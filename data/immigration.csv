It’s law enforcement at its most fearful.
He was willing to promote immigration enforcement in the manner that this administration wants, which is unlike anything I have ever seen before.","Every day, news of federal immigration raids, and the protests they attract, pop up across the country. Enforcement blitzes have drawn attention to Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities. In-your-face videos of aggressive tactics repeat — tear gas fired off in city streets, projectiles shot at journalists, children detained.

Sarah Saldaña, a former U.S. attorney in Texas, led Immigration and Customs Enforcement between 2014 and 2017 during President Barack Obama’s second term. Her tenure coincided with an influx of Central American families and unaccompanied children showing up at the Southern border, a period in which Obama received the moniker “deporter-in-chief” from immigration rights advocates. She was the last ICE director confirmed by Congress, and the agency has been led by acting heads ever since.

In a conversation with The Marshall Project that has been edited for clarity and length, Saldaña discussed how the agency has operated in past administrations and how it has changed since Trump returned to office earlier this year.

The Marshall Project: When you see ICE on the news today, what goes through your mind as a former leader? What tactics stick out to you?

Sarah Saldaña: We did not do our business out in public. We did not record our operations. Things are different. We weren’t out to make the news.

We were out to enforce the priorities of the administration, which at that time was [focusing on apprehending] terrorists down to aggravated felons, people who had a criminal conviction.

The priorities were not to go to a Home Depot and pick up people standing there waiting for day labor. That’s not something that happened. You planned ahead, and then you carried out the plan. And if you found the person you were looking for, that's the person you took. It wasn’t a matter of course that you would ask for identification of everybody in the household, let's say, and haul off people who were not a priority. That’s a very different operation than what’s happening now.

What do you think about the video footage that has been created and shared by Department of Homeland Security agencies like ICE?

I think the videoing is for clips for the evening news. That’s my opinion. All I know is that I’ve never seen ICE on the evening news so much as I have in the last three or four months. We were just as happy to work behind the scenes rather than having the people photographed or videoed. I think [Secretary] Kristi Noem is in half of them. And she’s not even with ICE. She’s with Homeland Security. She’s their boss, but I am not sure why she needs to go out on these operations other than one reason and one reason alone, and that’s advertising.

The secretary of Homeland Security has more important things to do than go out on operations. I can see doing it once or twice. I did it myself, just to know how an operation is conducted, but she’s in an awful lot of these videos. It strikes me as advertising. It strikes me as wanting to get the 15-second video and provide it to the evening news.

What’s your response to footage of the helicopters, flash-bangs and different means of luring people out of their homes during immigration enforcement operations?

I would describe it as “shock and awe.” It is intended. It is a different approach, certainly from what I experienced and from what I was familiar with. Its primary purpose does not appear to be making the community safer. It is intended to instill fear in those who might be subjected to our laws in the immigration area, as opposed to fostering public safety.

Is it effective?

If that’s the way you want to run your country, there are a lot of things that are effective. It’s effective to, like they are doing now, take drug dealers before trial, line them up against a wall, or shoot them in a boat and kill them. That’s very effective. That person won’t be dealing drugs anymore. But is it the way you want to run your country, is the question? Apparently the majority of the voting American public thought that was a good thing — that the ends justify the means. So it’s hard to say, “This is not our country,” because people had a choice when they voted and they voted for this approach.

Can ICE do these things?

Well, there are lawsuits all over the country that will test that issue. My personal belief is that a number of them, they cannot. And they will not withstand a legal challenge.

For instance?

The recent Supreme Court decision , I would say, to profile people. But clearly now that's legal after the Supreme Court case: If you speak Spanish and you look like you could be from another country, you could be interrogated. We will see where things come out. I am done predicting what the law of the land is because the Supreme Court is fashioning laws in a way that I would have never expected, like that profiling case.

My skin is brown. I speak Spanish fluently. I have been on occasion in old tattered clothes. I don’t think that that should be permitted to stop me — who was born in this country and has lived here for 73 years. I don’t think so, but apparently the law has changed, and profiling is allowable under those circumstances. We’ll see if specific cases are challenged, whether the facts of those cases justify if law enforcement can articulate a reason for stopping that person. It’s a slippery slope as far as I am concerned.

How would you have reacted to an agent stopping people for looking and sounding brown, or like they could potentially be undocumented?

It wouldn't have been tolerated.

Every administration has a right to set its own priorities. In this administration, it is, “Pick up anybody who is in the country without authorization.” Period. End of story. Even though they say, “Well, we are only after the worst of the worst,” I am sorry, that’s baloney.

What we are seeing today under this administration is extraordinary. It has never been done in this way before. There were already 11 or 12 million people without authorization in the United States before [President Joe] Biden took office. So I don’t know how you can blame President Biden for that. Now, did he let a lot more in? Of course he did. I have little patience for people who try to throw all that in one bag and say, “Look at where this country is now because of Biden.” It’s all the administrations beforehand. And it was the American public who said this is what I want to do. The voting public has a responsibility too.

You recently wrote a letter in The Dallas Morning News, titled “Stop the hate for ICE and for immigrants,” arguing for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws that would include a more secure border, reform of asylum restrictions and a “rational plan for allowing people from other countries to work here in jobs our citizens cannot or will not do.”

There is not a thoughtful, informed, methodical approach to immigration. It is slapdash, and as long as we don’t reform the immigration statute, not just through Band-Aids, but wholesale, we are going to continue this way. Every administration kind of comes in and does their thing. It doesn’t mean the future administrations considering comprehensive immigration reform won’t have their own priorities, I am just saying things like asylum can be tightened and accomplished without going after people who are here legally and seeking asylum.

What’s your reaction to Illinois state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat, who said ICE has acted like ""an invading army,"" with helicopters ""terrifying families"" from above, and in violation of people's ""right to live free from persecution and fear”?

I’d be open to somebody telling me how many times this has been repeated. I’d be open to those facts, but I have a problem with both sides using extreme rhetoric.

This idea that every immigrant who is in the country without authorization should not be dealt with, that’s not the law. The law prescribes that they have broken it by coming to the country without authorization. And remaining in the country without authorization is also illegal. I don’t know why we have to have an extreme on either side — either take everybody down or keep those borders open. There is so much wrong with both of those positions. It’s sad, but that’s where the extreme comes from.

Now this particular legislator, I am equally disturbed by activity like that [which Jiménez described]. I am not willing to say this is happening everywhere and it’s a national crisis. I don’t see it that way.

What do you think when you see federal agents with their faces covered, and the aggressive operations. Does that feel like the same agency to you?

No, no, no. It’s intended for TV. It’s intended for effect. It’s intended to instill fear. The ultimate objective is not legitimate law enforcement, it is to scare people to death. It is effective. There are a lot of people staying in their homes that would ordinarily come out, that are immigrants in the country without authorization. So, it’s effective. But it is disturbing to me to see that. It’s not law enforcement at its best. It’s law enforcement at its most fearful.

Face coverings?

There actually may be a basis for it. I think [immigration officers] are being targeted. Once they are targeted, of course, it’s not just the agent, it’s their families, their homes, getting doxxed. Now the left has provided a basis for those coverings. They weren’t legitimate at first, but now, you know, if I am on an airplane meeting somebody, I am not bragging that I am an ICE agent to anybody because they become targets. That Enforcement and Removal officer is not making policy.

What was Tom Homan, Trump’s appointed immigration czar, like to work with when you ran ICE?

I know him to be a great guy, based on my experience with him up through 2017. Very confident. Knows this area left and right. He is a convert, though, and a believer in this administration. He has always been fiercely loyal to whoever the head is. He was very easy to work with. I worried that he was going to die from a heart attack because he worked so hard. He’s a good human being. I just think he’s a believer in everything that this administration is doing.

He was willing to promote immigration enforcement in the manner that this administration wants, which is unlike anything I have ever seen before. I can’t judge him. I wish he would consider otherwise, but who is to say if you’ve got your own person in there. Expected to follow what the head honcho has to say. So, Tom is doing that.

Reportedly, ICE has increased spending for small arms from about $10 million to $70 million. Was it hard to get money when you were running ICE?

Not really, but our priorities were different. If you are picking up everybody, you are going to need a lot more money for that. Our priorities were, OK, we have $6 billion, we have 34,000 beds approved by Congress. Who should we be focusing on to fill those beds? Do we take a gardener who is working at a landscape company who has a pristine record in this country and has a family and has been here for decades? Or do we focus on the drug dealers, sexual assaults, domestic abuse perpetrators? It’s just prosecutorial discretion. Happens everyday in law enforcement. If we needed more money, we asked for it. Nothing like the numbers being discussed now.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/8ue3GBa_FYhMjMqKV4gwUBN8Vr8OWQp24dBjm5ukLTw/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9udHJ3a2VsZ2Ju/N2dvbm55eWphc2R4/N211dmZpLzI1MTAy/OV9DU29tb2Rldmls/bGFfU2FyYWhTYWxk/YW5hX0dldHR5SW1h/Z2VzLmpwZw,N,,2025-10-29 06:56:44.312385

Colorado state law prohibits state and local agencies from assisting in most federal immigration enforcement.","Chaos erupted outside of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Tuesday in southwestern Colorado after agents took a family into custody and Durango police tried to get the children released. The arrest and subsequent protest have sparked outrage from some in the small city and statements denouncing ICE's actions from local immigrant advocacy groups.

In a now-widely circulated video, a masked agent took a 57-year-old woman's phone as she recorded the events and as she tried to retrieve it, he threw her to the ground. The agent is only identified with a patch on his vest that reads ""police"" with a badge next to it.

She and other protesters characterized it as theft and assault. This all unfolded around 6 a.m.

""I was videotaping this ICE agent, and I said to him -- because they swear that they're good Christians, right? -- and I said to him, 'you're a good Christian, right?' Looking him in the eyes, and I said, 'what would Jesus do?' and that's when he flipped out and- I don't know if he grabbed my phone or flicked it out of my hands, that's sort of a blur to me,"" Franci Stagi told CBS News Colorado in a Zoom interview on Tuesday. ""Then I had my knee-jerk reaction of sort of going after my phone, which I shouldn't have done, but I don't know, I just- so I did touch him on the shoulder after he grabbed my phone.""

That's when Stagi said the agent reacted violently.

""He grabbed me by the hair, and he lifted me off the ground somehow, in a chokehold. It's still really blurry, but I've seen the video myself,"" she said, choking up in tears as she recalled. ""Then he and two other ICE agents were over top of me which- they're huge people and it's just pretty surprising that this would happen.""

Stagi described herself as a 5-foot-2-inch waitress and worries about how children in custody are being treated -- the initial reason for the protest outside the facility.

""If they're doing this to me- there's an 11-year-old girl. A little girl and her brother in detention right now. What are they doing to her? It's horrible,"" she said. She went on to say the initial agent who grabbed her was pulled away from her by another masked agent, whose vest said ""ICE.""

The crowd of about 50 protesters gathered after they and immigrant advocacy groups said ICE arrested a Colombian family seeking asylum while the father took the children to school the previous day.

""Despite our members remaining entirely peaceful, an ICE agent violently punched one of our community members in the face,"" a statement from the Southwest Colorado Rapid Response Network read, in part. ""This excessive force against peaceful protestors is unacceptable and underscores the brutal tactics ICE is willing to employ.""

A spokesperson for ICE's Denver Field Office and the Department of Homeland Security -- ICE's parent agency -- in Denver, said the agency was looking into the incident and questions about the family's arrest and likely wouldn't have a response or statement until Wednesday.

A joint statement from city leaders said Durango police officers tried to intervene in the detention of the children.

""On multiple occasions, Durango Police requested to facilitate the release of the children to their mother, but were unsuccessful. On Tuesday, the Police Department received a report that one of the children may have been in distress and potentially experiencing abuse. In response, officers attempted to conduct a welfare check and to bring food. Unfortunately, federal agents denied officers entry to the facility,"" the statement read, in part.

""In moments like these, our duty is not only to uphold the law, but to preserve our humanity,"" Durango Police Chief Brice Current said in a statement. ""While we have a sworn responsibility not to interfere with federal operations, our department advocated for the children's well-being. These situations are complex and often misunderstood. I want to be clear: the Durango Police Department operates independently and remains fully committed to protecting every member of our community with compassion and professionalism.""

The detained family has not been publicly identified, but Stagi said the girl is 11 and her brother is 14.

City officials have asked the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate the events from the protest. Because the event occurred on federal property, the city says the FBI is also investigating.

In addition to calling for the release of the children, the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition is calling for an investigation into ""the use of excessive force by ICE agents against peaceful protestors"" and an investigation by the Colorado Attorney General's Office into ""local cooperation with ICE."" The organization specifically called attention to the participation of Colorado Highway Patrol troopers.

""The presence of state troopers with ICE raises alarming questions about the level of local and state cooperation in this operation,"" said Gladis Ibarra, co-executive director of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. ""We need immediate clarity from state officials on their role in this family's separation and the violence that followed. The people of Colorado have a right to know if their state is violating its own laws to aid in tearing families apart.""

Colorado State Patrol said troopers did respond to the protest ""at the request of local law enforcement,"" saying protesters ""were reported to have blocked the facility's exit and bolted an access gate closed."" The agency said troopers did not assist in any immigration enforcement action or deploy any weapons or chemical munitions.

""The Patrol's role was to aid in de-escalation and protection of all parties present, maintain the peace, and address any identified unlawful behavior,"" CSP said in a statement.

Colorado state law prohibits state and local agencies from assisting in most federal immigration enforcement.

Stagi said she just wants the children released and reunited with their family.

""If my child was abducted and I knew where they were, I would hope that people would show up. I would hope people would show up and help me, even if they're total strangers,"" Stagi said. ""I see you. I hear your call. I feel what you're going through. I have empathy, compassion, I want to help you and I don't know how, but by being there physically with my presence, I was hoping to help. To be another person.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/29/34651f1d-0f58-4d66-acc9-4523b1b3c640/thumbnail/1200x630/7ff67d1fcdf6816e7ef3dfff8ced4672/durango-protest-3-frame-10.png,N,,2025-10-29 01:00:52.751462

“ICE has blocked all the mother’s attempts to see her children, and is reportedly preparing to forcibly separate these minor children from their father and send them alone to Texas.
In its statement, Durango officials said that ICE told local police that immigration agents tried to release the kids to another parent.
In a subsequent statement, an unnamed agency spokesperson wrote it arrived “at the request of local enforcement.” “The Patrol did not participate in any immigration enforcement action.
“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening,” he wrote.","Two children and their father on their way to school were detained by federal immigration agents in southwestern Colorado on Monday, sparking protests from demonstrators who tried to prevent the family from being separated and moved to different facilities.

Videos of the protest posted on social media Tuesday show law enforcement clashing with demonstrators outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Durango, where agents in tactical gear carried weapons capable of firing less-lethal projectiles. Video taken overnight shows one agent taking and throwing a woman’s phone and then throwing the woman to the ground. Other protesters appeared to have been hit by projectiles fired by federal officers.

In a statement, the city of Durango said it had asked the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate the woman who was shoved by the federal agent.

Fernando Jaramillo Solano and his two children, ages 12 and 15, were detained by ICE on Monday morning while driving near their home, said Enrique Orozco-Perez, the co-executive director of the Compañeros Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.

The family applied for asylum after coming to Colorado from Colombia and has an active, ongoing immigration case. The children’s mother, who is the primary applicant on the asylum case, has not been detained, the group said.

“ICE has blocked all the mother’s attempts to see her children, and is reportedly preparing to forcibly separate these minor children from their father and send them alone to Texas. This is not enforcement; it is a traumatic kidnapping of family members who are doing everything right and being punished for it,” Compañeros said in a statement.

Steve Kotecki, spokesman for ICE’s Denver field office, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The protests echoed similar opposition that’s been mounted against ICE facilities in Chicago and Portland, where protesters have gathered outside of the agency’s offices and detention centers.

Orozco-Perez said in an interview that Solano was “violently” arrested Monday morning while taking his kids to school. He shouted to volunteers who’d arrived to observe the arrest that his children were in the car, and the kids were also handcuffed and detained.

In its statement, Durango officials said that ICE told local police that immigration agents tried to release the kids to another parent. Orozco-Perez said the children’s mother was afraid to come to the scene for fear of being arrested. Local police “then offered to facilitate the release of the children back to their mother, but were informed that it was no longer an option,” according to the city’s statement.

Volunteer legal aides from the group also came to the ICE field office, where the family was held, to provide documents about the family’s pending asylum case. ICE officials refused to accept the documents, Orozco-Perez said.

The police also attempted a welfare check on the children, one of whom “may have been in distress and potentially experiencing abuse,” the city said. But Durango officers were denied entry into the facility.

“In moments like these, our duty is not only to uphold the law, but to preserve our humanity,” said Police Chief Brice Current. “While we have a sworn responsibility not to interfere with federal operations, our department advocated for the children’s well-being.”

Protesters began to gather outside the facility shortly after the arrests Monday. When an attorney later arrived to again try to provide documents to ICE, legal aides were told by ICE that the family would be detained together, Orozco-Perez said.

But the children’s mother later told advocates that she’d spoken with one of her kids and that they had been told they would be transported to Texas while their father was moved to Colorado’s immigration detention center in Aurora. Protesters then set up an all-night vigil to try to prevent any vehicles from leaving.

That’s when one volunteer from Compañeros was shoved by an ICE agent, Orozco-Perez said. Video posted to Facebook by the group shows a masked agent grab a phone from a volunteer who’d held her camera close to the man’s face. The agent then throws the phone as the woman yelled for him to return it. He then grabbed the woman and threw her to the ground, the video shows.

In its statement, the city said it had requested an independent investigation into the incident. Rob Lowe, spokesman for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, declined to comment on the request Tuesday.

The protests continued into Tuesday morning and afternoon. Law enforcement began handcuffing and pulling people sitting in front of the office’s gates. A group of Colorado State Patrol troopers were also present and appeared to be clearing the road so several SUVs could leave the building. Protesters threw objects and bottles of water at the SUVs, one of which grazed a protester standing in the roadway as it sped past them.

Susy, who volunteers with a local immigrant advocacy group and asked to be identified only by her first name to avoid retaliation, said ICE personnel were picking up and “bodily throwing” protesters who’d blocked the gates. She said they were then sprayed in the face with pepperspray.

“To have it in our little peaceful community is just — ” she sighed. “I don’t know what to say. To have our own government attacking people and spraying tear gas in our faces, it’s bad.”

Video also shows a masked agent in tactical gear unloading what appear to be pepper balls from close range on two people sitting in the roadway.

“What you saw was people defending our community with their bodies, trying to not allow ICE to leave,” Orozco-Perez said.

Sgt. Ivan Alvarado, spokesman for the state patrol, said the agency was at the protest to assist. In a subsequent statement, an unnamed agency spokesperson wrote it arrived “at the request of local enforcement.”

“The Patrol did not participate in any immigration enforcement action. Demonstrators were reported to have blocked the facility’s exit and bolted an access gate closed,” the spokesperson wrote. “The Patrol’s role was to aid in de-escalation and protection of all parties present, maintain the peace, and address any identified unlawful behavior. Members of the Colorado State Patrol did not use any weapons or chemical munitions.”

Tom Sluis, spokesman for the city, said the city had notified the patrol about ICE’s apparent plans to transport the family and that the patrol then said it would be present at the Durango facility.

In a statement, Gov. Jared Polis said he was “deeply concerned” about the family’s detention.

“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening,” he wrote. “The federal government should prioritize apprehending and prosecuting dangerous criminals, no matter where they come from, and keep our communities safe instead of snatching up children and breaking up families.”

In a statement, Durango School District spokesperson Karla Sluis said the district could not confirm whether any students were involved in “immigration enforcement action” because of federal privacy laws.

It was that order, halting the mission while litigation proceeded, that the appeals court panel would go on to assess.
But in its Oct. 20 order, the appeals court panel majority disagreed, finding that Immergut should have deferred more to Trump’s analysis of events and his military judgement.
The dissenting judge on the panel had asked her colleagues on the broader appeals court to consider rehearing the case en banc—as a larger group.
Soon, another judge on the appeals court initiated proceedings for a vote.","In yet another twist in a weighty legal dispute, an appeals court has cancelled a ruling that had largely cleared the way for the Trump administration to deploy U.S. troops in Portland, opting to rehear the matter with a larger group of judges instead.

“Upon the vote of a majority of nonrecused active judges, it is ordered that this case be reheard en banc,” wrote Chief Judge Mary H. Murguia of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an order Tuesday evening. The previous order, which a three judge panel of the court had published Oct. 20 “is vacated,” she wrote.

“This ruling shows the truth matters and that the courts are working to hold this administration accountable,” said Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield in a statement shortly after the latest order came down. “The Constitution limits the president’s power, and Oregon’s communities cannot be treated as a training ground for unchecked federal authority.”

What comes next at the appeals court level was not immediately clear. The order gave no other information, and did not set a schedule for its proceedings.

But the development means a Portland district court judge’s temporary restraining orders, which have now for weeks been blocking the deployment, are set to remain in place until their natural expiration dates, which remain a few days out.

Meanwhile, Oregon continues to seek a more durable block on the deployment: an injunction. The lower court is set to consider this matter in a three-day bench trial beginning Wednesday.

It has now been a month since President Donald Trump acted, following a provocative post on his social media platform, Truth Social, to deploy federalized Oregon National Guard members to Portland to quash protests surrounding the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on the south end of town—a move state and local leaders said was plainly unnecessary, but which the president said would restore order to a leftist hellscape allegedly besieged by domestic terrorists.

Arguing that this nightmarish characterization was an absurd fiction, Oregon officials filed suit, and won a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment to Portland. It was that order, halting the mission while litigation proceeded, that the appeals court panel would go on to assess.

The lower court judge, Karin J. Immergut, had found that the conditions on the ground in Portland did not appear meet any of the legally relevant circumstances under which the President was authorized to federalize the National Guard for domestic deployment.

But in its Oct. 20 order, the appeals court panel majority disagreed, finding that Immergut should have deferred more to Trump’s analysis of events and his military judgement.

The appeals court decision, rejecting the reasoning of the lower court’s first restraining order, seemed to all but clear the way for the deployment to proceed.

Yet there was another wrinkle. The dissenting judge on the panel had asked her colleagues on the broader appeals court to consider rehearing the case en banc—as a larger group. Soon, another judge on the appeals court initiated proceedings for a vote.

On Friday, the appeals court, noting that it had the consent of the members of the smaller panel, paused the Oct. 20 ruling of their colleagues while they considered whether to go the en banc route and hear the case as a larger cohort. The results of that vote arrived Tuesday evening.

On Wednesday morning, meanwhile, the case is set to proceed on a parallel track in Immergut’s courtroom at the federal courthouse in Portland.

Lawyers for Oregon and the Trump administration have in recent days been filing briefs citing various authorities—old court cases, media reports, an 1891 dictionary definition for the word “rebellion”—as they establish their basic cases for why the judge should, or should not, establish a more durable block on the deployment.

At issue is whether the situation at the ICE facility justified the calling in of the National Guard—and specifically, whether the president, as the applicable federal law puts it, “is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” or “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

In its brief, the U.S. government argues that “both conditions apply in Portland.”

In the weeks and months before the president made this assessment, Trump administration lawyers write, “agitators assaulted federal officers and damaged federal property in numerous ways.”

In its brief, however the state of Oregon and its allies say the challenges federal and local law enforcement have faced outside that facility have been plainly ordinary.

If the protests indeed grew violent in June, they remained well the capacity of law enforcement to manage, the state says, and from there they grew far tamer, into September, when police reports indicate little of note was happening outside the ICE facility at all.

Then, Oregon says, came Trump’s Sept. 27 post saying he would send troops to “War ravaged” Portland. Crowd sizes and tensions again increased, Oregon officials argue, though the most problematic interactions involved altercations between protesters and counter protestors—rather than being directed at federal officers.

One thing that both parties seem to agree on is that relations between the Portland Police Bureau and federal agents have been poor of late—though their analyses differ greatly.

The feds note that local law forbids PPB from assisting with immigration enforcement, but that the local police department has an “extraordinarily capacious understanding of the scope of this prohibition” and has at times refused to help to protect the ICE facility, or work constructively with their federal counterparts to, say, clear the ICE driveway of protesters.

Portland Police Bureau officers are set to testify otherwise at trial. And the state’s brief, for its part, argues that relations soured as federal law enforcement needlessly deployed munitions, gassing PPB officers themselves and creating made-for-TV spectacles out of minor protest events. Meanwhile the state says, the federal officer deployment surged without a clear command and control structure, undermining communication between federal and local officials.

As an example of the problems that emerged, the brief notes a moment when pepper balls were shot in the direction of a PPB officer. When confronted, the brief says said, federal officials responded, “help or get out of the way.”",https://www.wweek.com/resizer/v2/NTDHZXJD2JDYVPMNUFEIV6PS3I.jpg?smart=true&auth=33dd5c63b73248b8e8e25b9e5951e08324efcb94fd949d237773ef1d039c915d&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-29 01:56:58.141089

(Reuters) -President Donald Trump’s administration has told the U.S. Supreme Court he needs to deploy National Guard troops to the Chicago area in part because local police have failed to respond to what the Justice Department described as mob violence by people protesting his aggressive immigration enforcement.

Those law enforcement agencies have given the nine justices a starkly different account of protests they called limited in scale, detailing in court filings how they have responded on specific dates and explaining how a unified command they set up to coordinate efforts dealt effectively with the demonstrations.

This is just one of many contrasts in how events on the ground are being portrayed in the case, creating for the justices what may be a dilemma over who to believe as they mull the Justice Department’s October 17 emergency request to allow the deployment. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the move, rejecting the administration’s legal rationale and its version of events. The Supreme Court could act at any time.

The Justice Department relied heavily in its Supreme Court request on two written statements to justify its stated need for the National Guard to protect federal agents and property. The statements by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency official Russell Hott and Border Patrol official Daniel Parra portray the situation on the ground as dire and dangerous.

The Justice Department cited Hott’s declaration 37 times in its 40-page application to the Supreme Court, and Parra’s 15 times, a Reuters analysis showed.

Chicago-based U.S. District Judge April Perry found the sources of the administration’s facts to be unreliable, a determination an appeals court upheld.

“In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor” by Hott and Parra, Perry wrote in her decision, “it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts.”

In the U.S. legal system, trial judges and juries have the primary role in fact-finding, with higher courts generally deferring to those conclusions.

“Here, the district judge carefully detailed the factual record and found it ‘impossible to align’ with the statements in the affidavits submitted by the administration. The judge also raised serious credibility concerns with those statements,” said Brandon Garrett, a Duke University School of Law expert in legal evidence.

Garrett said it would be “all the more problematic for the Supreme Court to engage in fact-finding which is outside of its role as an appellate court.”

University of Chicago constitutional law professor Aziz Huq said it is not surprising for the court to be encountering a major gap between versions of events given its increasing willingness to settle weighty matters on its so-called emergency docket – as in this case – before the facts of a dispute have been fully determined.

“The Supreme Court has created a situation in which the ordinary process for settling factual disputes no longer exists in these cases,” Huq said.

The Justice Department declined to comment. An ICE spokesperson said that agency “is not going to comment on court documents and pending litigation.” The Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.

DOMESTIC DEPLOYMENTS

In their legal challenge to Trump’s deployment, the city of Chicago and state of Illinois have said he is using protests that have been limited in size and severity as a pretext to dispatch troops to punish adversaries and stifle dissent. They noted that Trump has talked about sending the military into Democratic-led cities like Chicago for years.

Trump since June has deployed troops to various Democratic-led jurisdictions in an extraordinary expansion of the use of the military for domestic purposes. Trump also has sent them to Los Angeles, Memphis and Washington, D.C., and has sought to dispatch them to Portland.

Challenges to those deployments are playing out in other cities. A judge who already has blocked the Portland deployment is set to preside over a trial beginning on Wednesday.

GLARING DIFFERENCES

A comparison of statements provided by both sides as evidence in the case reveals important differences in how the situation in Chicago and at a federal immigration processing facility called BSSA in the suburb of Broadview is being described, including the nature and size of protests and the response of local and state authorities.

Hott stated that “riots at the BSSA escalated from September 12 to the present,” alleging blocked traffic, vandalized property and assaults on personnel. Broadview Police Department Chief Thomas Mills, in his own written statement, never mentions a riot or rioters, and said protesters number typically fewer than 50.

On the use of tear gas and pepper spray near the BSSA, Parra said federal agents take such steps only after issuing warnings and only against “assaultive subjects.” But Mills called this use by federal agents indiscriminate and “unlike anything I have seen before,” sometimes targeting a protest with no more than 10 people.

The Hott and Parra statements use nearly identical language in detailing an October 4 incident in which a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a female driver in Chicago who allegedly aimed her car at the agent, the Reuters analysis found.

For instance, both statements include the following passage: “Approximately 200 rioters converged near the scene of the shooting at three separate locations. Over the next four hours, rioters threw objects at agents, including glass bottles and traffic cones, and forcefully pushed the agents. The Chicago Police Department initially refused to assist, but over one hour later, they provided perimeter security.”

The gender of the federal agent who shot the woman was changed from male in the Hott and Parra statements to female in the Justice Department’s later Supreme Court filing.

“A declaration or affidavit is far less credible if it uses repeated text or legal language,” Garrett said. “A hearing can shed more light on such documents. And that kind of fact-finding is the role of a district court. The Supreme Court is not in a position to carefully evaluate a factual record.”

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces answering to state governors except when called into federal service by the president. Trump has relied on a law that lets a president deploy state National Guard troops to suppress a rebellion or if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Trump’s administration federalized 300 Illinois National Guard troops and ordered more Texas National Guard troops into Illinois.

WINNING WAYS

In almost every challenge to Trump’s actions since he returned to office in January, the Supreme Court has ruled in his favor, often lifting orders imposed by district court judges.

“The Supreme Court does not appear to give a great deal of weight to district court findings of credibility. To my mind, that is a very problematic stance for the court to take,” Huq said.

“It suggests that the Supreme Court has the power not just to pick and choose what the law is, but it has the power to pick and choose what the facts are,” Huq added.

Perry, appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment as likely violating the federal law establishing preconditions for use of National Guard troops as well as the state’s rights under the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment.

Perry faulted the statements by Hott and Parra for “equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting or doing violence.”

A three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously left Perry’s order in place, concluding “the facts do not justify the president’s actions in Illinois.” Two of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including one by Trump.

Richard Friedman, a University of Michigan Law School expert on evidence and the Supreme Court, said if the justices apply normal standards, they would overturn the district judge’s factual findings only if they are “clearly erroneous” – a high bar, Friedman said.

That form of deference may yield to another in this case, given it involves the president and his power over military matters.

“The court will presumably give a great deal of deference to the executive,” Friedman said.

Kristine Beckerle “The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public.","A new, in-depth investigation by Amnesty International concludes that a US air strike on a migrant detention centre in Sa’ada, north-western Yemen, on 28 April 2025 that killed and injured dozens of African migrants amounted to an indiscriminate attack. US authorities must promptly and transparently investigate it as a war crime.

The attack, carried out by the US military during “Operation Rough Rider,” inflicted catastrophic civilian harm on vulnerable migrants, many of whom were held by the Huthi de facto authorities in the detention centre solely for their irregular immigration status.

‘It is a miracle we survived’: US air strike on civilians held in Sa’ada detention centre is based on interviews with 15 survivors, all of whom were Ethiopian migrants detained in Sa’ada, and analysis of digital evidence, including satellite imagery, photos and videos. The report provides compelling evidence that, in carrying out this attack, the US failed to abide by its obligation under international humanitarian law to distinguish between civilian objects and military objectives.

The strike killed and injured dozens of the migrants held at the detention centre at the time of the attack. Survivors who spoke to Amnesty International were able to identify by name and approximate age 16 of the people – all Ethiopian migrants, all men and most in their twenties – who had been killed.

This was a lethal failure by the US to comply with one of its core obligations under international humanitarian law.

Kristine Beckerle, Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“The harrowing testimonies from survivors paint a clear picture of a civilian building, packed with detainees, being bombed without distinction. This was a lethal failure by the US to comply with one of its core obligations under international humanitarian law: to do everything feasible to verify whether the object attacked was a military objective,” said Kristine Beckerle, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“Victims and their families should receive full reparation, including financial compensation. Given the air strike killed and injured civilians, the US authorities should investigate this attack as a war crime. Where sufficient evidence exists, competent authorities should prosecute any person suspected of criminal responsibility, including under the doctrine of command responsibility.”

Amnesty International formally requested information from US Central Command (CENTCOM) and US Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) on 27 August 2025, detailing its findings and seeking clarification on the military objective attacked and the precautions taken. CENTCOM provided only a brief response on the same day the request was sent, stating that it was still “assessing all reports of civilian harm”, that it was taking all of them “seriously” and reviewing them “thoroughly”.

Amnesty International also requested information from the Huthi de facto authorities on 11 September 2025, sharing its findings and seeking clarification regarding the uses of the Sa’ada prison compound and the migrant detention centre, the number of people detained at the time of the attack, their conditions of detention, and what steps, if any, the Huthi authorities took to investigate the failure of prison guards to allow detainees to seek safe shelter.

The Huthi Ministry of Justice and Human Rights provided two detailed responses on 24 September and 6 October 2025, including information on the number of migrants detained at the centre, denying any wrongdoing in terms of conditions of detention, and sharing a list of casualties from the US air strike.

A mass-casualty attack on a known civilian target

Amnesty International’s investigation found no evidence that the migrant detention centre was a military objective. Survivors said the migrant detention centre was an open space, so they were able to see everyone who was present in the building, whom were all migrant detainees.

The facility, part of the Sa’ada prison compound, had been used for years by the Huthis to detain migrants, and its civilian nature was widely known. It was visited by humanitarian organizations.

A few years earlier, on 21 January 2022, the Saudi-led coalition carried out an air strike on another detention facility within the same prison compound in Sa’ada. The 2022 attack, which Amnesty International also investigated, was carried out using a US-made precision guided munition, killing more than 90 detainees and injuring dozens.

Given this context, the US should have known the facility was a civilian object and that any aerial attack could result in significant death and injury to civilians. Under international humanitarian law, attacking forces have an obligation to do everything feasible to verify whether their intended target is a military objective and, if there is doubt in this respect, to refrain from launching an attack or to cancel or suspend it.

Survivors severely injured, maimed and traumatized

Almost all the 15 survivors Amnesty International spoke to said that they were sleeping when they heard the sound of an explosion nearby, sometime between 4 and 4:30 a.m. This was most likely a US air strike on a different structure within the Sa’ada prison compound which took place minutes earlier.

According to satellite imagery, another building, located about 180 meters from where the migrants were detained, was hit and destroyed the same day. In their response to Amnesty International, the Huthis stated that this building was a prison administration building.

Survivors said they woke up terrified and ran towards the gate of the detention centre. They screamed for help and pounded on the gate, asking the prison guards to let them out to seek safety. Instead, prison guards fired warning shots, to keep the detainees inside. Minutes later, a second US airstrike hit the migrant detention centre.

In their response to Amnesty International, the Huthi de facto authorities stated that 117 African migrants were detained at the time of the strike, of whom 61 were killed and 56 injured. They also claimed that “there were no recorded instances in which prison guards prevented detainees from fleeing the targeted area or from seeking a safe location”, but did not respond clearly to whether they had investigated this particular incident.

The air strike caused profound civilian harm with devastating, long-lasting consequences. Of the 15 survivors interviewed by Amnesty International, 14 sustained critical injuries with lifelong impacts including lost limbs, serious nerve damage, as well as head, spine and chest trauma. Two of the 15 migrants had their legs amputated, one had his hand amputated, and one lost an eye.

One 20-year-old survivor, Hagos*, who lost his leg and regained consciousness days after the attack in hospital, described his pain, stating: “You just wish you were dead there… I am begging for some money from friends to get the treatment and pills.”

Another survivor, Desta*, suffered from a head injury and lost one of his eyes. He was so traumatized that he could not speak for 20 days. He said: “The attack was really terrible, it killed lots of people, it made us disabled and left others in shock and terror.”

At the time of the interviews, almost two months after the US air strike, 10 survivors said that they still required some form of medical treatment, including follow up surgeries and medication. They also said that, despite their dire economic situation, they were paying for this treatment themselves or with the support of their financially struggling families back home.

Urgent call for accountability and reparations

In addition to its obligations under international humanitarian law, the USA has codified in its domestic law and policies key human rights protections and international humanitarian law obligations. The US Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response notes that mitigating civilian harm is not limited to compliance with international humanitarian law and encourages commanders to “take additional protective measures not required by the law of war as they deem appropriate”.

Critical systems put in place in recent years in the US to reduce and better respond to civilian harm caused by US military actions abroad are under threat by the Trump Administration. Amnesty International urges the US Congress to ensure that civilian harm mitigation and response mechanisms remain intact and robustly funded to effectively respond to this and other recent incidents.

The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public.

Kristine Beckerle

“The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public. Survivors of this attack deserve nothing less than full justice. They must receive full, effective, and prompt reparations, including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition, through an effective and accessible mechanism,” said Kristine Beckerle.

Amnesty International also urges the Huthi de facto authorities to conduct a transparent investigation into the failure to evacuate and provide shelter to the detained migrants. They should also end the arbitrary detention of migrants based solely on their immigration status and nationality and provide survivors of the US air strike with temporary residency status so they may recuperate, heal, and complete essential medical treatment without fear of re-detention.

The administration is downplaying the importance of a leadership reshuffle at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the infusion of Customs and Border Protection leaders into ICE field offices is already getting a sour reception at the agency.

The move, news of which broke Monday night, involved sending CBP leaders into as many as 12 of ICE’s “underperforming” field offices. Deputy ICE Director MADISON SHEAHAN said on Fox this morning, “What you are seeing here is us being able to work with Secretary [KRISTI NOEM] and President [DONALD TRUMP] to be able to deliver on his promise to remove the worst of the worst.”

But there’s already internal blowback. An administration official told our own Myah Ward that “it’s not going over well at ICE. Not at all going over well.” NatSec Daily granted the official anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the personnel changes.

Border Patrol is a significantly more aggressive agency than ICE, but it lacks some of ICE’s community knowledge that could be useful in the sensitive situations Trump’s crackdown could create, according to KATHLEEN BUSH-JOSEPH, an immigration lawyer and analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute think tank in Washington.

Border Patrol is “used to very quickly deport primarily single Mexican men, and they were the ones who were doing expedited removal, which means deportation in a matter of hours,” she told NatSec Daily. ICE, meanwhile, is used to dealing with the issues that arise when federal agents arrest people in workplaces and in their neighborhoods.

That makes it likely that the leadership reshuffle is teeing up additional internal divisions within the U.S. government’s immigration enforcement apparatus.

The shakeup at ICE — which is expected to affect field offices in cities including Los Angeles, San Diego, New Orleans and Philadelphia — comes as progress has stalled towards the Trump administration’s promise to deport a million unauthorized immigrants in a year. ICE has had to navigate a limited number of beds to hold and process immigrants in its custody and intense pressure from the White House over the last few months. It has pushed to quickly hire 10,000 new agents, but that recruitment is expected to still take some time as officers are screened and trained.

The Trump administration has commissioned CBP agents and Border Patrol officers, as well as agents and officials from across the U.S. government, to support ICE as it tries to ramp up deportations. Arrivals at the southern border have ticked up in recent months, but those numbers are still below the levels they were at when the Trump administration took office.

The U.S. government also hasn’t released comprehensive data about removals in months, leading some analysts to question whether the deportation figures the administration touts are accurate.

For its part, DHS is arguing that there’s no daylight between any parts of the administration on how to achieve deportation and immigration goals.

Spokesperson TRICIA McLAUGHLIN told NatSec Daily that “since the beginning, President Trump promised to arrest the worst of the worst criminals and those in our country illegally. Our leadership understands that mission and is committed to defending the homeland.” McLaughlin also pushed back on the idea that these would be anything more than “standard personnel changes.”

The Inbox

RAFT OF RARE EARTHS: Trump and Japanese Prime Minister SANAE TAKAICHI signed an agreement today to each “intensify” their efforts to increase the “resilience and security of critical minerals and rare earths supply chains.” In other words, make sure there are plenty of options beyond China for obtaining minerals needed for advanced technology, including on the battlefield.

The framework, released by the White House, says reps from both countries will convene a bilateral ministerial on mining within 180 days. The two sides also agreed to take steps to “provide financial support” to projects that will generate products for delivery in the U.S., Japan and “like-minded countries.”

Critical minerals have been a clear focus of Trump’s trip through Asia, and he has reached agreements with Cambodia and Malaysia and frameworks with Thailand and Vietnam to cooperate on the processing and exports of critical minerals. He inked another with Australia last week to boost efforts to produce the coveted raw materials.

NADIA SCHADLOW, a former deputy national security adviser for strategy, told NatSec Daily these deals should be seen in the context of Trump’s meeting planned for Thursday with Chinese President XI JINPING.

“It gives Trump leverage ahead of his meeting with Xi,” she said. “It shows there’s ongoing concern over giving the Chinese continuing leverage over critical inputs. This is an alternative, this is a counterweight. These deals show how powerful working with partners can be.”

CEASEFIRE ON THE ROCKS: The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be in trouble.

Israel launched strikes on an area of Gaza close to Shifa hospital after Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU declared that he’d ordered strikes on the strip earlier today.

In a post to social media ahead of the attacks Netanyahu announced that he had ordered the military to “immediately carry out forceful strikes in the Gaza Strip” after “security consultations,” our own Gregory Svirnovskiy reports.

Although Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of ceasefire violations since the peace agreement was struck earlier this month, Israel’s move today marks a major escalation of conflict under the fragile truce.

Netanyahu did not provide a rationale for the decision, though Israel earlier today claimed that Hamas had opened fire at Israeli military forces in southern Gaza, adding to frustrations over Hamas’ return of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage that had already been retrieved.

Hamas has accused Israel of obstructing the entry of heavy machinery needed to clear rubble and find bodies, both of Israeli hostages and Palestinians killed in airstrikes. Today, the group said Israel is violating the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to hold Israel to the terms of the ceasefire. It also said it would delay the handover of a body of an Israeli hostage “due to violations by the occupation.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the strike decision.

HIT ’EM WHERE IT HURTS: Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY wants to expand Ukraine’s strikes against oil facilities deep within Russia and is stressing that he needs more weapons to do it, our own Veronika Melkozerova reports.

In comments to a small group of journalists Monday, including Veronika, Zelenskyy pointed to the success of prior strikes on Russian oil facilities that forced the country to redistribute production to other refineries.

“Therefore, our task is absolutely clear,” Zelenskyy said, “to continue our work at other plants that have started to increase the volume, especially diesel.” According to the BBC, Kyiv has hit 21 of Russia’s 38 major oil refineries since January.

The Ukrainian president said that a key priority for Kyiv is building upon its long-range capabilities. While Ukraine completed 90 percent of deep strikes into Russia with its own long-range drones and cruise missiles, according to Zelenskyy, he said he still wants European allies to continue giving long-range missiles to help with the effort. In addition to its own weapons, Kyiv also uses U.K.-made Storm Shadow and French SCALP missiles.

Zelenskyy hopes that a combination of continued strikes on Russian refineries and pressure from U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies — as well as a potential European loan to Kyiv funded by Russian frozen assets — could force Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN to the negotiating table.

CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE: The Federal Communications Commission is taking more steps to prevent imports of high-risk communications technology, in particular targeting gear from China, our own John Hendel reports (for Pros!)

In a unanimous vote today, the FCC moved to close loopholes on imports of gear on the so-called covered list of tech considered to present national security risks to the U.S. Among the security concerns: fears that adversaries like China could use the equipment for espionage.

Today’s move addressed worries that some of the equipment on the list was still being used, since FCC rules didn’t bar use of previously authorized versions of the gear. Under the proposal, earlier models of equipment sold by Chinese companies like Huawei and Hikvision would join the list of barred import items.

The vote immediately garnered backlash from China’s Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. and Hikvision, who argued that the move “exceeds the scope” of the FCC’s authority.

The Complex

HOW MANY IS IT NOW? Another day, another set of boat strikes.

The U.S. military conducted three more strikes on four boats suspected of ferrying drugs in the Eastern Pacific on Monday, Secretary of Defense PETE HEGSETH announced in a post on social media today.

The strikes killed 14 people and left one survivor. According to Hegseth, Mexican search and rescue authorities took responsibility for coordinating the survivor’s rescue, roping another country into the U.S.’s widening military operation in the region. But the Mexican navy has yet to locate the individual, The Wall Street Journal reports.

During a news conference Tuesday, Mexican President CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM said she had requested a discussion on the strikes between the Mexican navy, foreign ministers and the U.S. ambassador in Mexico City as part of a new security initiative between the two countries, the Journal reports.

As in previous attacks, Hegseth claimed that the individuals aboard the ships were “narco-terrorists,” but did not provide evidence for those allegations.

On the Hill

KUWAIT AMB. NOMINEE TANKING: It’s been a bad few days for Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Kuwait.

AMER GHALIB, the mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, is facing bipartisan opposition over his history of allegedly antisemitic remarks. At least three Senate Foreign Relations Republicans plan to vote “no” on Ghalib, our own Benjamin Guggenheim reports today, all but assuring that his nomination won’t succeed inside the panel — or on the chamber floor.

If three Republicans join all Democrats to vote “no,” then Vice President JD VANCE would have to cast a tie-breaking vote. Sen. JOHN CURTIS (R-Utah), Sen. TED CRUZ (R-Texas) and Sen. JOHN CORNYN (R-Texas) all said they’d vote against Ghalib. A potential fourth lawmaker, Sen. PETE RICKETTS (R-Neb.) indicated that he’s not committed to supporting Ghalib’s nomination either.

Ghalib was grilled during a hearing last week over comments he’d previously made suggesting that Israel deserved to be attacked by Hamas and for lauding the Muslim Brotherhood and SADDAM HUSSEIN. The Michigan mayor made waves last year for his endorsement of Trump, as a Muslim mayor alongside an all-Muslim city council in the small Midwestern city.

Broadsides

WE’RE WATCHING YOU: Major importers of Russian oil are railing against the Trump administration’s new sanctions, but Sen. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) is warning that the U.S. won’t put up with plans to undermine its sanctions efforts.

“To Hungary, Turkey and Slovakia: if you think we’re not watching your efforts to undercut U.S. sanctions on Russian oil, you are mistaken,” the Russia hawk cautioned in a social media post today, adding that purchasing Russian oil “is funding terrorism, death and destruction.”

Hungarian Prime Minister VIKTOR ORBAN said last week that the country was working on ways to “circumvent” U.S. sanctions on Russian oil. Hungary, along with Turkey and Slovakia, remain largely reliant on Russian oil, while other European countries have made efforts to shift away from those imports since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

This is the first known deportation under the Government’s recently expanded Nauru regime – a secretive and multi-billion-dollar arrangement that allows people to be banished offshore.

Earlier today it was reported that Nauru’s President, David Adeang, told the Nauruan Parliament last Friday that the first person had arrived under the new offshore detention deal. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, which supports people seeking asylum held on Nauru, had heard reports of an arrival but has been unable to confirm or make contact with the individual. The organisation holds serious concerns for the person’s wellbeing, safety and current whereabouts.

The Albanese Government made a secret deal with Nauru for the transfer of migrants and refugees in the so-called NZYQ cohort. The deal was signed alongside new laws allowing deportations to occur without any consideration of the consequences people would face, such as whether a person might die without proper medical care, be permanently separated from their families, or face persecution in Nauru.

It was revealed in estimates it could cost up to $7 billion, and there are serious concerns about corruption risks tied to past offshore detention contracts, including payments to companies linked to criminal organisations.

The organisations are calling on the Albanese Government to immediately halt deportations to Nauru, end offshore detention once and for all, and uphold equal treatment under our laws. Australians voted against fear and division at the last election, and they will not accept the return of cruel, secretive policies that punish people for seeking safety.

Jana Favero, Deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said:

“This kind of ICE-like behaviour ripping people from our community is not in line with what our community expects from our government. This is a scary, shocking precedent, and it is not what people voted for in the recent Federal election.

Deportations are life-changing – we all know people who weren’t born here, who we consider as part of our community. It’s another blatant example of politicians trying to distract us from the real issues and demonising migrants – and they are spending billions of dollars in secrecy to do it.”

Laura John, Associate Legal Director at the Human Rights Law Centre said:

“The Albanese Government has today demonstrated it is willing to completely disregard the basic rights of migrants and refugees, and ignore serious questions about the lawfulness and safety of its deportation deal, by condemning the first person to exile in Nauru. The government’s mass deportation plans have been shrouded in secrecy from the outset to ensure that it does not have to grapple with the real, human consequences of its actions.

“Some people facing deportation to Nauru have lived in Australia for most of their lives, others are stateless with no other home, and some have serious health conditions meaning they will likely die in Nauru. They should not be subjected to lifelong suffering. Our rights should be the same, regardless of visa status.”

Sarah Dale, RACS Centre Director & Principal Solicitor said:

“There have been many dark days in our immigration history: 24 August 2001, 19 July 2013 and now we add 24 October 2025 to that list. It is a day when our country chose exile over basic principles of humanity. This should shake to the core anyone who cares about the rights of refugees in our community.

We do not seek to deny the complexity of the situation for many of the people in this cohort. However, exile, family separation, significant ill-health and possible return to a fate of torture or death – none of these should be an acceptable outcome for any human being. It’s yet another dire chapter added to the horror story of Australia’s deplorable Offshore Detention policy.”

Paul Power, CEO of the Refugee Council of Australia said:

By Arnie Alpert, Active with the Activists

Arnie Alpert spent decades as a community organizer/educator in NH movements for social justice and peace. Officially retired from the American Friends Service Committee since 2020, he keeps his hands (and feet) in the activist world while writing about past and present social movements.

CONCORD—Immigrants’ rights activists from several New Hampshire cities and towns on Tuesday announced the formation of Sanctuary Communities, a grassroots project to oppose “police state tactics” employed by federal immigration enforcement agencies.

At a news conference held at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church across the street from the State House in Concord, the group said that while it is now illegal for municipalities to refuse cooperation with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), the law cannot prevent Americans from exercising their Constitutional rights to protest, publicize, and lawfully resist the agency’s actions.

“We’re here as people of faith, people of conscience, people of conviction and compassion, who are doing what people have done for millennia: organize to protect community members who are facing persecution, organize to insist on a better world, to insist that our values of love and care and dignity are reflected in how we treat each other, creating circles of support and accompaniment and resources, attempting to match the courage and the leadership of immigrants in this community who are targeted by so much racism and xenophobia and dehumanization,” said Maggie Fogarty, a member of the Seacoast Interfaith Sanctuary Coalition, one of eight New Hampshire groups calling themselves “Sanctuary Communities.”

“We are people from many walks of life and probably a variety of political persuasions,” said Philip Kaifer, representing the Manchester and Merrimack Region Sanctuary Community. “But our common concern is the fear we have because federal police are interfering with life as we know it,” he continued. “Our Granite State motto is ’Live Free or Die,’ but we no longer feel so free when we see secret agents—often masked and with no ID —whisking people off our streets and even disappearing them.”

“We are witnessing news headlines that read like something out of Nazi Germany,” said Bob Baker, a former Air Force Intelligence officer who lives in Columbia, near the Canadian border. “We cannot sit by while lawlessness and indecency are being visited upon us by masked agents sent into our communities from Washington.”

“Let’s talk about due process,” Baker, a retired lawyer, said later in the news conference. “Every single human being in this country, all they have to be is on the soil, is entitled to due process. That means, in simplest terms, the right to know what the charges are against you when you’re arrested. That’s not happening.” When people don’t even know what they’re being charged with, they can’t defend themselves, he said. “Just think about that. That’s wrong,” Baker said.

The Sanctuary Communities groups drew critical responses from Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte before their news conference had ended, and in press releases from other Republicans later on Tuesday.

In a statement headlined, “New Hampshire is NOT a Sanctuary for Criminals,” Ayotte said, “Threats to law enforcement or efforts to obstruct them will not be tolerated in New Hampshire. We are not a sanctuary for criminals who have come into this country illegally, and the law I signed earlier this year reinforces that. If you disrupt law enforcement activity, you will be prosecuted.”

The Sanctuary Communities project was born several months ago in New Hampshire’s North Country, where J. Larry Brown and Judi Garfinkel, residents of Lancaster, circulated a concept paper stating, “Any community—groups of concerned people from nearby towns, churches and institutions—can informally come together and declare themselves a Sanctuary Community, ready to provide assistance to people whose lives and well-being are threatened by federal security forces. Individual Sanctuary Communities can simply announce themselves publicly and organize to take steps they choose.” The idea was to spark a grassroots upsurge of groups openly objecting to ICE abuses and providing support for those harmed by them.

“History is clear,” they wrote, “that the only way to thwart growing authoritarian rule is for common people to speak out and resist. The courts alone cannot do it. The media alone cannot do it. Masses of American citizens rising up to oppose heavy-handed tactics is the way to salvage our democracy and to highlight the rule of law.”

From there, Brown and Garfinkel created a website to promote the concept and encourage activist groups to sign up. At this point, New Hampshire has eight self-designated Sanctuary Communities: North Country, Mt. Washington Valley and Lakes Region, Concord and Capitol Region, Manchester and Merrimack Region, Monadnock, Plymouth Area, Seacoast, and Sunapee/Upper Valley.

The Sanctuary Communities concept received a boost in August when former Labor Secretary Robert Reich promoted it on his Substack newsletter, calling it “an important way to fight Trump fascism.”

Brown said they have received hundreds of inquiries from other states, but at this point, only groups in New Hampshire are listed on their website. “The nice thing about this is that we’re not asking people to join our parade. We’re simply saying, create Sanctuary Communities, but do them in your own way,” Brown said. According to the website, “The Sanctuary Community movement is not an organization and has no leader. It is an idea around which people can organize themselves, creating groups from towns and communities in an area that the participants define.”

The Monadnock Immigrant Solidarity Collaborative defines itself as “a network of people in the southwest corner of New Hampshire, some of us immigrants, some of us allies, who support our immigrant neighbors. We believe immigrants enrich and strengthen our communities through their hard work, wisdom and culture. Our communities are welcoming places and we intend to keep them that way.”?

Any group can declare itself a sanctuary community, the website says, by “organizing a group of 6-10 people from different cities and towns in your area.” Next, a new group should write a statement of purpose, give themselves a name, decide what actions they will take, publicize their existence, and hold meetings to plan and evaluate its actions. “Each Sanctuary Community across the nation can operate on its own but in conjunction with sister Communities as national momentum and news coverage builds.”

New Hampshire Sanctuary Communities represented at the press conference say they will engage in activities such as monitoring and videotaping ICE raids; providing witness information to state and national media and local law enforcement; informing houses of worship, veterans groups, health facilities and schools about heavy-handed ICE actions; and writing letters and placing ads to oppose police-state tactics that threaten legal immigrants, neighbors and fellow citizens.

Megan Chapman, a human rights lawyer from Albany, New Hampshire, who is part of the Mount Washington Valley and Lakes Region group, called for a pushback against “efforts to lay the infrastructure for the authoritarian state and terror regime on our own soil.”

“At the beginning of 2025, there was just one ICE detention center in New Hampshire, at the Strafford County Jail,” she said. “In March, the federal prison in Berlin became the second. Now ICE is trying to negotiate with three more counties in our state to use their jails to incarcerate our neighbors. We must push back in Rockingham, Merrimack and Hillsborough County, and any/everywhere else.”

Chapman cited the example of Wells, Maine, where the town has just revoked a 287-G cooperation agreement with ICE, as an example for New Hampshire jurisdictions to follow.

The group cautions against engaging in any illegal activity, such as physically interfering with ICE operations, but says videotaping ICE agents is lawful. “It is anticipated that as the number of Sanctuary Communities grows across the nation, the Administration will threaten and intimidate us. It’s a sign of success, don’t let that stop us,” they say.

State Senator Bill Gannon and Representative Joe Sweeney, both Republicans, released statements as well. “Across New Hampshire, local police departments are working closely with federal officials to enforce the law and keep Granite Staters safe. We have seen the consequences of Democrats’ continual support for open border policies, and we will never have Sanctuary Cities in New Hampshire,” said Gannon, who was the prime sponsor of a bill outlawing “Sanctuary Cities.”

“The ban on Sanctuary Cities is the law of the land,” said House Deputy Majority Leader Sweeney. “We will not allow activists to skirt the law to create open-border policies in New Hampshire.”

The Sanctuary Community groups are well aware of the law. Noting in a Q&A handout distributed at the news conference that Ayotte had recently signed a “Sanctuary Cities” prohibition, the group said, “The Governor’s action pertains to municipalities like cities, towns and counties but it does not pertain to individual citizens. We have a First Amendment right to speak and to organize Sanctuary Communities. We do not work for the Governor.”

In response to the governor’s news release, Megan Chapman said it is ICE that is violating the law and the Constitution. “We do want to be a sanctuary in which people’s rights are upheld and the Constitution is upheld, and that’s what we’re standing for.”

“There’s nothing that we talked about today that is in violation of any New Hampshire or federal law,” Chapman added. “In fact, what we’re trying to do is uphold the Constitution, uphold its guarantees, uphold the rights that are afforded to the people, and make sure that those are protected against a lot of policies and practices that are happening now in violation of those rights.”

“For many of us, this is about answering to a higher law, a law that that calls us to care for the vulnerable, to push back against state sponsored violence and persecution,” Maggie Fogarty commented.

“We’re going step by step,” Larry Brown said as the news conference closed. “This is what citizen movements are about. They grow and they take turns here and there. We don’t know where this is going.”

Success is by no means assured, Brown said. “This is truly the David and Goliath moment in our history. But let us all get organized.

The facility quickly drew immense criticism for its inhumane conditions and treatment of detainees.

Though Alligator Alcatraz is currently shut down due to environmental and moral concerns, the Trump administration’s use of it as a model for expanding detention capacity across the country is extremely concerning. Reports described the center as having contaminated food, floors flooded with sewage water and overcrowded cells resembling cages, according to AP News.

This precedent reflects a disregard for human rights and normalizes mistreatment under the guise of immigration control. The situation highlights a distinct lack of empathy from Trump’s administration and other officials, as they easily cross other humans’ boundaries in this facility.

Additionally, detainees were denied the opportunity to speak to lawyers, family or friends, according to NBC News. They were effectively denied one of America’s most fundamental rights: access to a fair justice system.

The detention center is oppressive toward immigrants who deserve equal and just treatment. Even the most basic standards of human decency are ignored, as if immigrants deserve fewer rights than any other citizen does. Everyone, including immigrants, should reserve the ability to possess human rights, no matter their origin.

In the midst of it all, the government’s reaction toward public criticism is offensive. Its complete disregard for the public’s opinions shows a disinterest toward serving the people of America, which should be one of their top priorities.

Trump’s unprofessionalism was shown clearly as he joked that detainees would have to “learn how to run from alligators,” according to CNN. Instead of understanding the cruel conditions they forced the detainees of Alligator Alcatraz into, the administration ridiculed them.

To prevent more unjust facilities from being built, Americans must stand up and hold government leaders accountable, demanding humane treatment for all people, regardless of their immigrant status. The same goes for officials, whose silence makes them complicit in the moral wrongdoings of Trump’s administration.

Similarly, the government must take responsibility and shut down existing facilities with inhumane conditions. It has a duty to ensure that detention centers, or any other facility, meet basic human rights.

And in a nation that prides itself on being a country of immigrants, forcing people to suffer because of their background is deceitful. These centers take away dignity, separate families and reduce people to less than human.

Americans can not claim to value the right to freedom while tolerating this kind of abuse. Ending these facilities is not just about policy, but about deciding what kind of country we want to be.",https://hhsepitaph.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/alligatoralcatrazillustration.png,N,,2025-10-28 22:21:08.297040

“Our interfaith leaders who are present here today are doing just that, and they’ve been doing that.","What's at stake:

Advocates and interfaith leaders gathered outside the Fresno ICE Processing Center to denounce racial profiling and detentions of immigrants attending required appointments with no criminal record.

On Tuesday morning, around 40 community members and faith leaders gathered outside the Fresno U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Processing Center for public prayer and “moral witness” as local detentions continue to rise.

Faith in the Valley, along with clergy from Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, Indigenous, and other traditions, also held a parallel interfaith vigil outside the Stockton ICE Processing Center simultaneously with the Fresno rally.

Some local interfaith leaders emphasized the challenges faced by immigrants and Indigenous communities in Fresno and the broader Central Valley, describing these struggles as “permanently intertwined and interlinked.”

“We have to stand up against ICE and its unjust and inhumane treatment of our immigrant sisters and brothers,” Hajj Reza Nekumanesh, executive director of the Islamic Cultural Center of Fresno said. “And we have to stand up against the genocide of all indigenous peoples, and in particularly of the Palestinians, because all of these struggles, sisters and brothers, and all of our victories, are permanently intertwined and interlinked with one another.”

Faith leaders spoke out against ICE raids in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and numerous other communities, highlighting repeated violations of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The leaders condemned these detentions as civil rights violations, which affect both U.S. citizens and undocumented workers. They also raised concerns about racial-profiling, violent arrests, prolonged detentions without access to legal counsel, and deportations to third-party countries, such as South Sudan, where people face indefinite imprisonment, torture, and even death.

Fresnoland has previously reported that immigrants attending required appointments at the Fresno U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office, are being detained during or after their visits — despite having no criminal records and maintaining current paperwork.

Fresnoland also reported that immigrants attending required appointments related to their permanent residence status at the Fresno U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office were detained during or after their visits—despite having no criminal records and maintaining current paperwork.

Earlier, in June, two undocumented immigrants were taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents during an ICE-led operation outside Fresno’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) office, reflecting a practice seen in several states.

ICE arrests in California’s Central Valley have increased by 58% during the first seven months of President Donald Trump’s administration compared to the same period the previous year, according to The Fresno Bee.

At the vigil Tuesday, advocates raised concerns about California’s newest and largest detention center, a 2,560-bed facility that opened in late August in California City’s Antelope Valley. They cited reports of poor conditions, alleged mistreatment by staff, and the fact that CoreCivic has not yet received approval for its operating permits.

‘Racialized targeting’

Nekumanesh called on interfaith clergy to uphold “consistency, consistency, consistency” in defending immigrant rights, fighting police brutality, addressing the genocide in Palestine, and standing against other instances where human rights are being denied.

Other faith leaders, including Rev. Akiko Miyake-Stoner of the United Japanese Christian Church, drew on their personal histories to highlight the parallels between current immigration detentions in Fresno and the city’s past.

She noted that the Fresno Fairgrounds served as a temporary detention facility, the Fresno Assembly Center, from May to October 1942, where over 5,000 Japanese Americans, many from Central California, were held during World War II, describing the similarity as “eerily familiar.”

“One doesn’t have to look hard to see the parallels with today’s ICE raids done with such brutality and without due process,” Miyake-Stoner. “Both rely on racialized targeting that singles people out by appearance, language or national origin rather than individual guilt. Both depend on sweeping executive and bureaucratic power that suspends ordinary protections and normalizes detention. Both leave families separated, lives disrupted and communities carrying intergenerational trauma.”

Rev. Madeleine Guekguezian of the United Methodist Church of Merced, an Armenian Armenian American and descendant Armenian Genocide survivors, reflected on U.S. immigration policy, emphasizing that enforcement has often targeted people based on race rather than legal status.

She highlighted how undocumented immigrants are subjected to inhumane detention and removal from their communities, framing those who look different from the white-skinned Anglo majority in the U.S. as threats rather than as fellow human beings.

“The Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II had once said, ‘justice is a gift from God, lack of justice is a sin against God.’ I carry that with me,” Guekguezian said. “For those standing in line for ICE processing, for check ins, my prayer is that justice and relief comes to you as soon as it may be through the action of the people and the repentance of our leaders, but it will not be soon enough.”

How to build a first line of defense

Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, Faith in the Valley’s Watch Network program manager, said she struggles to speak to people who think it’s acceptable for families to be torn apart and denied due process. She emphasized that caring for neighbors should be a basic value learned from childhood.

“They’re dragging people out of their homes, out of their cars and out from public spaces in front of their families because of where they were born, not because of whatever crap they made up or discovered after,” Zaragoza-Yáñez said. “Where’s the due process? No, really, where is the due process? This isn’t acceptable.”

Zaragoza-Yáñez explained that the Watch Network empowers the community by educating people about their rights, accompanying them to check-ins or court appearances, and preparing families for potential incidents. She described the program as the community’s first line of defense, operating across eight Central Valley counties to respond to the tactics used by ICE.

“We keep our community safe by adding our little grain of sand into the bigger picture,” Zaragoza-Yáñez said. “Our interfaith leaders who are present here today are doing just that, and they’ve been doing that. They have bared witness to the atrocities that are being committed against our communities, they’re standing strong against any dehumanization of them, and their efforts are the embodiment of what it means to accompany someone to bear witness to what’s happening.”

That sense of shared responsibility also resonated with local community members in attendance. Jackie Pierson shared with Fresnoland that, as a white person whose “Christian faith is tied to the most marginalized,” she strives to leverage her privilege by volunteering with watch networks and by listening to and walking alongside her neighbors.

While attending the No Kings protests, Sylvia Valdez, a community member invited by an interfaith leader from On Ramps Covenant Church, told Fresnoland that the narrative seems to be shifting, with more white people showing up in solidarity with the communities most directly affected by the actions of Trump’s administration.

Valdez said she wasn’t sure what to expect from the morning’s vigil but ultimately felt “unity, peace, and God doing something powerful” through the gathering.

“I was able to look inward and grieve what’s happening,” Valdez said. “I thought about the needs of the people.”",https://fresnoland.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1347-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 19:01:42.515663

""Me and my dad had nothing to hide,"" the Houston teenager said at a news conference Monday. ""We were confused, so we just pulled over in a parking lot.""

According to Arnoldo, the two cars then blocked them in, and masked law enforcement officers — whom he claimed did not have identifying badges on their vests — began hitting the windows. Arnoldo said he and his father were scared, so his father decided to drive away.

""That's when me and my dad went [into] fight or flight,"" he said. ""He was trying to protect me. That's what he told me — ‘I'm going to protect you.’ ''

The unmarked cars then followed Arnoldo and his father down Boone Street in Southwest Houston to the Restaurant Depot on Bissonnet Street, where the two got out of the car, according to Arnoldo.

""I ran with my dad, but then they tackled him,"" he said. ""Three of them jumped on him, but when I saw they started choking, kicking, punching, it's when I reacted. I just ran to my dad, and a lady, she grabbed my shirt.""

The Montgomery County Processing Center, which is used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told Houston Public Media that Arnulfo Bazan was deported to Mexico on Monday — the same day his son recounted their experience during a news conference organized by FIEL Houston, an immigrant rights nonprofit. The organization reported that Arnulfo was taken to the processing center north of Houston after the Oct. 23 encounter at Restaurant Depot, while Arnoldo said he was returned home after he told the officers he was a minor and U.S. citizen.

The detention center did not provide further details regarding Arnulfo's immigration status or why he was deported. A Houston-based ICE spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the deportation or the Oct. 23 incident involving Arnulfo and his son.

FIEL Houston Executive Director Cesar Espinosa said he fears “more incidents like this can unfold” as federal immigration enforcement ramps up under the administration of President Donald Trump.

“In our beautiful diverse city, we are so worried for our communities and all the families that will be separated and hurt by this administration,” Espinosa said in a statement.

Arnoldo alleged that the officers who confronted him and his father choked him and took his cell phone. He said he believes his phone was taken because he had used it to film the encounter.

""Then that's when they tackled me and even though I said I was underage, the dude started choking me more,"" Arnoldo said.

A separate video shared online by FIEL appears to show Arnoldo and his father being detained in the entrance of the Restaurant Depot. While Arnoldo said he didn't see any identifying markings on the officers' uniforms, the video shows five officers, four of whom had ""police"" patches on their vests and one who had a “DEA” patch on the back of their vest.

In the video, the person filming the incident can be heard saying, ""You're fixing to break his neck"" while pointing the camera at two officers trying to restrain a young man who appears to be Arnoldo.

“They cover their faces and they don’t act like regular law enforcement or other federal agents,” Manny said.","Angelica Vargas was driving to get coffee near her home in Downey, California, when she saw a disturbing, yet now-familiar sight: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents running down the street, arresting a man who was painting a gas station. Immediately, Vargas moved to action: She pulled over and confronted the officers, using the firm, calm tone she’s learned is effective in situations like these.

“Of course, they got a little bit defensive. But then I started recording for evidence. And I reminded the guy he had rights. I kind of gave the officers a rough time,” Vargas said in a phone interview. Her initial plan was only to assist the detainee and document the officers. But then, seemingly in retaliation, some ICE vehicles remained behind to “box in” Vargas’s car, preventing her from leaving.

“That pissed me off. I mean, they weren’t gonna be there forever, boxing me in,” Vargas recalled. “So when they took off, I said, Let’s go. I have a really fast car. So I gave them a run for their money that day.”

For Vargas, a Mercedes-driving self-described “soccer mom,” that was the start of a new extracurricular: chasing ICE vehicles on the road, and posting the videos on TikTok. Now Vargas is known to her hundreds of thousands of followers—and the tens of millions of people who have watched her content—for her videos with cheeky titles like “Spending Quality Time With ICE.” Posted in time-lapse speed to jaunty Mexican music, Vargas’s videos show ICE vehicles weaving lanes, and in some cases making multiple or illegal U-turns, to avoid her. In one video, Vargas cuts across what appears to be a gas station parking lot to speed up her pursuit.

“I love you taking shortcuts to get back to them that they don’t know about. Guess who’s actually from there,” one user commented. Indeed, the overall effect, as commenters have noted, is like Grand Theft Auto: exhilarating, even heroic.

ICE raids have skyrocketed under the Trump administration, striking fear in immigrant communities. Fueled by a $75 billion funding increase this year, arrests surged in the Los Angeles area, where Vargas lives. Over 2,000 immigrants without criminal records were arrested this summer, the majority from Mexico and Guatemala. Other areas have been hit hard more recently; in Chicago and its suburbs, for instance, federal agents have used tear gas and smashed car windows while carrying out raids.

Raids are designed to inspire fear, with agents frequently wearing masks, seizing students off the streets, and even incorporating theatrical, militarized elements like agents on horseback. “The Trump administration’s goal is to make life as unnavigable, unstable and uncomfortable as possible” for undocumented immigrants, CalMatters reported in August. The effects in the LA area have been palpable. Bus ridership decreased in LA over the summer, and Cal State Los Angeles, which serves working-class communities, allowed students to take classes online for fear of immigration enforcement.

In these conditions of terror, Vargas’s decision to turn the fear back on ICE offers much-needed catharsis for her viewers. “You had them stressing 😂,” commented one user on a June video. “ICE works hard but Angie works harder 😭,” said another. “Do you think they sit around campfires and tell horror stories about you?” another joked.

Vargas’s favorite responses, she said, come from older generations. “There was a girl who reached out to me and told me that her dad was an illegal immigrant, and before his passing, he loved my TikTok page,” she said. “It brightened up his day.”

Vargas did not intend to become a public vigilante. She works by day as a mental health professional and dedicates much of her free time to raising her two daughters, student athletes aged 15 and 16. But times are too dire to stay home, she said. Before the ICE raids, she said, “people were able to do their daily lives, go to Home Depots without having the fear of being detained, or even showing up to their jobs without the fear of being raided by immigration agents. A lot has shifted. We are definitely living under terror.”

Vargas first discovered her superpower—her ability to stand up to ICE—in June, when she got a distressing call from her mother: Vargas’s sister, a US citizen, had gotten stuck at a “super chaotic” ICE raid at a Home Depot in Downey. “There was tear-gassing, fire bombs, a bunch of stuff that, you know, it’s just not normal. On a Saturday morning,” Vargas recalled. “My mom was scared, and I took initiative. I said, ‘Mom, I’m going to go get her.’”

Although ICE had blocked off the parking lot and wasn’t allowing anybody to leave, Vargas drove up to the Home Depot. She managed to push through the barriers and convince the ICE agents to allow her sister to drive out in her truck. “Mind you, she was one of the only people that was allowed to leave. I convinced the federal agents, right? So I’d seen what I could do,” Vargas said. “It really made me see how privileged I am to be a US citizen. Everybody’s told me, like, you carry this confidence in you, even officers respect you. So I’m gonna use that to my advantage and for the community.”

Vargas thinks she is able to get through to ICE agents because she is a US citizen and speaks fluent English. She’s strengthened her communication tactics—she tries to keep it “smart and professional,” having noticed that federal agents don’t respond well to cursing or aggressive questioning. Vargas, a former psych major, also tries to use “reverse psychology tactics” against the agents, trying to “relate to them, get on their level.”

“I feel like a lot of people stay indoors and just watch through a phone,” she said, “when they have the legal status to go out there and make a difference.”

Emboldened by her success at Home Depot, Vargas started keeping track of ICE raids in her community. She uses civilian-run Instagram and TikTok accounts that report ICE raids in the hopes of mobilizing responders. Manny, the 29-year-old community college student behind the Instagram account @LAHoodLove, is one such source.

On a given day, @LAHoodLove blasts a series of potential ICE sightings, often naming streets and posting grainy photos.

Manny, who is also an ICE chaser, was already active in organizing fundraisers for street vendors and leading peaceful protests, including at the Downey Home Depot, which is often hit by raids. Manny said ICE chasers stepped up their tactics because ICE doesn’t play by normal rules. “They cover their faces and they don’t act like regular law enforcement or other federal agents,” Manny said. “I call them kidnappers, because they’re wearing masks. No plates, no badge number. They’re just grabbing, pulling out guns. This is worse than cartel. They take you, and you disappear.”

Vargas and Manny, like many organizers, took advantage of the fact that ICE, at least in the early months of the Trump administration, was disorganized. Manny’s first time chasing ICE was in February. He said he sensed that the agents were nervous. “I already had an idea that ICE was going to hire contractors. So I just figured, OK, they haven’t done this in a while, so it’s gonna be a little off,” Manny said. “So once I approached them, they were shook because I was recording them. I had my phone right in their faces, and I was like, who are you guys? Where you work?”

The agents, Manny said, claimed to be probation officers, but the effect on the people they were detaining was confusion and terror. Indeed, ICE’s practice of wearing masks during raids earned swift public pushback and is facing legal and policy challenges.

Ad Policy

Vargas said ICE is getting more effective now—but so too is resistance. “They’re scared to be ambushed by civilians, especially now, since we’re all well connected,” Vargas said.

Social media, Vargas said, has been a “huge blessing” for community members to coordinate their response, whether that is ICE chasing, documenting raids, or informing detainees of their rights. It also helps build morale. There are the viral videos of mass confrontations with ICE and the Border Patrol, from LA to Portland to Chicago. But there are also people standing up on a smaller scale. Social media is filled with choppy videos filmed by bystanders bearing witness to raids.

In July, the Los Angeles Times compiled a list of social media videos that showcase civilians intervening in local ICE arrests. From cars honking in warning as Border Patrol trucks enter a parking lot, to a woman screaming, “What’s wrong with you?” at agents arresting a taco vendor, to a woman commenting, “Bitches,” as she records agents making arrests at a Home Depot, social media bears witness to a tapestry of quiet and overt resistance.

Nonetheless, ICE chasing carries significant risks. Manny said that “unfortunately” he has never consulted with a lawyer or gotten legal protection for his ICE chasing; he works alone because he doesn’t want to endanger a passenger if he is detained. Just in case, he switched cars. Vargas, too, said she chases alone: “Nobody knew where I was. Only, like, my best friends had my location.” While she isn’t afraid of detention by ICE since she’s a US citizen, she did initially fear being pulled over by police.

Now that she’s often busy responding to ICE sightings, Vargas’s mother steps in to help take care of her daughters. “They are my number-one supporters,” Vargas said of her family; while she doesn’t bring her daughters on ICE chases for safety reasons, they help charge her phones, batteries, and media equipment, and accompany her to “friendlier, family-oriented protests.” Meanwhile, Vargas’s social media followers sought ways to help. Responding to comments offering to pay for her gas, Vargas set up a GoFundMe page, “Support Angie in Protecting Our Latin Community,” that has raised over $122,000.

To her community, in-person and online, Vargas is a hero. She said she’s always been this kind of person—someone who stands up when things are difficult. This quality she attributes to her father, an ex-professional soccer player, who raised her with privilege in the suburbs but “never let [her] forget she is brown.” She also credited her organizing chops to managing her daughter’s soccer team. Beyond ICE chasing, she stays active in her community through mutual aid efforts and food distributions, and has contemplated running for office in the future.

“It definitely doesn’t come with a manual,” Vargas said of organizing against ICE. “Everything is going to be different. One day you can be helping a person with groceries. The next day, you can be chasing ICE and confronting federal agents.”

These days ICE comes to Downey less often, hopefully a result of ICE-chasing efforts, Vargas said. “I’m not getting as much ICE leads around my city, which is a good thing. But now I have to commute longer in order to do what I was doing. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable because it’s not within my comfort zone, like, I don’t know the streets, what freeways I’m at. But I still make an effort to go out there and help out the community.”",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FotoJet-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 18:17:00.778459

Window-shopping for health plans delayed The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The pressure to end the second-longest federal government shutdown is gaining new urgency this week as millions of Americans face the prospect of losing food assistance, more federal workers miss their first full paycheck and recurring delays at airports snarl travel plans.

The building strain on lawmakers to end the impasse was magnified by the nation’s largest federal employee union, which called on Congress to immediately pass a funding bill and ensure workers receive full pay. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said the two political parties have made their point.

“It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship,” said Kelley, whose union carries considerable political weight with Democratic lawmakers.

Still, Democratic senators, including those representing states with many federal workers, did not appear ready to back down. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he was insisting on commitments from the White House to prevent the administration from mass firing more workers. Democrats also want Congress to extend subsidies for health plans under the Affordable Care Act.

“We’ve got to get a deal with Donald Trump,” Kaine said.

But shutdowns grow more painful the longer they go. Soon, with closures lasting a fourth full week as of Tuesday, millions of Americans are likely to experience the difficulties firsthand.

“This week, more than any other week, the consequences become impossible to ignore,” said Rep. Lisa McClain, chair of the House Republican Conference.

Shutdown’s impact is set to grow dramatically

The nation’s 1.3 million active-duty service members are at risk of missing a paycheck on Friday. Earlier this month, the Trump administration ensured they were paid by shifting $8 billion from military research and development funds to make payroll. But it is unclear if the Trump administration is willing — or able — to shift money again.

Larger still, the Trump administration says funding will run out Friday for the food assistance program that is relied upon by 42 million Americans to supplement their grocery bills. The administration has rejected the use of more than $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits flowing into November. And it says states won’t be reimbursed if they temporarily cover the cost of benefits next month.

The Department of Agriculture says the contingency fund is intended to help respond to emergencies such as natural disasters. Democrats say the decision concerning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, goes against the department’s previous guidance concerning its operations during a shutdown.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the administration made an intentional choice not to the fund SNAP in November, calling it an “act of cruelty.”

Will lawmakers find a solution?

At the Capitol, congressional leaders mostly highlighted the challenges many Americans are facing as a result of the shutdown. But there was no movement toward negotiations as they attempted to lay blame on the other side of the political aisle.

“Now government workers and every other American affected by this shutdown have become nothing more than pawns in the Democrats’ political games,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

The House passed a short-term continuing resolution on Sept. 19 to keep federal agencies funded. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of legislative session ever since, saying the solution is for Democrats to simply accept that bill.

But the Senate has consistently fallen short of the 60 votes needed to advance that spending measure. Democrats insist that any bill to fund the government also address health care costs, namely the soaring health insurance premiums that millions of Americans will face next year under plans offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Window-shopping for health plans delayed

The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday. In past years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has allowed Americans to preview their health coverage options about a week before open enrollment.

As of Monday, Healthcare.gov appeared to show 2025 health insurance plans and estimated prices, instead of next year’s options. CMS was expected to temporarily bring back all its workers furloughed during the shutdown, in part to manage the ACA open enrollment period.

Twenty-eight senators, mostly Democrats, signed a letter urging Trump’s administration to let ACA enrollees start previewing next year’s health insurance options on its marketplace website.

Republicans insist they will not entertain negotiations on health care until the government reopens.

“I’m particularly worried about premiums going up for working families,” said Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa. “So we’re going to have that conversation, but we’re not going to have it until the government opens.”

Congressional leaders dig in deeper

Schumer said Republicans would prefer to shut the government down than work with Democrats in preventing massive spikes in their health insurance costs. He said the average American doesn’t want to pay an extra $20,000 a year to cover their health insurance.

“And we Democrats want to solve this crisis right away,” Schumer said. “So lowering health care is not a crazy demand.”

Vice President JD Vance planned to attend a Republican luncheon on Capitol Hill Tuesday. But with President Donald Trump traveling in Asia and congressional leaders dug into their positions, a quick deal appeared unlikely.

Meanwhile, some rank-and-file lawmakers urged colleagues to consider the impact of their standoff on the lives of federal employees and Capitol police officers who have not been paid for weeks.

“We have got to come together, which means we’ve got to talk to one another,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said in a floor speech urging leaders to stop focusing on who was winning the political fight. “Right now, those that are losing are the American people.”

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs.","WASHINGTON (CN) — Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had little to say Tuesday about reports that the Department of Homeland Security purged immigration enforcement chiefs in several U.S. cities as the Trump administration looks to supercharge its mass deportation campaign.

Both Republicans and Democrats were hesitant to weigh in on the staffing shake-up, which would see officials from U.S. Border Patrol replace the heads of Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, among other cities.

But at least one lawmaker speculated that the Homeland Security Department made the staffing changes to support what he called the White House’s “unrealistic” deportation quotas.

According to a report from the Washington Examiner, the agency last week removed five ICE field office chiefs and moved them to positions elsewhere in the country. In addition to reassigning the heads of immigration enforcement in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, the Homeland Security Department also removed ICE chiefs in Phoenix and San Diego.

The administration reportedly plans to replace most of the ousted immigration heads with senior staff from Border Patrol, though in Philadelphia, the vacant ICE role will be filled by an official from Homeland Security Investigations.

While the move to replace top ICE officials with Border Patrol — which has taken an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement under its chief, Gregory Bovino — is unprecedented, lawmakers largely claimed Tuesday that they didn’t have enough information to take a firm stance on the issue.

Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, a senior Republican member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, declined to comment to Courthouse News. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, another GOP lawmaker on the homeland security panel, said that he had seen reporting about the purges but that he didn’t “know enough” about the situation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed ignorance of the ICE leadership purge during a news conference Tuesday morning, telling Courthouse News that he had only just learned about the reports. He added that “some of these things get mis-portrayed.”

Democrats were similarly reticent to offer their thoughts. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy told Courthouse News that he had not yet been briefed and declined to offer any additional input.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a fellow Connecticut Democrat who also sits on the Homeland Security committee, posited that the staffing shake-up at ICE’s field offices was thanks to the immigration agency’s failure to meet the Trump administration’s “completely unrealistic” deportation quotas.

White House adviser Stephen Miller has long demanded that ICE arrest as many as 3,000 immigrants a day, or 1 million per year.

“This kind of executive action simply shows the moral bankruptcy of their policies,” said Blumenthal.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, did not directly respond to reports of the purge at ICE, saying instead that Americans were “understandably horrified” at the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.

“It’s our hope that, if there’s going to be a change in personnel, it’s actually to enact a more humane approach, rather than what we’ve seen in community after community in the country,” said Jeffries.

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs. The agency’s assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, told Courthouse News in a statement Tuesday that it had “no personnel changes to announce right now.”

“This is one team, one fight,” McLaughlin wrote. “President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary [Kristi] Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

A spokesperson for the Border Patrol union did not return a request for comment.

News that Border Patrol officials may be taking over for ICE in several major cities comes as Bovino on Tuesday was dressed down by a federal judge over his failure to comply with a court order blocking federal agents from deploying tear gas and other riot control weapons against protesters, journalists and other bystanders in Chicago.

The judge demanded that Bovino, who has personally participated in the federal crackdown on the Windy City and has himself deployed tear gas on demonstrators, appear before her daily to report new incidents. Bovino admitted to the court that he did not use a body-worn camera and agreed to begin wearing one.

The Trump administration has in recent weeks sent federal agents and National Guard troops into several U.S. cities, including Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The White House has framed the move as an effort to crack down on crime and illegal immigration. Some federal courts have ruled that the president’s deployment of National Guard troops violates federal law.

According to recent statistics, more than 70% of people held by ICE have no prior criminal convictions.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/courthousenews.com/2025/10/immigration-ice-police-jacket.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-28 22:21:28.375460

The cities include Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix and San Diego. ICE officers in those locations were relieved of their jobs last week and moved to other positions within the agency, the sources said.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said the administration had “no personnel changes to announce at this time,” but praised President Donald Trump and his team for “delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

It comes as Border Czar Tom Homan says he’s working with White House adviser Stephen Miller to increase the pace of deportations.

“We need to continue prioritizing public safety threats,” Homan told NewsNation. “Worst first but prioritization doesn’t mean everyone else is off the table. If you are here illegally, you ARE NOT off the table.”

Border Patrol has been carrying out the majority of the sweeping raids that generally lead to protests at the direction of Chief Gregory Bovino, who appeared in court Tuesday over allegations that he threw tear gas canisters during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.

Border Patrol agents also carry out targeted enforcement operations. By comparison, ICE officers generally stick to one target after they conduct research.

Earlier this month, Bovino told NewsNation that Border Patrol operations are “all legal, ethical and moral.”

Fox News reports that the change in staffing comes from competing factions within deportation enforcement, with Homan and ICE Director Todd Lyons squared off against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Bovino.

Sources believe that ICE’s current enforcement approach is not producing the number of arrests Trump wants, but Bovino’s broader methods appear to be what the administration is after.

“We are going to go throughout Chicago with reckless abandon — professionally, legally, ethically and morally — and arrest all illegal alien gang members that we can get our hands on,” Bovino told NewsNation.

Over months of conversations with NY1, former immigration judges recommended comparing how many judges had active Webex video channels now versus the beginning of Donald Trump’s presidency in January.

What You Need To Know

NY1 analysis shows a steep drop in immigration judges with active Webex channels since the beginning of the second Trump administration

Former judges told NY1 that no longer having a Webex link means the judge is on leave, took a buyout, retired or got fired

The Trump administration announced a plan to hire hundreds of temporary judges across the country

A former immigration judge in New York City, fired by the Trump administration, raised concerns about how prepared the temporary judges will be

They told NY1 the missing links had one of four potential outcomes: the judge could have taken a leave, taken a buyout, retired or been fired.

When NY1, using examined the government web pages from January 19, 2025 — the day before Donald Trump’s inauguration — compared to October 16, 2025, there were 15 judges whose names had disappeared over the course of the year.

One of those judges was Carmen Maria Rey Caldas, who had been a judge at 26 Federal Plaza until late this summer.

“It was an email,” she said from her Brooklyn apartment, describing how she found out her fate. “It was sent at 4:07 p.m.”

She said there was no reason given for her termination.

For the first time since 2015, according to data provided to NY1 by the U.S. Department of Justice, the number of immigration judges has dropped.

In that year, there were 254 immigration judges across the country per Department of Justice data, when the immigration case backlog was 456,216, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

However, in the decade since then, the backlog of cases has exploded to more than 3.4 million, as the number of judges reached a peak of 735.

In 2023, there was a federal report provided to Congress about the backlog of immigration cases and how hiring more immigration judges could impact that statistic.

At that point, the backlog of immigration cases nationwide was under 2 million. The number of immigration judges sat at 649, according to the report filed by the Congressional Research Service, which is a nonpartisan research agency that provides reports to Congress.

If 1,000 more judges had been hired at the time, that would have led to no backlog in about five years, according to the analysis done at the time. If no judges were hired, it would lead to a backlog of more than 3.1 million by 2033.

It took less than two years, rather than the predicted 10 years, to blow past that number nationally, however.

The backlog of cases means some respondents in immigration courts have hearings set for the next decade, according to immigration lawyers NY1 has interviewed in recent years.

On Jan. 19, there were 721 immigration judges across the country. Before a recent hiring announcement by the Department of Justice, at last count, it was at 575.

The remaining judges can face a culture of fear, according to Caldas.

“That is no way to run a court,” she said to NY1.

In the latest budget bill, Congress authorized the DOJ to have a total of as many as 800 immigration judges, and late this summer, the Trump administration announced a plan to hire up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary judges.

On Friday, the administration announced a new class of 36 immigration judges, about 70% of them temporary.

One permanent and one temporary hire will hear cases in New York City courtrooms starting this month.

This new class of judges will bring the total to more than 600 again, for the first time in a few months, according to the NY1 review of active Webex video channels.

Since the beginning of the administration, there has been a 15% drop in judges across the country, and in New York City, nearly mirroring the national average, has seen a 16% decrease, according to NY1’s analysis.

Those percentage drops include last week’s hiring announcement.

If the Trump administration fills all the temporary judicial positions, on top of the permanent ones currently on staff, it would represent the largest total number of judges nationwide.

The 600 potential temporary ones, however, will be reevaluated every six months, before a decision is made on whether to renew their position or not, according to the Department of Justice memo from this summer.

“I think they’re being set up to fail,” Caldas said in her interview about the temporary judges, which was done weeks before the new hires were announced.

She said immigration law can be complex, and judges are often ruling on cases at the moment, not having time to research decisions for weeks on cases where the stakes can be incredibly high.

“A wrong move can result in someone’s death. If you deport someone to a country where their life is in danger, that person could very well die,” she said.

A Department of Defense spokesperson told NY1 the agency “is identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges.”

NY1 followed up by asking what qualities make a Department of Defense employee qualified versus unqualified.

“We don’t have anything additional to provide on this,” she said.

In a federal document outlining the new policy, the Department of Justice indicated it will look for “the most qualified individuals overall with primary weight given to an applicant’s education and employment history,” and that factors such as judicial, trial or immigration experience will matter.

The DOJ document said the temporary judges will receive the same “comprehensive, continuing training and support” as permanent judges.

But Caldas said she’s not sure if they will have the support team she had, including two clerks who helped with writing decisions and responding to motions.

When NY1 asked the Department of Justice spokeswoman about the plan to support temporary judges, she sent a document that she said included that information.

However, NY1’s review of the file led to nothing specific about staffing for the temporary judges.

More simply, Caldas has a question, at least at her former workplace, 26 Federal Plaza, if the government hires more judges than those who have left in recent months.

“Has anyone even looked at where these people are going to sit? There aren’t enough courtrooms,” she said. “We literally don’t have court space.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/_ERIC_PKG_JUDGES_DROPPING_CG,N,,2025-10-28 18:01:26.530296

WASHINGTON—The federal government has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review two appellate court decisions striking down President Trump’s executive order limiting constitutional birthright citizenship to children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Yesterday, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), in a brief joined by Landmark Legal Foundation, urged the Court to take up the cases.

In its brief, FAIR focuses on the true meaning of an historic Supreme Court case: United States v. Wong Kim Ark, decided in 1898. In that case, the Supreme Court held that, because—and only because—the parents of a man of Chinese ancestry were legally residing in the United States when he was born here, he was a U.S. citizen at birth under the Fourteenth Amendment.

In showing that the Court’s requirement of lawful permission to reside was part of its holding, FAIR sharply parts ways with the view taken by plaintiffs’ attorneys, activist courts, and many academic commentators that the Fourteenth Amendment makes anyone born in the United States whose parents are not diplomats or members of an invading army a citizen. On the contrary, the true reading of the Fourteenth Amendment, explicated in Wong Kim Ark, is that, to be a citizen at birth under the Fourteenth Amendment, one must be born in the United States to parents who, at the time, had permission to reside in the United States. This rule excludes the children of both illegal aliens and tourists from constitutional birthright citizenship, since neither class of aliens has permission to reside here.

Which interpretation is right is clearly an issue of such importance that the Court must resolve it. As the brief puts it:

This Court should grant certiorari to correct a glaring, widespread legal error, committed by both courts below, about the meaning of one of this Court’s central historical precedents. This Court should recognize that it remains bound by this precedent as properly understood, having no strong grounds to overturn it, and accordingly rule for petitioners.

“This holding has been sleeping in the law books, in a case largely mischaracterized in law schools and by academics, for 127 years,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “Yet logic shows that it is there and still binding on the Supreme Court. We hope the Court interprets its prior case rightly, grants review, and upholds Trump’s executive order.”

Not anymore.

Nine months after the Trump administration dramatically stepped up immigration enforcement, many people from other countries are remaining at home for fear of being harassed, arrested or deported, possibly to a county they’ve never known. Instead of seeing their therapist at the clinic, a majority of Esperanza’s clients who speak Spanish are now opting for virtual sessions to avoid venturing outside.

But even at home they can’t function normally, said Ingrid Solares, clinical and health equity director for Adelante Mujeres, an Latino advocacy group that opened the clinic a year ago.

“People have a difficult time concentrating, making decisions, focusing, eating regularly, sleeping regularly,” Solares said.

The administration’s efforts to deport people and its racial profiling are starting to take a deep toll not only on many residents but also on those who serve them, advocates and providers told The Lund Report.

Providers at safety net clinics are bracing for potential raids as federal agents sit in unmarked cars with tinted windows in store parking lots and outside schools. Patients are still showing up for health appointments, but they’re reluctant to see unfamiliar specialists, with some even limiting treatment of severe conditions by their primary care provider.

State officials say they have not shared the personal information of undocumented immigrants with the Trump administration thanks to a pending legal action filed to block federal access. But immigrants who lack residency documents have become increasingly reluctant to sign up for state-paid health care benefits because they’re worried they might become a target — even though Oregon is one of several states offering such care.

The Healthier Oregon program provides free physical, mental and dental care benefits to low-income immigrants whose residency status excludes them from Medicaid, the federally backed health care program for low-income residents.

The number of people enrolled in the program had steadily grown, surpassing 100,000 in December and peaking at more than 107,000 in June, state enrollment figures show. Since then the number has dropped every month and currently stands at about 105,000.

By law, federal money is not supposed to be used for routine health care for undocumented immigrants. The state will cover $900 million to fund the program and use another $300 million in federal dollars to cover emergency and pregnancy care as required by the decades-old Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, EMTALA, according to the Oregon Health Authority.

After enrolling, many were reluctant to take advantage of the benefits and now they’re hesitant to even sign up.

“Even folks who might qualify, there's just a level of fear in signing up for any public benefit program,” said Jennifer Griffith, CEO of One Community Health, which runs clinics in Hood River and The Dalles in Oregon and in White Salmon and Stevenson in Washington.

Avoiding preventative care can lead to more serious conditions later on, requiring costly emergency room visits or worse.

If people don’t get care or if federal rules prevent safety net clinics from providing services, everyone will suffer, said Talbot Eckweiler, communications director for the Oregon Primary Care Association, which represents 34 safety net clinics in the state.

“That's going to cost the taxpayers more money, it's going to lead to worse health outcomes for that individual, and it just makes our populations less healthy, less able to function,” Eckweiler said.

Too soon to tell

Officials said it’s too early to gauge how much the crackdown might be affecting health services for undocumented immigrants. But anecdotally, health experts and advocacy groups say it’s definitely affecting people’s health.

“People are worried; providers are worried,” said Gil Muñoz, CEO of Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center, a safety net health system with six clinics in Washington and Yamhill counties.

“For a population that has a lot of trauma already this just adds another layer of stress,” he said.

Virginia Garcia serves 52,000 people. About 60% speak Spanish or another language as their primary tongue, and nearly as many are on Medicaid or qualify for Healthier Oregon. Muñoz has expected the federal activity to lead to many Spanish speakers canceling appointments, but he said that’s not happened so far.

“The demand is still very strong for the services,” Muñoz said. ”I’ve been impressed that people are still showing up despite concerns that there is more activity in the community.”

He suspects that the continued demand reflects trust in Virginia Garcia, which was established in 1975.

“We think people feel safe coming to Virginia Garcia,” Muñoz said. “But what we’ve heard anecdotally is that people may be more hesitant to go to referral visits.”

One Community Health, founded in 1986, serves over 28,000 patients, and about one-fifth who speak Spanish. Griffith, the CEO, said most patients are continuing to seek care.

“Part of that is we're a rural community,” Griffith said. “There are not a lot of options other than us, and we've been here for a long time. Community members trust us.”

But she said some immigrants on Medicaid or Healthier Oregon have asked whether they should give up the coverage to drop off the official radar.

“Our team so far has really been able to kind of talk folks out of it,” Griffith said.

But advocates, like those at the Oregon Latino Health Coalition, an advocacy group focused on reducing health care inequities, are having a tougher time these days persuading people to take advantage of Healthier Oregon. The nonprofit has three bilingual community health workers educating people in Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties about the program. After getting them signed up, they help people navigate the system.

In the past, they could get people signed up with a phone call or two, said Olivia Quiroz, the coalition’s CEO. Now, it takes longer.

“People are hesitant,” Quiroz said. “They want to know more information.” They have a lot of questions.”

Advocates, providers affected, too

Like many people the coalition helps, Quiroz was born in Mexico. She’s a U.S. citizen but understands the effect the crackdown is having on Latinos who feel they’re a target regardless of their immigration status. Every evening she’s reminded of the enforcement as she drives past the ICE detention center in south Portland on her way home from work.

“Personally, every time I see that corner my stress levels and my anxiety goes up,” Quiroz said. “All of us are feeling it.”

At Clinica Esperanza, Solares had to take a day off recently to regroup. From Guatemala, she said seeing images on the news of federal agents with guns brings back a traumatic memory of being a girl on her father’s shoulders one day and having to run because the police were shooting people.

“I feel scared and anxious and sad and pissed,” she said.

Like her clients, she, too, has felt under stress.

“The other day I went a whole day without drinking water,” Solares said.

As a provider, she’s had to adapt. When patients are traumatized, talk therapy often doesn’t work, she said. Instead, therapists use breathing and other body techniques to help clients loosen up.

The therapists at Clinica Esperanza also make sure patients have a safety plan and key phone numbers in the event a family member is arrested.

She recommends that patients and people in the community join the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition, PIRC, to get trained on how to deal with a potential ICE raid. She said she just joined a mutual aid group in the community and is working after hours to help.

“I have some privilege, and I can use my privilege to help others,” Solares said.

But her main focus is working with patients to keep them engaged.

It’s not yet clear what the long-term impact of the current environment will have on people, but Griffith of One Community Health fears the effects could cause deep harm.

“Mental health is a huge component of overall physical well being,” Griffith said. “I don't think we know yet what the long-term effects are going to be, but I can't imagine they're positive.”

‘More complex issues’

One of the family physicians at One Community Health, Dr. Evan Saulino, said some patients appear to be delaying treatment.

“What I do see is people having a little bit more complex issues when they're coming in,” Saulino said. “They're waiting a little bit. They're waiting to see — ‘Can I wait this out? Maybe it'll just get better.’”

He said a longtime patient, an orchard worker with diabetes, came in recently with a foot problem that Saulino said was potentially limb-threatening.

The clinic referred him to a specialist in Portland, but Saulino said the man didn’t want to go.

“He expressed some reluctance over immigration concerns,” Saulino said. “I don’t know what his status is though.”",https://www.thelundreport.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-10/Clinic%20Esperanza%20hug.jpg?itok=QI3pfeAF,N,,2025-10-28 18:01:33.929184

In July, the Department of Labor (DOL) introduced an extensive plan to reduce regulations affecting various labor protections, including important workplace safety regulations. Officials presented the initiative as an effort to “put American workers and job creators first,” a misleading interpretation of policies that enable employers to jeopardize their workers’ well-being and complicate the process for employees to seek accountability.

This movement toward deregulation indicates a readiness to compromise the health and lives of workers, especially Black and brown workers who are overrepresented in the blue-collar industries that would be impacted, in pursuit of corporate profits. If approved, the far-reaching changes will adversely affect working conditions at construction sites and mines and limit the ability of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while performing inherently dangerous activities.

Loosening regulations that ensure health, safety, and dignity in the workplace will not eliminate outdated or unnecessary regulations. Rather, this plan undermines the fundamental right of employees to have safe and respectable working environments; indicates to employers that taking shortcuts is permissible and that the government will ignore the exploitation and subsequent dismissal of worker safety; and seems aimed at reducing expenses for employers by transferring risks and dangers onto employees.

The Importance of Regulatory Rules

Agencies draft federal rules to implement the specifics of legislation enacted by Congress. Regulations ensure that laws are properly implemented and administered so that workers have meaningful protections. This is especially important given that current labor law already falls short in creating adequate job quality standards. Trump’s deregulatory agenda requires agencies to identify ten regulations to repeal before enacting a single new regulation. This paradigm upholds the false notion that regulations hinder economic growth and burden employers.

Over half of the rules that Trump’s DOL wants to repeal are intended to make workplaces safer for employees. Since the establishment of OSHA, more than 712,000 workers have been saved under the OSH Act, and jobsite deaths have decreased by almost two-thirds, even as the size of the U.S. workforce has more than doubled. OSHA is the only agency that enforces and preserves worker health and safety.

Health and Safety Deregulations

Within this deregulation campaign, DOL intends to revise reporting thresholds and training mandates, and change enforcement priorities and inspection frequencies at OSHA. The twenty-five proposed rules all put worker safety protections at risk. Four of the most concerning are:

General Duty Clause

A proposed change that would limit OSHA’s ability to cite employers under the General Duty Clause for hazards deemed “inherent and inseparable” from certain professions in high-risk sectors is particularly harmful. Employers already have autonomy over what is “essential” to a job and how to establish workplace standards, especially in nonunionized settings. That makes the General Duty Clause one of OSHA’s most effective enforcement weapons to address the countless dangers workers may face, giving it the authority to address significant workplace dangers that are not covered by more focused rules. Without the clause’s vital safeguards, OSHA would be significantly less equipped to respond to developing risks or hold employers accountable for recognized hazards that lie within gaps in current regulations.

COVID-19 Reporting

The administration also intends to terminate OSHA’s independent system for monitoring COVID-related deaths and hospitalizations, as well as explicitly remove COVID-19 emergency reporting guidelines for health care settings from federal regulations. This change would mean that employers must only report the usual criteria for workplace risks, under which companies are only required to record hospitalizations if they occur within 24 hours of the job exposure. Since most COVID-related hospitalizations occur days or even weeks after exposure, returning to OSHA’s baseline reporting standard would essentially remove many workplace-related COVID cases from the record. The elimination of separate COVID-19 reporting also signals a concerning de-prioritization of reporting on the exposure of contagious illnesses, even in medical facilities where reporting is crucial for maintaining the safety of those settings, safeguarding access to care, and averting outbreaks that disproportionately affect those who are already at risk. If implemented, this change will harm workers in nursing facilities, assisted living communities, and home health agencies, as well as in other health care environments such as hospitals and medical offices.

Musculoskeletal Injury Reporting

Another proposal would remove the need for employers to disclose musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), even though these injuries are among the most prevalent and expensive workplace hazards. MSDs are injuries brought on by or made worse by heavy lifting, repetitive motions, poor workplace ergonomics, and other physically taxing jobs that are often not adequately protected by existing OSHA standards.

The vote on Monday paused consideration of the ordinances for six months. It came after a procession of clergy, nonprofit workers, activists and citizens stood before the panel of commissioners to deliver impassioned pleas against them. No one expressed support for the measures during a public comment period.

“You are proposing to penalize Knoxvillians for being good. You would turn food pantries, clinics and shelters into checkpoints and faithful servants into informants,” said Matthew Nance, a Knox County resident.

Nance was among the majority of speakers who cited scripture in opposing the measures.

“You would threaten directors for refusing to betray what Christ commands: to feed the hungry, welcome the stranger and heal the wounded,” he said.

But Commissioner Andy Fox, a cosponsor of the measures, chided many of the members of the public who spoke by name, telling one, “you do not rightly divine the Bible.”

“The people that like to bring up the Bible and say what would Jesus do …first of all the Bible, as I like to put it, is a book of personal piety not public policy,” Fox said.

“Now you can derive values from the Bible that you apply in public situations, but primarily the Bible is the book that is the Gospel message to the world and its primary focus is to draw attention to the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the need for repentance,” he said.

The two ordinances were initially introduced by Commissioner Angela Russell, an accountant who said the county should more strictly monitor nonprofits that receive county funds. The ordinances require more stringent audits and detailed reporting of expenditures.

One ordinance would attach the new requirements to nonprofits receiving funding via the county’s hotel tax; the other applies to general funds distributed to nonprofits.

Fox subsequently added a clause to the ordinances requiring nonprofit executive directors to provide sworn statements, subject to penalty of perjury, that no county funding is used to provide services to “any person or persons residing in, staying in, or visiting Knox County while in violation of U.S. immigration laws.”

Knox County issued $1.9 million in grants to charitable foundations through its general fund. The amount distributed to charitable funds through its hotel tax was not immediately available. Altogether, public officials said that the total amount granted to nonprofits is less than 1% of the county’s budget.

“While this misguided move has been rightfully challenged in court, it is imperative that you not wait to take action to rescind this unlawful attempt to undermine the CDFI Fund immediately.","Today, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar (TX-16) joined Representatives Maxine Waters (CA-43) and Bill Foster (IL-11) and 120 House Democrats in sending a letter to U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, expressing grave concern about the Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to terminate staff at the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund amid the ongoing Republican government shutdown.

In the letter, the lawmakers underscore how for decades, communities across the country have benefited from the CDFI Fund, whose success has been made possible through the dedicated staff who have been essential to carrying out its statutory programs and functions. These public servants have helped CDFIs — including hundreds of community banks, credit unions, and loan funds — navigate rigorous certifications and applications, manage grants, and ensure funds reach the communities that need them most. Despite the Fund’s decades of proven success, the Trump Administration has repeatedly targeted the work of the CDFI Fund this year, delaying and even forcing reapplications for hundreds of millions of dollars in awards that community financial institutions leverage to provide financial access to consumers and small businesses. They go on to warn that firing CDFI staff would be reckless and would threaten the CDFI Fund’s core mission of expanding access to capital, especially to underserved groups and areas that have been historically and systemically shut out by traditional financial institutions.

The letter can be found in its entirety below and here.

”We write to express our deep concern at the attempt by the Trump Administration to unilaterally terminate all of the Treasury Department’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) staff as it pursues illegal “reductions in force” during the government shutdown. The CDFI Fund and the community financial institutions they serve are an essential and vital source of capital and financial services to underserved communities across the United States that traditional financial institutions historically don’t serve as well, including in urban and rural communities.

“For more than 30 years, across Republican and Democratic Administrations, the CDFI Fund has been a bipartisan success, providing grants, technical assistance, and other support to community financial institutions across the country that are certified as CDFIs. During the pandemic, Democrats and Republicans worked with the Trump Administration to ensure CDFIs could serve as a lifeline to consumers and small businesses in underserved communities across the country. For example, after the first round of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans went to preferred customers of the largest banks, Congress set aside $60 billion for CDFIs and other community lenders to help deploy PPP to truly small businesses in underserved communities. Congress subsequently worked with the Trump Administration to provide $12 billion in capital investments and grants for CDFIs and minority depository institutions (MDIs). These funds are estimated to boost lending by at least $130 billion to underserved communities over the next decade.

“Today, there are 1,376 community financial institutions certified as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that are located in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. These include 352 community banks, 444 credit unions, and 567 loan funds.6 Last year, CDFI Fund recipients financed more than 109,000 businesses, provided funding for more than 45,000 affordable homes, and originated almost $24.5 billion in loans and investments. CDFIs are vital to Main Street prosperity. Moreover, the New Markets Tax Credit program implemented by the CDFI Fund has contributed more than $81 billion in tax credit awards to projects that include investment in manufacturing facilities, educational centers, and hospitals. The sudden, inexplicable loss of this critical funding conduit could mean a decades-long recovery for impacted communities, as they seek to replace CDFI Fund dollars that are typically leveraged more than 8 times by private funding.

“Experienced, knowledgeable CDFI Fund staff support certified CDFIs, which are often very small community lenders, in completing the CDFI recertification and program award application processes. Furthermore, before the shutdown, the Trump Administration needlessly held up the delivery of hundreds of millions of dollars of previously appropriated CDFI awards, and then issued an updated application, forcing applicants to potentially adjust their application within a short period without having staff on hand to help. We ask that all applicants have a fair opportunity to access these funds. Going forward, without experienced staff being available to answer questions and help these institutions navigate the recertification process that must be completed by year-end, delays may cause investors to look to other opportunities, undermining the public private partnership that has supported so many communities gain financial access to credit.

“The CDFI Fund and CDFIs it supports have contributed for more than 30 years to addressing many difficult investment challenges that other financial institutions lack the capacity or ability to resolve. As some of us have recently noted, this reckless attempt to fire all of the public servants who administer the CDFI Fund flies in the face of what leaders of the Trump Administration have acknowledged about the importance of CDFIs. The outcry of alarm at this attempted gutting of the CDFI Fund and the show of support for the work of the CDFI Fund has been broad and bipartisan.

“While this misguided move has been rightfully challenged in court, it is imperative that you not wait to take action to rescind this unlawful attempt to undermine the CDFI Fund immediately. Doing so will help ensure that CDFIs and the communities that depend on them across the country will continue to thrive now and, in the years, to come.”",https://escobar.house.gov/images/facebook-meta-25.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 18:01:38.999228

The Democrats are pointing to a rolling contingency fund for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), saying Congress created that multibillion dollar pool for emergency situations like the current budget impasse. If the Trump administration refuses to spend the money, they say, it would violate the federal law designed to ensure that appropriated funds go where Congress intended.

“The contingency funding that we set aside for SNAP is not optional spending. It is required by the law,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters in the Capitol.

“We appropriated that money for this purpose. The White House must spend it,” she added. “And what they are doing right now, blocking these funds from going out, is illegal.”

At issue is more than $5 billion in the SNAP contingency pool, which Congress created to fund the low-income nutrition program in the event of emergencies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees SNAP, had initially said the administration is legally obligated to pay SNAP benefits in the event of a shutdown.

But last week, the department reversed course, saying the contingency fund is reserved for emergencies like natural disasters, not the current shutdown, which it blamed on Democrats. In that light, the agency said, it’s not withholding the money that would be illegal, but spending it.

“The contingency fund is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice,” the USDA said in a memo.

The cost to fund full SNAP benefits through the month of November is estimated to be almost $8 billion. Withholding the funds would affect more than 40 million low-income people, including roughly 16 million children, 8 million seniors and 1.2 million veterans.

Democrats dispute the USDA’s legal argument, saying the contingency fund is designed for situations like the shutdown. They’re invoking the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which limited the president’s powers to spend funds in ways inconsistent with Congress’s designs.

“The Trump administration has the appropriated funds, and legal authority, to fully fund SNAP in November — plain and simple,” said Rep. Angie Craig (Minn.), the senior Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. “They are refusing to follow the law. And they are cutting food assistance when there are ample funds available.”

Also on Tuesday, 25 states led by Democrats sued the Trump administration, similarly contending that it is legally obligated to spend the SNAP contingency funds.

Democrats are pointing out that the administration has recently found funding for other favored projects, including $40 billion to bail out Argentina’s flailing economy, $300 million for a new White House ballroom and $170 million for new private jets for top officials at the Homeland Security Department. If the administration wanted to fund SNAP, they contend, it would do so.

Yet, in a grotesque inversion of history, contemporary politics in the United States, particularly under the Trump administration, has perversely transformed immigration into a toxic battleground of fear, exclusion and ideological warfare. By erasing this brutal history, successive governments in the United States have perpetuated a myth of exceptionalism, even as it denies the humanity of those seeking refuge on its shores.

As schoolchildren, many of us were asked to write an essay on the theme, “What if Columbus had not discovered America?” Understandably, the very framing of this question is steeped in colonial ideology that assumes that Columbus’s landing was a historic necessity, a great leap for civilisation rather than what it actually was. Our answers, drawn from textbooks that valorised explorers and erased victims, inevitably celebrated Columbus’s courage and navigational daring. We were taught to admire the predator, never to mourn the prey.

The destruction of vibrant civilisations

But what if Columbus had not landed in the Bahamas in 1492? What if the Arawaks, the generous, peace-loving people he first encountered, had been allowed to live in peace? What if the Americas had been allowed to evolve on their own terms, with their own cultures, languages, and knowledge systems flourishing unmolested? The Iroquois Confederacy, for instance, had developed a sophisticated democratic system that inspired elements of the U.S. Constitution, though that influence is often buried or denied. These were not “primitive” societies awaiting rescue. They were civilisations with libraries, roads and astronomy, all destroyed in the name of gold and god.

From the early waves of European colonisation in the Americas and Africa to the apartheid regimes of South Africa, migration has not merely been a matter of movement. It has also been a means of conquest, expansion and domination. Settler colonial projects thrived through the forceful displacement and systematic downgrading of native populations, manifesting in overt and subtle ways through systems of oppression that are deeply ingrained in societal structures that perpetuate racial disparity and injustice. The U.S., frequently celebrated as an ideal for the “tired, poor, huddled masses”, was itself forged through the expurgation of native peoples and the abuse of enslaved labour. By denying entry to migrants, powerful nations conveniently obscure their own complicity in creating the conditions that drive people to flee.

The intricate dynamics of historical memory and its distortion are starkly illustrated in the U.S.’s approach to immigration and counter-terrorism. Let us for a moment go back to the distressing example of “Geronimo”, the code word said to have been used in the 2011 mission (“Operation Neptune Spear”) to eliminate Osama bin Laden. By appropriating the name of the legendary Apache leader, Geronimo, the U.S. military inadvertently highlighted its historical amnesia. Geronimo was a complex figure, a warrior who resisted Mexican and U.S. military forces, seeking to preserve Apache sovereignty and way of life. Labelling him a terrorist overlooks the nuances of his struggle and reduces it to simplistic binaries.

But this is no isolated misstep, for it is symptomatic of a deeper sickness in the dominant historical narrative; a narrative that begins in 1492 with the mythic arrival of Christopher Columbus. This moment is still described in textbooks, museums and mindless school rhymes as the “discovery” of America. The truth, of course, is far more brutal. Columbus did not discover a new world. He invaded one, and that invasion set in motion one of the most ferocious chapters in human history. Columbus’s arrival heralded not discovery, but genocide. The devastation was total.

What mainstream historians miss

Mainstream historians seldom dwell on the mass enslavement, the sexual violence or the cultural annihilation. To question Columbus’s legacy is to invite accusations of being “anti-American” or “revisionist”. But if revision means restoring truth to the record, then revisionism is a moral obligation. The problem is not that we remember too little; it is that we remember too selectively.

The Columbus myth, far from being a harmless fable, is the ideological blueprint for centuries of colonial expansion, white supremacy and racial capitalism. It legitimises the pillaging of the Americas, the enslavement of Africans, and the later interventions of American imperialism under the guise of spreading “freedom”. The mentality that justified the extermination of the Arawaks is the same that rationalises drone strikes today.

Fast-forward to the 21st century, and the brutal calculus of migration remains unchanged: flee war-torn Syria, economically ravaged Venezuela, or climate-ravaged sub-Saharan Africa, and you will be met with suspicion and hostility at the borders of the Global North. The Trump presidency has been a zenith of this xenophobic fervour, pathologising immigration as an existential threat to American identity. The border wall, family separations, and the Muslim ban are not just policy aberrations but ideological manifestos that codify cruelty and exclusion. These measures are not pragmatic responses to complex issues; they are declarations of war on the most vulnerable.

Moreover, the resurgence of exclusionary nationalism, a hallmark of Trump-era politics, has biased the discourse around belonging and citizenship. It designates the immigrant not as a fellow human in search of security but as an economic burden, a cultural contagion or a national security risk. What emerges, then, is a moral paradox of nations founded on violent migration and colonisation but now busy erecting moral and legal barriers to those seeking refuge.

If settler colonialism is justified under the banner of “civilising mission”, why should today’s migration be framed illegitimate? The glaring disparity between the revered pioneers of the past and the vilified migrants of today lays bare the insidious role of race, power and historical amnesia in shaping the immigration narrative.

A fundamental aspiration

Clearly, the future of immigration policy hinges on our willingness to confront the darkest chapters of our past and the brutal realities of our present. We need to excavate the buried subtexts of empire, capitalism and racial domination that continue to shape mobility, and forge a new path forward informed by historical reckoning and a commitment to human dignity. The right to seek safety, to move across borders, is not a privilege to be doled out to the few, but a fundamental human aspiration that must be recognised and protected.

To imagine, therefore, a world in which Columbus had not made landfall is not to indulge in idle fantasy, but to confront the brutal reality of a collective past. It is to consider the possibility of a world unshaped by genocide, a world where Indigenous peoples flourished on their own terms, where empires did not build their foundations on loot and plunder. The truth about history is not a matter of nicety, but a fundamental requirement for justice, accountability, and a future that does not replicate the wrongs of the past.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/opinion/op-ed/d0ue7k/article70213300.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/iStock-1321690745.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 21:57:20.733964

“Snap benefits are about to end on Saturday,” the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Fox News.","A coalition of more than two dozen states on Tuesday sued the Trump administration over its decision to suspend food stamps during the government shutdown.

The lawsuit, co-led by New York, California and Massachusetts, asks a federal judge to force the US Department of Agriculture to tap into emergency reserve funds to distribute food benefits to the nearly 42 million families and children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). The USDA has said no benefits will be issued on 1 November.

“Snap is one of our nation’s most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running,” the New York attorney general, Letitia James, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on Snap, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.”

The Democratic attorneys general and three governors argue in their lawsuit that the federal government is obliged by law to maintain food benefits to the low-income households who rely on the program. They ask for a ruling by Friday on their motion.

Snap is the nation’s largest nutrition assistance program, according to the USDA, serving roughly one in eight low-income Americans at a cost of approximately $8bn per month. The USDA’s contingency fund is estimated to contain approximately $6bn.

The expiration of Snap benefits has emerged as a major pressure point in the shutdown standoff between Democrats and Republicans. Across the country, food banks and pantries, already struggling under the sharp cuts to federal programs, were bracing for a surge of hungry people if federal food aid is paused, as state officials scrambled to keep assistance flowing to recipients.

Many congressional Democrats and Republicans had called on the Trump administration to use the reserve funding to prevent widespread hunger and financial hardship on millions of American families, but it has so far declined.

“Snap benefits are about to end on Saturday,” the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Fox News. “We don’t have the funding to cover them.”

The USDA’s food and nutrition homepage has a banner with a strikingly partisan message falsely accusing Senate Democrats of shutting down the government to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants and trans Americans. “Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the notice says. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.”

“Despite having the money to fund Snap, the Trump administration is creating needless fear, angst, and harm for millions of families and their children especially as we approach the holidays,” the Massachusetts attorney general, Andrea Joy Campbell, said in a statement. “It is past time for the Trump administration to act to help, rather than harm, those who rely on our government.”

The plaintiffs cite a memo from the agriculture department stating that contingency funds were “not legally available to cover regular benefits” during the government shutdown, which the document blamed on Democrats. The agency said it was only able to tap into the reserve funds under certain circumstances, such as natural disasters.

The memo appears to contradict the department’s lapsed funding plan, released in late September, which stated that Congress’s “evident” intent was for Snap operations to continue during a government shutdown and pointed to “multi-year contingency funds” that could be tapped in the event the closures dragged on. The plan has been removed from the department’s website.

“USDA not only has authority to use contingency funds, it has a legal duty to spend all available dollars to fund Snap benefits,” said California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, adding: “We are taking a stand because families will experience hunger and malnutrition if the Trump administration gets its way.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1410d31b94ce628203719b2082c1e3b582b3cbc/283_0_2968_2374/master/2968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=980574d5e91db41195daec1499f438e2",N,,2025-10-28 19:01:35.217554

‘No Kings’ protests were people-driven, peaceful, and potent

The “No Kings” protests show the growing depth and breadth of opposition to an imperial presidency. Although most Americans lack experience in mounting major resistance efforts against a federal government engaged in authoritarian actions or policies, they peacefully organized in all 50 states to make their demands heard, reaching even further into conservative communities. People of all ages, races, economic statuses, and other backgrounds, including veterans and religious leaders, demanded transformative change in the face of the administration’s unprecedented abuses of power; the weaponization of the military against Democratic-led cities; illegal detentions and arrests by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents; President Donald Trump’s self-enrichment and lack of accountability; and the administration’s attacks on key parts of civil society and on the president’s perceived rivals—all while Congress and the courts are largely failing to act as a sufficient check and balance.

Despite the seriousness of the moment, the “No Kings” protests were infused with positivity. Many rallygoers dressed in festive costumes, carried humorous signs, played music, danced, sang, and performed other joyful acts. To show unity, many wore yellow, the color of several nonviolent movements around the world. These tactics can create enthusiasm and are effective tools against strongman leaders.

People voiced their views despite dangerous and threatening language used by some lawmakers and officials who claimed that the “No Kings” protests would be driven by hatred of America and would include terrorist sympathizers and violence. Yet, notably, there was not one reported arrest of any “No Kings” protester nor any widespread violence, perhaps because the organizers conducted nonviolence and deescalation trainings. Protest movements stand a much greater chance of success if they are peaceful.

The 3.5 percent ‘rule’ is an instructive measurement of public sentiment

In a prior article and video, CAP explained how a relatively small number of Americans—12 million—can help stop the nation’s slide into full-scale authoritarianism. Political science research developed by professor Erica Chenoweth of Harvard University and her research partners shows that when a mere 3.5 percent of a nation’s population mobilizes in peaceful protest at a key moment, it signals a powerfully broad movement, making it nearly impossible for the government to ignore the people’s demands. The 3.5 percent rule is not a fixed formula, but rather a solid predictor based on more than 300 successful nonviolent movements around the world. In fact, most movements that succeeded did so without reaching 3.5 percent.

How Peaceful Protest by Just 3.5 Percent of Americans Could Force Major Policy Changes From the Trump Administration

Michael Sozan

As CAP has discussed, movements gain power when they sustain public participation across diverse groups that refuse to allow the government to scare or divide them. Chenoweth’s research also reveals that 3.5 percent participation indicates deeper underlying societal support from nonprotesters and a sense of inevitability, which can help accelerate defections from key pro-government pillars, including leaders from the business, political, cultural, and media sectors. The most effective mobilizations also spur defections from security and military forces who refuse illegal government orders and members of the political party in power, pillars that an imperial-minded leader relies on to entrench his control.

A Green Light for Authoritarianism: How the Trump Administration Fuels Global Autocracy

Dan Herman, Robert Benson

In the months ahead, broader mobilization could spur change

The “No Kings” protests signal that the United States may be on the brink of a sustained and ideologically broad movement to counter an imperial presidency. Next steps could involve Americans engaging in other forms of nonviolent noncooperation, like they did during the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. For example, “general strikes that affect the economy, boycotts, sit-ins, walkouts, or shutdowns of parts of cities can put unavoidable pressure on political leaders to hear their constituents and resolve the matter.”

The grassroots organizations that coordinated the “No Kings” mobilization said they are exploring options such as those described above as well as creating a rapid response network to coordinate quick peaceful pushback, encouraging people to get involved with community groups, and connecting the protests to popular policies such as reducing skyrocketing health care costs or curbing elected officials’ corruption. CAP has suggested a wide range of activities for Americans to make their voices heard, including communicating directly with their federal, state, and local elected officials; creating websites to build a public record of harms to their communities; or pooling money with neighbors to amplify messages via newspaper ads or billboards.

Conclusion

People are refusing to stay silent and instead are engaging in peaceful dissent. Town by town, they are growing a movement to demand a government whose president is not above the law. The United States has crossed the halfway mark toward the 3.5 percent threshold. If people build an expansive ideological movement that creatively flexes its power and persuades key pillars of society to join, they could help course-correct the nation onto a pro-democracy path.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-2241815439-cropped.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 16:56:54.873308

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.","MIAMI — In the streets of downtown Caracas, Venezuela, university student Mariana stood alongside her family in a sea of yellow, red and blue. She was among other Venezuelans protesting an oppressive regime controlling the country.

“Hay que estudiar, hay que estudiar, el que no estudia se parece a Nicolás,” the crowd chanted. “We must study, we must study, the ones who don’t will be like Nicolás.”

Their cries declared their disdain for dictator Nicolás Maduro.

It wasn’t long until the military intervened, sparking violence and unrest. As Mariana sought refuge, a man got out of his car and stopped her – and pointed a gun at her head.

Her shock drowned out the chaos around her. All she heard was her father screaming her name.

“We were very used to violence and guns and crime being part of the day by day in the city,” Mariana recalled, adding that the man quickly returned to his car and drove away. “It was not really that shocking.”

Four years later, while on vacation in Miami with her boyfriend, Antonio, Mariana heard something on the radio about a new immigration benefit for Venezuelans fleeing the country amid food shortages, kidnappings and repression.

The conditions, the U.S. homeland security secretary said at the time, “reveal a country in turmoil, unable to protect its own citizens.”

Mariana and her boyfriend decided to stay in the United States and restart their lives – safe from harm – through what’s known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.

Today, like hundreds of thousands of others, the couple face the unimaginable idea of having to give up that new life.

As part of the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration agenda, the Department of Homeland Security has acted to terminate TPS for recipients from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

People from Venezuela and Haiti make up the vast majority of those losing status.

In April, DHS ended TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans, which meant work permits and protection from deportation were no longer valid. On Feb. 3, TPS is set to end for nearly 350,000 Haitians.

And this Wednesday, Sept. 10, is the deadline for the designation to end for another 250,000 Venezuelans – including Mariana and Antonio – who would then have about 60 days to figure out what comes next.

Amid ongoing legal wrangling, a federal judge on Sept. 5 found the administration’s actions unlawful and blocked it from ending protections for Venezuelans and Haitians.

As the court battles go on, some beneficiaries have holed up in their homes, fearful of arrest and deportation, while others scramble to find legal alternatives – or face losing everything.

“We have people … who have been here for over 15, 20 years, who have made a life in the U.S., who have families in the U.S. – children, homes, cars, businesses that are at risk,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigration advocacy group.

“Right now, the level of fear and trauma and terror cannot be explained,” Jozef said. “It is complete chaos. It is complete terror. It is complete trauma.”

Florida is home to more TPS recipients than any other state in the country – people such as Rafael Rodriguez, a former civil engineer and college professor from Valencia, Venezuela. He has gone from servicing a major cruise liner to barely leaving his home because he now is considered deportable. He obtained TPS in 2023; without it, his life in North Miami has transformed from one of prosperity to, in his estimation, a “prison.”

Sebastian, an architect also from Valencia, left Venezuela because of government oppression and dwindling career prospects. He obtained TPS in 2024, after fleeing to North Miami. For him, it was a “lifesaver.” And the loss of the benefit, he said, is the loss of his pursuit of “the American dream.”

Since 2021, Mariana and Antonio have lived in Aventura, north of Miami. They both started careers in finance, the subject they studied together in university back in Venezuela. For the couple, looming TPS expiration has made it nearly impossible to plan for their future.

“It has given me anxiety, a lot of sadness, a feeling of injustice,” said Mariana – who, along with Antonio and Sebastian, asked that her full name not be used because of concerns it could hurt her efforts to remain in the country.

“I feel like my life is on hold.”

‘America is not perfect, but it was human’

TPS began in 1990 as a way to protect individuals fleeing armed conflict, natural disasters or other unlivable conditions in their home countries. The status provides work permits and deportation protection for up to 18 months – and can be renewed at the discretion of the U.S. homeland security secretary.

As of Sept. 30, 2024, some 1.1 million people were protected by the benefit.

To qualify, individuals must meet several conditions, pay a fee that this year went from $50 to $500, and have never been convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors. These requirements, experts say, make holders of the humanitarian benefit some of the most vetted immigrants in the country.

“They are not criminals. They are not illegal,” said Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus in Miami. “So, what is this about?”

In a January interview with Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of TPS for some Venezuelans, saying a Biden-era extension of the benefit meant “they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months, and we stopped that.”

Noem referred to Venezuelans who were in the country legally – and those of the Tren de Aragua criminal enterprise – in the same breath, saying, “We are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here and members of the TDA. … The people of this country want these dirtbags out.”

In official announcements explaining the end of TPS, the agency has said conditions in some of the countries, including Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and violence-riddled Haiti, have improved enough to be safe for beneficiaries to return.

Humanitarian organizations disagree.

“The Taliban is one of the most repressive governments in the world,” said Matthew Soerens of World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. “Until the U.S. Department of Homeland Security tried to make the argument, I’d never heard anyone suggest that Afghanistan was back to being a safe place for people to live.”

“In the case of Haiti, you’re just facing death,” said Daniel Noroña, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas. “You are facing a situation where there are no guarantees for your life or for your loved ones.”

In the case of Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in July – titled “Standing with the Venezuelan People” – in which he denounced the regime of dictator Maduro as “corrupt, criminal and illegitimate.” The DHS, though, says that “notable improvements” in the economy, public health and crime prevention “allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.”

The State Department restricts travel to and from Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan with Level 4 travel advisories – the highest issued by the agency, warning of “life-threatening risks.”

Homeland Security also argues that it is against the “national interest” of the United States to allow many of these TPS recipients to remain. But to many advocates, that’s code for something else.

“Is it just racism? Is it just xenophobia? Is it just because we are brown and Black? Is this just about making America white again?” Ferro asked. “Why (is) America becoming this absolutely unrecognizable picture of what it was?”

“America is not perfect,” she added, “but it was human. Now it’s not.”

‘There’s only so much we can do’

Often called the “Gateway of the Americas,” Miami is known for its majority foreign-born population, which gives the city a multicultural flair unmatched by most other parts of the U.S.

In the north of the city, Little Haiti serves as the heart of Haitian culture. The country’s flag lines the streets, the air smells of rich Caribbean food, and the Little Haiti Cultural Complex – a vibrant building topped with ornate steeples – sits at its center.

The city of Doral is 12 miles west. Nicknamed “Doralzuela,” the city is home to some 30,000 residents of Venezuelan descent. Store owners are more likely to greet you with “Como estas?” than “How are you?” Arepas, corn cakes stuffed with fillings, are common menu staples.

The Florida and American flags fly outside the Doral Government Center in Doral, Fla. Under the Trump administration, 350,000 Venezuelans have lost TPS – along with the work permits and protection from deportation that came with it. About 40% of Doral’s residents are from Venezuela. (Photo by Grace Berry/News21)

Today, Miami’s cultural enclaves lack the bustle that once characterized them.

In North Miami, Rodriguez, the former civil engineer and professor, hides in his home with two cats and his wife, who also lost her legal status when the Trump administration canceled a different humanitarian program. The fear of immigration raids or being stopped by police keeps their lives confined to the walls of their condominium; they leave only once a week, to buy groceries.

“You feel like the net is closing around you,” Rodriguez said, “and there is nothing you can do.”

With their work permits no longer valid, he and his wife draw from their savings to live.

If he can, Rodriguez will pursue a national interest waiver, which allows professionals who hold an advanced degree or have “exceptional” abilities to more quickly gain legal status. If that’s not possible, he and his wife will self-deport – possibly to Spain.

They are waiting to see how ongoing court challenges shake out before making a final decision; several organizations have filed lawsuits in defense of TPS recipients, and that litigation continues.

“We want to do it legally,” Rodriguez said. “But it’s very hard to hear people trying to say, ‘Oh, come here legally,’ when the system is broken.”

Sebastian, the architect, is seeking an employment-based visa, but if it isn’t approved, he said, he will self-deport. He would leave behind his uncles, cousins and friends.

“I believe the majority of the (TPS) community is doing things right – we’re not criminals,” he said. “We are trying to make our voice heard and show the American people we deserve to be here. We need to be here.”

Advocates are coming together to help TPS recipients in whatever way they can.

The Miami-based Family Action Network Movement hosted a two-day summit in June at the Little Haiti Cultural Complex. Experts provided a know-your-rights training and legal workshops to help residents navigate the fast-changing landscape.

“There’s only so much we can do from a local level, but what we’re trying to do is to stop the American dream from being the American nightmare,” Michael Joseph, a first-generation Haitian-American and the mayor of North Miami Beach, said as the summit kicked off.

Across town, in North Miami, the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center sits across the street from a Haitian restaurant. The nonprofit serves around 20,000 people each year and helps Haitian immigrants with applications for legal status.

On a rainy Tuesday, the center was filled with people waiting to speak with someone. Employees in cubicles hunched over their desks – some answering phones, others counseling clients.

Executive Director Gepsie Metellus, who came to the U.S. from Haiti when she was 12, sat in her office in a back corner. These days, she said, her organization’s work centers on helping TPS recipients figure out what to do next.

“If you have children who are U.S.-born and you don’t want to necessarily take them with you, you need a guardianship arrangement,” she said. “If you have property … let’s make sure that you have a power of attorney.”

It’s “lots of guidance, lots of counseling, lots of holding hands,” she added.

For some, the planning process involves considering self-deportation – but to where?

“We’ve had some clients suggest that they would prefer to return to the country through which they were granted some sort of status prior to coming to the United States,” Metellus said. “We’re talking Chile or Brazil.”

At the national level, two bills pending in Congress propose a pathway to legal permanent residency for TPS recipients.

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.

John De La Vega is a Miami-based immigration lawyer who counsels Venezuelan TPS recipients. Lately, his work has centered on helping his clients adjust their status to remain in the U.S.

“It’s very limited, because with a short amount of time, they have to be able to look for other options,” he said. “It’s very stressful, because they do not know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”

The first thing he asks clients is whether they have a relative who could petition on their behalf for permanent residence. For example, a U.S.-born person over the age of 21 could petition for their parent. Citizen spouses of TPS recipients may also petition for them.

If none of those options is available, De La Vega encourages his clients to apply for asylum. Some TPS recipients have already done so, but many never applied – assuming they were “safe” under Temporary Protected Status.

Though asylum can lead to permanent residency, applying also comes with risks. In addition to the multimillion-case backlog that has slowed the process, if a TPS recipient whose status has been terminated appears in court for a hearing, they could be placed in removal proceedings if asylum is denied.

Said Oscar Mendoza, an immigration attorney in Dallas: “Immigration courts become, unfortunately, a place where you can be detained.”

‘We dream of a normal life’

For the past four years, Mariana and Antonio have rebuilt their lives in the U.S. With their work permits, Mariana landed a job as an operations analyst at a wealth management firm, while Antonio found work as a retail banker dealing with personal and business accounts.

While they cherish their Venezuelan traditions – such as eating arepas almost every day for breakfast – they have adopted American customs. The couple host Thanksgiving at their apartment every year and even learned how to make a turkey.

They envision a future not unlike that of many Americans. They want to continue flourishing in their careers, get married, buy a house with a big backyard and have kids. “That’s normal life,” Mariana said. “We dream of a normal life.”

“We want to start a family, and we want to find a place where we could be stable and to have a certainty of the future,” Antonio added.

But for now, they can’t see any future beyond Sept. 10, the date their TPS is set to expire.

Mariana and Antonio spend much of their time consulting with lawyers and sifting through legal options.

“This immigration thing has taken over our entire lives,” Mariana said.

She said her company wants to support her, so she has looked into obtaining certification that allows employers to hire foreign workers to work permanently in the U.S. The couple have also explored student visas as an option.

The two recently applied for master’s programs at a university in Miami. Mariana was accepted into her program and starts classes in September. Antonio was accepted but later found out the university was unable to grant him a visa. He is now applying for asylum, despite the risks.

If their plans fail, they will move to Spain.

“I love projections – I love having everything under control,” Mariana said. “And I can’t project any type of future beyond September. … I’m just trying to navigate through it.”

This June, on a trip to New York City, Antonio proposed to Mariana while strolling through Central Park. Her engagement ring carries special significance: Engraved on the inside of the silver band is “M.A. + A.H. = K” – the couple’s initials added together to equal the symbol for a constant in mathematics.

It’s a callback to where the couple first met – in math class at university. For the two, the equation symbolizes a forever life together. As Antonio put it: “We can have ups and downs, but the constants are you and I.”

What was supposed to be one of the most exciting milestones in their lives is now shrouded in anxiety.

Mariana remembers the deep admiration she had for America as a young girl – and the poem, etched on the inside of the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal, that had always represented what she thought the country stood for.

She recited a line – “I lift my lamp beside the golden door” – then paused to think about what it had always meant to her.

“This used to be a place that welcomed people, people willing to work hard,” she said. “And I thought, ‘Of course, I’m going to make it there. The doors are going to be open.’

“That was the case for years, and now it’s not. It has made me very sad about what I thought of this country.”

Since 2021, Mariana and Antonio have lived in Aventura, north of Miami. They both started careers in finance, the subject they studied together in university back in Venezuela. For the couple, looming TPS expiration has made it nearly impossible to plan for their future.

“It has given me anxiety, a lot of sadness, a feeling of injustice,” said Mariana – who, along with Antonio and Sebastian, asked that her full name not be used because of concerns it could hurt her efforts to remain in the country.

“I feel like my life is on hold.”

‘America is not perfect, but it was human’

TPS began in 1990 as a way to protect individuals fleeing armed conflict, natural disasters or other unlivable conditions in their home countries. The status provides work permits and deportation protection for up to 18 months – and can be renewed at the discretion of the U.S. homeland security secretary.

As of Sept. 30, 2024, some 1.1 million people were protected by the benefit.

To qualify, individuals must meet several conditions, pay a fee that this year went from $50 to $500, and have never been convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors. These requirements, experts say, make holders of the humanitarian benefit some of the most vetted immigrants in the country.

“They are not criminals. They are not illegal,” said Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus in Miami. “So, what is this about?”

In a January interview with Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of TPS for some Venezuelans, saying a Biden-era extension of the benefit meant “they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months, and we stopped that.”

Noem referred to Venezuelans who were in the country legally – and those of the Tren de Aragua criminal enterprise – in the same breath, saying, “We are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here and members of the TDA. … The people of this country want these dirtbags out.”

In official announcements explaining the end of TPS, the agency has said conditions in some of the countries, including Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and violence-riddled Haiti, have improved enough to be safe for beneficiaries to return.

Humanitarian organizations disagree.

“The Taliban is one of the most repressive governments in the world,” said Matthew Soerens of World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. “Until the U.S. Department of Homeland Security tried to make the argument, I’d never heard anyone suggest that Afghanistan was back to being a safe place for people to live.”

“In the case of Haiti, you’re just facing death,” said Daniel Noroña, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas. “You are facing a situation where there are no guarantees for your life or for your loved ones.”

In the case of Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in July – titled “Standing with the Venezuelan People” – in which he denounced the regime of dictator Maduro as “corrupt, criminal and illegitimate.” The DHS, though, says that “notable improvements” in the economy, public health and crime prevention “allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.”

The State Department restricts travel to and from Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan with Level 4 travel advisories – the highest issued by the agency, warning of “life-threatening risks.”

Homeland Security also argues that it is against the “national interest” of the United States to allow many of these TPS recipients to remain. But to many advocates, that’s code for something else.

“Is it just racism? Is it just xenophobia? Is it just because we are brown and Black? Is this just about making America white again?” Ferro asked. “Why (is) America becoming this absolutely unrecognizable picture of what it was?”

“America is not perfect,” she added, “but it was human. Now it’s not.”

‘There’s only so much we can do’

Often called the “Gateway of the Americas,” Miami is known for its majority foreign-born population, which gives the city a multicultural flair unmatched by most other parts of the U.S.

In the north of the city, Little Haiti serves as the heart of Haitian culture. The country’s flag lines the streets, the air smells of rich Caribbean food, and the Little Haiti Cultural Complex – a vibrant building topped with ornate steeples – sits at its center.

The city of Doral is 12 miles west. Nicknamed “Doralzuela,” the city is home to some 30,000 residents of Venezuelan descent. Store owners are more likely to greet you with “Como estas?” than “How are you?” Arepas, corn cakes stuffed with fillings, are common menu staples.

The Florida and American flags fly outside the Doral Government Center in Doral, Fla. Under the Trump administration, 350,000 Venezuelans have lost TPS – along with the work permits and protection from deportation that came with it. About 40% of Doral’s residents are from Venezuela.

Today, Miami’s cultural enclaves lack the bustle that once characterized them.

In North Miami, Rodriguez, the former civil engineer and professor, hides in his home with two cats and his wife, who also lost her legal status when the Trump administration canceled a different humanitarian program. The fear of immigration raids or being stopped by police keeps their lives confined to the walls of their condominium; they leave only once a week, to buy groceries.

“You feel like the net is closing around you,” Rodriguez said, “and there is nothing you can do.”

With their work permits no longer valid, he and his wife draw from their savings to live.

If he can, Rodriguez will pursue a national interest waiver, which allows professionals who hold an advanced degree or have “exceptional” abilities to more quickly gain legal status. If that’s not possible, he and his wife will self-deport – possibly to Spain.

They are waiting to see how ongoing court challenges shake out before making a final decision; several organizations have filed lawsuits in defense of TPS recipients, and that litigation continues.

“We want to do it legally,” Rodriguez said. “But it’s very hard to hear people trying to say, ‘Oh, come here legally,’ when the system is broken.”

Sebastian, the architect, is seeking an employment-based visa, but if it isn’t approved, he said, he will self-deport. He would leave behind his uncles, cousins and friends.

“I believe the majority of the (TPS) community is doing things right – we’re not criminals,” he said. “We are trying to make our voice heard and show the American people we deserve to be here. We need to be here.”

Advocates are coming together to help TPS recipients in whatever way they can.

The Miami-based Family Action Network Movement hosted a two-day summit in June at the Little Haiti Cultural Complex. Experts provided a know-your-rights training and legal workshops to help residents navigate the fast-changing landscape.

“There’s only so much we can do from a local level, but what we’re trying to do is to stop the American dream from being the American nightmare,” Michael Joseph, a first-generation Haitian-American and the mayor of North Miami Beach, said as the summit kicked off.

Across town, in North Miami, the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center sits across the street from a Haitian restaurant. The nonprofit serves around 20,000 people each year and helps Haitian immigrants with applications for legal status.

On a rainy Tuesday, the center was filled with people waiting to speak with someone. Employees in cubicles hunched over their desks – some answering phones, others counseling clients.

Executive Director Gepsie Metellus, who came to the U.S. from Haiti when she was 12, sat in her office in a back corner. These days, she said, her organization’s work centers on helping TPS recipients figure out what to do next.

“If you have children who are U.S.-born and you don’t want to necessarily take them with you, you need a guardianship arrangement,” she said. “If you have property … let’s make sure that you have a power of attorney.”

It’s “lots of guidance, lots of counseling, lots of holding hands,” she added.

For some, the planning process involves considering self-deportation – but to where?

“We’ve had some clients suggest that they would prefer to return to the country through which they were granted some sort of status prior to coming to the United States,” Metellus said. “We’re talking Chile or Brazil.”

At the national level, two bills pending in Congress propose a pathway to legal permanent residency for TPS recipients.

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.

John De La Vega is a Miami-based immigration lawyer who counsels Venezuelan TPS recipients. Lately, his work has centered on helping his clients adjust their status to remain in the U.S.

“It’s very limited, because with a short amount of time, they have to be able to look for other options,” he said. “It’s very stressful, because they do not know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”

The first thing he asks clients is whether they have a relative who could petition on their behalf for permanent residence. For example, a U.S.-born person over the age of 21 could petition for their parent. Citizen spouses of TPS recipients may also petition for them.

If none of those options is available, De La Vega encourages his clients to apply for asylum. Some TPS recipients have already done so, but many never applied – assuming they were “safe” under Temporary Protected Status.

Though asylum can lead to permanent residency, applying also comes with risks. In addition to the multimillion-case backlog that has slowed the process, if a TPS recipient whose status has been terminated appears in court for a hearing, they could be placed in removal proceedings if asylum is denied.

Said Oscar Mendoza, an immigration attorney in Dallas: “Immigration courts become, unfortunately, a place where you can be detained.”

‘We dream of a normal life’

For the past four years, Mariana and Antonio have rebuilt their lives in the U.S. With their work permits, Mariana landed a job as an operations analyst at a wealth management firm, while Antonio found work as a retail banker dealing with personal and business accounts.

While they cherish their Venezuelan traditions – such as eating arepas almost every day for breakfast – they have adopted American customs. The couple host Thanksgiving at their apartment every year and even learned how to make a turkey.

They envision a future not unlike that of many Americans. They want to continue flourishing in their careers, get married, buy a house with a big backyard and have kids. “That’s normal life,” Mariana said. “We dream of a normal life.”

“We want to start a family, and we want to find a place where we could be stable and to have a certainty of the future,” Antonio added.

But for now, they can’t see any future beyond Sept. 10, the date their TPS is set to expire.

Mariana and Antonio spend much of their time consulting with lawyers and sifting through legal options.

“This immigration thing has taken over our entire lives,” Mariana said.

She said her company wants to support her, so she has looked into obtaining certification that allows employers to hire foreign workers to work permanently in the U.S. The couple have also explored student visas as an option.

The two recently applied for master’s programs at a university in Miami. Mariana was accepted into her program and starts classes in September. Antonio was accepted but later found out the university was unable to grant him a visa. He is now applying for asylum, despite the risks.

If their plans fail, they will move to Spain.

“I love projections – I love having everything under control,” Mariana said. “And I can’t project any type of future beyond September. … I’m just trying to navigate through it.”

This June, on a trip to New York City, Antonio proposed to Mariana while strolling through Central Park. Her engagement ring carries special significance: Engraved on the inside of the silver band is “M.A. + A.H. = K” – the couple’s initials added together to equal the symbol for a constant in mathematics.

It’s a callback to where the couple first met – in math class at university. For the two, the equation symbolizes a forever life together. As Antonio put it: “We can have ups and downs, but the constants are you and I.”

What was supposed to be one of the most exciting milestones in their lives is now shrouded in anxiety.

Mariana remembers the deep admiration she had for America as a young girl – and the poem, etched on the inside of the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal, that had always represented what she thought the country stood for.

She recited a line – “I lift my lamp beside the golden door” – then paused to think about what it had always meant to her.

“This used to be a place that welcomed people, people willing to work hard,” she said. “And I thought, ‘Of course, I’m going to make it there. The doors are going to be open.’

“That was the case for years, and now it’s not. It has made me very sad about what I thought of this country.”

Will it happen?

Smith has asked Congress to let him testify in public about his failed criminal prosecutions of President Donald Trump — the first stemming from Trump’s complex plot to subvert the 2020 election, the other from Trump’s decision to hoard classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after his first term ended.

House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan is mulling the offer, as is Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley; lawmakers are usually loath to let witnesses dictate the terms of their appearances, but Smith is among the biggest fish their panels are chasing, and he wouldn’t be the first special counsel to speak publicly to lawmakers about his work.

High-profile congressional hearings are often an exercise in grandstanding, speechifying and limited substantive value. And Smith may have his own limitations: He could choose to plead the 5th, in an acknowledgment of Trump’s repeated threats to prosecute him; he may be bound by grand jury secrecy from discussing key aspects of the cases; and he must first obtain permission from the Justice Department to speak freely about his work.

But in a hypothetical world in which Smith has no obstacles to testifying — and is delivered a dose of truth serum beforehand — here are the five questions we would ask to generate genuine insight about his ill-fated, historic prosecutions:

1. Did it hurt to have to share oxygen with Alvin Bragg and Fani Willis?

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s hush money prosecution of Trump in New York was widely seen as the weakest of the four criminal cases against him but had the advantage of being the first. Bragg leveled the 34-count indictment in April 2023, two months before your classified documents case.

Fani Willis’ case in Georgia, charging Trump with seeking to corrupt Georgia’s 2020 election results, came less than two weeks after you brought similar charges at the national level. Willis’ indictment was seen as scattershot and resulted in Trump’s infamous mugshot; and of course, it later fell apart over allegations that Willis had a financial conflict stemming from a romantic relationship with a top prosecutor.

Those other cases helped Trump build an argument that he was being unfairly targeted in the heat of his reelection campaign — and group the graver allegations you lodged into an overarching persecution narrative. Would it have been easier if the field had been completely clear?

Moreover, the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling — finding presidents almost entirely immune from prosecution for their official conduct — warned about the potential for dubious cases against former presidents. Do you think Bragg’s trial, which was underway at the precise moment the Supreme Court weighed the immunity question, contributed to the justices’ concerns?

2. Explain the decision to charge only Trump for election subversion and leave the other alleged co-conspirators — like Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro — unindicted.

The speculation in legal circles was that keeping the indictment focused squarely on Trump simplified the presentation of evidence, limited the ability of those alleged co-conspirators to gum up the process with disruptive motions or privilege claims and amplified the stakes of the case against him. But it also allowed them to escape potential accountability.

Why did you opt against a more sweeping indictment that included those most closely associated with Trump’s scheme to cling to power?

3. Did the Justice Department’s relatively slow start to the Trump investigation end up being fatal to your case? Would the outcome have been different if prosecutors began pursuing potential crimes by the president in the immediate aftermath of Jan. 6?

Now, there is evidence that the review of those close to Trump began much earlier than the public realizes. The Justice Department inspector general began asking about then-DOJ attorney Jeff Clark within weeks of Jan. 6, and fights over efforts to access privileged materials began in early 2022. Trump also used grand jury proceedings to fight prosecutors’ efforts to access his aides’ testimony and his Twitter account, resulting in delays of weeks or even months.

But there was still a lag at the outset of the Biden administration that allowed Trump time to regroup and position himself for the legal fight ahead. Was that a mistake by Attorney General Merrick Garland?

4. Describe your team’s view of the work of the Jan. 6 select committee. Did you view their findings as credible and did you rely on any of their analysis or simply the evidence they amassed?

The House’s Jan. 6 committee interviewed hundreds of witnesses from Trump’s White House, inner circle and political operation, helping lay out in a series of major hearings the first comprehensive history of Trump’s bid to seize a second term despite losing the 2020 election.

But the panel’s most valuable asset was its collection of transcripts and documents from witnesses like former White House counsel Pat Cipollone, former Mike Pence aide Greg Jacob and several other former White House officials who interacted with Trump in the lead up to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.

The committee had an uneasy relationship with the Justice Department prior to your appointment as special counsel. The Democratic-led panel rebuffed prosecutors’ requests for their evidence until after the committee completed its work in December 2022, even as prosecutors began building a parallel case.

How much of your case was built upon the foundation the Jan. 6 committee laid?

5. Do you think the American justice system has the capacity to prosecute a former president of the United States?

Not only did your case result in the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which all future presidents could use to shield themselves from legal consequences. But even before that, Trump had managed to stall the case for months over privilege disputes and grand jury battles that ultimately put it out of reach once he was elected.

Regardless of the cases’ merits, does the outcome show that the sheer power even former presidents can bring to bear on the legal system makes such prosecutions impossible? In other words, are presidents, as a practical matter, above the law, even after leaving office?

What'd I Miss?

— Graham Platner’s new campaign manager leaves operation after joining just days ago: Graham Platner’s campaign manager is stepping down after less than a week on the job, the latest departure on a Senate campaign that has seen several high-profile shake-ups in recent weeks as it attempts to fend off a string of controversies. The move, which was first reported by Axios, comes as the Maine Democrat has attracted a wave of criticism for troves of unearthed Reddit posts in which he endorsed political violence, downplayed concerns about sexual assault in the military and self-identified as a communist. That’s in addition to his Nazi-related tattoo.

— ‘Make American Shipbuilding Great Again’: Korea leans into shipbuilding as it woos Trump: President Donald Trump wants more ships made in America. He’s going to need foreign help. Key to this effort, which the administration sees as a national security and economic imperative, is South Korean shipbuilding giant Hanwha Ocean, which acquired the Philly Shipyard in Pennsylvania last year. It’s the linchpin of a broader strategy to counter China’s dominance in the field, which gives the People’s Republic a significant military and economic advantage over the U.S., whose shipbuilding capabilities are anemic in comparison. And shipbuilding could play a critical role in trade negotiations between the Republic of Korea and the United States.

— Trump administration is racing to deport Abrego Garcia ahead of criminal proceedings: The Trump administration is preparing to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia as soon as Friday, reversing an earlier commitment to bring him to trial on human smuggling charges federal prosecutors filed against him in June. Justice Department officials revealed the new plan Monday in a hearing convened by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who has blocked Abrego Garcia’s deportation while he attempts to stave it off for good. Abrego Garcia is in the eighth month of a fierce battle with the Trump administration that has drawn the fury of President Donald Trump himself and captured the attention of senior officials across the Trump administration.

— Another shutdown consequence: Democrats can’t visit ICE detention facilities: Federal immigration authorities say they no longer have to provide on-demand access to detention facilities for members of Congress. The reason? The government shutdown. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, who have been fighting a lawsuit brought by Democratic lawmakers over prior denied visit attempts,have informed lawmakers that they simply don’t have the staff or funding to support those visits. Lawmakers have previously been legally allowed to demand them as part of their oversight duties, which includes monitoring conditions and communicating with detainees facing deportation.

AROUND THE WORLD

FAMILY REUNION — Britain is pushing to form a Western alliance with the European Union to curb China’s dominance in the global steel market, multiple figures familiar with the talks told POLITICO.

The hope in London is that a coordinated approach could help the U.K. dodge the new tariffs Brussels plans to impose — a 50 percent duty aimed at shielding EU producers from China’s industrial overproduction.

Britain, which finds itself at the mercy of EU trade action post-Brexit, is currently seeking carve-outs from those measures.

WISH LIST — Friedrich Merz said the quiet part out loud back in May: Germany intends to build the Bundeswehr into “the strongest conventional army in Europe,” pledging to give it “all the financial resources it needs.”

Five months later, the German chancellor aims to add the hardware to that ambition, according to new internal government documents seen by POLITICO.

The sprawling 39-page list lays out €377 billion in desired buys across land, air, sea, space and cyber. The document is a planning overview of arms purchases that will be spelled out in the German military’s 2026 budget, but many are longer-term purchases for which there is no clear time frame.

PUPPET MASTERS — Nothing about the sand-colored façade of the palazzo tucked behind Milan’s Duomo cathedral suggested that inside it a team of computer engineers were building a database to gather private and damaging information about Italy’s political elite — and use it to try to control them.

The platform, called Beyond, pulled together hundreds of thousands of records from state databases — including flagged financial transactions and criminal investigations — to create detailed profiles on politicians, business leaders and other prominent figures.

Police wiretaps recorded someone they identified as Samuele Calamucci, allegedly the technical mastermind of the group, boasting that the dossiers gave them the power to “screw over all of Italy.”

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs.","WASHINGTON (CN) — Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had little to say Tuesday about reports that the Department of Homeland Security purged immigration enforcement chiefs in several U.S. cities as the Trump administration looks to supercharge its mass deportation campaign.

Both Republicans and Democrats were hesitant to weigh in on the staffing shake-up, which would see officials from U.S. Border Patrol replace the heads of Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, among other cities.

But at least one lawmaker speculated that the Homeland Security Department made the staffing changes to support what he called the White House’s “unrealistic” deportation quotas.

According to a report from the Washington Examiner, the agency last week removed five ICE field office chiefs and moved them to positions elsewhere in the country. In addition to reassigning the heads of immigration enforcement in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, the Homeland Security Department also removed ICE chiefs in Phoenix and San Diego.

The administration reportedly plans to replace most of the ousted immigration heads with senior staff from Border Patrol, though in Philadelphia, the vacant ICE role will be filled by an official from Homeland Security Investigations.

While the move to replace top ICE officials with Border Patrol — which has taken an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement under its chief, Gregory Bovino — is unprecedented, lawmakers largely claimed Tuesday that they didn’t have enough information to take a firm stance on the issue.

Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, a senior Republican member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, declined to comment to Courthouse News. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, another GOP lawmaker on the homeland security panel, said that he had seen reporting about the purges but that he didn’t “know enough” about the situation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed ignorance of the ICE leadership purge during a news conference Tuesday morning, telling Courthouse News that he had only just learned about the reports. He added that “some of these things get mis-portrayed.”

Democrats were similarly reticent to offer their thoughts. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy told Courthouse News that he had not yet been briefed and declined to offer any additional input.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a fellow Connecticut Democrat who also sits on the Homeland Security committee, posited that the staffing shake-up at ICE’s field offices was thanks to the immigration agency’s failure to meet the Trump administration’s “completely unrealistic” deportation quotas.

White House adviser Stephen Miller has long demanded that ICE arrest as many as 3,000 immigrants a day, or 1 million per year.

“This kind of executive action simply shows the moral bankruptcy of their policies,” said Blumenthal.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, did not directly respond to reports of the purge at ICE, saying instead that Americans were “understandably horrified” at the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.

“It’s our hope that, if there’s going to be a change in personnel, it’s actually to enact a more humane approach, rather than what we’ve seen in community after community in the country,” said Jeffries.

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs. The agency’s assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, told Courthouse News in a statement Tuesday that it had “no personnel changes to announce right now.”

“This is one team, one fight,” McLaughlin wrote. “President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary [Kristi] Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

A spokesperson for the Border Patrol union did not return a request for comment.

News that Border Patrol officials may be taking over for ICE in several major cities comes as Bovino on Tuesday was dressed down by a federal judge over his failure to comply with a court order blocking federal agents from deploying tear gas and other riot control weapons against protesters, journalists and other bystanders in Chicago.

The judge demanded that Bovino, who has personally participated in the federal crackdown on the Windy City and has himself deployed tear gas on demonstrators, appear before her daily to report new incidents. Bovino admitted to the court that he did not use a body-worn camera and agreed to begin wearing one.

The Trump administration has in recent weeks sent federal agents and National Guard troops into several U.S. cities, including Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.

That order came Tuesday after Bovino testified before federal Judge Sara Ellis on questions surrounding the use of chemical agents by immigration enforcement officers in the city and suburbs.

Bovino, a chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was recorded on video throwing a cannister of tear gas Thursday during a clash between agents and protesters in the Little Village neighborhood.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Bovino was struck in the head by an object prior to the recorded incident, but it still raised questions about the tactics of officers after Ellis had issued a temporary restraining order aimed at curtailing the use of chemical agents during enforcement operations.

Ellis had also issued an order that all immigration agents in Chicago wear body cameras during operations.

During Tuesday’s hearing, Ellis ordered Bovino to appear in federal court in Chicago every day at 6 p.m. to report how operations proceeded in the city and suburbs during the preceding 24 hours.

She also ordered Bovino to turn over agents’ use of force reports from September 2 forward, and to turn in body camera footage by Friday as part of that reporting.

Border Patrol officials have previously testified before Ellis that the use of chemical agents in multiple incidents was justified, alleging protesters were throwing objects at agents.

Last week, Ellis extended questioning of Bovino from two hours to five because she wanted to hear about agents’ recent use of force in the city’s Mexican enclave of Little Village. During a separate enforcement operation last week in Little Village and the adjacent suburb of Cicero, at least eight people, including four U.S. citizens, were detained before protesters gathered at the scene, local officials said.

Silva-Renteria said anxiety among holders of citizenship papers or a cherished green card, as well as those in the United States without lawful status, was growing.

“It’s very, very difficult to just see how separation is happening, the cruelty that is happening,” she said. “There’s just this fear that is happening across the board. The fear that we’re facing … it’s not only for the undocumented population.”

During a gathering of Kansas Democrats on Saturday in Wichita, Silva-Renteria said advocacy on behalf of immigrant communities might in the future be labeled subversive by the federal government and lead to legal challenges to her naturalization. She is executive director of the International Rescue Committee in Wichita.

“I think what I’m doing right now, it can be seen as me fighting against the government,” Silva-Renteria said. “It is a fear, even for someone like me who has been a naturalized citizen for more than 20 years. Before, it was never a question. I could share my story all over the place and I could feel safe. But now, I don’t.”

Silva-Renteria walked across the border from Mexico with her mother at age 10, received permanent resident status in the United States as a teenager and earned a master’s degree in social work at Wichita State University. She is a cofounder, with Wichita immigration attorney Sarah Balderas, of the Kansas Immigration Coalition. Its mission is to safeguard the dignity and well-being of immigrants statewide.

Risk of assumptions

Balderas, who teaches immigration law at Washburn University, said the political climate in regard to immigration could prompt people to insert themselves into enforcement activities by mistakenly alleging people were in the United States without legal authority.

“You see someone who is from another country speaking a different language, you can’t automatically assume they don’t have status,” she said.

She said general public knowledge of immigration law was so deficient that most people didn’t appreciate a person could hold a temporary visa, be part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program or hold permanent residency status without being proficient in English.

Reading and writing ability enters the picture in a federal regulatory sense when applying for citizenship, she said.

“There are so many misconceptions about immigration, and it’s simply because of a lack of education. Nobody talks about this stuff. We just hear what we hear in the news or we hear what we hear from friends, and it’s really complicated,” Balderas said.

She said the reality was there were millions of people in the United States who would never qualify for lawful permanent resident status, a prerequisite for applying for U.S. citizenship.

“You have a typical situation where you have mom and dad entering the country illegally together,” she said. “They came over 21 years ago because — guess what — their U.S. citizen-born kid is turning 21 and they’re like, ‘Hell, yes, our 21-year-old kid is going to apply for us.’ The problem is that they both, mom and dad, entered illegally. If each of them do not have a spouse or a parent with lawful permanent resident status or U.S. citizenship, they will never be eligible to become a lawful permanent resident.”

Politics of reform

Balderas said U.S. immigration law was designed to keep people out of the country. She said Congress, which is responsible for formation of immigration law, failed to make modest changes that could unclog the immigration system to better accommodate people in the United States without legal status who worked hard, paid taxes and avoided criminal entanglement.

She said the answer in the United States wasn’t debate about a politically fraught amnesty program.

“Everyone’s angry at President Trump. I get it. He is enforcing the immigration laws to the fullest extent possible,” Balderas said. “But we are going to be in this situation every four years if Congress doesn’t make changes in the immigration law. Politics is what’s holding these people hostage.”

U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican serving the Wichita area, has repeatedly praised the Trump administration for securing the southern border with Mexico. He said U.S. Border Patrol data indicated illegal crossing was at the lowest level since 1970s.

“President Trump promised to secure our southern border, and he has delivered on his promise,” Estes said. “In fiscal year 2025, Border Patrol captured 238,000 illegal immigrants. When Joe Biden was president, 2.2 million illegal immigrants were apprehended at the southern border.”

In September, the Trump administration reported elevated enforcement actions had led to deportation of 400,000 people and the voluntary departure of an estimated 1.6 million people from the United States.

Silva-Renteria said she worked primarily with people from Mexico, India, Vietnam, China, Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Latin American nations.

In Kansas, an estimated 116,000 people had at least one immigrant parent and 74,000 of these individuals earned the right to vote in elections.

“Something very important, especially for those that are elected officials, pay attention to the number of immigrants that now have voting rights,” Silva-Renteria said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sarah-Balderas-2-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:57:24.557943

It happened around 1 p.m. on the first floor of the Stamford Superior Court parking garage.

Video appears to show four ICE agents - three of which are wearing FBI vests - apprehending a man on the ground as he cries out for help.

The man is then lifted up off the ground and put into the backseat of a black car.

""They manhandled him trying to get him out of the car,"" witness Lizzie Eifler says. ""This poor man's face was smashed into the pavement and they would not get off of him.""

""There's not much we can do except document it, but what we're seeing is horrifying,"" Eifler says. ""As far as we know, they don't have warrants, nobody shows a badge, nothing.""

Stamford police responded to the scene to control the crowd that had built up.

Pritzker signed Senate Bill 2487 into law, amending the Illinois Human Rights Act (“IHRA”), 775 ILCS 5/7A-102. Among other reforms going into effect on January 1, 2026, the legislation fundamentally changes how the Illinois Department of Human Rights (“IDHR” or the “Department”) processes charges of discrimination.

Most notably, the law eliminates mandatory fact-finding conferences. For decades, these conferences were a hallmark of the Department’s investigative approach, giving complainants, respondents, and the agency a chance to gather information early, test the strength of claims, and sometimes even prompt informal resolution. Their removal will change how employers, employees, and practitioners must navigate discrimination charges in Illinois.

Fact-Finding Conferences Generally

A fact-finding conference is essentially an informal, investigative meeting in which the Department brings the parties together to discuss the allegations in the charge of discrimination. The investigator can question witnesses, review documentary evidence, and attempt to clarify disputed facts. While not a mediation, these conferences often create opportunities for early settlement discussions. For employers, they also offer a critical chance to gain insight into the complainant’s allegations and to present documents and testimony before the Department issues a determination.

From Mandatory to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

Prior to Senate Bill 2487, fact-finding conferences were mandatory for nearly every charge of discrimination. An employer could only avoid this requirement if the charge was dismissed early, the Director issued a determination of substantial evidence, or the parties voluntarily agreed to waive the conference in writing. Nonattendance without good cause could result in dismissal of the charge or default judgment.

With the passage of the amendment, fact-finding conferences will be optional and occur only in limited circumstances.

If both the complainant and the respondent wish to have a fact-finding conference, they must make that request in writing within ninety (90) days of the charge being filed. Importantly, agreeing to a conference also means agreeing to extend the Department’s investigative deadline by an additional 120 days, giving the Department more time to complete its review. Even if the parties do not request one, the Department still has discretion to convene a conference on its own if it believes doing so would help clarify the case or resolve factual disputes.

The procedural rules surrounding attendance remain in place. If a conference is scheduled, the parties must appear. A complainant who fails to attend without good cause risks dismissal of the charge, while an employer who fails to appear can be held in default.

Rationale Behind the Switch to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

The legislature cited efficiency and backlog reduction as central reasons for eliminating mandatory fact-finding conferences. The Department has long struggled with processing times, and fact-finding conferences have historically been resource-intensive.

The amendment also brings Illinois more in line with federal practice, where charges of discrimination are typically investigated through written position statements, document requests, and interviews.

[Read: Are Large ICE Raids Coming Back to Orange County?]

Since the summer, dozens of residents and activists have shown up to several city council meetings demanding elected officials take a stance against the immigration crackdown and launch an immigrant aid fund to support Garden Grove families impacted by the raids.

For months a majority of city council members have avoided adopting any resolution in response to the federal immigration crackdown or starting a fund to help immigrants with rent, food or utility bills like in Anaheim, Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and potentially in Fullerton.

That might change at Tuesday’s 6:30 p.m. Garden Grove City Council meeting where officials are expected to consider adopting a resolution that calls on law enforcement agencies to respect civil liberties and would create an online resource hub on the city website.

To read the resolution, click here.

Councilwoman Ariana Arestegui, who requested the resolution, said it has been an “uphill battle” to get a majority of her colleagues on the dais to respond to the immigration sweeps impacting local families.

“Garden Grove is not unique in what it’s facing, but what has been unique is that we’ve been so slow to respond to an issue that so many of our regional partners are doing their best to address,” she said in a Monday phone interview.

“We’ve had so many residents come to us since the beginning of the federal law enforcement presence in our area, and the message is resoundingly clear – our residents want us to keep them informed.”

In August, Arestegui brought forth a resolution reaffirming that local police officers do not participate in immigration enforcement and recognizing the fear felt by residents amid an increased federal law enforcement presence but a majority of her colleagues voted to table it.

[Read: Garden Grove Leaders Back Off From Responding to ICE Raids]

Arestegui said the resource hub would help provide important information to immigrant families as well as businesses owners impacted by the raids.

She also said whether Garden Grove launches a legal aid fund or rent assistance program for immigrants will be up to her colleagues on the council.

“Our community has expressed that that is an interest. My question to the other folks on my council is that an action that you are also willing to take? I cannot do this on my own, and I would need further conversations with my colleagues and my city staff to even see if that is a capability for us as a city,” Arestegui said.

Other elected officials in Orange County have called on local police to cooperate and work with federal immigration agents – a move that would violate California’s Sanctuary State law.

Garden Grove City Councilman Joe DoVinh recently received backlash for comments he made in Vietnamese on a radio show calling on police to cooperate with immigration enforcement officers and threatening to fire the police chief himself.

[Read: As Immigration Aid Expands in OC, A Westminster Official Wants Police Working With ICE]

Arestegui said no council member has the power to individually fire the police chief.

In a news release after the nationwide No King protests earlier this month, DoVinh said there has been a politicization of Trump’s policies on immigration in Garden Grove and the millions that joined the protests do not speak for all Americans.

“While we strongly support law enforcement, we also call for the Equal Protection of all immigrants, documented or not– this is basic human rights that need to be respected in a civil society like US,” reads the Oct. 19 news release

DoVinh said in an email Monday he would speak to the issue at Tuesday’s meeting.

The proposed resolution reiterates that Garden Grove police officers do not conduct immigration enforcement.

In Garden Grove, about 49% of residents or roughly 84,000 people are foreign born. Of that, about 31,000 of residents are not U.S. citizens and 53,000 are naturalized citizens, according to the census.

Over 42% of the population in Garden Grove is Asian and 37% is Latino.

According to the USC Equity Research Institute, over 210,000 people in Orange County are undocumented.

Under the proposed resolution, city staff would be directed to identify immigration aid services and programs like legal aid and know your rights information and maintain a list of them on the city’s website.

Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Santa Ana and Stanton have all launched similar informational hubs on their websites.

Staff would also be directed to create emergency preparedness packets for families impacted by the raids and city officials would commit to working with nonprofits and community organizations to identify ways to better support residents amid the immigration crackdown.

Arestegui said as immigration enforcement sweeps spread in the city, the pressure from residents on elected officials in Garden Grove to respond amplifies.

She adds she is optimistic that the majority of city council members will support her resolution this time.

“The evidence that our community needs help is becoming incontrovertible,” Arestegui said.

“To turn the other way would be irresponsible for us.”

We’re also seeing people leaving within the human resources section of the Justice Department.
Terry Gerton Right, and you mentioned that usually these folks stay, regardless of the party that’s in control of the presidency.
Terry Gerton Were the majority of these DOJ departures as a result of the DRP?
Terry Gerton And DOJ also has a pretty large responsibility for enforcing tax laws, right?","Suzanne Monyak We found that more than a third of career managers at the Justice Department have left this year since the start of the second Trump administration. This is pretty unusual, because leaders who are hired through the career process tend to stay through political administrations. They’re not political appointees. They stay, sometimes for decades even, with the government.

Terry Gerton So what kind of roles are we talking about here? Lawyers, managers, all of the above?

Suzanne Monyak A mix of both. We used a federal directory posted by the Office of Personnel Management under government transparency law that included more than 300 career leaders at the Justice Department. They include some members of the Senior Executive Service and other management positions. Some of them are lawyers, some of them are not.

Terry Gerton Are there particular sectors in the Department of Justice that were more impacted by these departures than others?

Suzanne Monyak Yes, even though it was about a third overall at least, we saw more than three quarters of, for example, the civil rights division, those managers had left during the second administration. This, I think, is a reflection of how hard of a pivot that division has taken under this administration to align with the second Trump administration’s ideological priorities.

Terry Gerton And what about immigration and environmental divisions? They seem to be pretty significantly impacted as well.

Suzanne Monyak Yes, we really saw a lot of the attrition in divisions that affected policy areas that the administration has really targeted. So the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is the component that houses the immigration courts, and the environmental division, which enforces environmental laws across the country, lost about half of its career leaders, at least.

Terry Gerton We certainly hear a lot of talk in the press and in the political cycles about the Department of Justice. But what exactly do these folks do on a day-to-day basis? Are they defending the government? Are they prosecuting? What is their day-to-day role?

Suzanne Monyak It really varies. We looked at more than 300 roles across the department. So, yes, there are attorneys who are in management roles, maybe overseeing litigators. We’re also seeing people leaving within the human resources section of the Justice Department. So it really just runs the gamut in the types of roles that they are. But what they have in common is that they were all appointed through the career process. And that’s a merits based process. And a lot of those people have many years, if not decades, of experience each.

Terry Gerton Right, and you mentioned that usually these folks stay, regardless of the party that’s in control of the presidency. So what makes this cycle of departure so unusual?

Suzanne Monyak Well, that’s exactly it. Most people, a lot of people, when they joined the federal government, that’s a career for life for them. And some of the people that I spoke to for this story, they never saw themselves leaving at this time or retiring early. They saw this as where they were going to spend the rest of their careers. And then when this administration took over, deferred resignation offers came out and some of the divisions just had to take a very different stance than they had taken in the past, and they were being asked to do work they hadn’t been asked to do in the past that really just represented a departure from the work that had been done previously. And there’s just been an environment under this administration to really push out federal workers. And I think that’s something that administration officials have been pretty open about, that they want to get deep state actors out of government, as they describe them, and they want to do a fresh start or a redirect. And so we really did see that across the Justice Department and across the government more broadly, as people took those offers, were pushed out and left.

Terry Gerton Were the majority of these DOJ departures as a result of the DRP?

Suzanne Monyak It’s hard to say exactly why everyone left. Some people will disclose why they left in post. Some people do not. Quite a few were from the deferred resignation offer, absolutely. Two of those went out this year, which allowed federal government employees to remain on paid leave through the end of the fiscal year, which ended at the end of September. But we also saw people who were fired. We saw people who left voluntarily, technically, but after being forcibly reassigned or demoted. Some people, career managers with many years of experience, were put in a task force called the Sanctuary Cities Working Group, which ended up being known as a task force that didn’t do meaningful work, at least in the view of a lot of the people there, and now has no one working there. None of the people reassigned there are still with the department.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Suzanne Monyak. She’s a reporter at Bloomberg Law. So, Suzanne, with this significant departure, a third of the Department of Justice leaders, but concentrated in some particular divisions, what happens to DOJ’s functionality and effectiveness? Like, this seems to represent a significant loss of institutional memory. How will that impact how DOJ does its work?

Suzanne Monyak That’s a great question. And I think that’s one that a lot of former officials, a concern that they raised in the interviews for this story. It’s absolutely a significant loss of expertise and institutional memory. One role that career people will really have throughout the government is that when political administrations change, you’ll see new political appointees come in. And maybe they have experience doing this work at the career level, maybe they don’t. And having a career staff already in place, knowing how things work, knowing what to do, I’m told can really sort of ease that transition as the politicals come in and out as administrations change. Certainly, I think with this amount of loss, they’re going to be doing hiring. But until those new people are in place, we are, I cannot help but imagine that there will be some compromise of functionality to the Justice Department.

Terry Gerton Well, you mentioned the expectation that they would be hiring, and yet the federal government remains under a hiring freeze across the board. Has DOJ received any exceptions for that to begin hiring to replace these folks?

Suzanne Monyak There have been exceptions made. We’ve seen hiring, for example, at the civil rights division, the one that lost more than 76% of its career managers. It also lost a number of its lower level attorneys as well. And we have already seen hiring in that division. The political leader heading it has been posting on social media, we’re hiring, we’re hiring. So we are seeing some enthusiasm from administration officials to kind of bring those people on. So yes, there have been exceptions made.

Terry Gerton We’ve been talking here about the divisions that were most significantly impacted by departures, but were there others that weren’t, so that their workload kind of continued on?

Suzanne Monyak Yes, we saw lower levels of departures in the criminal division, for example. I think that one was slightly less affected. At the civil division, whose attorneys handle a lot of the litigation against the Trump administration’s federal policies, they lost at least about a quarter of their career managers. So while we did see pretty high shares across the board, there were certainly some that were below that one third we saw overall.

Terry Gerton And DOJ also has a pretty large responsibility for enforcing tax laws, right? They have a tax division. How were they affected?

Suzanne Monyak Yes. The tax division lost at least a third of its career managers, so right around that across the board point. The national security division lost about half. And I should also mention that these are really all minimum numbers. These were departures that we were able to confirm and be sure of, but it’s likely an undercount because there are people who would still be on the website, even though they’ve left and people are leaving every day. So in between when I report the story and it publishes, we might even have had a few more departures.

Terry Gerton And so as you talk to folks either in or recently in the Department of Justice, what’s their takeaway? What does this mean for the effectiveness of the department and its future?

Suzanne Monyak I mean, I think there’s definitely a lot of concerns, both about its ability to do its work and about morale across the department. One of the appeals of working in the government is having a stable job that you can spend years and years doing. And that ideal, I think, has really been eroded under this administration. And that’s not specific to the Justice Department. We’re seeing that everywhere. And I also think there’s been a lot of concerns about politicization at the Justice Department, as we’re seeing a lot of career people leaving, people who’ve worked through multiple political administrations from both parties who, their goal is just to do their job and enforce or argue the laws as they see them, or as they’re supposed to. We see with more political people coming in, career people coming out, I think that just kind of fuels those concerns that this department might be more politicized under this administration than it has in the past.

Terry Gerton And the technicalities of the cases that the Department of Justice handles are pretty significant. So it’s not like you can just walk in from a private sector commercial firm and understand the roles of the Department of Justice, right?

Suzanne Monyak Absolutely. A lot of people at DOJ have talked about how, what they do, it is a niche expertise. It is something that you have to learn how to do that, just as you said, working at a big firm would not necessarily, you wouldn’t come in knowing exactly what to do, hitting the ground running always. And so there is something to be said for having had that experience in the government, for having argued in court for the government for years and know what you’re doing before you, say, become a manager. So, you see that really from the top down. When people lose their managers, it it affects morale at the lower levels as well.

Terry Gerton And do you think in the long run, is this likely to affect the success of the DOJ in the cases that it does bring before the courts?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Trump_Justice_Department_47916-scaled-e1743102026706.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 19:01:56.718099

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said many prejudicial comments from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other senior officials violated a local court rule and threaten Abrego Garcia’s right to a fair trial.

The judge’s warning is the latest example of Trump officials’ incendiary extrajudicial comments being used against the Department of Justice (DOJ) in high-profile criminal and civil cases.

“Government employees have made extrajudicial statements that are troubling, especially where many of them are exaggerated if not simply inaccurate,” Crenshaw wrote in an opinion Monday.

“These statements made allegations regarding Abrego’s ‘character or reputation’ and expressed government officials’ views on Abrego’s ‘guilt or innocence,’” the judge added.

Among several examples, Crenshaw highlighted Noem describing Abrego Garcia in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press release as being an “MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,” an assertion that other DHS officials repeated in other public releases.

Crenshaw also noted that Bondi made extrajudicial statements while officially announcing charges against Abrego Garcia in June.

Stopping short of issuing a gag order, Crenshaw instead instructed prosecutors to inform DOJ and DHS employees — including Bondi and Noem — of a local court rule limiting official comments on ongoing criminal cases.

The judge said despite the statements, he was confident Abrego Garcia would ultimately receive a fair trial because media coverage of the case has “gradually subsided” both nationally and in Tennessee.

Earlier this month, Crenshaw found that Abrego Garcia showed there was a “realistic likelihood” that the DOJ is vindictively prosecuting him for asserting his legal rights in his successful civil lawsuit challenging his removal to El Salvador.

The most telling statement, Crenshaw said, came from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said on Fox News in June that the government only started investigating Abrego Garcia after a judge ruled that the Trump administration did not have the authority to remove him from the U.S.

Crenshaw said Abrego Garcia was entitled to discovery against the Trump administration and a hearing in which he can present evidence on why his case should be tossed for vindictive and selective prosecution.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers moved to subpoena Blanche and other senior DOJ officials to testify at the vindictive prosecution hearing, which is set to take place next week. However, the DOJ has asked Crenshaw to quash those subpoenas.

Separately, DOJ attorneys told a U.S. district judge in Maryland that the Trump administration would seek to deport Abrego Garcia to Liberia by the end of the week — even if doing so would collapse the department’s criminal case against him in Tennessee.

Liberia is just the latest in a series of African countries the Trump administration has designated as possible destinations for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who has lived in the U.S. for years with his wife and children — all of whom are American citizens.

The litigation started shortly after a New York Times article in early 2020 highlighted the company's alleged practices involving facial recognition technology and its growing list of government and private clients. According to the lawsuit, Clearview built an extensive database of face images by scraping photos from publicly available websites and recording individuals' facial features.

The plaintiffs proceeded with claims based on statutes and the common law from Illinois, California, New York, and Virginia, with the strongest claims under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. As the case progressed, it became evident that, although Clearview was a highly valued company, it lacked the liquid assets to pay a large lump-sum settlement or even sustain its ongoing defense. Given these circumstances, the parties devised a novel settlement structure that granted class members a 23 percent stake in Clearview. This settlement stake was valued at approximately $51.75 million, based on Clearview’s January 2024 valuation of $225 million. Four triggering events could activate the payment of the settlement equity stake to the class members:

The occurrence of an initial public offering.

The occurrence of a liquidation event, such as a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of Clearview's assets.

A payment by Clearview of an amount equal to 17 percent of Clearview's recognized revenue for the period beginning on the date of final settlement approval and ending with the election of this option, which will expire on September 30, 2027. The recognized revenue will be determined according to recognized Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

The amount that the Settlement Class will receive if it elects to sell its right to receive the Settlement Stake payment.

The settlement class has the right to choose which payout event they deem most advantageous through their chosen Settlement Master. Through the settlement agreement, the Settlement Master was granted certain powers to protect the class members' interests, including the following:

The right to inspect Clearview's books and records upon providing reasonable notice.

The right to request and receive biannual interviews with Clearview's management team.

The right to receive information regarding the price and terms of any secondary sales of Clearview

The right to sell the equity stake in Clearview if deemed in the best interest of the class.

Although the Court approved the settlement, questions remain. Because of the liquidated damages provisions of the Biometric Information Privacy Act, there are concerns about whether a settlement with an indefinite fund value accurately measures damages for BIPA violations. On the surface, it may appear that equity in a company is not “liquidated damages” within the meaning of the BIPA. However, the court did not address this question. Rather, the court focused on the lack of injunctive relief provided by the settlement and the fairness of the settlement.

Recent BIPA amendments, which limited the liquidated damages available to plaintiffs, seem to have reduced the threat of significant awards that might have prompted a “Clearview-like” settlement. In any event, for parties facing potentially overwhelming damages from BIPA litigation, the Clearview settlement offers a way for plaintiffs to secure compensation while preventing defendants from being overwhelmed by significant class actions.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9985_1458.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:57:35.609767

(Source: X/DHS)

A fresh row erupted on social media after the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted an image comparing undocumented immigrants to the parasitic alien race known as “the Flood” from the popular video game series Halo. The move came just days after the White House shared its own AI-generated Halo meme featuring President Donald Trump as Master Chief, Halo's main protagonist. This angered gamers and human rights advocates alike. The post appeared early Monday morning on DHS’s official X account. The image showed Xbox’s iconic character, Master Chief, standing atop a Warthog vehicle with the Halo ring world in the background. The caption read, “Finishing this fight,” referencing the famous line from Halo 2 and the marketing slogan for Halo 3. Below it, text reading “Destroy the Flood” appeared beside a link to a recruitment page for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. The message was immediately slammed as “dehumanising” for likening immigrants to the Flood, a fictional parasitic species that infects and consumes all intelligent life in the game’s universe. Critics noted that this comparison echoed some of history’s darkest propaganda. As one commentator put it, “Comparing immigrants in the US to a parasitic alien life form… is rooted in the worst of human history.” The Halo row began on Saturday when GameStop shared a humorous post announcing the “end of console wars” after Microsoft revealed that Halo: Combat Evolved would be released on PlayStation 5 next year. The White House then replied to GameStop’s post with an AI-generated image of Trump dressed as Master Chief, captioned “Power to the Players.” GameStop later escalated the exchange by retweeting the White House’s image alongside another meme showing a bloated JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, depicted as Cortana, Master Chief’s AI companion in the game. However, the situation soured after DHS jumped into the meme war with its “Destroy the Flood” post. Social media users accused the administration of using video game imagery to promote anti-immigrant propaganda and normalise cruelty through humour. “It’s ‘the police using The Punisher logo’ levels of media illiteracy,” one user wrote on Reddit. Microsoft, which owns the Halo franchise, has not issued any official comment. One observer summed it up, “It’s a bold strategy for an agency hoping to look heroic, but it seems ICE missed the part where the good guys fight to protect all of humanity.”

Washington, D.C. – Today, Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee Ranking Member Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) demanded answers from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on why their agencies have prioritized checking off the wish lists of oil, timber, and mining companies during the ongoing Republican government shutdown while halting critical public safety, wildfire prevention, and disaster preparedness work.

The members wrote that while millions of working people face a loss of services because of “Congressional Republicans’ inability to garner the votes to open the government even when they control both houses of Congress,” the Trump administration has kept operations for oil, timber, and mining running at full speed.

The letter follows reports that, under the Trump administration’s orders, Interior and Agriculture have kept permitting offices open for drilling, mining, and logging while furloughing staff who support wildfire response, park operations, and disaster preparedness.

The lawmakers detail how the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have continued issuing new oil and gas drilling permits—more than 300 since the shutdown began—while advancing controversial mining projects such as the Ambler Road in Alaska and the Libby Mine in Montana. At the same time, the agencies have held coal lease sales, closed visitor centers, paused prescribed burns, and furloughed critical wildfire support staff.

They have cited a so-called “national energy emergency” to justify keeping fossil fuel operations running, even as they halted major renewable energy projects like Nevada’s 6.2-gigawatt solar development.

The members warn that “continuing to prioritize activities benefitting extractive industries over activities supporting the protection of life and property represents an abandonment of basic agency responsibilities and potentially violates the Antideficiency Act.” That law, they explain, “prohibits federal agencies from incurring obligations or accepting voluntary services during a lapse in appropriations except in narrowly defined emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.”

The members also raised concerns about risks to public safety, noting that the shutdown has “impeded your agencies’ ability to fight wildfire, respond to other natural disasters, and protect our national parks.”

They warned that by directing personnel to continue routine fossil fuel activities, “your agencies have expanded the emergency exception beyond its intent to cover ‘ongoing, regular functions’ of government administration,” which “GAO precedent emphasizes agencies cannot lawfully direct staff to perform in the absence of appropriations or authorization.”

The lawmakers requested documents describing which activities and services have continued during the shutdown, the criteria used to make those determinations, and all communications regarding the designation of oil, mining, and timber production from public lands as “emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.”

Why it matters: The Trump administration has put significant pressure on ICE to meet the administration's arrest and deportation goals.

Driving the news: Almost half of ICE's field office directors are being shifted out of their roles in an effort to ramp up immigration enforcement.

They will be replaced with leaders from other parts of the Department of Homeland Security, including Border Patrol, which has been assisting ICE in its operations in Los Angeles and Chicago.

Zoom in: The Washington Examiner first reported the leadership shakeup on Monday, which included removing ICE's top staff in Portland, Denver, San Diego, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

The field office directors are being reassigned, one source told Axios.

More changes in other offices around the country are expected today, one source told Axios.

There are 25 field offices across the country and as many as a dozen changes are possible.

Zoom out: Fox News reported that the leadership changes come as there's a split between Trump administration officials.

Sources told Fox that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wants broader arrest priorities, while White House border czar Tom Homan and ICE acting Director Todd Lyons prefer to prioritize arrests of undocumented people with criminal records.

But Noem's media interviews and public statements have often focused on targeting the ""worst of the worst"" and people with criminal records.

Homan has said in several interviews that ""if you're in the country illegally, you're on the table"" for arrest and deportation. One source said Lyons is also equally committed to broad enforcement.

What they're saying: ICE's deputy director Madison Sheahan told Fox News on Tuesday that there's ""not a split in leadership.""

""Sec. Noem, President Trump, Director Todd Lyons are all in lock step to be able to deliver for the American people,"" Sheahan said. ""Our job is to go out and target criminal illegal aliens... We are one team and this is one fight to deliver for the American people.

The intrigue: Replacing ICE leadership with Border Patrol is expected to increase the number of arrests in part because ICE's arrests are typically targeted.

Border Patrol has been behind more indiscriminate operations, including raids at Home Depots or other work sites.

Targeted arrests require more surveillance and planning.

Flashback: In May, roughly a week after White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller set a 3,000 arrest goal target, ICE swapped out two of its top leaders in Washington — ousting the heads of Enforcement and Removal Operations and Homeland Security Investigations.

In February, reportedly due to lagging daily arrest totals, ICE's acting director and deputy director were also both replaced.",https://images.axios.com/cQk4LRM59fcmzeIredtNtW-b_2k=/0x238:4000x2488/1366x768/2025/10/28/1761671178142.jpeg,N,,2025-10-28 13:58:01.999920

In just two days, more than 26,000 people have been forced to flee the city following intense fighting, according to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM).

IOM is dispatching emergency shelter items, including kits and tents, which are scheduled to arrive within a few days to Tawila village, a major centre in Darfur receiving displaced persons from El Fasher.

Reports of violations of international humanitarian law and abuses of human rights in El Fasher are deeply concerning, including indiscriminate attacks, targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, gender-based violence, and ethnically motivated attacks against displaced populations.

Scenes emerging from El Fasher are horrific. Thousands of families are once again displaced due to violence and forced to walk for days under the scorching sun. Mothers are carrying infants, and children are helping elderly relatives who can barely stand.

They are facing high insecurity, movement restrictions, protection risks, theft and assaults with most having nothing left: no food, no shelter, no medicine, and no certainty of where they will be safe next. People arrive in small villages around El Fasher exhausted, hungry, and terrified.

This surge in displacement is amplifying the already dire needs. Shelter, food, health care, clean water, and protection are urgently needed. IOM’s DTM programme continues to provide critical information and relevant data on needs and displacement trends to help humanitarian actors deliver evidence-based responses. Yet access remains extremely limited, and needs are rising faster than aid can reach people.

(Schrader’s resignation was reportedly prompted by the case being pursued for political reasons.)","Litigation over Kilmar Abrego Garcia continues to dog the Trump administration, which illegally sent him to El Salvador in March, then said it would never bring him back him to the U.S., then returned him to the U.S. and now has to prove that the criminal case it had waiting for him upon his return isn’t unconstitutionally vindictive. All the while, the administration is working to remove him from the country again, possibly to the West African nation of Liberia, to which he has no apparent ties.

Deportation could moot the criminal proceedings. Whether and when the administration can remove him again is the subject of separate pending litigation in Maryland.

But so long as Abrego remains in the U.S., the Trump Justice Department is stuck having to prove the Tennessee criminal case, which the government seemed to develop in an effort to save face when it finally complied with court orders for his return in June. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Abrego “has landed in the United States to face justice.” She said, “This is what American justice looks like.”

Now, remarks from Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have drawn a rebuke from the judge presiding over the criminal case, in which federal prosecutors allege that Abrego illegally transported undocumented immigrants. He has pleaded not guilty. The rebuke came Monday in one of two rulings issued by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in the Middle District of Tennessee. In granting Abrego’s motion to require DOJ and DHS officials to refrain from making “prejudicial extrajudicial statements,” Crenshaw wrote that “government employees have made extrajudicial statements that are troubling, especially where many of them are exaggerated if not simply inaccurate.”

The Barack Obama appointee highlighted statements from Bondi and Noem that he said appeared to violate a court rule prohibiting extrajudicial statements (that is, those made outside of court) that have a “substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing” the defendant’s right to a fair trial. He cited Noem’s statement that Abrego is an “MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,” and Bondi’s statement that Abrego played “a significant role in an alien smuggling ring” that “was his full-time job,” and that he “was a smuggler of humans and children and women.”

Crenshaw issued an order accompanying his ruling that puts DOJ and DHS employees “on notice” of the court rule against making such statements. He warned that any violations “may be subject to sanctions.” So unless Bondi, Noem or any other officials make it a point to test the judge’s order, nothing more may come of it.

‘Not an ordinary case’

The judge’s other order Monday gets closer to the substance of the case and how it will proceed, specifically concerning Abrego’s bid to dismiss the charges on the grounds that they’re unconstitutionally vindictive. Ahead of a hearing on the subject set for next week, Crenshaw noted that the defendant has “established a reasonable likelihood that his prosecution was motivated, at least in part, in retaliation for him exercising his constitutional rights in his Maryland immigration case.”

The judge conceded that in an “ordinary case,” the government would be right to shield documents that reveal internal motivations behind prosecutions. But he wrote that this “is not an ordinary case.”

The judge issued an order accompanying that ruling to say that he’ll review certain materials himself before deciding what exactly Abrego can use in his attempt to prove vindictiveness. Crenshaw gave the government until noon Wednesday to give him evidence including, among other things, all documents reflecting government motivations behind the charging decision, as well as documents related to Ben Schrader, the former chief of the criminal division of the Tennessee office that brought the case. (Schrader’s resignation was reportedly prompted by the case being pursued for political reasons.) In a previous filing, the DOJ said Schrader had drafted a memo detailing why he wouldn’t bring the case, but the DOJ has argued that such evidence is “not properly subject to disclosure.”

Among the officials whom Abrego wants to subpoena for the upcoming hearing is Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the government’s attempt to quash the subpoena is being litigated this week.

These motions are generally difficult for defendants to win, though, as Crenshaw observed, this isn’t an “ordinary case.” But what “American justice looks like” at the moment is the administration having to justify how it brought it in the first place.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251028-pam-bondi-abrego-garcia-zz-568555.jpg",N,,2025-10-28 14:57:41.297478

Tuesday morning, the school district sent a message to all staff and families to offer counseling services, Sluis said.","Dozens of protesters remained outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Durango on Tuesday morning, after demonstrating through the night over reports that federal agents had detained two children and their father on the way to school.

The children, ages 12 and 15, and their father were taken Monday morning by ICE agents who pulled them over near a mobile home park at the edge of town, said Enrique Orozco-Perez, executive director of Compañeros, Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.

A legal representative is working with the family on their asylum case and it remains active, Orozco-Perez said.

“Our legal representative went to the ICE office and presented the paperwork. ICE refused the paperwork and refused to give up the kids,” he said. “At a minimum, we were asking for the children and to be reunited with their mother.”

Fernando Jaramillo Solano, his 12-year-old daughter, Jana Michel Jaramillo Patiño and 15-year-old son Kewin Daniel Patiño Bustamante are asylum seekers from Colombia who have lived in Colorado for more than 18 months, Compañeros said in a letter to Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper posted on social media Tuesday morning.

None of the detained family members have a criminal record or history of non-compliance with ICE reporting requirements, the center said.

“We respectfully request that your offices contact ICE immediately to advocate for the release of Mr. Jaramillo and his two minor children while their asylum case proceeds. The family poses no flight risk and has substantial community support and housing in place,” the center said.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment when asked about the reported arrests on the phone Tuesday morning. An email with questions was not immediately returned.

About 60 to 70 demonstrators remained outside the building, at 32 Sheppard Dr., chanting “Let the kids go!” Orozco-Perez said. Orozco-Perez, who works directly with immigrant communities in Durango, is in Minneapolis for personal business, but is receiving live updates from people at the protest, he said.

“Causing good trouble,” he said. “Everything legal, everything followed by the Constitution, freedom of speech.”

About 7 a.m. Monday, Compañeros received a report that one of its members was pulled over on the side of the road by masked people wearing police vests, he said. Two people from the center’s Rapid Response Network went to the area to document ICE activity.

“They were detaining a gentleman who kept screaming in Spanish that his kids are in the back of the car. When our volunteers started asking about the kids, they were able to find out that their mother lived near there and that because of the mother’s status, she too was afraid to go over there,” Orozco-Perez said.

ICE refused to let the children go with the representatives from the resource center and instead handcuffed them and placed them inside the back of the car with their father, he said.

Protesters gathered outside the building at 11 a.m. Monday and swelled to 200, he said. People took shifts, in groups of at least 50, to keep vigil through the night.

On Monday night, a legal representative from Compañeros received a call from the children’s mother, who said she heard from one of her children saying that ICE was sending them to Texas and their father to the detention center in Aurora.

“The point is to get this as far and wide as possible, so people can see the cruelty that’s happening in real time and see that kids who are just trying to get an education, which is their their right for living in this country that’s being trampled on,” Orozco-Perez said. “We’re literally taking away kids being kids.”

Sluis did not confirm that the children attended school in the district, citing privacy concerns.

Tuesday morning, the school district sent a message to all staff and families to offer counseling services, Sluis said. The district has bilingual parent liaisons who are working with families, she said.

Perlmutter is the latest official whose firing has reached the Supreme Court.","The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to let President Trump refire the director of the U.S. Copyright Office, after a divided federal appeals court panel allowed her to remain in her post.

The Justice Department filed an emergency application at the high court Monday asking the justices to pause the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision blocking Trump’s termination of Shira Perlmutter as the case proceeds.

“This application involves another case of improper judicial interference with the President’s power to remove executive officers — here, the Register of Copyrights,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the administration’s request.

Perlmutter was fired in May after releasing a report that questioned whether companies can legally train artificial intelligence models using copyrighted materials.

As Trump sought to remove her, he also fired the Librarian of Congress, to whom Perlmutter reported, and installed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to take the helm.

Though Perlmutter lost before a district judge, the appeals panel ruled 2-1 that her firing was likely unlawful and blocked it until the court resolves the case. The majority argued that the executive branch has “no authority to punish a legislative branch official for the advice that she provides to Congress.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Justin Walker, a Trump appointee, wrote in a dissenting opinion that he would not have allowed Perlmutter to remain in her position while she challenges the legality of her removal because the Register of Copyrights exercises executive power. He noted that the Supreme Court has “repeatedly and unequivocally” stayed lower court injunctions barring Trump from firing officers exercising executive power.

The justices requested a response from Perlmutter by Nov. 10.

Sauer argued that the appeals court’s ruling marked a “startling about-face” of its previous determinations that the Library of Congress and librarian fall within the executive branch.

“As in past cases where lower courts have impaired the President’s constitutional authority to oversee executive agencies, this Court should grant a stay: the case is certworthy, the President had authority to direct respondent’s removal, the D.C. Circuit lacked equitable authority to reinstate her, and the balance of equities favors the government,” he wrote.

Perlmutter contends in the lawsuit challenging her firing that Trump had no power to fire her and Blanche was unlawfully installed, meaning he had no authority to effectuate her removal either.

She’s represented by Democracy Forward, a prolific challenger of Trump administration actions. The Hill requested comment.

Perlmutter is the latest official whose firing has reached the Supreme Court. The justices are slated to hear arguments in two such cases in coming weeks: Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter’s removal will be weighed in December, and Federal Reserve board of governors member Lisa Cook’s firing will be heard in January.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/AP24318853676620-e1761591195174.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-28 15:57:25.147166

A Muslim civil rights group said his arrest was retaliation for his criticism of Israel.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, announced on social media that Hamdi’s visa had been revoked, that he was being held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement until he could be removed. In her post, she also made unsubstantiated claims that Hamdi supported terrorism.

“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin wrote in her Sunday social media post.

Hamdi, who is based in London, had been on a speaking tour in the United States, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights advocacy group. His visitor visa was supposed to last for several months, a leader at the organization said.

The group said in a statement that Hamdi had been detained “because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide” while on his tour, and called his detention “a blatant affront to free speech.”

Hamdi had attended the organization’s annual gala on Friday night in Sacramento and was scheduled to speak at an event in Florida on Sunday night.

Hamdi is a journalist and commentator who appears on British television networks to analyze developments in the Middle East, as well as domestic U.K. politics. According to his LinkedIn page, he is the managing director and editor in chief of International Interest, which “advises on political environments across the globe.”

Hamdi appears to be the latest of several immigrants and international travelers to have a U.S. visa revoked over political speech. The Trump administration was rebuked in September by a federal judge, who ruled that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had unconstitutionally targeted noncitizens for their pro-Palestinian advocacy in order to suppress critiques of Israel and the war it has waged in Gaza for two years with backing from the U.S.

Hussam Ayloush, chief executive of CAIR’s California chapter, said he attended the Sacramento gala with Hamdi and was shocked to receive a text from him Sunday around 7 a.m. informing him that Hamdi had been stopped by federal agents who told him he had to come with them.

Ayloush visited Hamdi along with two attorneys on Monday afternoon at the Golden State Annex, an ICE detention center in McFarland, where he is being held.

“When I went inside to meet him and check on him, I felt embarrassed that my country treated him that way,” Ayloush said. “He hasn’t caused or instigated any harm to our country.”

Ayloush said Hamdi was only guilty of “being critical of what Israel is doing to Palestinians, and the complicit role the U.S. government has played.”

CAIR said that its legal team as well as attorneys from the Muslim Legal Fund of America were working toward Hamdi’s release.

The organization said Hamdi’s arrest came after pressure from right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who publicly took credit for his detention. She said on social media that ICE acted in response to her “relentless pressure.” Loomer had smeared Hamdi with anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, the organization said.

Loomer has said she successfully lobbied the U.S. government to bar Palestinian children injured by American weapons in Israel’s war from seeking medical care in the U.S. In August, the Trump administration announced it had stopped approving visitor visas for Palestinians from Gaza, including young children in need of serious medical care.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0810fa7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4928x2587+0+346/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F43%2Fae%2F6a7bc40b40059a5565a976580c43%2Fgettyimages-2187203810.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:03:11.031730

Vijandre has DACA status through May 2026 and hasn’t been charged with a crime in the United States or elsewhere, according to the filing.
Vijandre came legally to the US in 2001 at age 14 under his father’s H-4 non-immigrant visa, which expired in 2004, the filing says.
He was granted DACA status in February 2013, and it was again granted on May 3, 2024, after he reapplied.
His team alleges that his detainment is, in part, retaliation for not agreeing to work with the FBI.","A 38-year-old man who has been protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program for the past 12 years was detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this month, with the agency citing his social media posts as the reason for terminating his DACA status.

Yaa’kub Ira Vijandre, whose legal name is Jacob Ira Azurin Vijandre, is a Filipino immigrant, freelance journalist and activist in the Dallas area who was detained October 7, 2025, while leaving his home for work.

Vijandre is one of several immigrants who have been detained this year after speaking out against the war in Gaza, including students Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, and British commentator Sami Hamdi, who was detained over the weekend while on a speaking tour.

In addition to opposing the war in Gaza, Vijandre also spoke out against human rights abuses at ICE facilities and “the US government’s inhumane and illegal treatment of those it accuses of terrorism,” his attorneys said in a statement.

His detainment came a day after he recorded and participated in a local city council meeting in the Dallas suburb of Richardson, Texas, where he gave vocal support for a local community leader who was detained by ICE, according to a court filing from his legal team Monday.

His attorneys filed a habeas corpus petition Monday, arguing their client is being unlawfully detained and asking the court for his release.

Vijandre has DACA status through May 2026 and hasn’t been charged with a crime in the United States or elsewhere, according to the filing. Vijandre came legally to the US in 2001 at age 14 under his father’s H-4 non-immigrant visa, which expired in 2004, the filing says. He was granted DACA status in February 2013, and it was again granted on May 3, 2024, after he reapplied.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement shared with CNN Monday that Vijandre posted content on his social media “glorifying terrorism,” and said he supported groups such as the Holy Land Foundation, a former US-based Muslim charity where five members were convicted in a contested series of trials on charges of conspiring to support terrorism and launder money for Hamas.

Monday’s filing denies Vijandre has supported terrorism, and argues his First and Fifth amendment rights have been violated and the court should order his release and provide injunctive relief to prevent “further unlawful detention.”

Speech is “plainly protected by the First Amendment”

On the morning of October 7, Vijandre was leaving his home in Arlington, Texas, when ICE agents arrested him while at least one officer pointed a handgun at him, Monday’s filing said.

A Notice of Intent to Terminate DACA dated September 22 was sent to Vijandre and found in his mailbox several days after he was detained by ICE, according to the filing.

The notice alleges Vijandre supported “organizations and individuals who are known to engage in acts of terrorism,” which “presents public safety, national security concerns, and is a significant negative discretionary factor under the totality of the circumstances analysis,” Monday’s habeas filing said.

His legal team argues DHS is conflating supporting terrorism with Vijandre’s “opposition to U.S. foreign policy, the policies of the Israeli government, and abuse of prisoners with support for terrorism,” the filing says.

“In each of the three cases listed above, what Respondents characterize as support for terrorism actually consists of opposing perceived violation of detainee rights, including at black site prisons like Guantanamo Bay and Bagram Air Force Base,” the habeas petition says. “Equating such speech to ‘terrorism’ to justify detention would risk criminalizing a broad array of protected speech critical of U.S. government policy engaged in by citizens and non-citizens alike.”

Even if the speech did support terrorism, “such speech is plainly protected by the First Amendment,” the filing says, and the speech referenced by DHS “unquestionably fails this test regardless of whatever grounds of removability Respondents ultimately charge Mr. Vijandre in his Notice to Appear.”

Vijandre is not charged or convicted of any crime, his attorneys said.

Attempted recruitment by FBI

His detainment also comes after he was approached by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigations and asked to act as a confidential informant shortly after the Israel-Gaza conflict started in 2023, the filing says.

On or around November 30, 2023, agents approached Vijandre, indicating they wanted to recruit him as a confidential informant, and allegedly said he was “a poster child for the way you’re supposed to do it” in an apparent reference to immigration status, the filing says. He declined the offer, according to the filing.

A form called a Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien provided to Vijandre’s attorneys said that he was a “subject of interest to the [FBI’s] Dallas Join (sic) Terrorism Task Force” at an unspecified time, and the FBI initiated a review of his immigration record, the filing says.

His team alleges that his detainment is, in part, retaliation for not agreeing to work with the FBI.

Vijandre’s attorneys ring alarm bells

Attorneys representing Vijandre raised alarm bells about the implications of their client’s detainment, saying in Monday’s filing that “important democratic principles are at stake.”

This is another example in a string of cases this year in which the Trump administration is aiming to root out any immigrants it views as unpatriotic, and specifically associate those who are pro-Palestinian as being anti-American, said Marium Uddin, an attorney representing Vijandre and Legal Director of the Muslim Legal Fund of America.

They appear to target people expressing dissent, which is disturbing from a legal perspective but also “incredibly scary as a country,” she said, adding that is testing whether our legal systems will stay intact and follow decades of legal precedent.

DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Protection did not confirm or deny the personnel changes.","EXCLUSIVE — The Trump administration has begun to purge Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in offices in five major U.S. cities and fill some of those top posts with senior Border Patrol agents who will take over interior immigration enforcement in those regions, according to five sources familiar with the plans.

ICE leaders in Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and San Diego were relieved of their jobs and moved to other posts within the federal agency last Friday, the Washington Examiner has learned.

Over the weekend, the Department of Homeland Security quietly started overhauling how it carries out its mass deportation operation in hopes of netting more arrests and ratcheting up its flashy, high-profile deportation campaign. The five cities are believed to be the first of more to come across ICE’s 24 field offices nationwide, according to three officials.

One official with firsthand knowledge of the plans, who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity, said the plan goes far beyond the five cities.

“It’s a lot more,” the official said.

A total of five sources said the five field office directors had been relieved of their duties and sent to other parts of the country to work. That included Denver Field Office Director Robert Guadian.

Guadian was told over the weekend that he would be reassigned from his duties, according to an informed source who wished not to be identified for fear of losing his job. The source said that Guidien informed his staff of the development on Monday.

The DHS had plotted to fire all five field office directors but relented amid pushback from acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, who pleaded that they not be terminated.

“The administration wanted all these guys fired and Todd stepped in and said, ‘Let’s move them all to headquarters,'” the second official said. Lyons did not respond to a request for comment.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem would have the final say in personnel matters at ICE and Border Patrol. The DHS did not comment on Noem’s role in the personnel changes.

“I personally think this is being pushed by Noem and [DHS senior adviser Corey Lewandowski] because they don’t like [White House border czar Tom Homan]. I think Tom would have said, ‘No way,'” the second official said.

The decision to replace top federal employees from one agency with employees from an entirely different agency is unprecedented.

The DHS had initially dispatched Gregory Bovino, who oversees the Border Patrol’s El Centro, California, region, to help with immigration arrests in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland since the start of summer.

Bovino has become the face of the Trump administration’s crackdown on crime for his aggressive style, leading Border Patrol agents in a parade down the streets of Chicago’s business district and standing face to face with fiery rioters and protesters. He has also brought in Border Patrol agents to supplement ICE efforts.

Now, the second official explained, Bovino is not viewed as the exception to the norm, but the new standard for what is to come at ICE.

The other four officials pushed out from their posts besides Guadian were San Diego Field Office Director Patrick Divver, Phoenix Field Office Director John Cantu, Los Angeles Field Office Director Ernesto Santacruz, and Philadelphia’s acting Field Office Director Brian McShane. All five did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson from the Denver ICE office did not respond for comment as if this story’s publication.

Guidian came to Denver from Chicago, where he held the same position leading operations for Enforcement and Removal operations.

During his short tenure in Denver, he led an ICE operation in July which ended up in 243 arrests of undocumented immigrants in the Denver metro area. Of those arrested, ICE said that nine were members of violent gangs including Tren de Aragua and their crimes ranged from murder to human trafficking and drug offenses.

At the time, Guidian claimed that many of those who were detained had been previously released into the Denver metro area by the local county jails “because of Colorado’s sanctuary laws that prevent sheriffs from cooperating with ICE.”

Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration has pushed for a high level of arrests and deportations. At present, the Trump administration anticipates hitting 600,000 deportations by January 2026.

In May, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller pushed ICE to arrest 3,000 illegal immigrants per day, which would work out to more than 1 million arrests in a year.

In a heated exchange at ICE’s Washington headquarters between Miller, Noem, and ICE leadership in May, the administration officials berated ICE for not doing more to arrest illegal immigrants.

But those high figures have been impossible to achieve as ICE has simultaneously focused on arresting the “worst of the worst,” often a one-by-one process.

Now, DHS is bringing in regional chiefs and supervisors normally stationed at the nation’s borders to carry out immigration arrests inside the country. Normally, Border Patrol’s authority only extends 100 miles into the U.S. from the border, though it is not clear what jurisdiction agents have to be enforcing immigration law in cities.

In mid-October, Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks told the Washington Examiner that agents were already assisting ICE in 27 cities nationwide, far beyond the two where agents have mostly been seen this fall: Chicago and Portland.

DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Protection did not confirm or deny the personnel changes.

“While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in an email Monday.

The overhaul affects ICE field offices in at least eight cities and will replace many senior leaders with Border Patrol officials, marking an unprecedented power shift inside DHS and exposing sharp divisions over how far to go in ramping up deportations, the officials told Fox News.

The changes are being driven by competing camps inside DHS.

On one side are Border Czar Tom Homan and ICE Director Todd Lyons, who have advocated focusing on criminal aliens and those with final deportation orders.

On the other side are DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, senior adviser Corey Lewandowski and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who have pushed for a broader and more aggressive approach, targeting anyone in the US illegally to boost deportation numbers.

Two senior officials described the mood inside DHS as “tense” and “combative,” with some ICE leaders warning the new approach could erode public support and blur the line between ICE and Border Patrol operations.

“ICE started off with the worst of the worst, knowing every target they are hitting, but since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization,” one senior DHS official told Fox. “It’s getting numbers, but at what cost?”

Another senior official put it bluntly, “ICE is arresting criminal aliens. They [Border Patrol] are hitting Home Depots and car washes.”

Border Patrol agents have defended the new strategy.

“What did everyone think mass deportations meant? Only the worst?” one agent told Fox News. “Tom Homan has said it himself — anyone in the US illegally is on the table.”

The internal friction comes as deportation totals remain below targets set by the administration earlier this year. Officials told Fox News that the latest round of reassignments impacts ICE field chiefs in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Denver, Portland, Philadelphia, El Paso and New Orleans — positions expected to be filled by Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.

A separate DHS official confirmed the personnel changes, describing them as “performance-based” and designed “to move people around for the best results.”

Dive Brief:

The Iowa Department of Education and the state’s Board of Educational Examiners are being audited after U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement took former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts into custody last month for allegedly staying and working in the country illegally.

The state auditor will review the entities’ licensing and background check procedures, as well as audit Iowa’s Des Moines Public Schools, according to information shared with K-12 Dive by the state auditor’s office.

Meanwhile, the state’s largest school district announced earlier this month that it is suing JG Consulting, the search firm that Des Moines School Board tapped to help with its superintendent search in 2022-23 and facilitated the hiring of Roberts in 2023.

Dive Insight:

Roberts’ arrest by ICE on Sept. 26 is one of the most high-profile apprehensions in the K-12 sector to result from the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, which has impacted school communities nationwide and has even changed schools’ daily operations in some places like Chicago. Roberts has served in educator and school leadership positions for over two decades in the U.S., according to the Des Moines school district.

His apprehension by immigration enforcement officials raised questions about the hiring and vetting processes in place at the state and district levels.

The Iowa state department of education audit was launched after a request by state Sen. Tony Bisignano from Des Moines, who said in an Oct. 22 letter to state auditor Rob Sand that the arrest of Roberts “raise[s] serious concerns about the integrity and effectiveness of the Board’s licensing processes.

“This incident represents a glaring oversight and suggests a potential failure in either the background check protocol itself or in the implementation and review process,” said Bisignano, adding that “public trust” is on the line.

Bisignano also requested that the use of third-party contracts by the board be reviewed.

Since 2001, Roberts filed repeated green card applications, which is also known as a Permanent Resident Card, which the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services rejected, according to ICE. In 2019, he filed for employment authorization documents, which was approved with an expiration date of Dec. 18, 2020. By 2024, an immigration judge had ordered Roberts to be deported.

Des Moines Public School district said in a Sept. 30 statement that Roberts wrote he was a U.S. citizen on his I-9 employment form and that he provided a driver’s license and Social Security card as two forms of identification. His arrest also raised concerns about his qualifications, including his doctorate degree from Morgan State University in Maryland.

Following his arrest, Roberts submitted a letter of resignation to the district through his attorney, which the Des Moines School Board accepted. His license allowing him to practice as superintendent was revoked by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners in the days following his arrest.

The district maintained in an Oct. 1 statement that it was a “victim of deception” by Roberts.

The district’s lawsuit against JG Consulting claims the firm failed to properly vet Roberts in violation of their contract and was negligent when it represented Roberts as a suitable candidate for the superintendency. The district is seeking an undetermined amount of damages, including the costs of superintendent pay.

In 2023, the Des Moines school system paid Roberts a base salary of $270,000, according to district documentation.

“We’re getting calls from every single community out here in Orange County,” De Anda said.

“We had a little bit of a reprieve from ICE’s illegal activities over the last few weeks, but they have been back in force in Orange County again violating people’s constitutional rights – regardless of citizenship status under the law,” said USC professor and local immigrant advocacy volunteer Jody Vallejo.

In a Thursday phone interview, she said her volunteer colleagues at the OC Rapid Response Network – an immigrant advocacy group that tracks federal deportation efforts – are seeing people’s constitutional rights being violated by federal agents.

“They are acting in ways that are inhumane, they are violating due process rights that people have and because they are so rogue and relying on stereotypes,” Vallejo said. “They are casting these nets that ensnare legal residents and United States citizens.”

The ramp up comes after President Donald Trump’s administration began focusing deportation efforts elsewhere in the country – like Chicago and New York City.

Citizens Caught up in Car Wash Raid

Officials in Anaheim have also noticed an uptick, noting a recent raid at the Euclid Car Wash – a spot that federal agents have been to multiple times.

“Last week, Anaheim saw what appeared to be broader, roving enforcement at a restaurant and car wash by Border Patrol and other agencies, part of stepped-up enforcement throughout Orange County. Since mid-August, Anaheim has mostly seen targeted enforcement operations focused on individuals, rather than broader operations at Home Depots, car washes and other public places,” reads an Oct. 22 update on Anaheim’s city website.

Sandra De Anda, director of policy and legal strategy for the OC Rapid Response Network, said federal agents showed up to the Euclid Car Wash in West Anaheim on Oct. 16.

“One of our ICE watchers was there, she got there minutes before the enforcement began,” De Anda said, adding that the volunteer warned the car wash employees.

Bethany Anderson, who heads up Camino Immigration Services, said two citizens were caught up in the car wash raid – where she was serving as a legal observer.

“They let one of the guys go they tackled to the ground and the second guy that they tackled, they put him in a car then the other guys were trying to advocate for him, saying he’s a US citizen,” Anderson said in a Friday phone interview. “He was released about an hour later.”

Mayor Ashleigh Aitken said the city doesn’t know when deportation activities are going to happen.

“We rely on a collaboration between public safety, dedicated activists, neighborhood leaders and social media. While we have seen continuing enforcement, we have not seen a rise as compared to neighboring cities and counties. Our focus remains on helping our neighbors, with dedicated information and resources available to our residents in their time of need,” Aitken said in a Thursday text message.

Anaheim City staff provide regular updates on the website, noting a recent uptick in ICE sweeps – especially in nearby Santa Ana, where officials don’t provide daily public updates.

“We are tracking stepped-up enforcement in Santa Ana and throughout the region over the past few days. Anaheim has not seen major enforcement activity since Oct. 16,” reads the Anaheim Thursday update.

Over the summer, Anaheim City Council members voted to join a federal lawsuit – stemming out of Los Angeles – against the federal government in a case alleging that roving patrols and unwarranted stops amount to racial profiling and violate people’s constitutional rights.

“We condemn how some federal immigration enforcement has played out in our city and do not support any excessive enforcement activity that destabilizes families, neighborhoods and our economy. As of Oct. 2, Anaheim has been admitted to and has officially joined a federal lawsuit, known as Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, et al., v. Kristi Noem, et al., challenging some enforcement tactics,” reads Anaheim’s website.

Last week, Fullerton City Councilwoman Shana Charles also publicly raised concerns on how immigration enforcement is being done after a resident read the 5th Amendment’s due process protections during public comment at Tuesday’s city council meeting.

“I really appreciate that somebody took out the (U.S.) Constitution and read the 5th Amendment,” Charles said, adding that the founding fathers didn’t use the word “citizen” in due process rights.

“Just above that was Amendment number four which is also prohibiting illegal search or seizure and it explicitly says ‘no persons,” she said. “No person should be denied any of those protections and everyone should get due process no matter what.”

The Department of Homeland Security didn’t answer specific questions about roving enforcement efforts, but provided an overview of how many people have been arrested since June.

“Since June 6, 2025, ICE and CBP arrested more than 7,100 illegal aliens in the Los Angeles area,” reads an Oct. 22 email from an unnamed spokesperson. “Illegal aliens have a choice: they can either leave now voluntarily and receive a $1,000 or they can arrested, detained, and removed without the ability to return the right legal way.”

Are Policy Shifts Creating Undocumented Immigrants?

Anderson – who heads up Camino Immigration Services – said shifts in federal immigration policies are making people undocumented.

“There is an intentional dismantling of the immigration legal system,” Anderson said. “They’re creating undocumented immigrants, they’re creating people without status.”

Anderson also noted federal officials are revoking people’s temporary protected status and putting them in deportation proceedings.

“It’s not criminals, it’s the most vulnerable of the immigrant population that are being made undocumented. Immigration has their information because they’re applying, they’re trying to do it the right way and they’re being targeted,” she said.

De Anda and Vallejo also echoed what Anderson said, adding it’s not just the Latino community that’s being impacted.

“We’re getting calls from every single community out here in Orange County,” De Anda said.

“Last night we had two Vietnamese families join our community space – both of their loved ones got taken at their ICE check-in and actually my friend’s dad just got taken at his ICE check-in, he’s Vietnamese too,” De Anda said in a Oct. 23 phone interview.

Vallejo said the deportation efforts are impacting all immigrants.

“This is an issue that touches a broad swath of our community. ICE is publicly targeting Latinos, but there’s constant actions against Middle Eastern immigrants in Orange County, Asian immigrants in Orange county, Black immigrants – they’re not as public as the attacks on Latinos,” she said.

Vallejo said the situation is going to have a lasting impact on various communities.

“We are a county with a diverse set of immigrants and these kinds of effects ripple within communities and across generations.”

Margaret Croke has drawn ire online for an email sharing details about ICE vehicles.

Recent posts by right-wing accounts including Libs of TikTok and Donald Trump For President on Facebook have called on the U.S. Department of Justice to review an email they say was sent by comptroller candidate Croke to ""dox"" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch

A screenshot of the email sent by Croke, D-Chicago, to constituents on Oct. 24 includes a ""List of ICE Vehicles Seen Today,"" including car makes, models and blacked out license plate numbers.

The screenshot also lists contact information for reporting ICE activity and connecting with other resources through the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights hotline.

""Just as we have witnessed in neighborhoods across our city, ICE is conducting their unlawful and undemocratic actions in the 12th House district, including the very block I reside on,"" the screenshot reads.

It further encouraged people to record ICE detentions or use of force, as well as to run errands on behalf of individuals who are afraid to leave their homes due to ICE presence.

Capitol News Illinois confirmed that the email came from Croke's office. A post on Croke's Instagram shared some of the same language regarding ICE activity, hotlines and ""Know Your Rights"" resources but without the list of vehicles.

""I'm just doing what I think is right for my district,"" Croke said in an interview with Capitol News Illinois. ""I'm always going to keep fighting for my district. I'm always going to make sure that I'm doing the right thing, and I believe I'm on the right side of history.""

Another state legislator, Rep. Hoan Huynh, D-Chicago, recently said U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents pulled a gun on him after acting on a tip about ICE activity in Chicago's Northwest Side.

Huynh said he was in the area to educate residents about their rights. He said agents immediately surrounded and harassed him. One of the agents pointed a gun at him, he said, though it was not caught on the cellphone footage he shared.

According to the Illinois Civil Liability for Doxing Act, doxing refers to intentionally publishing another person's personally identifiable information without consent and with the intent to harm or harass with reckless disregard for the person's safety.

Publishing information to report conduct ""reasonably believed to be unlawful"" is not considered doxing under the law.

Croke's office sent the email out after recent actions by Gov. JB Pritzker and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias to create official channels for the public to report and document ICE activity they say is unlawful.

Recording government officials when they are performing their duties in public is protected by the First Amendment, according to Edwin Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at the ACLU of Illinois. Attempts to criminalize such expression, Yohnka said, raise serious constitutional concerns.

""Government accountability is a cornerstone of democracy,"" Yohnka said. ""Photographs and videos - including those capturing license plates or identifying details of federal agents - can be vital tools for transparency and for families trying to locate detained loved ones.""

Posts online sharing the screenshot claimed that the Department of Homeland Security had referred the case to the DOJ for review, citing DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a post on X.

""Heinous. We will prosecute those who dox ICE law enforcement to the fullest extent of the law - State Rep Croke is no exception,"" says the quote attributed to McLaughlin.

DHS confirmed the statement was made by McLaughlin. Anthony Coley, who heads DOJ's Office of Public Affairs, says the Department is tracking cases such as this and issued a warning to public officials involved.

""The Department is actively tracking these targeted assaults against our law enforcement and will hold offenders accountable to the fullest extent of the law,"" Coley said. ""Any official encouraging reckless behavior should think twice before inciting further violence and putting federal agents in harm's way.""

License plate hotline

The calls for charges against Croke came the same week as Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias said federal agents may be subject to legal penalties for modifying and hiding state-issued license plates.

Giannoulias called on the public to help identify potential violations by making reports to a new ""Plate Watch Hotline.""

The move follows public accounts and past reporting that federal immigration agents have been driving unmarked cars and vehicles without proper license plates.

""Swapping out Illinois license plates on Illinois registered vehicles is illegal,"" Giannoulias said in a video posted to YouTube. ""As secretary of state, I have zero tolerance for this type of illegal activity.""

With the exception of motorcycles, trailers and some trucks, Illinois law requires all licensed vehicles to display two plates, on the front and back of the vehicle.

Giannoulias said his office was actively investigating alleged violations, including a video circulated on social media that appears to show an ICE officer saying, ""You can record all you want. We change the plates out every day.""

Penalties for putting a license plate on a vehicle other than the one to which it was issued, obscuring or otherwise modifying plates include fines or potential jail time, according to a news release issued with the hotline announcement video.

The office also said it has the authority to suspend or revoke the vehicles' license plates.

""Flipping license plates or altering them in any way to avoid detection is strictly prohibited in Illinois,"" Giannoulias said. ""No one, including a federal agent, is above the law.""

Individuals seeking to make reports of license plate violations can contact the Secretary of State's Plate Watch Hotline at (312) 814-1730 or email platewatch@ilsos.gov.

ICE accountability actions

The day after Giannoulias' announcement, Pritzker signed an executive order forming a commission to document and investigate misconduct by federal agents.

State officials argue these steps are necessary to hold federal agents accountable after U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and ICE officials told U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis earlier this month that no agents had been disciplined for use of force while applying aggressive crowd control tactics on protesters.

Ellis extended a temporary restraining order earlier this month prohibiting immigration agents from using those tactics, including the use of chemical irritants, until Nov. 6.

A group of journalists and activists that sought the restraining order filed a notice to Ellis on Oct. 23 accusing Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino of violating the restraining order.

The notice alleges that Bovino that morning threw a tear gas canister ""without justification"" at protesters in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood. The filing cites video footage of the incident livestreamed on Facebook.

A federal judge last week ordered Bovino to testify in person about the incident in federal court on Tuesday.

In an interview with CBS News, Bovino defended the use of force at the Broadview facility, accusing protesters of attacking federal agents and calling agents' actions ""exemplary.""

""If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them,"" Bovino said. ""Don't protest and don't trespass.""

The lawsuit filed this month accuses Immigration and Customs Enforcement of breaking federal laws and policies that are intended to protect crime victims.
That includes people applying for visas that are available to crime victims who cooperate with law enforcement.
Now, ICE is routinely arresting, jailing and deporting people under a “blind removal policy” — without first considering the validity of their requests for protected status as a crime victim, the lawsuit says.
“It is a policy of arrest first, ask questions later,” said Rebecca Brown, an attorney who helped file the lawsuit through the nonprofit Public Counsel.","A former Milwaukee teacher’s aide is among the people suing over a change in federal immigration policy.

The lawsuit filed this month accuses Immigration and Customs Enforcement of breaking federal laws and policies that are intended to protect crime victims.

For years, ICE has generally refrained from deporting people with certain types of pending applications for legal status. That includes people applying for visas that are available to crime victims who cooperate with law enforcement.

But, according to the lawsuit, that changed under a 2025 policy.

Now, ICE is routinely arresting, jailing and deporting people under a “blind removal policy” — without first considering the validity of their requests for protected status as a crime victim, the lawsuit says.

“It is a policy of arrest first, ask questions later,” said Rebecca Brown, an attorney who helped file the lawsuit through the nonprofit Public Counsel. “In some cases, the government is sending these survivors straight back into the hands of their abusers.”

ICE is also deporting and detaining crime victims who have been granted formal legal permission to remain temporarily in the U.S through what’s known as “deferred action,” according to the lawsuit. In doing so, ICE has been “treating its enforcement actions as a de facto revocation of deferred action status without prior notice or opportunity to be heard,” the lawsuit says.

Those policy shifts are making everyone less safe, said Erika Cervantes, an attorney with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law.

The center is one of the groups that filed that lawsuit in a California U.S. district court.

“Folks don’t want to speak to police anymore, and there’s no trust in the criminal justice system,” Cervantes told WPR. “The consequence of that is that there’s going to be more unreported crime.”

According to the lawsuit, the changes are affecting people who self-petition for visas under a process established from the federal Violence Against Women Act. That avenue allows domestic abuse survivors to apply for visas on their own in lieu of having to rely on an abusive family member who is a U.S. citizen.

It’s also affecting people applying for T-visas, which are available to victims of human trafficking, and for U-visas, which are intended for victims of serious crimes, including domestic violence and sexual assault.

The groups filing the lawsuit are asking for class action status, arguing that the new policy has harmed “tens of thousands” of people.

One of the plaintiffs is 38-year-old Yessenia Ruano. She crossed the southern border in 2011 to flee violence in her native El Salvador, the lawsuit says. During that journey, the lawsuit says she became a victim of trafficking.

After being detained by Border Patrol, Ruano applied for legal protection and passed a “credible fear” interview, indicating that she had a legitimate fear of violence or persecution if she were forced to return to her home country, according to the lawsuit.

“She was released and placed into immigration court proceedings on a non-detained immigration court docket, which moves extremely slowly,” the lawsuit says. “Over the next fourteen years, Ms. Ruano attended all immigration court hearings and ICE check-ins.”

While she was in the U.S., Ruano married and had a pair of twin daughters. Ruano also worked at Academia de Lenguaje y Bellas Artes, a bilingual school in Milwaukee.

In 2023, an immigration court dismissed Ruano’s application for what’s known as “withholding of removal.” That prompted Ruano to hire new legal counsel and to apply for a T-visa as a trafficking victim.

Earlier this year, Ruano got a notice of deportation informing her she had to leave the country.

Her attorney requested an emergency stay, arguing that Ruano should be allowed to remain in the U.S. while her T-visa application was being considered. ICE denied that request.

In June, Ruano boarded a plane to El Salvador, with her 10-year-old daughters by her side.

“Ultimately, Yessenia decided to self-deport with her daughters rather than put them through the trauma of seeing her arrested and imprisoned,” the lawsuit says. “For weeks, they cried constantly. They remain in El Salvador at significant risk of harm.”

Along with breaking federal laws and directives, the lawsuit accuses immigration enforcement of violating constitutional rights to due process and to protection against unreasonable seizure.

In an email to WPR, a federal official disputed those allegations. The lawsuit names Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and ICE as defendants.

“This is yet another clickbait headline,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Every illegal alien ICE removes has had due process and has a final order of removal—meaning they have no legal right to be in the country.”",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2014/03/courtroom-scales-jury.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 11:59:49.484018

The administration has grown increasingly frustrated with ICE’s failure to meet White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller’s target of 3,000 arrests of undocumented migrants per day, The New York Times reports.

The latest figures available, compiled prior to the government shutdown, recorded an average arrest rate of 1,178 per day in September, well below Miller’s expectations.

The development came as California Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal took to X to announce the latest death of a detainee in ICE custody, placing further pressure on the much-criticized immigration enforcement agency.

“That is 22 immigrants who have died in custody since Trump came to office,” the congresswoman wrote. “This is beyond outrageous. ICE is responsible for the well-being of people in immigration detention and it is failing miserably.”

The Trump administration’s decision to swap out ICE field directors with replacements from Customs and Border Patrol was inspired by the president’s top aides being impressed by the latter’s “more aggressive tactics to secure arrests,” NBC reports, “such as rappelling into apartment buildings from Black Hawk helicopters and jumping out of rental trucks in Home Depot parking lots.”

“The mentality is CBP does what they’re told, and the administration thinks ICE isn’t getting the job done,” a DHS official told NBC. “So CBP will do it.”

The network reports that the White House has signed off on a list of at least a dozen directors of ICE field offices it intends to remove imminently, half of whom would be replaced by CBP personnel.

Given that there are only 25 ICE field offices across the U.S., the substitutions would mean almost half of its leadership being benched.

The list of replacements, who have not been named, was reportedly drawn up by DHS adviser Corey Lewandowski and CBP chief Greg Bovino, who has overseen his agents’ operations in Los Angeles and Chicago.

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin did not address Rep. Jayapal’s concern about the treatment of detainees but told The Independent: “This is one team, one fight. President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary [Kristi] Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.

“Stephen Miller, Tom Homan, Todd Lyons, Gregory Bovino, Corey Lewandowski, and Madison Sheahan are patriots who wake up every day to make this country and its people safer... We have no personnel changes to announce right now but we remain laser focused on RESULTS and we will deliver.”

The reported dissatisfaction with ICE comes after it was revealed that the agency had spent $70 million on weapons in the first nine months of Trump’s second term, a 700 percent increase on the amount spent in Joe Biden’s final year in office, as its role has dramatically increased to help deliver the “largest mass deportation program in history” as the president promised on the campaign trail.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/28/9/22/GettyImages-2243636496.jpg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-28 13:03:28.842821

The death of Josué Castro Rivera follows recent incidents in which three other immigrants in Chicago and California were killed during immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration’s crackdown.

Castro Rivera was headed to a gardening job Thursday when his vehicle was pulled over by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, brother Henry Castro said.

Agents tried to detain Castro Rivera and the three other passengers, and he fled on foot, tried to cross Interstate 264 in Norfolk and was fatally struck, according to state and federal authorities.

Castro Rivera came to the United States four years ago and was working to send money to family in Honduras, according to his brother.

“He had a very good heart,” Castro said Sunday.

The Department of Homeland Security said Castro Rivera’s vehicle was stopped by ICE as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based” operation and passengers were detained for allegedly living in the country without legal permission.

DHS said in a statement that Castro Rivera “resisted heavily and fled” and died after a passing vehicle struck him. DHS officials did not respond Sunday to requests for further comment.

Virginia State Police said officers responded to a report of a vehicle-pedestrian crash around 11 a.m. Thursday on eastbound I-264 at the Military Highway interchange. Police said Rivera was hit by a 2002 Ford pickup and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The crash remains under investigation.

Federal authorities and state police gave his first name as Jose, but family members said it was Josué. DHS and state police did not explain the discrepancy.

Castro called his brother’s death an injustice and said he is raising money to transport the body back to Honduras for funeral.

“He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him,” Castro said.

DHS blamed Castro Rivera’s death on “a direct result of every politician, activist and reporter who continue to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission and ways to avoid detention.”

Similar deaths amid immigration operations elsewhere have triggered protests, lawsuits and calls for investigation amid claims that the Trump administration’s initial accounts are misleading.

Last month in suburban Chicago, federal immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican man during a traffic stop. DHS initially said a federal officer was “seriously injured,” but police body camera video showed the federal officer walking around and describing his own injuries as “ nothing major.”

In July a farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic ICE raid at a California cannabis facility died of his injuries. And in August a man ran away from federal agents onto a freeway in the same state and was fatally struck by a vehicle.

Melissa's life-threatening winds and rain hit Jamaica

Hurricane Melissa approached Jamaica as a powerful Category 5 storm as forecasters warned it would cause catastrophic flash flooding, life-threatening landslides and extremely strong winds across the Caribbean. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami warned people in Jamaica to go to shelters and stay there during the storm.

Melissa is set to make landfall in Jamaica this morning, before moving across southeastern Cuba tonight as a Category 3 storm and across the southeastern Bahamas tomorrow.

Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned residents to take the storm seriously, particularly young people who may be unaware of what a strong hurricane can do.

The most powerful storm to hit the region since Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, Melissa will bring between 15 and 30 inches — and potentially up to 40 inches — of rain to Jamaica, as well as extreme winds, extensive infrastructure damage and life-threatening storm surge along its southern coast, the hurricane center said.

It's the third Category 5 storm of the 2025 season. The last time a single storm season saw more than two storms of this strength was 20 years ago.

Freddie Freeman (again) enters World Series lore

One year after hitting the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history, Freddie Freeman came through again for the Dodgers with a hit for the ages.

Freeman’s solo home run in the 18th inning against the Toronto Blue Jays ended a game tied for the longest in World Series history, propelling Los Angeles to a 6-5 win and a 2-1 series lead.

While Freeman deserves credit for the decisive blow, his teammate Shohei Ohtani was equally crucial in the victory for the defending champions. The Japanese superstar hit two home runs and two doubles early in the game — and then was intentionally walked four straight times by the Blue Jays, who preferred to face Mookie Betts and Freeman than Ohtani’s hot bat.

Border Patrol officials to lead a more aggressive migrant crackdown

The Trump administration is planning to replace some regional leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement with Border Patrol officials in an attempt to intensify its mass deportation effort amid growing frustration with the pace of daily arrests, according to two Homeland Security Department officials, one former DHS official and one federal law enforcement official.

President Donald Trump's top aides have welcomed Border Patrol’s more aggressive tactics to secure arrests, such as rappelling into apartment buildings from Black Hawk helicopters and jumping out of rental trucks in Home Depot parking lots, as they've become disappointed with ICE, the officials said.

The White House has signed off on a list of at least a dozen directors of ICE field officers who are set to be reassigned in coming days, the sources said. They said that at least half of them would be replaced with Border Patrol officials. ICE has 25 field offices around the country, so the move could replace nearly half of the agency’s leaders.

Messi doesn't rule out 2026 World Cup

Lionel Messi is hopeful he'll be playing for Argentina to help defend the World Cup when soccer's biggest event comes to North America next summer. Speaking with NBC News' Tom Llamas, Messi said he will see how his body feels next year before choosing whether to play.

Messi has been playing professionally since 2004. He debuted in La Liga with Barcelona at just 17 years old, becoming, at the time, the youngest player to play for the Spanish club. In 2021, Messi left Barcelona in the wake of the club's financial issues, moving to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain. After two years with PSG, Messi brought his talents to the United States, signing with MLS' Inter Miami.

While he enjoyed a decorated individual and club career, international success eluded Messi until the 2022 World Cup, when Argentina defeated France 4-2 on penalties to win the final. Messi won his second Golden Ball and was voted the tournament's best player. The World Cup victory was Argentina's first since 1986. Messi has appeared in 195 matches for his country since 2005, scoring 114 goals.

The administration’s newest emergency appeal to the high court was filed a month and a half after a federal appeals court in Washington held that the official, Shira Perlmutter, could not be unilaterally fired.

Nearly four weeks ago, the full District of Columbia circuit court of appeals refused to reconsider that ruling.

The case is the latest that relates to Donald Trump’s authority to install his own people at the head of federal agencies. The supreme court has largely allowed Trump to fire officials, even as court challenges proceed.

But this case concerns an office that is within the Library of Congress. Perlmutter is the register of copyrights and also advises Congress on copyright issues.

Solicitor general D John Sauer wrote in his filing on Monday that despite the ties to Congress, the register “wields executive power” in regulating copyrights.

Perlmutter claims Trump fired her in May because he disapproved of advice she gave to Congress in a report related to artificial intelligence. Perlmutter had received an email from the White House notifying her that “your position as the Register of Copyrights and Director at the US Copyright Office is terminated effective immediately”, her office said.

A divided appellate panel ruled that Perlmutter could keep her job while the case moves forward.

“The executive’s alleged blatant interference with the work of a legislative branch official, as she performs statutorily authorized duties to advise Congress, strikes us as a violation of the separation of powers that is significantly different in kind and in degree from the cases that have come before,” Judge Florence Pan wrote for the appeals court. Judge J Michelle Childs joined the opinion. Democratic president Joe Biden appointed both judges to the appeals court.

Judge Justin Walker, a Trump appointee, wrote in dissent that Perlmutter “exercises executive power in a host of ways”.

It comes as the government is falling well short of its targets on immigration. Earlier this year, Stephen Miller – Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff – set ICE a target of arresting 3,000 people every day. But as of late September, the agency on average was arresting 1,178 daily, NBC reported.

The New York Times reported that the proposed changes stem from the White House becoming frustrated at the pace of deportations, which currently lags behind Trump’s goal of removing 1 million immigrants in his first year in office.

Under the plan, employers must apply online through the Ministry of Labor, submitting documentation for approval to hire Afghan nationals in physically demanding or hazardous jobs.

The Donald Trump administration has begun removing senior US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials as his top aides push for faster deportations, according to reports from NBC News and Fox News.

NBC News reported on Monday that the administration “is planning to replace some regional leaders” at ICE with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials, while Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin said US social media company X that the shake-up is already “underway.”

Two Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials told NBC that the White House has grown increasingly satisfied with CBP’s aggressive enforcement tactics, citing examples such as agents “rappelling into apartment buildings from Black Hawk helicopters and jumping out of rental trucks in Home Depot parking lots.”

“The mentality is CBP does what they’re told, and the administration thinks ICE isn’t getting the job done,” one DHS official said. “So CBP will do it.”

Melugin reported that ICE field office directors in at least eight major cities — including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and New Orleans — are being replaced. He said there is “significant friction in Homeland Security as to how to best to achieve more deportations.”

A Border Patrol agent quoted by Melugin defended the tougher approach: “What did everyone think mass deportations meant? Only the worst? (US border czar) Tom Homan has said it himself, anyone in the US illegally is on the table.”

Both outlets noted that DHS special employee Corey Lewandowski, a close ally of Secretary Kristi Noem, is helping lead the effort.

Oregon and Portland asserted in a letter to the panel last week that the Trump administration greatly misrepresented how many FPS officers it sent.
They said evidence obtained in discovery indicated that the number of FPS officers in Portland never surpassed 31 at any time.
Bernie said the discrepancies should not influence the panel’s ruling upholding Trump’s deployment because the number of FPS officers in Portland didn’t form the basis of its decision.
The panel’s expansive ruling, which alarmed several legal experts, stayed a district court order blocking Trump’s deployment.","The Department of Justice (DOJ) Monday corrected a key piece of evidence it repeatedly cited in defense of President Donald Trump’s attempted military deployment in Portland, Oregon, last month.

In a letter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Andrew Bernie, a DOJ attorney, said the Trump administration made several “errors” in describing how many special law enforcement officers it sent to Portland in response to protests outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the city.

The disclosure, which came in Portland and Oregon’s lawsuit against the deployment, marks a rare walkback from the DOJ that may damage its legal defense of Trump’s military intervention in the City of Roses.

Attempting to prove that Trump had the authority to send troops into the city, government officials claimed 115 Federal Protection Service (FPS) officers were ordered to the city between June and September. The number represented nearly a “quarter” of the whole FPS force that protects federal facilities and employees, the government claimed in court filings.

In oral arguments and court filings, the DOJ repeatedly argued that this major reallocation of FPS officers indicated that Trump was unable to enforce federal law in Portland with regular forces and was therefore justified in calling up around 200 Oregon National Guard troops in September.

The number of FPS officials allegedly sent to Portland was a key piece that a Ninth Circuit panel relied on in determining last week that Trump had the authority to federalize and deploy Guard troops to the city.

Oregon and Portland asserted in a letter to the panel last week that the Trump administration greatly misrepresented how many FPS officers it sent. They said evidence obtained in discovery indicated that the number of FPS officers in Portland never surpassed 31 at any time.

In the department’s response letter Monday, Bernie acknowledged that, based on a review by the Department of Homeland Security, the government only sent 86 FPS officials to Portland over the summer.

Bernie added that the DOJ also incorrectly stated that a “quarter” of the entire FPS force was sent to the city.

“We stated in our supplemental brief that ‘it is undisputed that nearly a quarter of the agency’s entire FPS capacity had to be redirected over a relatively short period to a single location in one medium-sized American city due to the unrest there,’” Bernie wrote. “This statement was incorrect.”

Instead, Bernie claimed that the statement was meant to refer to the percentage of FPS “inspectors” who were sent to Portland. Rather than a quarter, the amount was only around 13% of all FPS inspectors, Bernie wrote.

“We deeply regret these errors,” he added.

Bernie said the discrepancies should not influence the panel’s ruling upholding Trump’s deployment because the number of FPS officers in Portland didn’t form the basis of its decision.

However, in the ruling, the panel’s majority repeatedly cited the amount of FPS officers in the city, at one point saying that the president may in part rely on FPS deployments to measure whether he is unable to execute the law with regular forces and needs to mobilize the National Guard.

The panel’s expansive ruling, which alarmed several legal experts, stayed a district court order blocking Trump’s deployment.

The Ninth Circuit stayed the ruling last week to hold a vote on whether a larger panel should take up Trump’s appeal of the district court order.

A district court judge is set to preside over a three-day trial starting Wednesday to consider the merits of Trump’s military intervention in Portland. Following the trial, the judge could block the deployment again.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239241957-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 12:00:00.053283

President Trump’s Coal Fantasy Since taking office in 2017, President Trump has promised to bring back the coal industry.
The Trump administration is doing all it can to resuscitate the struggling coal industry, but both the market and environmental advocates have other plans.","The Trump administration and its allies in Congress are doing all they can to prop up the struggling coal industry. The administration has held press conferences with coal miners lined as a backdrop to tout its “mine, baby, mine” agenda while flooding the industry with subsidies to try to keep it afloat.

But three recent mining lease sales of public land — including two in the Powder River Basin, the largest coal producing region in the United States — have completely flopped.

Even conservative voices in the Northern Rockies are now publicly questioning whether elected officials’ wishful thinking on coal is dooming state economies for years to come.

Americans Will Pay More for Trump’s Coal Agenda

The administration’s policies ask the American taxpayer to pick up the tab for a dangerous and polluting industry with a failing market, while they simultaneously attack affordable and reliable clean energy. Removing pollution control requirements, forcing outdated coal power plants to operate past their retirement dates, and offering up our public lands to industry will not only harm our health and environment: it will hurt our pocketbooks through higher energy prices at a time when so many of us are already struggling. The administration’s use of sham emergency orders to stop a Michigan coal-fired plant from retiring cost customers $29 million in just the first five weeks it was forced to keep burning coal.

While the administration and Republicans in Congress remove incentives for and block clean energy development, they are also increasingly subsidizing the fossil fuel industry at our expense. The Department of Energy recently announced that it will provide $625 million to subsidize aging, polluting coal-fired power plants. And earlier this year, the Republicans passed a budget bill that cut the coal royalty rate from a 12.5% floor to a 7% ceiling, providing the industry a handout at the expense of a critical funding stream for state and local governments that goes toward schools and colleges, highway and road construction, and city and town budgets.

Clean energy is now cheaper than coal in many places and investing in it helps to keep down electricity costs for Americans. So why is the Trump administration selling out our communities by propping up this costly and polluting fuel source while attacking clean energy?

The MAGA Agenda Lets Other Countries Lead on Clean Energy

In addition to raising energy prices, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress have given a competitive edge to other countries that continue to grow their clean energy industries. According to the New York Times, Chinese companies now produce 60% of the world’s wind turbines and 80% of solar panels. America has a rich history of progress and leadership on emerging industries, but the MAGA movement now seems hellbent on rejecting these new opportunities to allow other countries to win the clean energy space.

Despite Trump’s attacks on clean energy, other countries around the world continue to move toward renewables. In fact, renewables have now overtaken coal as the primary source of electricity around the world for the first time. Trump and congressional Republicans are holding us back from competing on the global stage.

A Fake Energy Emergency at Our Expense

Upon taking office, the Trump administration immediately declared an energy emergency, but this is completely fabricated. Even before Trump took office, the U.S. was producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet has in the history of human civilization. If the purpose of Trump’s actions was to address an actual energy emergency, it would be nonsensical to simultaneously adopt policies that inhibit wind and solar energy development and promote coal exports to other countries. President Trump’s manufactured emergency is meant to line the pockets of wealthy fossil fuel CEOs at the expense of our communities.

Much of the administration’s push for fossil fuels is ostensibly about fueling large-load data center development and the massive energy requirements that come with it, rather than providing power for American families. Communities are being forced (oftentimes without their knowledge) to take on both the cost and environmental risks of the AI boom. These data centers require enormous amounts of electricity, generate an excessive amount of waste, noise pollution, and require vast amounts of water. They often end up raising electricity rates for customers and are keeping fossil fuel-burning power plants online, disrupting the transition to clean energy and rolling back progress on fossil fuels. The administration’s actions on coal further exacerbate this growing threat to our communities and utility customers. Earthjustice attorneys represent local communities before state utility regulators to protect customers from subsidizing data centers.

Opening Up National Public Lands

Trump isn’t just pushing to burn more coal — he also wants to mine more of it. The administration recently announced that it was opening 13.1 million acres of our national public lands to coal leasing. But even with the subsidies from the administration and Congress, three recent lease sales in the Powder River Basin and Utah have fallen flat, illustrating the market’s continued shift away from coal. Companies don’t want this coal even when it’s on the clearance rack.

The American people also don’t want to turn over our national public lands to industry. According to the 2025 Conservation in the West poll, Western voters want their members of Congress to prioritize conservation over energy development on our national public lands by the widest margin to date — a whopping 72%. Americans want our elected officials to protect our public lands for recreation opportunities, wildlife, and economic benefits for local communities.

President Trump’s Coal Fantasy

Since taking office in 2017, President Trump has promised to bring back the coal industry. It didn’t happen in his first term and it will not happen now. While the U.S. may see a temporary bump in coal production, it will not last as the market continues to move toward cheaper and cleaner energy. The Trump administration and its allies in Congress are selling coal communities and states a bill of goods — and even longtime coal supporters in those states are starting to recognize it. By doubling down on an industry that continues to decline even with heavy subsidies behind it, and refusing to support transition plans, elected officials are dooming communities and workers with false hope.

Even while the administration moves forward with its coal industry bailout, it is leaving behind the same workers who have been asked to line up behind members of the administration at press conferences. Recently, coal miners from across the country protested at the Department of Labor over the administration’s failure to enforce limits on silica dust — a carcinogen that has led to a spike in black lung disease. The administration is ignoring worker health while helping its industry executive friends get even richer.

Earthjustice Continues to Fight Back

In Michigan, Earthjustice has active litigation to shut down the coal plant that Trump’s fake energy emergency has kept running past its scheduled retirement. In the coming months, we will fight more mandates like this one across the country.

Earlier this year we also sued the Trump administration for its unlawful decision to exempt dozens of coal-fired power plants, including Montana’s Colstrip plant, from stronger pollution limits set in the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

Earthjustice has also fought expansions of some of the country’s largest coal mines for years and will continue to protect communities against Trump’s plans to authorize reckless new mining in the Northern Rockies region. Even though the coal industry’s allies in Congress recently passed an unprecedented Congressional Review Act resolution to reopen the Powder River Basin to new coal leasing, we are continuing to challenge mine expansions at the Rosebud and Bull Mountains coal mines and will take on the administration whenever it tries to sell off more of our public lands. Thankfully, as the recent failed lease sales show, the market is already rejecting the Trump administration’s coal fantasy.

Wherever the Trump administration and its allies in Congress attempt to illegally turn back progress on coal, we will meet them in court. We have come too far on the fight for clean energy and regulations to protect our health and environment from coal pollution to turn back now.

The Trump administration is doing all it can to resuscitate the struggling coal industry, but both the market and environmental advocates have other plans.

Human rights groups have criticised the deal, which is expected to cost A$2.5bn (£1.64bn; $1.23bn).
""People are secretly being sent to Nauru, with key aspects of the deal still kept from the Australian public"", immigration spokesperson for the Greens party, David Shoebridge, told Australian media.
This deal is separate to the arrangement for Nauru to run Australia's offshore immigration processing regime.
That system was scaled back following international condemnation on how the detainees were treated and housed.","Australia has started to deport foreign detainees to Nauru, marking the start of a controversial deal with the tiny Pacific island nation.

In a statement on Tuesday, Australian Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke confirmed that ""the first transfer had occurred"" last Friday, although how many people were deported is unknown.

The deal was struck after Australia's top court ruled that it could not indefinitely detain about 358 people, the bulk of whom have been convicted of crimes, forcing their release into the community.

Human rights groups have criticised the deal, which is expected to cost A$2.5bn (£1.64bn; $1.23bn).

The Australian government has repeatedly refused to release details of the agreement for the so-called NZYQ cohort, and refugee advocates says it goes against the country's human rights obligations.

Laura John, from the Human Rights Law Centre told SBS News the plans have been ""shrouded in secrecy from the outset"".

""We do not know if the person who has been exiled has left family behind in Australia, whether they need medical care that is unavailable in Nauru, or even if they still had visa appeal options in Australia.""

The NZYQ cohort refers to a group of detainees who were released into the Australian community after a landmark High Court decision in 2023 found that the government's power to hold them indefinitely in immigration detention was unlawful.

Many of them had been convicted of serious crimes including assault, drug smuggling and murder, leading to their Australian visas being cancelled.

The Australian government found itself in a difficult situation - unable to send the former-detainees back to their home countries for fear of persecution or because their government wouldn't accept them - but also facing severe backlash from the public for their release into the community.

Last year, the government, under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, made changes to Migration Act, bolstering its powers to deport non-citizens, in a move critics described as ""brutal"".

It included paying third-countries to take Australia's deportees.

Australia turned to Nauru, and under the agreement which was finalised earlier this year, the deportees are given a 30-year visa that allows them to work on the island and mix freely with its 12,500 inhabitants.

The first transfer triggers an upfront payment of A$408m to resettle the group in Nauru.

Aside from these details, little is known about the agreement.

""People are secretly being sent to Nauru, with key aspects of the deal still kept from the Australian public"", immigration spokesperson for the Greens party, David Shoebridge, told Australian media.

Criticising the lack of transparency in the plan and ""contemptuous silence"" from Minister Tony Burke, Shoebridge also expressed concern that once the deportees arrive in Nauru, they could then be sent back to their home countries.

""No matter who you are or where you were born, governments should not be able to disappear you, send you off against your will to a country that you have zero connection to,"" he said.

Burke has defended the arrangement, telling the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he has inspected the accommodation and health facilities on Nauru and ""the standard there is good"".

""When somebody has come and treated Australians in a way that shows an appalling character, their visas do get cancelled and when their visas are cancelled, they should leave,"" Burke has previously said.

In less than a year, the Trump administration has shuffled ICE's leadership several times.","The Trump administration is staging a major shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with plans to reassign senior leaders in agency offices across the country amid frustrations over current arrest and deportation levels, two sources familiar with the changes told CBS News on Monday.

One U.S. official, who requested anonymity to talk about internal matters, said as many as roughly a dozen local ICE leaders could be reassigned, with some expected to be replaced by current or former officials at Customs and Border Protection, its sister Department of Homeland Security agency. Some of those ICE officials have already been informed of their reassignments, the official added.

The planned shake-up at ICE would be a major leadership overhaul, affecting roughly half of the agency's 25 field offices.

In most cases, the field office directors won't be demoted or fired, said two U.S. officials, who described the plan as a way to give certain ICE offices additional support.

The Trump administration has increasingly turned to CBP and Border Patrol officials like Commander Gregory Bovino to expand its government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, deploying them to apprehend unauthorized immigrants far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, in Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.

Operations by green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in those cities — including arrests at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes — have triggered significant local backlash, with critics accusing the agents of being heavy-handed and arresting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but without criminal records.

In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, ""While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country.""

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, ""The President's entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President's policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.""

The Washington Examiner reported on the reassignments earlier Monday.

Internally, U.S. officials tell CBS News, some ICE leaders have been frustrated with Border Patrol's operations in cities — and the opposition they have garnered from local residents. While the Trump administration has made anyone in the U.S. illegally who is encountered by federal officials subject to arrest, ICE says its operations have continued to primarily target immigrants who have committed crimes in addition to being in the country unlawfully.

""We're arresting criminals, while they are going to Home Depots and car washes,"" one U.S. official told CBS News, referring to Border Patrol agents.

Some inside the Trump administration, however, see Border Patrol officials as better equipped to carry out the aggressive and expansive operations needed to reach the ambitious arrest targets set by the White House.

In the spring, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump's mass deportation plans, suggested on Fox News that ICE should be carrying out ""a minimum"" of 3,000 arrests per day. ICE officials have not met that target. While they have peaked above 2,000 on some days, arrests by the agency typically hover over 1,000 each day.

As of this week, ICE had carried out more than 260,000 arrests under the second Trump administration, or an average of approximately 900 per day, according to internal agency data obtained by CBS News.

In less than a year, the Trump administration has shuffled ICE's leadership several times.

Caleb Vitello, the first official tapped to lead ICE under the second Trump administration, was reassigned in February and replaced by longtime agency veteran Todd Lyons, who continues to serve as acting director. Previous heads of ICE's deportation unit, Enforcement and Removal Operations, and its investigative branch, Homeland Security Investigations, have also been replaced in recent months.

ICE has not had a Senate-confirmed director since early 2017, under the Obama administration.

Dozens of protesters gathered Monday outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Durango after reports spread that federal agents detained two minors and a parent on their way to school.

The minors are believed to be Durango School District students, and the adult is their parent, according to a representative from Compañeros: Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center, who asked not to be identified by name.

All three were taken to the ICE field office in Bodo Industrial Park.

The Compañeros official said she has worked with the family on an active asylum case since December 2024.

A work permit request was submitted in September and denied in early October. However, the Compañeros official received an email Monday from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services saying the denial was an error and the case remains active.

“They have a strong asylum case,” the Compañeros employee said. “(It meets) all the requirements and criteria (needed).”

The advocate said she showed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services email to a field office employee and was told the family would be released if the case could be confirmed as active.

Community members, legal advocates and representatives from Compañeros and the immigrant rights group Apoyo began to gather around 8 a.m. Monday across the street from the ICE field office where the family was held.

By Monday afternoon, the number had grown to about 100 people. Durango Police Department patrolled the scene.

Several protesters said the children were brought to the Center in handcuffs.

“I’m here to support these people that are literally being kidnapped off our streets,” said community member and protester Lisa Owens. “I am absolutely appalled that they (detained) two young children on their way to school – which is where they belong – and that they have them in this ICE building. It breaks my heart what’s happening. ... They must be terrified – traumatized.”

Local family law attorney Angie Buchanan went to the Center to support the detained family.

Buchanan said an ICE official told her any request to speak with the children must go through a juvenile coordinator with ICE. But when she called the number provided, she was told no such office or position exists.

According to the National Immigration Forum, the Flores Settlement requires each ICE field office to have a juvenile coordinator – an expert on children and families – and a compliance officer to address issues.

A Denver-based attorney from Meyer Law Office is consulting with the family, according to an employee with the firm.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

Raye, a member of the Southwest Rapid Response Network who requested their last name remain anonymous, said that while every ICE detainment comes with heavy feelings, the involvement of children has made this one feel especially difficult.

“This time it involves kids,” they said. “The cruelty of that is really apparent to our community.”

Community member and protester Natalia Anzola, who immigrated from Columbia in 1989, called the detainment of the children “the first step in erosion of public liberty.”

Anzola arrived to the protest around 9:30 a.m. Monday and remained as of 6 p.m., with no plans to leave.

She said she joined the protest to let the detained family and immigrant community know she stands with them.

“I just want them to know they’re not alone,” she said.

Enrique Orozco, co-executive director of Compañeros, told The Durango Herald that the children and their parent were still being held in the ICE field office in Durango as of Monday evening. Protesters intend to remain outside of the office until the children are released, he said – even if it takes all night.

“Part of the message is, if you believe in dignity and you believe in kids not (being) subject to this fascist administration, join us out there,” Orozco said. “We’re looking for people to be out there through the night with anything – coffee, hot chocolate, blankets, generators, noisemakers. We don’t want those kids to go to Denver.”

Orozco said the children’s mother is not being detained, and that ICE should release the minors to her.

The struggle over immigration is an ongoing one and will remain a constant source of friction between conservative politics and the social witness of the Catholic Church.","Earlier this month, hundreds of Catholic laypeople, nuns, and clergy processed from St. Eulalia Church in Maywood, IL, to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in nearby Broadview. The clergy donned their vestments and processed the Eucharist from the church to the outside of the ICE facility to provide the sacrament for detained immigrants. After an exchange with local police stationed there, the procession was denied entry into the facility. After remaining outside the facility, singing hymns and platforming speakers, the Eucharistic protest disbanded peacefully.

The Catholic press broadly rallied behind the protestors, demanding that the religious rights of illegal immigrants be respected, many of whom are Catholic. This sentiment also derives from the spirit of Pope Leo’s recent letter, Dilexi te, which offers that “in every rejected migrant, it is Christ himself who knocks at the door of the community.”

Much of the American Catholic mainstream saw ICE’s refusal to admit the procession on October 11 as a sign of callousness, following the words of one of the event’s organizers, that “Jesus was knocking at the federal agents’ door, and they would not let him in.”

Despite this polemic, ICE agents regularly invite Catholic priests to serve migrant communities. Although the right to do so has been challenged at specific sites, Catholic priests have worked to establish consistent chaplaincies at detention facilities. Even at the South Florida Detention Center, or as the President prefers, “Alligator Alcatraz,” a team of four to five priests visits the site to hear confessions and offer Mass weekly. This model has been replicated at several other ICE installations nationwide, which often rely on volunteers to provide religious services for staff and detainees alike.

At Broadview, the priests involved did not clear the event with ICE in advance, as chaplaincies regularly do, and could not have reasonably expected to gain access to the facility. The liturgical stunt pulled by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL), the progressive organizers of the event, not only cheapens the Eucharist but also does a disservice to the migrants interred at Broadview. This demonstration still left them without access to the Eucharist, as going through the work to establish a permanent chaplaincy would be far less provocative than what the CSPL seems to prefer.

Even more unlike other Catholic outreach efforts to ICE detainees, this initiative lacked any attention to Confession. At Alligator Alcatraz, the priests there have heard thousands of confessions from detainees, many of whom are indeed criminals of various stripes beyond their immigration status. Providing the Mass and the opportunity to atone for one’s sins is the way to treat illegal immigrants as spiritually mature souls in need of saving, not just as political props. To exercise a genuine Christian love for migrants, the idea that the consequence of their immigration status expunges their sins must be wholly dismissed.

This erroneous perspective on immigration has infected much of the Catholic and Protestant churches. As the Catechism states, the virtue of hospitality obliges nations to accept foreigners in search of security or the means of living. Still, the migrant must also “obey its laws and to assist in carrying civic burdens,” subject to the juridical qualifications set by their host country. This mutual relationship, grounded in Christian affection for the downtrodden, requires a heart of generosity in the nation and a bond of gratitude on behalf of the migrant.

Yet the Church’s advocacy in this regard often fails to capture this sentiment.

Priests for Justice for Immigrants, a pro-migration installation in the Diocese of Chicago, lists its mission as “to influence the public conversation regarding immigration policy and to promote the basic human rights and well-being of immigrants and their families living in our communities.”

This formulation, befitting a secular NGO, makes no mention of the spiritual needs of migrants. It does not take seriously the fact that migrants are sinners like the rest of us and require opportunities to repent and come closer to Christ. This progressive mindset only conceives of migrants as victims of state violence and fails to capture the ensouled dimension of their humanity, fixating on their utility as a political lever.

The struggle over immigration is an ongoing one and will remain a constant source of friction between conservative politics and the social witness of the Catholic Church. Regardless of the state’s immigration policy, the Church’s mission remains fixed, to accompany the migrant as an icon of Christ’s hospitality, and bring them to the fullness of the faith. Anything else would see the Church reduced to one of dozens of other pro-migration secular organizations.

But it would perhaps facilitate deportations when combined with other measures, some draconian and themselves arguably (and they will be passionately argued) in breach of human rights.

Leaving the EHCR and its European court, the Strasbourg Court, is now Conservative Party policy as well as that of Nigel Farage and his stooge party, Reform UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said that the government is examining the way the courts interpret Articles 3&8 of the ECHR, dealing with torture & inhuman treatment, and privacy, respectively, though he has said the government will not leave the Convention, which has been written into UK law since the Human Rights Act (HRA) 1998.

Farage announced in a speech in Oxford in August that the UK would leave the ECHR if his party were in power. Reform sees the Convention as a barrier to its planned mass deportation of people who have entered Britain illegally and remain in the country at the expense of taxpayers. Reform UK wants to deport 600,000 people over five years but has given hardly any details how this would be achieved apart from through negotiating returns agreements with other countries. Good luck with that.

The Tory plan

The Conservatives, in a probably vain attempt to pander to Reform supporters, announced at their annual conference in early October, that they too would depart the ECHR and deport 750,000 people. But their leader Kemi Badenoch at least recognised that quitting the Convention would not be an immigration silver bullet and set out a plan of other measures. The Tories would:

Rebrand the Home Office’s immigration enforcement unit as a “Removals Force” with new powers, and double its budget by an extra £820mn per year, which they say could be unlocked by closing asylum hotels

Mandate the new Force to remove 150,000 people a year for five years, including people currently living in the UK illegally, future illegal arrivals and all foreign nationals convicted of an offence more serious than minor parking or speeding offences

Ban people who enter the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum

Negotiate returns agreements with other nations, and threaten to withhold aid spending and visas from countries that decline to co-operate

Instruct police forces to check the details of everyone they arrest against biometric borders data and allow the use of facial recognition without informing the public it is in use. This is likely to be fiercely contested under the Data Protection Act 2018 as well as the HRA, and is contrary to guidance from both the Information Commissioner’s Office and the College of Policing

Expand an unspecified “existing facility” to detain migrants before they are removed, with a capacity for between 1,000 and 2,000 people

Restrict the grounds for claiming asylum to those facing a threat from the government in their home country, excluding claims from those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality

Abolish the Immigration Tribunal, which hears challenges to failed asylum claims, handing the appeals process instead to a team of officials within the Home Office

Abolish taxpayer-funded legal aid in immigration cases, with a document on the proposals arguing there “will be no need for lawyers” because claims would be “fairly assessed against the criteria”

At least this is a plan. But as a layman, I can only imagine with alarm the flood of human rights abuse claims likely to flood our courts if these measures were implemented – and not just from asylum seekers. Will British citizens not be among those challenging the new powers for the Removals Force? And what about allowing the use of facial recognition without informing the public?

The threat to the Human Rights Act

Indeed, it is mainly rights other than those directly connected (if at all) with immigration and asylum that would be at risk if the UK left the ECHR. This is plain to see in a piece referring to “the threat to the HRA”. written by Professor Conor Gearty KC of the London School of Economics before his recent death and newly published in the London Review of Books. In arguing that rights are already being eroded by the UK Supreme Court, he cites cases not related to immigration, but to trans people, the rehabilitation of offenders, the two-child benefit cap, compensation for victims of miscarriages of justice, and the release of information about end-of-life decisions related to young children (including a Newcastle Hospitals case), “The Supreme Court is quietly editing the HRA out of existence,” writes Gearty.

And think about the foreign policy repercussions. How and with which nations would the government negotiate returns agreements? What would be the effect on our global reputation if we started using Trumpian bully tactics by withdrawing spending and visas from countries that refuse to co-operate?

Starmer’s announcement of a well-intentioned attempt to find a compromise by reviewing the way Sections 3&8 of the ECHR are interpreted by the courts faces equally high hurdles. Starmer must mean amending the Convention as written into the HRA, which it is within the power of the UK Parliament to do. Re-writing the identical document for the Strasbourg court, however, would require the agreement of all 45 other signatory nations, a virtually impossible task.

Any such attempted negotiation would focus on withdrawing the UK from the right of individual petition to Strasbourg and from Article 46 of the Convention, which requires compliance with judgements of the court, suggest two eminent supporters of leaving the ECHR, the KCs Professor Richard Ekins of Oxford University and Sir Stephen Laws, in a recent report for the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange.

If negotiations did fail, leaving the Convention as applied by Strasbourg as it is but the version used in UK law amended to make deportations easier, it seems inevitable that there would be a flood of new appeals to the Strasbourg court by those who have been turned down in the UK.

The number of successful appeals to Strasbourg could easily rise from negligible to significant – exactly the outcome that politicians of all parties want to avoid and increasing the pressure to leave the ECHR altogether. Alternatively, appellants might pursue their cases through other UK laws, including their common law rights, as Ekins and Laws also point out.

What the ECHR says

It is worth at this point reminding ourselves exactly what the two relevant Sections of the ECHR say. Section 3 states:

“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”

This right is non-derogable – it cannot be limited or suspended even in times of war or emergency. The Strasbourg court has interpreted inhuman treatment as causing intense physical or mental suffering, and degrading treatment or punishment as debasing the individual, showing lack of respect for human dignity.

Section 8 says:

“Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.

“There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” This is a wide range of exceptions and one can certainly imagine why the UK government would want to ensure the courts take greater account of them, using them to reject more applications.

So, if the Tory plan would fail because it would have a negligible effect on immigration and asylum numbers while leading to more human rights abuses in other fields such as secret public surveillance; Labour’s because it would tend to shift the balance of final asylum decisions back to Strasbourg; and Reform’s because it has no plan, what can be done?

Ekins and Laws do set out a coherent case for the UK leaving the ECHR. Argued out in their 80-page report, in essence it is the quite commonplace one that in a democracy like the UK it is the elected parliament, not courts, wherever they may be, that should decide within the bounds of humanity what rights people have (No responsible person is suggesting that immigrants and asylum seekers should be exposed to execution, torture on inhuman treatment by being deported to a country under a murderous regime – at least, one hopes not, though one fears Farage might not care).

Farage is mistaken if he believes the British people are with him on this. Opinion polls by YouGov since 2013 and analysed by The Independent show that more people consistently favour remaining in the Convention than leaving. The most recent poll this month (October) found 46% opposed to leaving and 29% in favour.

The case for leaving the ECHR

Human rights law (whether British or European), believe Ekins and Laws, is not the same as human rights, which should be compatible with our laws in any case: “The HRA and the ECHR, taken together, upend the traditional balance of the Westminster constitution, compromising both effective government and parliamentary democracy, as well as creating unacceptable risks for the reputation of the judiciary for political impartiality,” they write. They see the ECHR as interpreted by the Strasbourg court as a moving target constantly inhibiting the ability of governments to legislate in all sorts of fields which should be matters for them alone, subject to parliamentary approval.

They agree with Gearty at least to the extent that all believe withdrawal from the ECHR would have wider implications than in the field of asylum and immigration: “Unhappiness about European human rights law may seem largely focused on immigration, asylum and deportation; but the reason for this is that those topics are, at present, the most politically salient examples of where the law and practical politics collide and diverge,” they write. “There can be little doubt that, if other topics developed greater political salience (say, climate change or welfare reform), judicial intervention in practical policymaking and administrative decision-making on those topics would attract similar unhappiness (as was seen, in the not so recent past, in relation to lawfare against UK forces).”

Pandora’s Box

So, all the options for leaving the ECHR have serious drawbacks:

Leaving the Strasbourg court and repealing the HRA would open a Pandora’s Box of claims of abuse in a wide range of areas

Leaving the ECHR but keeping the HRA unamended would result in a negligible reduction in successful asylum claims, as the number of cases rejected in the UK that go on to be successful in Strasbourg is already very small

Leaving the ECHR and amending the HRA would certainly make it more difficult for successful asylum claims to be made on grounds of human rights law; but applicants would doubtless seek other legal avenues, such as common law rights

Remaining in the ECHR but amending the HRA to make successful claims more difficult (the Starmer plan) would likely encourage more applicants unsuccessful in the UK courts to appeal to Strasbourg – just the outcome no political party wants – unless a way could be found to prevent them.

While leaving the ECHR as applied by Strasbourg would on its own have a negligible effect on the numbers, it would be a highly significant symbol of sovereignty, satisfying the instincts of some voters by whom it would be seen as “doing something” – but nothing effective, as we have seen. Anyway, it’s not what most people want, as we have also seen.

Conclusion

There’s no reason in principle why a liberal democratic country like the UK should not have its own human rights laws determined by its own parliament, but the benefits of leaving the ECHR would be so slight and uncertain in terms of immigration and asylum and the potential disadvantages significant enough in terms of counter-productivity and damage to our international reputation that leaving the Convention as advocated by the Tories and Reform UK would be unwise as well as inhumane and unethical in the eyes of many.

Ultimately this is a question of trust and empathy. Who do voters trust – or rather, who should they be able to trust – to strike a fair balance between the human rights of asylum seekers and immigrants and the legitimate interests and concerns of the British people: Parliament, ministers (effectively Home Office civil servants acting at the behest of ministers in accordance with UK law), UK courts and tribunals, or the ECHR as implemented by the Strasbourg court? And do these voters have sufficient regard for the rights of asylum seekers to care? The polling evidence suggests they do.

This is good news as far as it goes. But given that it is possible the UK will have a Reform government by 2029, and if Gearty is correct that the HRA is already being eroded, it would be reckless to cast aside the backstop of the ECHR and the Strasbourg Court.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSNCRcNFBlA4Mnts/2da880ab54ad0cd02724d881bafff3a44a0057ec7952013f67246a7feccf1351/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=basic-6&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2023%252F10%252Fnwb0.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F10%252Fdreamstime_l_308296276-1.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Human%2520rights%2520%2528Part%2520Three%2529%253A%2520The%2520UK%25E2%2580%2599s%2520ECHR%2520debate%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Fhuman-rights-part-three-the-uks-echr-debate-2,N,,2025-10-28 08:00:30.467018

Despite the last-minute failure this summer of his controversial litigation finance bill that would’ve added a 41% tax on investors, Tillis will continue to push for a new version.

“We’re going to go after it,” he said during a Bloomberg Government roundtable on Monday.

In April, Tillis introduced the Tackling Predatory Litigation Funding Act, which would impose the tax on profits earned by third-party entities that finance civil litigation. The bill describes the tax as being equal to the highest individual rate, 37%, plus an additional 3.8%. The bill was included in Senate Republicans’ version of President Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill in June. The tax was eventually removed from the bill by the senate parliamentarian.

Tillis, who is not seeking reelection and will end his term next year, said the reason for the bill is that there needs to be equitable tax treatment across the board and because it’s “silly” that investors in lawsuits have better tax treatment than the victims who receive an award.

The suggested inclusion of the bill in the reconciliation package caused an uproar in the funding space and prompted a blitz of lobbying from the industry trade group the International Legal Finance Association and funders. Tillis said he took notice and was surprised by how they mobilized.

“I think some of the players that didn’t want to see a change in the tax treatment did an extraordinarily good job of walking all over the Hill over the past couple of months,” he said.

“I was impressed with the sheer amount of money,” he added. “You couldn’t throw a rock and not hit a contract lobbyist who hadn’t been engaged to fight this evil, equitable tax treatment bill that Tillis had.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/7503f64/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F40%2Ff3da06f747dcbce7d4da5f2f640d%2Ftillisag-007.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:04:23.130397

Dexter, who advocated for the woman's release, announced the update Monday alongside Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici.

Jackie Merlos and her four U.S. citizen children were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in late June. Merlos was visiting her sister, a Canadian citizen, at Peace Arch Park along the U.S.-Canadian border. Agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained Merlos as the sisters were saying goodbye, a close family friend told KGW.

Her release came hours after Dexter announced that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed on Merlos' behalf, challenging the legality of her continued detention in federal court.

Merlos, originally from Honduras, is not a U.S. citizen but has a pending U-visa, according to court filings in the case. A federal judge terminated removal proceedings against her in mid-October.

""Jackie's freedom is proof that the power of the people is greater than the people in power,"" Dexter said. ""Oregonians refused to be silent, and because of that, Jackie is free and will be home with her children. This is a moment for celebration, but it's also a painful reminder that justice was long delayed and actively undermined by the federal government.""

Mimi Lettunich and her husband Kris Wigger, who cared for Merlos' children since July, said they were relieved that she was finally being released.

""Today is an important day. We picked up our dear friend after four months of cruelty and wrongful detention,"" Lettunich and Wigger said. ""Tenacity, heart and justice prevailed over the Trump administration's egregious immigration policies. It took countless lawyers, members of Congress, national advocacy groups, friends and family from all political affiliations to make this possible.""

Wyden said the delegation's teamwork helped free Merlos and reunite her with her children.

""Jackie Merlos should never have been cruelly separated from her kids and illegally imprisoned thanks to Donald Trump's scattershot immigration schemes,"" Wyden said. ""I'll never stop pushing back against this Trump madness so that due process and civil rights are upheld for everyone in America.""

Merkley said Merlos' detention lasted more than 100 days.

""If we allow families to be torn apart and our neighbors to be detained by their government indefinitely without due process, we surrender the values that define our great republic,"" Merkley said. ""Trump continues to shred our Constitution, allowing due process to be illegally denied and using ICE to stoke fear and uncertainty in our communities.""

Bonamici said ICE should not have separated the family.

""Many families, like Jackie's, are being ripped apart by an out-of-control federal agency using cruel, violent, and often illegal enforcement tactics,"" Bonamici said. ""My heart goes out to the entire Merlos family and to all of the families who are continuing to fight to be with their loved ones again.""

According to a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson, Merlos was arrested by Border Patrol agents in Peace Arch Park on June 28. The spokesperson said at the time that Merlos was ""attempting to smuggle illegal aliens into the U.S."" and that ""removal proceedings have been initiated."" The spokesperson said the children initially remained with their mother at her request in Border Patrol custody.

Dexter said it took around 12 days to locate the family after the arrest. She and her chief of staff drove to a CBP facility in Ferndale, Washington, where she eventually located the family.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/1444fb39-0e77-48f4-a79c-65d25fc621ea/20250716T061628/1444fb39-0e77-48f4-a79c-65d25fc621ea_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 04:57:07.001953

Burke said Nauruan authorities had confirmed the arrival on Friday, as reported by the ABC, triggering the first yearly instalment of $408m.
Nauru’s trust fund will receive a further $70m each year from Australia as part of the deal, totalling more than $2.5bn across the three decades.
The deal’s fine print allows Australia to “claw back” any funds provided to the trust should Nauru fail to deliver on the deal.

Burke said Nauruan authorities had confirmed the arrival on Friday, as reported by the ABC, triggering the first yearly instalment of $408m.

“When someone’s visa is cancelled they should leave,” Burke said in a statement.

No further information is known about the man’s case or circumstances at this stage.

The deal between Australia and Nauru is expected to last 30 years and will allow Australia to apply for 30-year long-term visas on behalf of the cohort to enable their deportation from the country.

Around $20m of the first instalment will become immediately available for the Nauruan government to “facilitate the settlement”, while the remaining $388m will go into a sovereign trust fund, which is expected to include board members from both the Nauruan and Australian governments.

Nauru’s trust fund will receive a further $70m each year from Australia as part of the deal, totalling more than $2.5bn across the three decades.

Details of the agreement remain a secret, subject to a public interest immunity claim. But home affairs department officials claim those sent to Nauru, many of whom have been found to be refugees, will be able to live freely within the community and cannot be sent to another country, where they could face persecution in a situation known as chain refoulement.

Department officials indicated earlier this year a former regional processing centre, handed to Nauru by Australia, could be used as temporary accommodation while the cohort is settled in. It’s not known what state the centre is in.

The deal’s fine print allows Australia to “claw back” any funds provided to the trust should Nauru fail to deliver on the deal.

Burke has suggested around two dozen people released under the high court’s NZYQ ruling against indefinite detention have been granted visas so far. Guardian Australia is aware of at least eight who have been redetained awaiting deportation.

Adnan*, a man within the NZYQ cohort, told Guardian Australia he hadn’t heard of Nauru prior to being redetained earlier this year by Australian Border Force officials in a night-time raid.

“I thought there had been a mistake. I hadn’t had a lawyer for years, and I had never really understood what was happening in my case,” he said through his lawyer.

“These days are like living in a nightmare. I made mistakes since I came to Australia – I have been punished for those mistakes. I have tried everything to put my life back on track. I am not a young man – I cannot keep rebuilding my life. I do not know why Australia has selected me for this terrible punishment.”

The associate legal director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Laura John, accused the federal government of being “willing to completely disregard the basic rights of migrants and refugees” in a process shrouded in secrecy.

“We do not know if the person who has been exiled has left family behind in Australia, whether they need medical care that is unavailable in Nauru, or even if they still had visa appeal options in Australia,” she said.

“This secrecy is not an accident. It is a deliberate tool wielded by the Albanese government to ensure that it does not have to grapple with the real, human consequences of its actions.

“Some of the people facing deportation to Nauru have lived in Australia for most of their lives. Others are stateless and have no other home. Some have serious health conditions and will likely die in Nauru. All of them have already been doubly, or triply punished by the government. They should not be subjected to lifelong suffering.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715baff02a40a7de11f69569f912670be17dcb05/89_0_1500_1200/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9a1b06dcf7c322a60844f634df3ae2ce",N,,2025-10-28 04:57:17.515943

Harvick said there are about 200 Border Patrol employees in the Chicago area, and those who are part of Operation Midway Blitz have cameras.","CHICAGO (AP) — A senior Border Patrol official who has become the face of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago is due in court Tuesday to take questions about the enforcement operation in the Chicago area, which has produced more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

The hearing comes after a judge earlier this month ordered uniformed immigration agents to wear body cameras, the latest step in a lawsuit by news outlets and protesters who say federal agents used excessive force, including using tear gas, during protests against immigration operations.

Greg Bovino, chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, one of nine sectors on the Mexican border, is himself accused of throwing tear gas canisters at protesters.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis initially said agents must wear badges, and she banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She later said she was concerned agents were not following her order after seeing footage of street confrontations involving tear gas during the administration’s Operation Midway Blitz, and she modified the order to also require body cameras.

Ellis last week extended questioning of Bovino from two hours to five because she wants to hear about agents’ recent use of force in the city’s Mexican enclave of Little Village. During an enforcement operation last week in Little Village and the adjacent suburb of Cicero, at least eight people, including four U.S. citizens, were detained before protesters gathered at the scene, local officials said.

The attorneys representing a coalition of news outlets and protesters claim Bovino himself violated the order in Little Village and filed a still image of video footage where he was allegedly “throwing tear gas into a crowd without justification.”

Over the weekend, masked federal agents and unmarked SUVs were spotted on the city’s wealthier, predominantly white North side neighborhoods of Lakeview and Lincoln Park, where footage showed chemical agents deployed on a residential street. Federal agents have been seen and videotaped deploying tear gas in residential streets a number of times over the past few weeks.

Bovino also led the immigration operation is Los Angeles in recent months, leading to thousands of arrests. Agents smashed car windows, blew open a door to a house and patrolled MacArthur Park on horseback. In Chicago, similar Border Patrol operations have led to viral footage of tense confrontations with protesters.

At a previous hearing, Ellis questioned Kyle Harvick, deputy incident commander with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Shawn Byers, deputy field office director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, about their agencies' use of force policies and the distribution of body cameras. Harvick said there are about 200 Border Patrol employees in the Chicago area, and those who are part of Operation Midway Blitz have cameras. But Byers said more money from Congress would be needed to expand camera use beyond two of that agency’s field offices.

The White House set a lofty goal of 3,000 daily arrests earlier this year — a high bar for an agency that’s historically been strained for resources and personnel. And despite ramping up arrests, ICE has largely fallen short of that goal.

That’s fueled tensions between the White House and ICE. Planning has been underway to reassign at least a dozen directors of ICE offices nationwide who senior officials believe are underperforming, the sources said. ICE has 25 field offices.

“While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country,” said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.

Since receiving its mass deportation edict after President Donald Trump took office in January, ICE has fielded criticism from people inside the administration who think they aren’t doing enough, lawmakers and advocates who think they are doing too much, and an incensed public that in some cases is taking drastic action to impede immigration enforcement.

To bolster immigration arrests, DHS tapped US Border Patrol agents to fan out across the country. They’ve have been involved in high-profile confrontations with protesters and at the center of some of the administration’s most controversial and aggressive enforcement actions.

Part of the discussions have involved replacing heads of certain ICE field offices with Border Patrol officials, the sources said, stressing that plans have not been finalized.

At the helm of the immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities is Gregory Bovino, who holds the title of chief patrol agent of the El Centro sector and has been the lead on the administration’s crackdown in cities — now, in Chicago.

Leadership at the Department of Homeland Security and the White House have touted the work of Bovino and the Border Patrol publicly and privately. There are more than 1,500 Border Patrol agents assisting ICE with immigration enforcement in the interior of the US.

But while ICE and CBP both fall under the Department of Homeland Security and are involved in immigration enforcement, they also execute different functions, raising concerns about potentially replacing some ICE leadership with Border Patrol officials.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2230972796.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-28 13:04:08.797730

While Immigration and Customs Enforcement is moving forward with widespread raids across the country, the agency says it doesn’t have the staff necessary to coordinate the congressional visits, as Politico first reported Monday.

One Democrat says it’s an excuse to block oversight.

“ICE wants to operate in the dark, and this president wants to let them,” Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, said in a statement first shared with NOTUS.

“Trump and Republicans are using the shutdown that they caused as an excuse to give ICE coverage to operate without oversight,” she continued. “It’s wrong and it’s not what happens in a democracy.”

McIver is facing federal charges following a scuffle with officers outside a New Jersey detention facility in May. She has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. She faces several years in prison if convicted of the three charges of assaulting federal officers.

Congressional visits have become some of the only ways to conduct oversight of the detention centers that have faced scrutiny over how detainees are treated. The Department of Homeland Security earlier this year made cuts to staff working on oversight of immigration operations.

But Department of Justice officials notified a federal judge on Oct. 21 that the funding for detention centers was coming from the tax cut and spending package lawmakers passed earlier this year, and not with funds subject to the oversight authority for members of Congress.

Lawmakers attempting to visit detention centers during the shutdown are getting denials or auto-responses saying that congressional liaisons for ICE are out of the office because of the shutdown, according to Politico.

A mass shakeup of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership is underway amid growing friction inside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over deportation tactics and priorities, according to four senior DHS officials.

The overhaul affects ICE field offices in at least eight cities and will replace many senior leaders with Border Patrol officials, marking an unprecedented power shift inside DHS and exposing sharp divisions over how far to go in ramping up deportations, the officials told Fox News.

The changes are being driven by competing camps inside DHS.

On one side are Border Czar Tom Homan and ICE Director Todd Lyons, who have advocated focusing on criminal aliens and those with final deportation orders.

On the other side are DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, senior adviser Corey Lewandowski and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who have pushed for a broader and more aggressive approach, targeting anyone in the U.S. illegally to boost deportation numbers.

Two senior officials described the mood inside DHS as ""tense"" and ""combative,"" with some ICE leaders warning the new approach could erode public support and blur the line between ICE and Border Patrol operations.

""ICE started off with the worst of the worst, knowing every target they are hitting, but since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization,"" one senior DHS official told Fox. ""It’s getting numbers, but at what cost?""

This third-country resettlement agreement — which the government has repeatedly refused to release publicly — is separate to a pre-existing and ongoing arrangement for Nauru to run Australia's offshore processing regime.

""Nauru confirmed last Friday that the first transfer has occurred,"" Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told the ABC on Tuesday.

NZYQ cohort's visas cancelled

About 358 former detainees have been released into the Australian community since the High Court ruling in 2023, the bulk of whom have been convicted of crimes or had their visas cancelled on character grounds.

More than a dozen have since been re-detained in Australia after being issued visas by Nauru, but deportations have been delayed by legal challenges.

Under the deal, members of the group are expected to be granted a 30-year visa that allows them to live and work in the community among Nauru's 12,000 or so residents, and to leave and re-enter the country.

Mr Burke said he had ""personally"" inspected the accommodation and health facilities that would be available to the deportees.

But human rights lawyers, advocates, and the Greens have loudly criticised the government's deportation plan, warning it may breach Australia's human rights obligations.

Payment due upon first arrival

Australia agreed to pay Nauru $408 million when the first deportee arrived on the island under a memorandum of understanding signed by officials last Tuesday.

That included $20 million to be paid directly to the government to cover set-up costs, and $388 million to be deposited into a long-term trust to be jointly managed by Nauru and Australia.

Australia will also pay an additional yearly sum of up to $70 million depending on how many people have been transferred to the island.

If the deal is upheld in full and all members of the cohort are transferred, it means Australia will end up spending more than $2.5 billion over the 30 year its lifetime — or more than $7 million per person.

But the value for Nauru will be greater, as the government will be able to immediately access interest generated by the trust.

In a statement last week, a Nauruan government spokesperson said the agreement reaffirmed ""Nauru and Australia's shared commitment to humane, lawful, and mutually respectful management of migration and settlement"".

Mr Burke defended the arrangement on ABC's Insiders earlier this month, highlighting that members of the NZYQ cohort had no right to remain in Australia given their visas had been cancelled.

""Cancelling a visa has to have meaning,"" he said.

""And until we landed this agreement with Nauru … we had a situation where for some people, no matter what laws they'd broken, cancelling a visa was meaningless.""

The Nauru agreement is the government's latest attempt to deal with the cohort after it was found scrambling for a solution in the wake of the High Court ruling, which centred on the case of one man known only as NZYQ.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6dd48baf75c2a51fa3d6f9743c972d47?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-10-27 22:56:59.562780

The Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition and other community partners say they have struggled to respond as more and more people are reporting ICE and Border Patrol sightings, many of which they say are hard to verify and create fear in immigrant communities.

During a news conference last week, advocates said they hope the hotline will create an accurate accounting of where immigration officials are working and what they’re doing in Maine “during a time of heightened enforcement and targeting of immigrants and refugees.”

“Agents are showing up at people’s homes without warrants, targeting day laborers, and using surveillance to track and intimidate our communities,” Presente! Maine executive director Crystal Cron said at a news conference Thursday, according to a copy of her remarks provided by the group. “This isn’t about public safety — it’s about control and fear.”

The coalition also launched a resource hub online with information on legal services and relief funds for families whose breadwinners were arrested by ICE.

Anna Welch, director of the Refugee and Human Rights Clinic at the University of Maine School of Law, said she hopes the hotline will combat the fear and confusion that immigrants in the state are experiencing. Welch said the clinic has held more than 300 legal consultations with ICE detainees in Maine jails and that clients often have questions about their basic rights and what will happen to their families.

“There’s just so much confusion, there’s just so much misinformation,” Welch said Monday.

Aside from news reports and rumors, such arrests have been a struggle to track. Dozens of incidents in Maine have come to light only because they involved local law enforcement agencies.

Family and loved ones of those arrested by ICE have also had a hard time finding people during the government shutdown, according to reporting from the Boston Globe.

U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, said her office has been trying to help some of these families for months and that U.S. Customs and Border Protection — whose agents carry out many immigration arrests in Maine — has refused to create its own locator service to report where it is holding people in its custody, unlike ICE.

“In the wake of the Administration’s sweeping edict to dramatically ramp up enforcement and detainment operations, some of these tools — including ICE’s own detainee locator system — have become unreliable,” Pingree said in a written statement Monday.

At the news conference, Cron said the organizations involved in the hotline hope it will help inform immigrant families who are trying to locate their loved ones after they’ve been detained or who worry they might be arrested.

The groups said they have more than 100 trained volunteers who will take calls from people who believe they’ve seen ICE or Border Patrol, and who will then confirm whether the reports are true.

A spokesperson for the ICE field office serving Maine referred a reporter to previous statements that the Department of Homeland Security’s leaders have made regarding hotlines in other states, some of which Secretary Kristi Noem has suggested “looks like obstruction of justice.”

Noem was not commenting specifically on the Maine program. Volunteers are only expected to document what they see, the groups said, not to intervene.

The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, which offers legal help and advocacy to immigrants in Maine, says it has been trying to keep up with arrests involving local law enforcement officers.

Spokesperson and attorney Lisa Parisio said ILAP is not involved in the hotline, nor could she comment yet on what impact it might have.

But Parisio said ILAP can also attest to the lack of information. Not only is there no centralized tracking system for ICE arrests, Parisio said, but fear among immigrants and ICE’s practice of arresting people and sending them out of state has also made getting information harder.

ILAP is aware of 22 incidents in Maine involving state and local police in which more than 50 people have been taken by immigration officials. Parisio said ILAP has received but not been able to verify several other reports.

“What is known shows a concerning and broad pattern of Maine law enforcement agencies across the state stepping outside of their roles and voluntarily diverting Maine’s resources to assist the federal administration with indiscriminate immigration enforcement, threatening the rights and safety of some of Maine’s most vulnerable residents,” Parisio said.",https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/ICE-Impersonator_66272.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-10-27 19:01:16.642034

The result has been mounting frustration for congressional Democrats, who had already been suing the Trump administration for curtailing or limiting access to detention facilities prior to the shutdown. They said even when the requirement was on the books, ICE had thrown up roadblocks to their visits.

“Members and staff were informed that the denials were due to the ongoing government shutdown and a lack of available funding or personnel to facilitate the visits,” said an aide to one congressional office affected by the policy change, requesting anonymity due to the ongoing litigation.

Now, their emails requesting visits are either being denied or met with auto-replies.

“Due to the current hiatus in federal funding, ICE Office of Congressional Relations staff are currently out of the office and unable to respond to emails, phone calls, or perform other work-related duties. Once funding is restored, normal operations will resume,” read one recent auto-reply to a lawmaker’s office, reviewed by POLITICO.

Cobb is weighing whether to pause the ongoing lawsuit until the shutdown ends.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, acknowledged the shutdown’s impact on lawmaker visits and said the lawmakers themselves were to blame.

“While the Democrats may not care about shutting down the government and making millions of public servants go without a paycheck, maybe they will get back to work now that they have lost the precious appropriations rider they rely on to try to storm ICE facilities,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

McLaughlin’s comment appears to reference the scrum that broke out when Rep. LaMonica McIver and two other Democratic lawmakers visited a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, earlier this year.

General Rob Bonta said Monday that he anticipates the Trump administration, which last week announced plans to use federal election monitors in California, will use false reports of voting irregularities to challenge the results of the Nov. 4 special election.

Bonta, California’s top law enforcement officer, said on a call with reporters that he is “100%” concerned about false accusations of wrongdoing at the polling places.

Bonta said it would be “naive” to assume Trump would accept the results of the Nov. 4 election given his history of lying about election outcomes, including his loss to President Biden in 2020.

The attorney general also warned that Trump’s tactics may be a preview of what the country might see in the 2026 election, when control of the U.S. House of Representatives — and the fate of Trump’s controversial political agenda — will be at stake.

“All indications, all arrows, show that this is a tee-up for something more dangerous in the 2026, midterms and maybe beyond,” Bonta said.

The U.S. Department of Justice last week announced it would send election monitors to five California counties where voters are casting ballots in the Proposition 50 election to decide whether to redraw state’s congressional boundaries.

Federal election monitors will visit sites across Southern California and in the Central Valley, in Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties, the Justice Department said last week.

Gov. Gavin Newsom called the move an “intimidation tactic” aimed at suppressing support for Proposition 50 and inappropriate federal interference in a state election.

While federal monitoring is routine, particularly in federal elections, it recently has been viewed with heightened skepticism from both parties. When the Justice Department under President Biden announced monitoring in 86 jurisdictions across 27 states during last November’s presidential election, some Republican-led states balked and sought to block the effort.

Democrats have been highly suspect of the Trump administration’s plans for monitoring elections, in part because of Trump’s relentless denial of past election losses — including his own to Biden in 2020 — and his appointment of fellow election deniers to high-ranking positions in his administration, including in the Justice Department.

The California Republican Party requested the election monitors and cited several concerns about voting patterns and issues in several counties, according to a letter it sent to the Dept. of Justice.

Bonta, in his remarks Monday questioned the GOP claims, and denied the existence of any widespread fraud that would require federal election monitors. He compared the monitors to Trump’s decision to dispatch the National Guard to Democratic-led cities, despite an outcry from local politicians who said the troops were not necessary.

More broadly, Bonta told reporters that the Trump administration appears to be ready to fight the Nov. 4 results if Prop. 50 passes.

“People vote and you accept the will of the voters -- that’s what democracy is. But that’s not what they’re teeing themselves up to do based on everything that we’ve seen, everything that’s been said,” said Bonta, describing Trump’s recent call on social media for Republicans to “wake up.”

Bonta also said that the state would dispatch observers — potentially from his office, the secretary of state and county registrars — to watch the federal monitors at polling places.

Early voting has already started in California, with voters deciding whether to temporarily reconfigure the state’s congressional district boundaries. The Democratic-led California Legislature placed the measure on the Nov. 4 ballot in an effort to increase their party’s numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives .

Gov. Gavin Newsom and other backers of the measure have said they generally support independent redistricting processes and will push for nonpartisan commissions nationwide, but argued that Democrats must fight back against Trump’s current efforts to have Republican states reconfigure their congressional districts to ensure the GOP retains control of Congress after the 2026 election.

Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the U.S. Dept. of Justice, declined to comment on Bonta’s remarks. Baldassarre also declined to say how many election monitors would work in California.

Federal election monitors observe polling places to ensure compliance with the federal voting rights laws, and are trained to observe and act as “flies on the wall,” said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan and nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, in an interview last week.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1158c1f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2F7e%2Fa6cc3ad64f73b5ed5a8e86ac6c19%2F1515347-me-0723-rob-bonta-juvenile-halls-gem-002.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 18:00:54.906380

Shackled and chained while miscarrying, denied prenatal care, given inadequate food and water—these are the conditions that pregnant women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention must endure.

Despite its own directive advising against detaining pregnant individuals, ICE has increasingly held pregnant immigrants in facilities across the country, where abuse and medical neglect go unchecked. Over the past nine months, the ACLU and partner immigrant rights groups, including the National Immigration Project, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Sanctuary of the South, and SNAP, interviewed more than a dozen pregnant women who described horrific treatment at ICE facilities. We found widespread neglect and repeated violations of federal policy.

“Immigration detention is known for medical neglect, abusive conditions, and utter disregard for the dignity of people in ICE’s custody,” says Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, who co-authored a letter to ICE documenting these conditions. “Still, what we heard from the pregnant women we interviewed are some of the most horrifying stories I’ve heard about detention.”

Although ICE has stopped publicly reporting the number of pregnant individuals it detains, and has refused to provide this information to Congress, ICE acknowledged that Basile, a detention center in south Louisiana, was holding 14 pregnant women as of April 2025. That number reflects a broader trend of detaining people who should qualify for release under federal regulations, which require the release of women “medically certified as pregnant.”

Interviews with detained women reveal that ICE officers have arrested pregnant individuals even after they informed staff of their pregnancies, including survivors of domestic violence, who are at heightened risk.

In April 2025, Alicia* arrived for her routine ICE check-in in Louisiana and was detained without warning, sent to Basile. She soon discovered she was pregnant. She was taken to a local hospital for a blood test, but no one explained her medical treatment or provided interpretation. In detention, she received small portions of poor-quality food that left her feeling weak and hungry. By May, Alicia began experiencing severe abdominal pain, cramping, and bleeding. She reported her symptoms to facility staff, who transported her to an emergency room, where medical personnel performed an invasive uterine test without her consent, injected her with an unknown medication, and later informed her that she had miscarried.

Despite this miscarriage, ICE returned her to Basile that night and detained her for two more months. She continued to experience heavy bleeding, swelling, fever, and severe uterine pain, submitting repeated sick call requests that went unanswered. In July 2025, ICE deported Alicia, separating her from her children, and she later sought hospital care for a severe infection acquired while in custody.

Alicia’s experience is far from unique. Marie,* a graduate student and lawful visitor to the United States, was detained for more than 20 weeks at Basile during her high-risk pregnancy. Although she had informed ICE officers that she was pregnant, officers placed in solitary confinement after transferring her thousands of miles from the U.S-Canada border to Basile. She was not sent for medical treatment until other detained women advocated for her. Inside the facility, Marie said the food was often inedible and when she asked about missing prenatal vitamins, a nurse told her, “You won’t die if you don’t take them.”

Marie was released only after legal advocates intervened, but after her detention she developed eclampsia, endured a difficult delivery, and continues to struggle with postpartum depression linked to her detention trauma.

Other women’s stories mirror these experiences. Lucia,* who was detained after appearing for a regular check-in appointment with ICE, began to experience heavy vaginal bleeding in the middle of the night when she was two months pregnant. She requested immediate medical attention, but was not taken to see medical staff for several hours. Instead, medical staff took her to a small room and left her bleeding alone without providing her any food, water, or pain medication. Later that evening, after a significant loss of blood, she was taken to the emergency room, with her arms and legs shackled as she was actively miscarrying. When she arrived at the hospital, she required a blood transfusion because she had suffered a miscarriage.

Julieta,* detained for two months despite having a valid visa, was shackled at the ankles, hands, and waist during cross-country transport and feared that poor nutrition and stress could endanger her pregnancy. Ana,* six months pregnant and still in detention, was denied prenatal vitamins and meaningful medical care. Jenny,* visibly pregnant when detained in February 2025, was restrained during transport, suffered vomiting, diarrhea, and vaginal bleeding, and had limited access to drinking water.

Together, these accounts depict a systemic pattern of cruelty and medical neglect toward pregnant women in ICE custody, in direct violation of agency prohibitions on detaining and restraining pregnant individuals.

“The stories that are represented in this letter are just the tip of the iceberg,” Cho told NBC News earlier this month. “You have women who are talking about being shackled and restrained while they’re actively miscarrying; you have women begging and pleading for things as basic as prenatal vitamins and being denied.”

The ACLU and partners are calling on ICE to act immediately to address this systemic abuse. In a letter to Congress, advocates urged the agency to identify and release all pregnant, postpartum, and nursing individuals and to follow its own directives prohibiting detention except in rare circumstances. They also recommended establishing a clear process for pregnant detainees to request timely release, ensuring access to medical care that meets community standards, investigating neglect and abuse at Basile, and closing facilities that have repeatedly violated detention standards designed to protect pregnant and postpartum individuals.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/10/shame-on-ice-s.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 18:01:02.045813

Hamdi was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) yesterday, Oct. 26, in an apparent response to his criticism of Israel’s genocide in Gaza, and at the urging of anti-Muslim, pro-Israel extremists.

Hamdi was detained by immigration officials at the San Francisco International Airport while on a speaking tour in the U.S., which he has done many times in the past. The night prior to his detention, he spoke at CAIR Sacramento’s annual gala and was traveling to speak at CAIR Florida’s gala.

Notorious anti-Muslim extremist Laura Loomer has publicly taken credit for his abduction, claiming that ICE acted in response to her demands and smearing Hamdi with various anti-Muslim conspiracy theories.

In a statement, CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said:

“This past Saturday, I had the privilege to join Sami Hamdi at CAIR Sacramento’s annual gala, where he, as always, spoke with moral clarity and courage. I was shocked to be contacted by him early Sunday morning to inform me that he was being detained by immigration officials, and that his visa was being revoked—seemingly for no reason other than pressure from extremist, anti-Muslim, and pro-Israel voices seeking to silence him.

“Sami has been a strong and outspoken voice against Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza and the dehumanization of the Palestinian people. It is clear that his unjust detention is nothing less than an attempt to undermine our Constitution and punish journalists for speaking the truth in order to shield Israel from accountability for its laundry list of war crimes and human rights violations.

“Our legal team is working towards his immediate release and aiming to hold ICE accountable for bowing to the whims of Islamophobes and supporters of the Israeli government.”

“You can’t have a trial if there’s no defendant,” Xinis said, finding it surprising the government had apparently not considered that fact, or had merely ignored it in favor of quickly deporting Ábrego García.
In his response, Ábrego García’s attorney, Jonathan Cooper of Quinn Emanuel, slammed the Liberia designation as an unrealistic removal destination and another effort to punish Ábrego García rather than abide by his request to be removed to Costa Rica.
As the hearing began, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Ábrego García’s attorney of Murray Osorio, informed Xinis that U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services officials were about to conduct a “credible fear interview” with his client regarding the Liberia designation.","GREENBELT, Md. (CN) — The Justice Department walked back a plan to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to Liberia as soon as Oct. 31 at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis Monday, after a reminder that such a removal would violate her court order blocking the Maryland man’s removal.

Xinis scheduled Monday’s hearing to address the government’s notice filed late Friday night stating it had selected Liberia as the fourth African country it would try to deport Ábrego García to after he was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March.

“Federal defendants have received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for petitioner’s arrival,” the Justice Department said in the Friday filing. “Defendants expect to be able to effectuate removal as soon as Oct. 31.”

The Barack Obama appointed judge appeared perplexed by the designation, as Ábrego García has repeatedly listed Costa Rica as a destination he would not challenge as he does not have the same fear of persecution that he’s stated regarding El Salvador and the Justice Department’s three prior African destinations.

Further, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in the Middle District of Tennessee, the Obama appointee presiding over Ábrego García’s criminal case brought after he was returned from El Salvador in June, has scheduled an evidentiary hearing Nov. 4.

The evidentiary hearing, Xinis noted, is meant to address pretrial motions in preparation for a looming January trial over Ábrego García’s immigration-related human trafficking charges.

“You can’t have a trial if there’s no defendant,” Xinis said, finding it surprising the government had apparently not considered that fact, or had merely ignored it in favor of quickly deporting Ábrego García.

Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign acknowledged that removing Ábrego García to Liberia on Oct. 31 would violate Xinis’ injunction barring his removal from the continental United States and stated the government would continue to abide by it.

Justice Department officials previously listed Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana as potential destinations, based on apparent assurances from the nations that any immigrant sent there would not be subject to persecution while there and will not be handed over to their home country if they have a reasonable fear of persecution there.

Ghana’s foreign minister Sam Okudzeto Ablawka rejected the idea that Ábrego García could be deported there, stating on Oct. 10 that the nation made clear to the U.S. government that Ghana would only accept West African migrants, “purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles.”

Liberia announced Saturday that it would accept Ábrego García “on a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis, following a formal request from the government of the United States,” its government said in a statement.

In his response, Ábrego García’s attorney, Jonathan Cooper of Quinn Emanuel, slammed the Liberia designation as an unrealistic removal destination and another effort to punish Ábrego García rather than abide by his request to be removed to Costa Rica.

“Simply put, the statute creates an order of operations that allows the government to lawfully remove petitioner only to Costa Rica,” Cooper said. “If it is not removing him there, then it cannot lawfully remove him at all.”

Cooper said he and his colleagues have not received any indications or evidence from the government that it has made any effort to effectuate removal to Costa Rica, the only thing it had provided was Friday’s notice of Liberia’s designation.

“This confirms that another country designation does not demonstrate good faith efforts to effectuate removal or any realistic prospect thereof,” Cooper wrote.

As the hearing began, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Ábrego García’s attorney of Murray Osorio, informed Xinis that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials were about to conduct a “credible fear interview” with his client regarding the Liberia designation.

Xinis quickly instructed Ensign to send word to USCIS that the interview cannot occur while Ábrego García’s attorneys were tied up in the proceeding, and to either delay the interview or the hearing.

She called the questionable timing “completely unacceptable” and “not fair play,” expressing frustration with the Justice Department and a lack of faith that the interview would be moved without a clear confirmation from Ensign.

Xinis ordered the parties to file a joint status update to determine further proceedings in the case, noting that she has yet to address Ábrego García’s claims that his due process rights have been violated throughout his ordeal.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/ap-kilmar-abrego-garcia-oct-10.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-27 18:01:06.141198

“MTC operates the Arizona State Prison — Marana, a minimum security prison with capacity for 500 male inmates.
The El Valle Detention Facility in Texas was formerly the Willacy Detention Center, where advocates identified poor medical care, sexual abuse and overuse of solitary confinement.
Multiple attendees called for Thursday’s meeting to be the first step in a campaign to block the possible immigration detention center.
We’ve got to come back next month.” Schramm said public pressure was one of the strongest tools available to share opposition to the Marana prison becoming an immigration detention center.","On a quiet patch of land surrounded by miles of cotton fields, and not far from the blinking lights of Marana’s regional airport, the turn-off to a vacant prison building is marked by an empty frame of a sign and a dead cactus, reduced to its ribs but still reaching to the sky. Outside the facility itself, cracked asphalt leads to low-lying gray buildings, some topped with barbed wire. The basketball court stands empty and lit.

The facility could soon be the site of an immigration detention center after private prison operator Management and Training Corp. (MTC) bought it from the state this summer, despite what appears to be growing community opposition and no opportunity for a vote from local officials.

A packed community forum turned impromptu organizing meeting, held Oct. 23, offered a first look for many into the reality of the detention center, what community members want to know about the project moving ahead, and how some of them may try to stop it.

MTC did not respond to a request for comment.

The meeting was convened by District 3 Supervisor Jen Allen, with panelists from the ACLU of Arizona, Just Communities Arizona and the Florence Project. Attendees took green question cards, discussed with others at their table, and formed a line to ask the panelists questions. They held Abolish ICE and Defund ICE posters, and often jeered or booed at the mere mention of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, moving into town.

Allen noted the potential “ripple effects” of opening a detention center, including the fear of local community members. “It affects our families, it affects our neighbors, our schools. It affects businesses. It affects every facet of our community,” said Allen. “Getting engaged now is the right time to be doing it.”

As Trump’s immigration crackdown continues to surge in many parts of the country, recent data point to an unprecedented number of people locked up in immigration detention centers. As of Sept. 21, about 60,000 people were detained, according to a data research center at Syracuse University. A 2022 study showed that “immigrants in counties with more detention space are significantly more likely to be arrested and detained by ICE.” That fear seems to have been one of the main reasons so many people turned out against the possible facility in Marana.

Among the 300-plus people who showed up Thursday night was Marana resident Evy McDonald.

She told Arizona Luminaria she wasn’t sure what to expect from the forum. But when she walked in to see those hundreds of people, “I felt like I walked into a sea of hope,” she said.

McDonald said she’s been an activist and protester for a half a century, and that the younger generations taking up social justice now have a lot to learn from their elders. “We were the young adults who burned draft cards, who burned bras,” she said. “If the center opens, there’s a lot we can still do to disrupt things. You have to be willing to put your privilege and your life on the line.”

She was one of many people that night who were making a call to action.

Here’s what people asked at the forum, and the key points of information to catch up on the status of a possible immigration detention center in southern Arizona.

How did we get here?

A key question attendees asked was how we got here, and who approved a plan to turn the shuttered prison into an immigration detention facility.

This summer, Congress approved $45 billion for new detention centers, part of an increase in spending for immigration enforcement that experts say would significantly grow America’s immigration enforcement apparatus. That would be a 256% annual budget increase to ICE’s current detention budget, according to the American Immigration Council.

MTC runs five immigration detention centers across the country, and one in Australia; the Marana facility would be the sixth in the U.S.

The Arizona Department of Administration, a state agency that acts as the administrative hub for state government, sold the building back to MTC in July for $15 million. MTC had previously operated a minimum security prison in the building until 2023, when the state ended the contract because the facility was operating at less than half capacity, according to a news release from Gov. Katie Hobbs’ office.

“MTC operates the Arizona State Prison — Marana, a minimum security prison with capacity for 500 male inmates. Over the last several years however, the facility has averaged an inmate population of 225,” the release said. “Despite the reduced population, ADCRR is required by contract to pay for nearly 475 beds. By ending the contract, the State will save an estimated $5 million in FY24, and nearly $10 million in FY25.”

The capacity of the Marana detention center is 500 people. In 2017, when the population of the private prison was near capacity at 487, the prison employed 119 people, according to a state audit of the facility.

As the state owned the facility, and it was already zoned for a prison, there was no local approval required for the sale to move ahead, said speakers on Thursday.

“I just want to point out that the state of Arizona did sell this to MTC. They didn’t have to,” said Noah Schramm, the Immigrants’ Rights and Border Policy Strategist at the ACLU of Arizona.

When the facility may open is uncertain. Liz Casey, of the Florence Project, said she’s been looking for job postings online as one way to see if they’re hoping to begin operations soon.

In an August statement to Arizona Luminaria, the Town of Marana said it had not been involved in the procurement process, and therefore did not track local reactions or concerns.

“As a municipality, we have always been in favor of a facility use that would generate local employment and create opportunities for collaboration on essential public services, such as road and street cleaning that could be performed by inmates,” the statement said.

Only one member of the Marana town council, Patrick Cavanaugh, attended Thursday’s meeting. He said it was frustrating to watch a detention center moving ahead without any clear levers to step in. “We’re not paying their bills, so there’s really nothing we can do,” he said. “In everything we’re seeing across this country, they’re not giving any due process. These are our neighbors, you know? That’s the problem here.”

What is the experience of people detained in private prisons, or other MTC facilities?

Conditions in immigration detention are stark, punishing and sometimes deadly, said Thursday’s panel.

Casey, a social worker with the Florence Project who helps document conditions in Arizona detention centers said that water and power outages, issues with access to hygiene, and medical neglect are common in immigration detention centers. Two people have died in Arizona immigration detention this year — one in Eloy and one in Florence.

Schramm, of the ACLU, echoed the critiques. “ICE detention centers across the country have consistently been places where people’s most basic and fundamental rights and dignity are violated,” he said.

“It is worth remembering that the people who are detained in these places often have not had a judge consider their case, have not had their day in court, have not been convicted of a crime,” Schramm said. “This is civil detention. It’s not supposed to be punitive, and yet, for years, we have heard so many stories of physical and verbal abuse by detention staff, of people being subjected to solitary confinement for the most minor infractions.”

Isaacson said that the push to cut costs was especially strong for private prison providers who made a profit by using less money than they were paid to run the facility.

“They’re competing for contracts with the government. That’s a competitive process,” she said. “They’ve got to come in as the lowest bidder, and then they’re going to make a profit on top of that. How do they do that? They do that by cutting corners.”

Watchdog groups have raised concerns about conditions at most of MTC’s immigration detention facilities

The MTC-owned and operated Imperial Regional Detention Facility in California did not have a nebulizer to help a detained person who eventually died of bronchopneumonia; at the time, the company had a policy to reorder medical supplies every two months regardless of whether they ran out earlier, according to a 2018 Human Rights Watch report.

At Otero County Processing Center a report from immigrant rights group Freedom for Immigrants found over 200 complaints of abuse between 2015 and 2018 that included inadequate food and medical attention, limited access to hygiene supplies and harassment by guards.

A lack of access to clean water, medication, along with freezing temperatures and lack of access to legal services were identified by Amnesty International from an April 2025 visit to the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Texas.

The El Valle Detention Facility in Texas was formerly the Willacy Detention Center, where advocates identified poor medical care, sexual abuse and overuse of solitary confinement.

IAH in Texas has had at least one detained person die following their detention; the ACLU of Texas has called for the facility to be shut down due to inadequate medical care and extensive use of solitary confinement.

A member of the audience also spoke about their decade of experience as a former correctional officer. Detainees faced abuse and violence, but so did staff, she said. “It is not good for anyone.”

Have immigration detention centers been stopped before?

While detention centers have been opened around the country, community organizers have stopped or slowed down efforts to open new facilities.

In Leavenworth, Kansas, a conservative community in an area full of federal and state prisons, some local officials and residents have used the permitting process as a public way to register their concern about a detention center in the area. Most recently, city leaders filed two lawsuits against CoreCivic, the company proposing to run the facility.

In 2011 in Florida’s Southwest Ranches, CoreCivic (formerly CCA) wanted to build a detention facility with a capacity of 1,500 people. But as residents in the neighboring town of Pembroke Pines were worried about dipping property values and were generally against the project, the city of Pembroke decided to cancel a contract supplying sewage, water, and fire-rescue services to Southwest Ranches. That was enough of a headache to scare away CoreCivic, which pulled out of plans to build in Southwest Ranches.

SouthWest Ranches sued Pembroke for damages — lost revenue. After a decade-long fight, they lost in court, and Southwest Ranches was billed with $2 million in legal fees.

Allen also said that localities have considered revoking permits or opening up a conversation about zoning again. She also suggested talking to the farmers around the heavily agricultural surrounding area about how this would impact them.

How will a new immigration detention center impact enforcement in communities?

Another Marana resident, Clement DeLarge, asked at the forum: “Is ICE going to be hanging out at churches and schools and things like that?”

Cities across the country have seen an uptick in immigration enforcement with the Trump administration’s mandate to increase deportation numbers.

In some communities, including most recently an aggressive blitz in Chicago, that has meant hostile stops by masked agents that leave people out of communication for days. More than 170 U.S. citizens have been held by immigration agents in recent months, ProPublica found.

Having an immigration detention facility in the region with capacity for at least 500 people would almost certainly lead to increased enforcement in Southern Arizona, the panelists said.

Detention center contracts sometimes include a minimum number of people that have to be detained, said Casey. “They will fill it,” she said. “If that means filling it with people from the neighborhood, that potentially could happen.”

Mo Goldman, an immigration attorney who has practiced law in Arizona since 2000, said he had witnessed “so much pain and hardship” in detention centers. He also reminded the crowd that the funding for the Marana private detention center would be provided by public dollars. “It’s not money that just comes out of nowhere,” he said.

Isaacson also noted that immigration detention centers, even as companies promised jobs, actually depressed property values and drained resources like water and electricity. “When is the last time y’all went shopping in Florence? Anybody looking at houses in Eloy on Zillow?” she asked. “You’re popping down a small city in the middle of your city, and again, you’re paying for that.”

The panelists also warned about the detention-related safeguards that have been eroded since the Trump administration took office, which will make it more difficult to fight against abuses. The administration shuttered the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, as well as the independent ombudsman office that monitored immigration detention..

Casey said that wrongful death lawsuits were one tool that remained, along with efforts by elected officials to attempt to get access to detention facilities as one means of oversight, even if those visits were no longer possible to conduct unannounced. Rep. Yassamin Ansari recently visited a detention center in Eloy to draw attention to what she says are abusive conditions faced by immigrants.

What’s next?

Multiple attendees called for Thursday’s meeting to be the first step in a campaign to block the possible immigration detention center.

Jeanne Lukasko said they wanted to see everyone in the same place next month to continue working together. “I’m seeing the energy here tonight. We’ve got to keep it going. We’ve got to come back next month.”

Schramm said public pressure was one of the strongest tools available to share opposition to the Marana prison becoming an immigration detention center. “As a private sale right now. I think the best thing, the most powerful thing, is to build clear public opposition,” he said. “Make it clear not only to MTC, but also to your local elected representatives, representatives in the House and the Senate, that this is intolerable, that this is a priority issue, that this is something that you will not stop bothering them about.”

William Joseph, a Marana resident, told Arizona Luminaria that he was “totally opposed” to the detention center. “I don’t trust ICE at all. They’re snatching people left and right.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed a notice late last week of their plan to deport him to the West African nation of Liberia as early as Friday. It's the latest in a series of African countries the agency has designated as possible destinations for the Salvadoran national.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a “well-founded fear” of violence from a gang that targeted his family. Earlier this year, his mistaken deportation to El Salvador, where he was held in a notoriously brutal prison despite having no criminal record, galvanized opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June.

During a status conference on Monday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned why the government does not simply deport Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica — a country he has said he is willing to go to because the government has promised he would welcomed as a legal immigrant and not re-deported to El Salvador.

“Any insight you can shed on why we're continuing this hearing when you could deport him to a third country tomorrow?” Xinis asked government attorneys. She noted that both the government and Abrego Garcia were “about to burn significant resources” in fighting over whether he can legally be deported to Liberia.

Government attorneys, including Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew C Ensign and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Guynn, didn't immediately have an answer but suggested it could be part of an upcoming court filing.

However, they are not satisfied by what they have received. He hinted that the Liberian government has only agreed to take Abrego Garcia for a limited time.

The administration’s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, who have argued that they violate due process rights and that immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.

When Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June, he was charged in Tennessee with human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss that case. A hearing on the motion to dismiss is set for next week, and Xinis noted the fact that the government seems ready to deport him just prior to that, saying his removal would be the end of the criminal case.

President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in Chicago has impacted people across the city and the surrounding suburbs.

Recently, federal agents tear-gassed a residential street on the North Side on Oct. 24, after detaining people in the predominantly White neighborhoods of Lake View and Lincoln Park, according to Block Club Chicago.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has arrested more than 1,500 people as of the beginning of October, though USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify their count.

Some immigration advocates call the arrests ""abductions."" Federal agents and agencies face lawsuits, including from a Chicago City Council member following her brief detainment at a hospital, and an ongoing case over accusations that agents have violated limits on how ICE can make arrests without warrants and during traffic stops.

If immigration officers approach or engage in public

Chicago's Office of Immigration, Migrant and Refugee Rights released a guide titled ""Know Your Rights & Resources: Upholding Justice and Rights for Every Chicagoan.""

A section by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee Rights offers the following about rights when engaging with immigration agents in any location:

You have the right to remain silent.

You do not have to disclose your immigration status.

You do not have to sign anything you don't understand.

You can ask to speak with an attorney.

It also advises that people should remain calm and keep hands in sight.

If immigration officers come to your home

ICE agents do not have the legal right to enter your home without a warrant signed by a judge, according to ICIRR, which also explains that some ICE warrants are signed by other officers within the agency and do not give the same legal authority as those signed by a judge.

The National Immigrant Justice Center has sample images to spot the difference between the two kinds of warrants on its website.

Are you allowed to film immigration interactions?

Legal precedent indicates yes, filming a law enforcement officer conducting their official business in public is covered by the First Amendment. A column published by the Cato Institute said the Supreme Court hasn't ruled on it explicitly, but it has been upheld by seven federal circuits.

However, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in July, according to CBS12, that videotaping agents and posting it online could be considered ""doxing"" and therefore violence against officers.

The National Immigrant Justice Center says, if filming or taking notes of what's happening, take care not to interfere or obstruct the operation.

ICIRR also has a hotline for witnessing ICE activity: 855-HELP-MY-FAMILY (855-435-7693).

“You can’t expect them to make unbelievably complex chips and computers and other things and pick people off the unemployment line that haven’t worked in five years.”

The president said factories that churn out “very, very complex, very highly sophisticated equipment” – like Hyundai’s new EV battery plant in Ellabell, Ga. – need to bring in specialized workers.

While such foreign laborers should focus on teaching their American counterparts, it’s a process that takes time, Trump added.

Video footage released by authorities showed some workers being shackled with chains around their hands, ankles and wrists – putting strain on the US’ relationship with South Korea.

His administration has already canceled or threatened to cancel billions of dollars of previously approved federal spending and now wants to go after even more funding during the government shutdown.

States, cities, nonprofits and other groups have responded with more than 150 lawsuits accusing the Republican administration of an unlawful power grab.

An Associated Press analysis shows that so far, those suits are mostly succeeding in blocking the Republican president’s spending moves, at least temporarily. But most of the legal battles are far from over, and the Supreme Court, where Trump so far has been more successful, could have the final word on at least some of them.

The court’s conservative majority has been receptive at least in preliminary rulings to many emergency appeals from the administration. Legal experts say a pair of recent decisions by the court may bode well for the administration’s push to gain more control over government spending. Here’s a look at the current legal score and what could lie ahead:

Courts have mostly ruled against the administration so far

As of early October, court orders were at least temporarily blocking the Trump administration’s decisions in 66 of 152 lawsuits over federal spending, an AP analysis shows. In 37 of those cases, courts had allowed the administration to proceed. In 26 of the cases, a judge had yet to rule on the matter. The remaining 23 had either been dropped or consolidated.

The count reflects decisions by district courts, appeals courts and the U.S. Supreme Court and will almost certainly change as the cases progress.

WATCH: A look at Russell Vought’s influence and his push to reshape the government

The flurry of litigation reflects not only the administration’s aggressive effort to wrest control of spending, but the Republican-controlled Congress’ unwillingness to push back, said Zachary Price, a constitutional law professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.

“Congress seems to be following its partisan interests more than its institutional interests, and that puts a lot of pressure on courts,” he said.

It’s hard to say how much money the administration has withheld

Government watchdogs say the administration is blatantly ignoring a requirement in the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to report funding freezes to Congress.

Research by Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees estimated the administration was freezing, canceling or seeking to block a total of $410 billion as of early September. That’s equivalent to about 6% of the federal budget for the year that ended on Sept. 30.

The administration has disputed that number.

Since the shutdown started this month, the administration has targeted even more funding, primarily in places represented by Democrats.

The Trump administration is taking a page from Nixon

Legal scholars say no president has attempted massive, unilateral cuts like these since Richard Nixon. The moves reflect an expansive view of executive power that is at odds with the Impoundment Control Act, court rulings and the Constitution, which grants Congress supremacy over spending, experts say.

“The power they’ve claimed is the power to delay and withhold funds throughout the year without input from Congress,” said Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel with Protect Democracy, which is involved in multiple lawsuits against the administration. “That’s a theft of Congress’ power of the purse.”

In a message to Congress earlier this year, the White House said it was “committed to getting America’s fiscal house in order by cutting government spending that is woke, weaponized, and wasteful.”

White House budget director Russ Vought, a proponent of withholding federal funds, has argued presidents long had the power to spend less money than Congress appropriated if they could cut waste or be more efficient, and that power is needed to address the country’s massive debt.

The government shutdown opened up a new opportunity to cut spending, he said this month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.”

“If I can only work on saving money, then I’m going to do everything I can to look for opportunities to downsize in areas where this administration has thought, ‘This is our way towards a balanced budget.’”

The administration has cut entire agencies

The 152 cases the AP identified challenge the closure of government agencies and offices, the cancellation of grants and other assistance and the attachment of new conditions on federal funding.

The administration has used the cuts, or threat of cuts, to try to impose its policies on gender, race, immigration and other issues.

But it’s not just money on the line. The funds supported jobs, school lunches, health programs, scientific research, infrastructure projects, foreign assistance, disaster preparedness, education initiatives and other programs.

Some notable rulings against the administration include the restoration of funding to 14 states that filed suit over nearly $2 billion withheld for electric car chargers and a block on potentially broad funding cuts to some of the country’s largest cities over their “sanctuary” immigration policies.

Judges have raised constitutional concerns

Judges who have ruled against the administration have often found strong reason to conclude the cuts, or threat of cuts, would violate the Constitution’s separation of powers by usurping Congress’ authority over spending.

They have also ruled the moves were most likely arbitrary under the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.

Judges who have sided with the administration have likened at least some of the legal claims before them to contract disputes that belong in a different court: the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

That court, which traces its origins to the mid-1800s, handles lawsuits by citizens seeking money from the federal government. Referred to as “the People’s Court,” it is separate from the district courts that are handling most of the high-profile litigation against the administration.

The Supreme Court has often sided with the White House

The high court’s conservative justices have allowed the administration to move ahead for now with plans to shutter the Education Department, freeze $5 billion in foreign aid and cut hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training and research supported by the National Institutes of Health.

Those decisions may make it harder to challenge the administration’s spending cuts, though the high court has not yet considered their ultimate legality or overturned lower court rulings.

In the National Institutes of Health case, the high court ruled 5-4 in August that lawsuits over the cancellation of grant funding generally cannot be handled entirely by federal district courts. Instead, plaintiffs must sue in federal claims court for any money and turn to the district courts if they want to challenge the guidance that led to the grant terminations.

The impact of the Supreme Court’s decision is still unfolding, but it could force plaintiffs in the grant funding cases to start over in a new courtroom. In some cases, plaintiffs might have to decide if they want to sue on two fronts.

In the foreign aid case, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision in September suggested the Impoundment Control Act did not give private parties the right to sue over so-called pocket rescissions.

That’s when the president submits a request to Congress not to spend approved money, but does it so late in the fiscal year that Congress doesn’t have time to act and the funds go unspent.

Trump notified House Speaker Mike Johnson in August of a pocket rescission for the $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Though the Supreme Court stressed its decision was preliminary, legal experts say it could make it easier for the Trump administration to use the tactic again.

The panel made its recommendation just days after President Donald Trump backed down from his earlier plans to send federal immigration agents to the city.

Jessy Ruiz Navarro was one of two people to apply to the commission, on which she is already serving, for a term ending June 6, 2026. Gay Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman said it’s important she continue serving at “a time trans folks and people from Latin America in particular are experiencing extreme hate and oppression in this country … from the federal government.”

Mandelman moved to forward Navarro’s nomination to the full board as a committee report Monday, with Rules Committee colleagues Supervisors Matt Dorsey, a gay man who represents District 6, and Stephen Sherrill, who represents District 2, voting yes. Dorsey was filling in for District 10 Supervisor Shamann Walton, who was excused.

The full board is expected to vote on the matter Tuesday.

Navarro, who has been living in San Francisco since 2017, has been serving on the commission since 2019. She is one of a handful of trans city commissioners.

“For me, remaining in this position is not only important but necessary, in particular representing the immigrant community and my trans community,” Navarro said, speaking in Spanish that was translated by an interpreter. “In the current political context, our voices, those of trans women, are often unheard or ignored. It is therefore essential we continue to fight for fair policies and representation.""

Since returning to office in January, Trump has made it a point to sign executive orders attempting to delegitimize the transgender community. The Biden administration had interpreted federal civil rights statutes referring to sex as inclusive of gender identity, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock vs. Clayton County, but Trump has rejected that.

Trump has also sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents, as well as federalized National Guard troops, to several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago. San Francisco was about to be added to that list, with border patrol agents showing up to the Alameda Coast Guard facility last week shortly before Trump called off a planned “surge” in the Bay Area.

As the Bay Area Reporter reported, Mayor Daniel Lurie stated Trump phoned him last week and called off the operation after he told Trump the city’s economy was recovering and public safety had been improved.

“We appreciate that the president understands that we are the global hub for technology, and when San Francisco is strong, our country is strong,” Lurie stated.

Trump wrote on social media that “friends of mine who live in the area” were key to the decision, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who he said spoke highly of Lurie and of the city’s efforts to turn the corner on crime. (Benioff had previously told reporters he welcomed National Guard troops to the city before backtracking amid fierce criticism from local leaders.)

Trump stated October 23, “I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it [San Francisco] around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the law does not permit him to remove. I told him, ‘It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?’ The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject.”

Even before Benioff’s comments, Trump had referenced sending National Guard troops to San Francisco on more than one occasion. The operation that was expected to begin last week did not include Guard troops, though San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins told the B.A.R. city leaders thought an immigration enforcement surge was a pretext to do so later on.

Navarro, who works for the Mission Neighborhood Health Center, said her asylum claim was recently accepted.

4 trans commissioners

Navarro is one of four trans-identified commissioners on the city’s oversight bodies – the others being Monroe Lace of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission, Joaquin Guerrero of the Homeless Oversight Commission, and Cecilia Chung of the Commission on the Status of Women.

In late September, Lurie took some heat for opting not to reappoint Jane Natoli, a trans woman, to the airport commission.

Navarro had a competitor for the seat in city resident Samim B. Shaikh, who is a co-chair for the Yaseen Women's Committee, an Islamic community association in Burlingame.

Shaikh said she has a degree in international relations and did “research centering on the factors driving global migration.”

In her application seeking appointment, Shaikh said, “As an immigrant myself I believe it is important to recognize and understand the diversity in immigrant communities, the diversity within countries of origin, and the reasons for immigration as well as the immense challenges that immigrant communities face.”

Mandelman said that ultimately, “It’s not great when you have two folks who you want to see both on the body come forward, but I do feel at this particular moment, the balance comes for Jessy Ruiz Navarro.”

Indy airport says it can’t stop ICE flights The Indianapolis Airport Authority said the federal government does not have to tell them about the ICE flights, including their duration or frequency.","Last Friday morning, more than 80 flights departed from the Indianapolis International Airport. But one, boarding around 11:30 a.m., was unlike the others.

The passengers were in handcuffs. They stood on the tarmac, next to three vans and a coach-style bus. Dozens were soon loaded onto an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement flight.

Who the detainees are, or where they are from, is unclear. But they were bound for Alexandria, Louisiana — the Trump administration’s major deportation hub, where immigration lawyers warn due process rights disappear.

The Oct. 24 departure was one of more than four dozen ICE flights that moved through the Indianapolis airport, records show, since early July. In an email, the Indianapolis Airport Authority said ICE is using the runways three times a week. But if you’re flying out, you probably won’t see them.

Detainees on charter flights depart from a private facility tucked away on the north side of the airport, separate from the main buildings. It’s the same area where politicians and professional sports teams fly in and out.

ICE did not answer questions about the flights or respond to requests for comment.

But Mirror Indy witnessed men with badges, including one wearing a black jacket that said “POLICE ICE,” shuffle groups of people with bound wrists onto an Eastern Air Express flight. The airline, headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, is one of three working with the federal government to rapidly transport people between detention centers and out of the country.

The scale of this federal operation is unprecedented, said Savi Arvey, an immigration researcher. She heads the ICE Flight Monitor team, a nationwide project run by a human rights group tracking the planes in real-time. Last month, as the number of ICE flights hit a record high across the country, Indianapolis caught their attention for the first time.

“It’s a new ICE Air destination,” Arvey said.

‘No meaningful due process’

Angela Joseph, an Indianapolis immigration attorney, is used to her clients being moved around the Midwest. But this year, some started popping up in detention centers in Louisiana.

“I didn’t know about the ICE flights,” Joseph told Mirror Indy. “But nothing this administration does surprises me anymore.”

She is among advocates who say the Trump administration is moving immigrants around to isolate them from family and from lawyers trying to defend them. Immigration is generally a civil matter, and non-citizens have constitutional rights to hire legal counsel in deportation cases and receive a fair hearing before a judge. According to federal data from September, people with no criminal record now make up the largest group in ICE detention.

“There’s no meaningful due process,” Joseph said. “Before you can do anything legally, they’re on a plane and back in their home country.”

Local flight data reviewed by Mirror Indy shows planes arriving here from Gary, Minneapolis and most recently, Youngstown, Ohio. At first, according to ICE Flight Monitor, a different airline was taking detainees from the Indy airport: Global X, which was flying regularly to another deportation hub in Harlingen, Texas. By Oct. 8, Eastern Air Express had taken over with weekly flights to Alexandria, Louisiana.

Both airlines did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Neither did Million Air, a fixed-base operator at the Indianapolis airport. The luxury company based in Houston services private planes at locations across the country with fuel, maintenance and ground support. It took care of celebrities and athletes flying in for the Indy 500 and NBA All-Star Weekend.

On Oct. 24, two Mirror Indy journalists observed an Eastern Air Express flight taxiing to Million Air’s facility off of Pierson Drive. They watched from the parking lot as workers set up stairs for boarding and began servicing the Boeing 737.

Before any people boarded, a Million Air employee told Mirror Indy’s reporter and photojournalist to leave.

“So these are ICE flights with detainees?” the reporter asked.

“This is private property,” the employee replied.

Mirror Indy then went to a public road and shot pictures of the flight from about 900 yards away. Photos show detainees lined up, waiting to board. They wore regular clothes — a requirement listed in the 2024 ICE Air Operations Handbook. The manual outlines how detainees must be fully restrained on the planes with handcuffs, shackles and leg irons.

“If the flight goes down, is someone going to unshackle them?” Joseph, the immigration attorney, asked.

Indy airport says it can’t stop ICE flights

The Indianapolis Airport Authority said the federal government does not have to tell them about the ICE flights, including their duration or frequency.

The airport was informed about ICE’s activities in September, a spokesperson said. ICE Flight Monitor tracked the federal agency using the airways in Indianapolis as early as July, though records show flights ramped up in September.

“The Indianapolis International Airport is a federally regulated public use facility,” an airport spokesperson said in an Oct. 22 statement to Mirror Indy. “The IAA must comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations and cannot interfere with or restrict federal and civil aviation activities.”

That answer — along with the silence of the airlines and companies involved — was not satisfying to advocates.

“I don’t think most Indy residents want an airport we really love to be part of a deportation machine,” said Josh Riddick, an organizer with Live Free Indiana. “We have to figure out who is passively sitting by while ICE expands its footprint in our city.”

The group has repeatedly protested the Marion County Sheriff’s Office for working with ICE this year to hold detainees in the local jail. From January through mid-October, records show nearly 800 people have been housed there at some point. The sheriff’s office does not transport detainees to the airport for ICE flights, a spokesperson said.

Two weeks ago, Riddick visited with immigrants inside Indy’s jail. Some, he said, were so defeated they agreed to voluntary departure. Others wanted to fight their cases.

That’s much harder, advocates say, once someone has been moved out of state in a few short hours. Deportation flights were common under the Bush, Obama and Biden administrations. But the scale has grown immensely under Trump 2.0, which is also transferring more people between states.

“These planes are going to Louisiana for a reason,” Riddick told Mirror Indy. “That’s a location where the government wins in court and expedites deportations. Our neighbors and friends are being put in a black box so the Trump administration can force a victory.”

‘Enough resistance’

Other communities across the country are reckoning with their airports becoming a pit-stop in the deportation process.

In Seattle, advocates are monitoring ICE flights with live video feeds and pressing the private airlines and companies involved to stop working with federal agents. In Massachusetts, ICE initially stopped flights at Hanscom Field after public outcry, but resumed them in September. And in New Hampshire, community members are demanding answers from the Pease County Development Authority — though officials there say the airport will lose all federal grants if it defies ICE.

“Ultimately, if all airports took a stand, ICE couldn’t operate,” said Megan Chapman, a human rights lawyer working to stop the flights at Portsmouth International Airport. “If there is enough resistance in enough places to slow things down, that allows more people to actually have their day in court.”

Indianapolis may be the next chapter in the fight.

“The airport has some control over who does business on their property and which companies they allow,” said Riddick, the organizer with Live Free Indiana. “Somebody is aware of this and they’ve been quiet about it.”

Joseph, the local immigration attorney, has her eyes set on the private companies involved in the Indianapolis flights: Eastern Air Express, Global X and Million Air.

To her, the answer is simple.

“We won’t support businesses that are helping tear families apart,” she said.

Pritzker signed Senate Bill 2487 into law, amending the Illinois Human Rights Act (“IHRA”), 775 ILCS 5/7A-102. Among other reforms going into effect on January 1, 2026, the legislation fundamentally changes how the Illinois Department of Human Rights (“IDHR” or the “Department”) processes charges of discrimination.

Most notably, the law eliminates mandatory fact-finding conferences. For decades, these conferences were a hallmark of the Department’s investigative approach, giving complainants, respondents, and the agency a chance to gather information early, test the strength of claims, and sometimes even prompt informal resolution. Their removal will change how employers, employees, and practitioners must navigate discrimination charges in Illinois.

Fact-Finding Conferences Generally

A fact-finding conference is essentially an informal, investigative meeting in which the Department brings the parties together to discuss the allegations in the charge of discrimination. The investigator can question witnesses, review documentary evidence, and attempt to clarify disputed facts. While not a mediation, these conferences often create opportunities for early settlement discussions. For employers, they also offer a critical chance to gain insight into the complainant’s allegations and to present documents and testimony before the Department issues a determination.

From Mandatory to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

Prior to Senate Bill 2487, fact-finding conferences were mandatory for nearly every charge of discrimination. An employer could only avoid this requirement if the charge was dismissed early, the Director issued a determination of substantial evidence, or the parties voluntarily agreed to waive the conference in writing. Nonattendance without good cause could result in dismissal of the charge or default judgment.

With the passage of the amendment, fact-finding conferences will be optional and occur only in limited circumstances.

If both the complainant and the respondent wish to have a fact-finding conference, they must make that request in writing within ninety (90) days of the charge being filed. Importantly, agreeing to a conference also means agreeing to extend the Department’s investigative deadline by an additional 120 days, giving the Department more time to complete its review. Even if the parties do not request one, the Department still has discretion to convene a conference on its own if it believes doing so would help clarify the case or resolve factual disputes.

The procedural rules surrounding attendance remain in place. If a conference is scheduled, the parties must appear. A complainant who fails to attend without good cause risks dismissal of the charge, while an employer who fails to appear can be held in default.

Rationale Behind the Switch to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

The legislature cited efficiency and backlog reduction as central reasons for eliminating mandatory fact-finding conferences. The Department has long struggled with processing times, and fact-finding conferences have historically been resource-intensive.

The amendment also brings Illinois more in line with federal practice, where charges of discrimination are typically investigated through written position statements, document requests, and interviews.

Impacts on Employers

Position Statements Matter More Than Ever: Without a guaranteed fact-finding conference, employers lose the chance to “fill in the gaps” or clarify their story in person. This means that the position statement and its supporting documentary evidence will likely carry more weight. Employers assume these filings will be the primary record on which the IDHR bases its determination.

Employers Face a Critical Choice: Employers must decide whether a fact-finding conference helps or hurts their case. Opting in would give employers the opportunity to see the complainant’s testimony and test their credibility, the chance to directly explain their defenses to the investigator, and a possible opening for early settlement. On the other hand, opting in extends the IDHR’s timeline by 120 days, prolonging uncertainty, gives the complainant a platform to expand or refine their claims, and increases legal fees and preparation time.

Fewer Early Settlement Opportunities: Employers can no longer count on fact-finding conferences to provide an informal settlement forum. Instead, employers who are open to early resolution should explore the Department’s voluntary mediation program or work with counsel to negotiate directly with the complainant.

The Trump administration has its eyes set on expanding ICE and is specifically targeting local police departments for recruitment.
Attempting to merge two autocratic institutions notorious for brutalizing minorities is a recipe for disaster — and an incredibly strategic move by the Trump administration.
Although the Keep Washington Working Act prohibits police from sharing surveillance data with ICE, SPD has a history of inappropriately using surveillance, including to spy on political groups.
“UW has continually said we can't stop ICE from coming on campus,” Chabaud said.","All over the United States, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been under fire for infringing on the rights of civilians and taking measures that are well beyond its jurisdiction. This ranges from detaining people without due process to detaining citizens, to forced entry into homes and smashing windows to pull suspected undocumented persons out of their cars.

With the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” in July, ICE’s budget has nearly tripled.

The Trump administration has its eyes set on expanding ICE and is specifically targeting local police departments for recruitment. U.S. police departments are infamous for racial profiling, use of excessive force, and abuse of power. Though hardly an outlier, SPD has an especially long history of alleged racism and unnecessary use of violence.

In 2020, a lawsuit was filed against SPD by Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County for its indiscriminate use of rubber bullets, tear gas, batons, and chemical irritants on protestors, medical personnel, journalists, and legal spectators as a means of “crowd control” during the George Floyd protests. SPD was found guilty of violating free speech rights for its actions.

The recent Keep Washington Working Act, passed by the Washington State Legislature, places limitations on how local police cooperate with ICE, but it doesn’t prevent them from joining. Attempting to merge two autocratic institutions notorious for brutalizing minorities is a recipe for disaster — and an incredibly strategic move by the Trump administration.

“It is a tool of authoritarianism, and it's a tool of fear, especially,” Mathieu Chabaud, chair of Students for a Democratic Society’s UW chapter, said. “We're seeing in Chicago, with the deployments of the National Guard, that these appointments are meant to make people feel afraid. They are meant to drive people into their homes, to make them fearful of going to work, to make them fearful of organizing.”

Chabaud also pointed out that Trump’s intimidation tactics disproportionately impact immigrant and Chicano communities.

“Now, ultimately, I think that the larger concern for me is not necessarily if SPD officers are quitting to go work for ICE, but if they're just working with ICE under the table … you have all these surveillance cameras, right? If they’re somehow accessing these surveillance records because they've gone through other agencies to request them,” Chabaud said.

ICE has been known to use surveillance databases to track people with the help of local law enforcement agencies. In 2019, it was revealed that ICE agencies in San Francisco used driver location data provided to them by local police for deportations, in violation of the California Values Act. Seattle is big on police surveillance, with new CCTV cameras and a “Real Time Crime Center” recently being approved despite community pushback about privacy concerns and misuse of the data. Although the Keep Washington Working Act prohibits police from sharing surveillance data with ICE, SPD has a history of inappropriately using surveillance, including to spy on political groups.

“I don't doubt that there are members of SPD, of UWPD, of all these private security officers hired through Seattle's finest that want to work with ICE under the table,” Chabaud said. “Whether that's calling up somebody that they know in ICE saying, ‘Hey, I saw this person today, I don't think that they're a citizen’ … or just outright breaking the law themselves and intimidating students on the basis of their immigration status.”

There are millions of illegal European immigrants in the U.S. Why isn’t ICE cracking down on them? The answer is simple. Obviously, racism plays a role, but when we look at the jobs minority immigrants tend to work — blue-collar, low-pay — it becomes very evident very quickly that the Trump administration is using ICE to scare historically underpaid and overworked communities out of unionizing and rebelling.

The general slanderous narratives that Republicans try to push about immigrants — that they’re rapists, that they’re criminals, that they steal jobs — are yet another tool used by the elite to sow division and to keep the masses from developing class consciousness and organizing against the real criminals: the billionaires, like Trump, who exploit us.

Immigrants are invaluable to our society. They contribute trillions to the GDP and housing wealth, and they keep our food system afloat, in part because their labor is so heavily exploited. They enrich our country with their cultures. But beyond their servitude, immigrants are human beings who deserve to be treated as such. No child should be ripped away from their family. No worker should be afraid that if they advocate for themselves, their bosses will get them thrown out of the country.

It’s going to take a lot of time, effort, and resources to change things on a national scale, but what we can do right now is take a stand on our campus.

“UW has continually said we can't stop ICE from coming on campus,” Chabaud said. “And every other university in Washington state is saying a very different thing: We will not allow ICE to come on campus, we will not provide them any resources.”

Earlier this year, UW hosted Homeland Security agents on campus for their ”Career as a Special Agent” workshop, prompting backlash and protests in response.

Chabaud raised important points about how, in addition to not actively bringing these agents on campus, UW can take many actions to help protect the immigrant student body. They can create and send out alerts if ICE comes to campus, provide training for staff and students about what to do if ICE comes on campus, and make sure they aren’t hiring campus security officers who would collaborate with ICE against UW’s students. He explained how SDS and other student activist groups and unions are pressuring UW to make those changes.

“I actually just happened to run into President [Robert] Jones on Friday, and very quickly it was clear that he wasn't happy with what we're doing,” Chabaud said. “But we wouldn't be doing what we're doing if we saw real action from this administration … it's his choices that mean that students are walking up to him every time that they see him on campus and asking, ‘Why aren't you doing more?’”

International and undocumented students are an important part of our UW community. UW needs to do more to protect them.

FROM THE WILDERNESS: Nearly a year out from the 2024 election, Democrats are still searching for their way out of the wilderness and looking for a unified direction amid concerns over a party brand that lost ground with key voting blocs. And with a little over a year until the midterms, the party’s moderate wing is pitching their way forward.

Among the biggest messaging battles Dems will confront going into next year is President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration agenda — from his pledges to carry out the largest mass deportation program in history to masked ICE agents conducting raids across major Democrat run-cities to the National Guard deployments to protect ICE agents.

First in Playbook: A new memo from centrist think tank Third Way finds an “electorate caught between two unsatisfying extremes: the cruelty of Trump’s policies and the perception that Democrats can’t maintain order at the border.” The latest data, shared exclusively with Playbook, shows that Democrats are still struggling to make inroads on immigration in the wake of a messy border policy under the Biden administration that is sticking in the minds of voters. Read the memo

The GOP dip: Support for Republicans’ handling of immigration slightly dropped from the last polling in March to September, down to 56 percent from 62 percent. But trust for Republicans’ handling of border security held steady at 66 percent.

But Dems aren’t breaking through: Democrats, meanwhile, “made modest but significant gains: their 30-point deficit on trust in immigration shrank to 20 points. Yet, the 40-point deficit on border security persisted. That’s a crucial distinction — because while voters are softening in their views toward Trump and his party on immigration overall, they still don’t trust Democrats to manage the border responsibly.” The report draws from a focus group of 55 swing voters and a national survey of 800 general election voters and 516 voters in battleground House districts.

But but but: The temptation for Democrats to blanket denounce all of the Trump administration’s most extreme measures is strong, but not effective, Third Way’s Sarah Pierce told Playbook. “They shouldn’t be criticizing everything the Trump administration is doing, because some of this is in line with what voters want to see,” she told Playbook. “Democrats really need to be putting themselves forward as joining voters on the ground they’re standing on.”

Who’s doing it right: Pierce pointed to Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), whose campaign in battleground Arizona could serve as a roadmap, she argued. “Ruben Gallego overperformed the entire Democratic ticket in Arizona and across the nation because of how he leaned into talking about immigration,” Chuck Rocha, who worked on Gallego’s campaign, told Playbook. Gallego would “have conversations with people about immigration, working in class economic issues … but the big thing he did was actually show up and listen.”

And Democrats’ challenge to break through on immigration spills into other key issues, per a new report out today.

It’s still the economy, stupid: The report from centrist WelcomePAC outlines how Democrats have to talk more about the economy and less about democracy, pushing a move toward kitchen table issues and moderate stances on immigration and crime, POLITICO’s Lisa Kashinsky reports. It features input from big names in Dem politics like David Axelrod, James Carville and David Plouffe to provide a sweeping analysis that is less an autopsy report and more an “indictment of the party’s leftward shift since the Obama administration.”

A woke-up call: The report, which was scooped by Semafor’s David Weigel, shows that a majority of voters believe Democrats are getting “out of touch” by focusing on LGBTQ+ rights and climate change. In the same vein, it warned elected Democrats to “abandon some of the progressive language about race, abortion, and LGBTQ issues that Democrats began using after the 2012 election — and recommends the nomination of more candidates willing to vote with Republicans on conservative immigration and crime bills.”

TRAIL MIX: We’re almost a week out from Election Day. Early voting in the NYC mayoral race is projecting high turnout for the off-year election, with more than 160,000 voting over the weekend, NYT’s Benjamin Oreskes and Maya King report. In Virginia, Dem candidate Abigail Spanberger maintains a comfortable lead in the race for governor despite an onslaught of attacks from GOP candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, NYT’s Reid Epstein writes.

That said, the middle-of-the-road Dem candidates running in Virginia and New Jersey have been underperforming compared to the ever-growing enthusiasm for Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani in NYC, WSJ’s Joseph De Avila and Anvee Bhutani write. Despite Spanberger and Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s leads, neither race is a lock, with concerns persisting about whether their messaging has broken through with voters.

An eye toward 2026: NYC Comptroller Brad Lander is privately planning a bid to challenge Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) next year, City & State New York’s Peter Sterne reports. … And Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner’s campaign manager, Kevin Brown, is leaving after just days on the job, Axios’ Holly Otterbein scoops.

7 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Hoosier hoopla: Fair Maps Indiana, a project of Defending America’s Comeback Inc., is launching a 501c4 nonprofit organization to back mid-cycle redistricting in the Hoosier State, Playbook’s Adam Wren reports. The effort comes ahead of next week’s special session called today by Gov. Mike Braun and is led by a number of Trump campaign alums, including top advisers and strategists Chris LaCivita, Chip Englander and John Brabender.

“States such as Illinois and California have gerrymandered their Congressional maps for decades,” said Marty Obst, who will serve as chair of Fair Maps Indiana. “The Indiana General Assembly has an opportunity to redraw the lines and play a meaningful role in maintaining our majorities in Congress. Our goal is to strongly support efforts to do so.”

The latest redistricting salvo: New York is joining in the redistricting arms race, as a new lawsuit filed by Elias Law Group today alleges that Rep. Nicole Malliotakis’ (R-N.Y.) district was unfairly drawn to disenfranchise voters of color, NYT’s Grace Ashford and Nick Corasaniti report. “Democrats may face an uphill battle convincing a judge that the current lines are unacceptable: It was just last year that they drew and approved the map, which Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, himself blessed as a modest but meaningful improvement over the previous lines.”

2. SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN: It’s day 27 of the shutdown, with paychecks missing and air travel delayed across the country. The pain has reached an inflection point for many federal workers: their largest union this morning called for an end to the shutdown and for Democrats to join Republicans to pass the “clean” stopgap funding bill, NBC’s Monica Alba scoops. “Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,” the American Federation of Government Employee statement reads.

Republicans are running out of patience as Democrats jam the Senate — once again confronting the thorny issue of the filibuster and whether to get rid of it, WSJ’s Lindsay Wise writes. But Democrats are working in lockstep, and they’re prepared to stick together on their strategy in the near future, CNN’s Sarah Ferris and Ellis Kim report.

This week: Talks abound about how to pay federal workers and air traffic controllers, with potential votes this week on those smaller bills, per Punchbowl. But these talks are still very much a work-in-progress, per Semafor’s Burgess Everett.

3. FED UP: The Federal Reserve’s next meeting kicks off tomorrow, where the central bank is widely expected to once again slash interest rates amid growing concerns on the slowing labor market. We could see a reduction of rates by a quarter of a percentage point come Wednesday, when Chair Jerome Powell makes his announcement, especially as the most recent inflation numbers proved cooler than expected, Reuters’ Ann Saphir reports.

Driving the decision: The Fed meeting comes not only as Trump is in Asia finalizing trade agreements, but also as the government shutdown prolongs the release of key government data that usually helps drive the Fed’s policy changes. The September jobs report wasn’t released and October data hasn’t been collected, the USDA’s export sales report hasn’t come out, key demographic data has been delayed.

The short list: Bessent confirmed the five finalists today being considered to succeed Powell and said Trump will make his final decision by the end of the year, Bloomberg’s Josh Wingrove reports. In the running: current Fed board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and BlackRock exec Rick Rieder. Bessent is doing another round of interviews and will give Trump a “good slate” after Thanksgiving.

4. WHERE’S THE BEEF?: Trump’s frustration with spiking beef prices and his vow to bring prices down have led the White House to lean on beef from Argentina, which “has spurred intense backlash from farm-state Republicans and agriculture industry groups who have felt burned by several Trump administration policies in recent months,” POLITICO’s Myah Ward and Grace Yarrow report. “Ten months in, Trump and his top aides are scrambling to keep the campaign pledge, calculating that in the short-term it’s worth antagonizing ranchers, a loyal GOP constituency that benefits from elevated beef prices, if they can bring down costs for consumers.”

5. WAR AND PEACE: Hungarian PM Viktor Orban said he will meet with Trump in an effort to blunt the effect that U.S. sanctions on Russian oil will have on Hungary, which relies on Moscow for oil and gas imports, Bloomberg’s Zoltan Simon and Marton Kasnyik report. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui to strengthen the countries’ military ties, Bloomberg’s Greg Sullivan reports.

Big read: “Is the U.S. Losing in Vietnam? Russia, North Korea and China Are Gaining,” by NYT’s Damien Cave: “U.S. allies worry that American volatility and Russian outreach and arms sales, in particular, are driving Vietnam into a new phase.”

6. YOU DON’T KNOW JACK: “How Jack Smith’s strongest case against Donald Trump collapsed,” by Aaron Davis and Carol Leonnig for WaPo, adapted from the pair’s forthcoming book, “Injustice: How Politics and Fear Vanquished America’s Justice Department” ($29.76): “This behind-the-scenes account reveals new details about the inner workings of [Jack] Smith’s highly secretive team as he pushed it to complete a historic investigation in record time … it recounts for the first time Smith’s effort to remove [Judge Aileen Cannon] from the case, an idea that a top Justice Department official rejected and that Smith never presented to Attorney General Merrick Garland.”

7. SECURITY DETAILS: “Hundreds of People With ‘Top Secret’ Clearance Exposed by House Democrats’ Website,” by Wired’s Lily Newman and Matt Burgess: “The people’s details were included in a database of more than 7,000 individuals who have applied for jobs over the last two years with Democrats in the [House]. … The researcher found data including applicants’ short written biographies and fields indicating military service, security clearances, and languages spoken, along with details like names, phone numbers, and email addresses. … The data also included information about people’s political affiliations.”

TALK OF THE TOWN

BILL OF HEALTH — Trump said he underwent an MRI scan during his trip to Walter Reed Medical Center, but did not say why or which part of his body was scanned, POLITICO’s Dan Goldberg reports. “It was perfect,” Trump told reporters.

MEDIA MOVES — “CBS Evening News” co-anchor John Dickerson is leaving the network in mid-December, according to an internal announcement scooped by The Guardian’s Jeremy Barr. … Caitlin Valleskey is now an event manager at NOTUS. She previously was at the DNC.

TRANSITIONS — Susan Musser is joining WilmerHale as an antitrust and competition partner. She previously worked at the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. … Amanda Wait is joining Michael Best as partner in the firm’s antitrust and competition practice. She previously worked at DLA Piper, and is an FTC alum. … Will King is now working in government relations at BP America Inc. He previously worked on the House Natural Resources Committee.

The U.S. military has been carrying out air and sea strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and off the coast of Venezuela.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the military has conducted its 10th strike so far — and there’s talk of land strikes coming next.
The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it.
… The drug war, or the crime war, has typically been dealt with through law enforcement, and so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers … and we’ve had no evidence presented.","When it comes to fighting America’s drug problem, the Trump administration seems to have traded courtrooms for combat zones. The U.S. military has been carrying out air and sea strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and off the coast of Venezuela.

Officials say these operations are meant to stop “narco-terrorists” before they reach our shores, but here’s the problem: we don’t actually know who’s being killed, or what evidence proves they were drug traffickers in the first place.

According to the administration, at least 43 people have been killed since this campaign began. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the military has conducted its 10th strike so far — and there’s talk of land strikes coming next. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) even told CBS News that he thinks President Trump has decided “it’s time for Maduro to go,” talking about the Venezuelan leader and calling land strikes a “real possibility.”

Graham then doubled down, saying the military will “kill the people that want to poison America.”

But let’s pause. Because while Graham sounds ready to invade and escalate, other lawmakers — even Republicans — are sounding the alarm. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a longtime defender of the Constitution, went on “Fox News Sunday” and said he’s never been invited to any briefing about these attacks.

“A briefing is not enough to overcome the Constitution. The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it. … The drug war, or the crime war, has typically been dealt with through law enforcement, and so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers … and we’ve had no evidence presented. So at this point we would call them extrajudicial killings.”

Paul didn’t stop there. “At this point,” he said, “this is what China does, this is what Iran does without ever presenting any evidence to the public. So it’s wrong.”

And that’s really the point — America was built on checks and balances. We’re supposed to be the country that demands proof before punishment, not one that bombs suspects at sea without due process.

Yet the White House is openly suggesting it doesn’t need Congress. Trump even told reporters, “We’ll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we are doing … but we don’t have to do that.”

So, let me get this straight. If 43 people were killed in a law enforcement operation, with no evidence shown, no transparency, and no vote from Congress — what exactly do we call that? “The war on drugs” or “the war without rules”?

Because when a government decides it can kill whoever it labels a criminal — without trial, without proof, and without oversight — that’s not a show of strength. That’s a red flag.

At the very least, Americans deserve answers. Who was killed? Why? And under what legal authority? Until we know that, calling these “extrajudicial killings” isn’t radical — it’s reality.

In separate letters sent to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last week, ACE called for an exemption for higher education institutions from the new $100,000 H-1B application fee—now in effect following the launch of DHS’s official payment portal and accompanying guidance from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)—and urged withdrawal of a new rule that would prioritize H-1B visa petitions based on wage levels.

Both policies stemmed from President Trump’s Sept. 19 proclamation, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers. Together, the groups warned, they would undermine U.S. colleges and universities’ ability to attract global talent and fulfill their role in educating the domestic workforce for high-demand sectors.

Higher Education Calls for Exemption from $100,000 H-1B Fee

ACE and 29 higher education associations are urging DHS to exempt colleges and universities from the new $100,000 fee now being implemented for H-1B visa applications.

In an Oct. 23 letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, the associations said the Sept. 19 presidential proclamation establishing the fee would place an “extraordinary and unnecessary burden” on institutions that rely on H-1B visa holders to teach, conduct research, and provide medical and technical expertise in areas of national need—including health care, engineering, and computer science.

The groups noted that the proclamation allows DHS to issue exemptions in the national interest and called on the department to recognize higher education’s central role in training the U.S. workforce.

They also requested clarification on how DHS will implement the fee, including whether the payment will be refunded for denied petitions, how it will affect changes of status, and what metrics will determine when no U.S. worker is available for a role.

The USCIS guidance released alongside the portal clarified that the fee applies to new petitions for individuals outside the United States and does not appear to cover F-1 students transitioning to H-1B status. However, many other aspects of the policy remain unclear.

Citing data from CUPA-HR showing that more than 70 percent of H-1B faculty hold tenure-track or tenured positions, the letter emphasized that colleges and universities already operate under strict hiring and compliance requirements. The associations asked DHS to ensure higher education is treated consistently with its long-standing exemption from the H-1B lottery cap, granted by Congress in recognition of its national-interest role.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers also sent a letter to President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week warning that the fee is “prohibitively expensive” and could harm small employers and innovation. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a legal challenge, and additional lawsuits are underway.

ACE Opposes DHS Proposal to Prioritize H-1B Visas by Wage Level

ACE and 18 other higher education associations are also urging DHS to withdraw a proposed rule that would prioritize H-1B visa petitions based on wage levels, warning that it would disadvantage international graduates of U.S. colleges and universities and discourage new student enrollment.

In Oct. 24 comments submitted to DHS, the associations said the rule “would dramatically reduce access to the H-1B visa program for early career professionals, including those who have completed master’s or doctoral degrees at U.S. institutions of higher education.” They added that the policy would also harm foreign-born medical residents and other professionals in critical national-need areas.

“America’s colleges and universities are among the finest in the world,” they wrote in the comments. “This proposed rule will limit the ability of our institutions to recruit and retain talented students, especially those who wish to remain in the United States.”

The associations warned that the change could exacerbate an ongoing drop in international student enrollment. A recent NAFSA survey found potential declines of 30–40 percent in international enrollment for the 2025–26 academic year, representing an estimated $7 billion loss to the U.S. economy.

50, said those numbers “are not unusual” since Latino voters tend to lag other ethnic and racial groups in casting ballots.","As in-person voting begins in California’s special election on redistricting, Gov. Gavin Newsom has repeatedly asserted that the Trump administration could send immigration agents to polling places in an attempt to intimidate voters and depress turnout.

The governor’s warnings, while unspecific, speak to what community leaders call real, palpable fears within some Latino communities that immigration agents could show up on Election Day. And ever since the Supreme Court greenlit using racial profiling in immigration stops, even U.S. citizens are scared they could be detained simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

“You’re going to likely see members of our military in and around polling booths and voting places all across this country,” Newsom warned last week during a virtual event with former President Barack Obama in support of Proposition 50. “I would say the same about ICE and Border Patrol, and I say that soberly.”

Newsom has not provided any evidence to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will deploy immigration agents to polling sites. But he pointed to the Los Angeles campaign launch event for Prop. 50, his plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats, where federal immigration agents blocked supporters from entering the area and detained a nearby strawberry vendor.

A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement wrote in a statement that the agency “is not planning operations targeting polling locations,"" but that if agents are tracking ""a dangerous criminal alien"" who goes near a voting site they could be arrested there. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Patrol did not respond to emailed questions.

The governor argues that the Trump administration’s indiscriminate immigration raids, military and National Guard deployments are intended to suppress Democratic voters and keep Republicans in control of Congress for the duration of Trump’s presidency.

“We know the intention of this administration — to rig next year’s midterms,” Newsom told reporters recently. “It’s absolutely predictable. It’s a script that’s been written for centuries. It’s the authoritarian playbook.”

The Trump administration’s Justice Department announced on Friday that it will deploy personnel to monitor polling sites in five counties: Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside on Election Day. Fresno, Kern and Riverside counties are majority Latino.

The poll monitors will “ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law,” according to the department. The administration has not said whether the agents will be stationed at polling sites in addition to county election offices where ballots are counted.

Democrats denounced the plan.

“Deploying federal forces to ‘monitor’ elections is nothing more than an intimidation tactic meant to suppress the vote,” said Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party. “What Republicans are really afraid of is record voter participation and a clear verdict from the people of California in support of Prop 50.”

‘Alarming’ number of Latinos fear ICE at polls

The vast majority of Californians vote by mail, especially since the state adopted universal mail-in voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Just over 80% of votes cast in the 2024 presidential election were mail-in ballots.

But casting a ballot in-person on Election Day is a point of pride for many American immigrants, especially Latinos, said Yvette Martinez, executive director of the California Democratic Party.

“It’s a cultural thing,” said Martinez. “People want to show up and say, ‘I’m patriotic, here’s my civic duty. I’m here to vote, I’m here to make my voice heard. And when you quell that, it’s dangerous. And it’s actually sad.”

In a September survey of 1,200 registered Latino voters conducted by the Latino Community Foundation, a nonprofit that funds Latino advocacy, 53% said they planned to vote in person. Of those, more than half said they would vote on Election Day.

The same survey also found that two-thirds of the Latino voters surveyed said they were at least somewhat worried that ICE or Border Patrol agents could show up at polling places. The poll had a sampling error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

“These are citizens of this country. And if they are concerned about immigration or any type of federal presence at in-person voting sites, that is alarming,” said Christian Arana, who leads policy strategy for the foundation.

“If people want to vote in person, it is their fundamental right,” Arana said. “I never want us to buy into the fear that you can't participate in democracy because immigration enforcement may show up.”

Hendricks for CalMatters So far in the race for Prop. 50, only 9% of registered Latino voters have returned their ballots, according to the most recent data available from Political Data Inc., compared to 19% of white voters and 13% of Black voters. California pollster Ben Tulchin, who recently surveyed Latino voters about Prop. 50, said those numbers “are not unusual” since Latino voters tend to lag other ethnic and racial groups in casting ballots.

Sen. Anna Caballero, Democrat of Merced, said U.S. citizens told her they’re afraid to go outside, especially when there have been reports of ICE sightings in the region. Many of her constituents come from mixed-status families in which some family members are citizens and others aren’t. She blames the Trump administration for terrifying those families so much that they don’t want to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary.

“This idea that all you have to do is pull out your driver's license, or pull out some kind of documentation, that's a fantasy,” said Caballero. “U.S. citizens have been detained and taken into custody.”

A recent investigation by ProPublica found that at least 170 U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained by ICE since the second Trump administration took office, prompting intense criticism from opponents. Top Democrats on the House and Senate government oversight committees, Rep. Robert Garcia of California and Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, have opened an investigation.

Assemblymember Esmeralda Soria, another Merced Democrat and the daughter of Mexican immigrants, said ever since the Supreme Court issued its racial profiling ruling earlier this summer, she keeps her passport in her bag at all times.

“Just because you may look like an immigrant — which I don't even know what that really means — you know, I could also be targeted,” Soria said.

‘My voice will be heard’

Opponents of Newsom’s redistricting plan say the governor’s warnings about Election Day intimidation and interference from federal agents are exaggerated.

“People see it for what it is. It’s politics, it’s headline-grabbing,” said Hector Barajas, a spokesperson for the No on 50 campaign.

Barajas denounced Democrats for what he said was intentional disenfranchisement of nonwhite voters, since white college-educated voters are historically far more likely to turn out during off-year elections.

“This is what happens with special elections, is people don't turn out to vote, especially Hispanics, which is a sad tragedy in itself,” Barajas said.

Martinez said Democratic Party volunteers are for the first time urging voters to return their ballots early via mail or drop-off when they go door to door and handing out pamphlets with instructions for how to report any suspicious activity near polling sites.

The party has also trained hundreds of volunteers as poll watchers who will monitor polling sites for signs of intimidation or federal interference starting the weekend before Election Day.

Arana, with the Latino Community Foundation, said he’s choosing to vote in person as an act of defiance.

The death of Josué Castro Rivera follows recent incidents in which three other immigrants in Chicago and California were killed during immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration’s crackdown.

Castro Rivera was headed to a gardening job Thursday when his vehicle was pulled over by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, brother Henry Castro said.

Agents tried to detain Castro Rivera and the three other passengers, and he fled on foot, tried to cross Interstate 264 in Norfolk and was fatally struck, according to state and federal authorities.

Castro Rivera came to the United States four years ago and was working to send money to family in Honduras, according to his brother.

“He had a very good heart,” Castro said Sunday.

The Department of Homeland Security said Castro Rivera’s vehicle was stopped by ICE as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based” operation and passengers were detained for allegedly living in the country without legal permission.

DHS said in a statement that Castro Rivera “resisted heavily and fled” and died after a passing vehicle struck him. DHS officials did not respond Sunday to requests for further comment.

Virginia State Police said officers responded to a report of a vehicle-pedestrian crash around 11 a.m. Thursday on eastbound I-264 at the Military Highway interchange. Police said Rivera was hit by a 2002 Ford pickup and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The crash remains under investigation.

Federal authorities and state police gave his first name as Jose, but family members said it was Josué. DHS and state police did not explain the discrepancy.

Castro called his brother’s death an injustice and said he is raising money to transport the body back to Honduras for funeral.

“He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him,” Castro said.

DHS blamed Castro Rivera’s death on “a direct result of every politician, activist and reporter who continue to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission and ways to avoid detention.”

Similar deaths amid immigration operations elsewhere have triggered protests, lawsuits and calls for investigation amid claims that the Trump administration’s initial accounts are misleading.

Last month in suburban Chicago, federal immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican man during a traffic stop. DHS initially said a federal officer was “seriously injured,” but police body camera video showed the federal officer walking around and describing his own injuries as “ nothing major.”

In July a farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic ICE raid at a California cannabis facility died of his injuries. And in August a man ran away from federal agents onto a freeway in the same state and was fatally struck by a vehicle.

Jim Pillen’s plans to convert a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings.
State and federal officials have said they expect to house the first detainees by the end of this week.
“When the Legislature delegates authority, it may place such restrictions and limitations on that authority it chooses,” Heng continued.
Heng also ruled that Nebraska law broadly gives the state the authority to house anyone “committed” to the Corrections Department, including federal detainees.","LINCOLN — A district court judge in southwest Nebraska will let the state move forward with Gov. Jim Pillen’s plans to convert a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings.

Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng, in a 17-page ruling Monday, ruled that Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, did not violate the Nebraska Constitution or state law by entering into a Sept. 30 contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to convert the state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook into a regional ICE detention center.

ICE certified the facility last week, Pillen announced Thursday. State and federal officials have said they expect to house the first detainees by the end of this week. A hearing on the motion was held Friday, and the lawsuit will continue.

“It is clear that the current situation with the department and ICE detainees was never contemplated when the statutes were created, but the language utilized by the Legislature is broad enough to allow the defendants to take the action they have chosen,” Heng wrote.

Pillen and federal officials announced the Nebraska-ICE partnership Aug. 19. Jeffreys signed the contract on Sept. 30, which was released to the public Oct. 17, two days after the lawsuit was filed.

A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office referred questions to the Governor’s Office, and Pillen’s office had no immediate comment.

Nebraska Appleseed attorneys who filed the lawsuit Oct. 15 on behalf of 13 McCook residents and former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, expressed disappointment that the court did not stop the changes.

In a statement, Robert McEwen, Appleseed’s legal director, said he was pleased that Heng had let the case keep moving forward.

“The case will carry forward from here, and we will continue to represent the interests of our clients in halting the activities of the defendants as they relate to the large-scale detainment camp in McCook.”

Schimek was one of the original lawmakers who authorized the creation of the state’s Work Ethic Camp in 1997. It opened in 2001.

She and the taxpayers argued Pillen and Jeffreys were trying to “usurp” legislative authority by converting the McCook facility’s legislatively directed usage without first receiving legislative approval.

Heng overruled a state motion to dismiss the lawsuit — saying the taxpayers had a legal right to challenge the matter — but he denied a request to pause the state-federal partnership.

Heng also ruled that the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden of having the standing to sue, even as state attorneys for Pillen and Jeffreys had argued others might be better suited to challenge the action, such as the Legislature, displaced state inmates from the McCook facility or future federal detainees., he said the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden.

In denying the request for a temporary injunction, Heng pointed to the Nebraska Constitution’s requirement that the “general management, control and government” of all state penal institutions is done by the Legislature. His major question was whether the Legislature had delegated that authority.

“The answer is obviously, ‘yes,’” Heng wrote.

He pointed to the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and the authority of the governor to appoint a director, who then has general oversight of corrections oversight. Heng also ruled that Pillen and the executive branch have broad authority to enter contracts with the federal government.

“When the Legislature delegates authority, it may place such restrictions and limitations on that authority it chooses,” Heng continued. “It has not done so here.”

To pause the Nebraska-ICE deal, Heng said the 14 taxpayers would have needed to show “irreparable harm,” probable success of succeeding on the merits and a balance of hardships in favor of the taxpayers over the government. Heng wrote that he was not yet convinced the plaintiffs were likely to succeed.

Heng also ruled that Nebraska law broadly gives the state the authority to house anyone “committed” to the Corrections Department, including federal detainees.

Heng said that while state law requires a work ethic camp, it doesn’t require one in McCook or Red Willow County. He said the location is a decision left to the corrections director, who has signed a sworn statement saying the rehabilitation offerings at the former McCook facility would be available at other state facilities.

“If there is not such a facility for qualified inmates,” Heng said, “that is not the subject matter of this lawsuit.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2560-scaled-e1761585676122-2048x1207.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:01:30.370856

Those decisions may make it harder to challenge the administration’s spending cuts, though the high court has not yet considered their ultimate legality or overturned lower court rulings.","Congress has the constitutional power of the purse, but President Donald Trump’s robust assertion of executive authority is testing even that basic tenet of U.S. democracy.

His administration has already canceled or threatened to cancel billions of dollars of previously approved federal spending and now wants to go after even more funding during the government shutdown .

States, cities, nonprofits and other groups have responded with more than 150 lawsuits accusing the Republican administration of an unlawful power grab.

An Associated Press analysis shows that so far, those suits are mostly succeeding in blocking the Republican president's spending moves, at least temporarily. But most of the legal battles are far from over, and the Supreme Court, where Trump so far has been more successful , could have the final word on at least some of them.

The court's conservative majority has been receptive at least in preliminary rulings to many emergency appeals from the administration. Legal experts say a pair of recent decisions by the court may bode well for the administration's push to gain more control over government spending. Here’s a look at the current legal score and what could lie ahead:

Courts have mostly ruled against the administration so far

As of early October, court orders were at least temporarily blocking the Trump administration’s decisions in 66 of 152 lawsuits over federal spending, an AP analysis shows. In 37 of those cases, courts had allowed the administration to proceed. In 26 of the cases, a judge had yet to rule on the matter. The remaining 23 had either been dropped or consolidated.

The count reflects decisions by district courts, appeals courts and the U.S. Supreme Court and will almost certainly change as the cases progress.

The flurry of litigation reflects not only the administration’s aggressive effort to wrest control of spending, but the Republican-controlled Congress’ unwillingness to push back, said Zachary Price, a constitutional law professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.

“Congress seems to be following its partisan interests more than its institutional interests, and that puts a lot of pressure on courts,” he said.

It's hard to say how much money the administration has withheld

Government watchdogs say the administration is blatantly ignoring a requirement in the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to report funding freezes to Congress.

Research by Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees estimated the administration was freezing, canceling or seeking to block a total of $410 billion as of early September. That's equivalent to about 6% of the federal budget for the year that ended on Sept. 30.

The administration has disputed that number.

Since the shutdown started this month, the administration has targeted even more funding , primarily in places represented by Democrats.

The Trump administration is taking a page from Nixon

Legal scholars say no president has attempted massive, unilateral cuts like these since Richard Nixon. The moves reflect an expansive view of executive power that is at odds with the Impoundment Control Act, court rulings and the Constitution, which grants Congress supremacy over spending, experts say.

""The power they’ve claimed is the power to delay and withhold funds throughout the year without input from Congress,"" said Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel with Protect Democracy, which is involved in multiple lawsuits against the administration. ""That’s a theft of Congress’ power of the purse.”

In a message to Congress earlier this year, the White House said it was “committed to getting America’s fiscal house in order by cutting government spending that is woke, weaponized, and wasteful.”

White House budget director Russ Vought, a proponent of withholding federal funds, has argued presidents long had the power to spend less money than Congress appropriated if they could cut waste or be more efficient, and that power is needed to address the country's massive debt.

The government shutdown opened up a new opportunity to cut spending, he said this month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.""

""If I can only work on saving money, then I’m going to do everything I can to look for opportunities to downsize in areas where this administration has thought, ‘This is our way towards a balanced budget.’”

The administration has cut entire agencies

The 152 cases the AP identified challenge the closure of government agencies and offices, the cancellation of grants and other assistance and the attachment of new conditions on federal funding.

The administration has used the cuts, or threat of cuts, to try to impose its policies on gender , race , immigration and other issues.

But it’s not just money on the line. The funds supported jobs, school lunches, health programs, scientific research, infrastructure projects, foreign assistance, disaster preparedness, education initiatives and other programs.

Some notable rulings against the administration include the restoration of funding to 14 states that filed suit over nearly $2 billion withheld for electric car chargers and a block on potentially broad funding cuts to some of the country’s largest cities over their “sanctuary” immigration policies.

Judges have raised constitutional concerns

Judges who have ruled against the administration have often found strong reason to conclude the cuts, or threat of cuts, would violate the Constitution's separation of powers by usurping Congress' authority over spending.

They have also ruled the moves were most likely arbitrary under the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.

Judges who have sided with the administration have likened at least some of the legal claims before them to contract disputes that belong in a different court: the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

That court, which traces its origins to the mid-1800s, handles lawsuits by citizens seeking money from the federal government. Referred to as “the People's Court,” it is separate from the district courts that are handling most of the high-profile litigation against the administration.

The Supreme Court has often sided with the White House

The high court's conservative justices have allowed the administration to move ahead for now with plans to shutter the Education Department , freeze $5 billion in foreign aid and cut hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training and research supported by the National Institutes of Health .

Those decisions may make it harder to challenge the administration’s spending cuts, though the high court has not yet considered their ultimate legality or overturned lower court rulings.

In the National Institutes of Health case, the high court ruled 5-4 in August that lawsuits over the cancellation of grant funding generally cannot be handled entirely by federal district courts. Instead, plaintiffs must sue in federal claims court for any money and turn to the district courts if they want to challenge the guidance that led to the grant terminations.

The impact of the Supreme Court’s decision is still unfolding, but it could force plaintiffs in the grant funding cases to start over in a new courtroom. In some cases, plaintiffs might have to decide if they want to sue on two fronts.

In the foreign aid case, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision in September suggested the Impoundment Control Act did not give private parties the right to sue over so-called pocket rescissions .

That's when the president submits a request to Congress not to spend approved money, but does it so late in the fiscal year that Congress doesn't have time to act and the funds go unspent.

Trump notified House Speaker Mike Johnson in August of a pocket rescission for the $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid , effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Though the Supreme Court stressed its decision was preliminary, legal experts say it could make it easier for the Trump administration to use the tactic again.

Like Gibran, we will assert: “You have your America, I have my America.”","A century ago, Gibran Khalil Gibran wrote a love poem to Lebanon, ""You have your Lebanon, I have my Lebanon."" He spoke of his affection for the captivating qualities of generosity and hospitality of the Lebanese people and the sheer beauty of the country and contrasted this with Lebanon’s petty, bickering politicians who sought nothing more than their own aggrandizement. When I read this poem, I saw parallels between the understanding of the contradictions at play in Lebanon and those in my country, the United States of America.

Today, many Americans are living in fear and even despair as they watch their president, seemingly unchecked, tearing down some of the foundations of democracy and gutting social and economic programs that have for decades provided for the safety, security, and well-being of millions. They ask: “How could this be happening?” and “Can our country survive this onslaught?”

But, as has always been the case in America, while some have felt hopeless, others are driven to respond. And so it was that a week ago, seven million Americans took to the streets in 2,700 cities and towns to demonstrate their resolve to save America’s democracy and arrest the drift toward authoritarianism.

All of this should serve as a reminder that there have always been these two Americas: one pushing to restrict democratic freedoms and the other working to expand them. Both have defined our history.

America, after all, was born with the original sins of genocide against native peoples, the forced enslavement of Africans, and the annexation and subjugation of Spanish-speaking peoples of the Southwest. As the country grew and attracted immigrants, these newcomers, whether they were Irish, Italians, Central Europeans, Jews, or Arabs were often met with discrimination, repression, and even violence.

This, however, was always only one part of America’s story. On the other side, for every racist, segregationist, anti-immigrant bigot, there were abolitionists who fought slavery, and organized movements that championed immigrants, labor, and civil rights for Blacks, Latinos, and Native peoples. And in the last century, for every xenophobe like Fr. Coughlin or Pat Buchanan, or segregationist like Bull Connor or George Wallace, there was a Martin Luther King, Caesar Chavez, and Jesse Jackson. And despite persistent bigotry and waves of recurring anti-immigrant bigotry, what remains are the core of Dr. King’s “I have a dream” speech and the spirit of the Statue of Liberty’s words welcoming the “tired and poor, yearning to be free.”

This is my family’s story. While my father’s mother and siblings were all able to immigrate to America after World War I, he was delayed and then unable to secure a visa because Congress determined that there were too many immigrants from the Mediterranean region. (One Senator famously said, “We don’t need any more Syrian trash in America.”) Eager to reunite with his family, he got a job on a ship sailing to Canada and then crossed into the US without documents in 1923. He received amnesty in the 1930s and became a citizen in 1943. Four decades later I was serving as a deputy campaign manager for Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign and was given to opportunity to place his name in nomination at the 1984 Democratic Convention.

Reflecting on my personal history as a metaphor for the broader American story, I noted in my speech that “I am the son of an illegal immigrant who is nominating for president the great grandson of a slave. Nowhere else but America could this happen.”

It’s important to remember that these two Americas are always with us. And we must never forget either one. If we forget the threats and challenges to freedom, we let down our guard and become vulnerable to the assaults when they come. But if we forget the promise of America and fail to recall the heroes and movements who in every generation have fought and won, then we lose hope and fail to meet the challenges before us.

And so, to those who despair and say that what is happening today is” un-American” as they witness efforts to gut voting rights, curtail immigration, use of military force to violently expel migrants and threaten freedom of speech and assembly—we must respond that we've been here before and we’ve always risen up to confront these threats to liberty. And we’ve won.

The bottom line is that we should remember that we’ve been through other dark periods in our history. In my lifetime, we’ve witnessed: the hysteria and repression of the McCarthy era’s manufactured anti-Communism scare; the racism and violence that followed the civil rights movement; the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Dr. King; the deeply polarizing Vietnam war; the national trauma of 9/11 and the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hate crimes and government repression that followed; and the disastrous failed wars against Afghanistan and Iraq. Each time, we rose to meet these challenges.

Given our history, I feel confident that in the face of today’s xenophobia, racism, repression, and hate, we will rise again. Like Gibran, we will assert: “You have your America, I have my America.”",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61940957&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C421%2C0%2C421,N,,2025-10-27 14:01:45.718401

What was supposed to be a Halloween parade in Old Irving Park turned to chaos as ICE agents appeared to deploy tear gas through residential streets last week. Outrage was sparked by the arrest of construction worker, Luis Villegas, whose family says he was working on a now-unfinished project before he was chased down and arrested by federal agents.

Tensions continued to grow after Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino was photographed allegedly hauling a tear gas canister at protesters in little village. Monday morning, Bovino defended his actions.

""When we utilize force in law enforcement, this is in law enforcement in general: As we use force, it's the least amount of force necessary to affect an arrest or to affect the successful outcome of any given mission that we're on,"" Bovino said. ""So, whether it's the use of tear gas, or the use of hand techniques or any use of force by law enforcement, that's that least amount of force necessary to positively affect the outcome of that mission. And that's what we do here in Chicago.""

The incident stirred fear among residents and led to a statement from the village’s mayor.

What we know:

The incident occurred around 8:45 a.m. Sunday in the parking lot of 390 W. Lake St. in Addison, according to Addison police.

Officers responded to a report of a disturbance and found Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the area. Police said a crowd gathered and officers ""ensured the safety of the public until the area was clear.""

Authorities did not release additional details about the incident and said no Addison officers took part in any federal immigration enforcement.

An area business posted a live video on Facebook, showing federal agents surrounding a vehicle in the parking lot and breaking a window with people inside.

The agents were then seen detaining at least one person and putting her inside their vehicle. Further details haven't been released.

Mayor speaks out:

Mayor Tom Hundley addressed residents’ concerns in a statement on social media.

""I want to acknowledge the concern many residents are feeling in light of recent immigration enforcement activity in our area. These events have understandably caused fear and uncertainty, and I want to assure you that your safety and dignity matter to me.

""While immigration enforcement is a federal matter and outside the authority of our local government, I want to reaffirm what the Police Department has already shared: our officers do not assist with federal immigration operations, do not inquire about immigration status, and are bound by the Illinois Trust Act to preclude involvement in such enforcement. Any federal presence in Addison has occurred without coordination or support from our police department.

""During any ongoing incident, our Police Department may respond to the area, just like we do for the Addison Fire Protection District. This is solely to ensure that bystanders are safe, traffic does not become an issue, and the area is secure. This is their only role.

""Addison is a diverse and vibrant community, and we are stronger because of the people who live and work here. Though our ability to intervene in federal matters is limited, I remain committed to ensuring that our Village continues to be a respectful and welcoming place for all.""

Inside an empty salon, owner Maky Munoz sits in a styling chair getting her hair dyed by the only employee on the clock. The pair don’t have any clients at the moment.

It’s an unusual case for a salon that used to be full of customers waiting for a haircut. Clients could hear razors buzzing, blow dryers going off and chatter between staff and employees.

The majority of her clientele now remains at home, she says, afraid to spend money due to immigration enforcement and rumors of increased activity in east Tulsa, the center of Latino life in the city. Her sales have dropped 75%.

Munoz is one of many local business owners in the area who are feeling the impacts of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign. There has been an increasing number of Immigration and Custom Enforcement sightings in recent months, leaving many in the community afraid to venture outside of their home.

An August research paper showed increased immigration enforcement has led to “economic damage” to construction, agriculture and leisure and hospitality industries, mostly from losing immigrant workers. The U.S. economy was already seeing a reduction in its immigrant workforce in 2024, according to the study.

On the ground, things look starker. There are widespread reports of immigrants across the country who are “reluctant” to show up for work because of fear that they or family members will be apprehended.

This fall, Munoz has noticed her regulars have more fear of ICE agents, especially when it comes to going to work, and are paying close attention to their presence in the community.

“They tell me, ‘Cut my hair short because I’m not coming back, I’m scared. I have my kids. They’re off to school. I’m putting myself at risk,’” Munoz said.

Rey Villalobos, owner of the restaurant La Torta Loca, saw a 30% drop in sales this summer at his restaurant inside Plaza Santa Cecilia. The plaza, home to restaurants, boutiques and clothing stores, has seen less foot traffic in recent years. Rumors of ICE’s presence in the area doesn’t help.

Villalobos has sold tortas there for seven years. Typically, he sells the best on the weekends, but that isn’t the case lately.

“July was probably one of the worst months we’ve had in a long time,” he said. “It just felt dead here. You could feel it in the air, like, nobody wanted to come by here, and I mean, it’s understandable.”

If Hispanics — his main clientele — are impacted, the business as a whole will feel the consequences, he said. People have told Villalobos that they’re saving money to return to Mexico.

“I imagine people don’t want to buy things, invest in stuff, buy cars for the reason of ‘I could be deported,’” he said.

He’s seen sales bounce back to normal with the arrival of fall, and the lunch rush of customers is slowly flowing back.

The fear, he said, remains. People are more aware of ICE’s presence and cautious in case something happens, he said.

Similarly, Karla Cruz has noticed fewer people coming out to spend money lately. The owner of Bellisima Boutique in Plaza Santa Cecilia said she understands people are scared but rent is still due at the end of each month.

Cruz sometimes has weeks where she doesn’t sell any items at the boutique and barely makes enough to stay open. Before the increase in immigration enforcement, she said people would at least come out and look at the store.

“If (people) do come, they’re coming fast and buying what they need and not stopping by and looking at the other stores anymore,” she said.

Sara Melgoza, who works at a furniture store in east Tulsa, noticed gas stations that were typically packed with customers were empty after social media posts about ICE being present near 21st and Garnett streets.

“It wasn’t only the day they said ICE was there, but the following day, too,” Melgoza said. “That week you could tell the terror that happens when they’re scared about a situation.”

Munoz, the salon owner, said she doesn’t just miss the sales but her clients as well. Fewer people of color and families are coming in for haircuts and the occasional therapy session that the salon provided.

“We just have to wait and see if all of this gets any better,” Munoz said. “It’s not easy to leave your country and be hit with the wolf.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2cea6da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2722x1429+0+44/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Faa%2F41%2F36c4ae6f4a19a31eb017d18f522b%2Fvillalobos-1.png,N,,2025-10-27 14:16:55.166522

The district is represented by Representative Nicole Malliotakis, the only Republican member of Congress in New York City.
This lawsuit was filed by Elias Law Group, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that has handled much of the party’s redistricting litigation.
Mike Braun, a Republican, called a special legislative session to redraw congressional maps in his state.
That commission was first responsible for drawing the state’s congressional and legislative district maps ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.","A lawsuit filed on Monday on behalf of four New Yorkers charges that the state’s congressional map unconstitutionally dilutes Black and Latino votes in a district that covers Staten Island and part of southern Brooklyn, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times.

The case marked New York’s official entrance into the national gerrymandering arms race. Rewriting the state’s existing congressional districts represents one of Democrats’ best hopes of improving their chances in the 2026 midterm elections.

Filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the lawsuit argues that the lines for the 11th Congressional District unfairly disenfranchise Black and Latino residents under the state’s newly passed Voting Rights Act. The district is represented by Representative Nicole Malliotakis, the only Republican member of Congress in New York City.

The combined Black and Latino population on Staten Island has grown from 11 percent to 30 percent over the past 40 years, the suit notes, arguing that the current boundaries “confine Staten Island’s growing Black and Latino communities in a district where they are routinely and systematically unable to influence elections.”

A representative for Ms. Malliotakis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This lawsuit was filed by Elias Law Group, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that has handled much of the party’s redistricting litigation.

Filing a lawsuit is a far less certain path to redistricting than having a partisan legislature simply draw new maps and pass them into law, which is what Texas did earlier this year. But New York placed its redistricting process in the hands of an independent commission years ago, in hopes of insulating it from partisan politics.

Redrawing legislative boundaries for Congress and state legislatures is typically done at the start of the decade following the census. But the Trump White House has upended that cycle, pushing Republican-controlled states to redraw their congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms in an effort to ensure the party maintains control of the House of Representatives.

Republicans have already redrawn maps in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, netting their party as many as seven likely pickups before any votes have been cast.

Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, the official head of the state Democratic Party, pledged to “fight fire with fire,” saying: “If they’re going to rig the system, I refuse to sit on the sidelines and let our democracy further erode any more than it already has under the Trump administration.”

But Democrats may face an uphill battle convincing a judge that the current lines are unacceptable: It was just last year that they drew and approved the map, which Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, himself blessed as a modest but meaningful improvement over the previous lines.

Democrats in Albany devised the current lines for New York’s 26 congressional districts after the state’s redistricting commission failed to come to a consensus and an unsuccessful attempt by the party to gerrymander to its advantage.

In addition to the states where maps have already been redrawn, the White House had mounted an aggressive push in Indiana to force the legislature to eliminate the state’s two Democratic districts, with the president himself calling legislators earlier this month to persuade them to draw new maps.

On Monday, Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, called a special legislative session to redraw congressional maps in his state. But immediately after his announcement, a spokeswoman for the state’s Senate Republican leadership said that “the votes still aren’t there for redistricting,” adding to the uncertainty surrounding the effort.

Republican leaders in both Kansas and Nebraska have indicated that they are open to redrawing ahead of the midterms, though neither have yet taken formal steps to do so. And Florida Republicans are contemplating new maps as well.

Until this month, the only Democratic countermove ahead of the midterms was in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a temporary suspension of the state’s independent redistricting commission in order to draw five new Democratic seats. That effort will need to be approved by voters this November in order to move forward.

But last week, Virginia Democrats made the surprise announcement that they would also embark on an effort to redraw their maps should Democrats hold both chambers of the legislature this November, possibly netting two or three more seats for Democrats. The legislature is expected to meet on Monday to begin the process.

This has left the courts as one of the last remaining avenues for a state like New York, which passed a law establishing the bipartisan commission to redraw its maps in 2014.

That commission was first responsible for drawing the state’s congressional and legislative district maps ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. But after months of public hearings, the commission’s Democratic and Republican members failed to agree on a single set of maps, sending the job back to the Democratic majorities in the State Legislature.

Democrats there quickly passed a set of maps that would have favored their party in 22 of the state’s 26 congressional seats — called “a master class” in gerrymandering by one elections expert. But those maps were thrown out by a judge, who appointed a special master to draw a new set of lines.

Republicans went on to capture four seats in 2022, a margin that was equal to the slim four-member majority the party won in the House of Representatives that year.

Democrats sued and ultimately won the opportunity to redraw the maps one more time. Leery of another protracted battle, they created maps last year that only slightly benefited their party.

Only three of the 26 districts were meaningfully changed: the 22nd District in Syracuse, the 19th District in the Hudson Valley and the 3rd on Long Island. Democrats won all three in the 2024 election.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/27/multimedia/27met-ny-redistricting-fhlq/27met-ny-redistricting-fhlq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:03:21.484447

Sullivan v. Feldman, 132 F.4th 315, 332 (5th Cir.","Despite its promise, arbitration is not always cheaper and faster than litigation, especially when class arbitration is involved. In Sullivan v. Feldman, the Fifth Circuit encountered what it called ""the Bleak House of arbitration.""1 The case involved nine overlapping proceedings over five years before nine different arbitrators, leading to four inconsistent awards.2 There was even an attempt, after the appeal was filed, to initiate a tenth arbitration.3 Two of the awards reached different results on class arbitration: one allowed class arbitration, while the other did not.4 Constrained by the parties' arbitration agreement and broad delegation clause, the court affirmed the confirmation of all four awards.5On March 11, the Fifth Circuit ordered the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, on remand, to stay the litigation while the parties initiate an eleventh arbitration to reconcile the conflicting awards.6

Sullivan is part of a larger split, percolating through the circuit courts, on whether incorporation of the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) into an arbitration agreement means that the parties intended to delegate class arbitrability issues to the arbitrator. In its March ruling, the Fifth Circuit panel ""reluctantly"" concluded that the issue was delegated to the arbitrators under circuit precedent, and affirmed the contrary awards.7On June 25, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the defendants an extension of time to August 28 to file a petition for certiorari on this issue.8 As of this writing, the defendants have not filed any petition for certiorari. The litigation in the district court is currently stayed, per a June 24 order.9 On September 12, the defendants filed notice of yet another appeal to the Fifth Circuit.10

Sullivan also stands as a reminder that broad delegations of power to arbitrators may prevent courts from correcting even serious errors when arbitrators go astray. Here, the parties' arbitration agreement provided for arbitration before a ""single"" arbitrator, to be resolved within four months. Nevertheless, the case has been going on for five years and as of this writing is now before its eleventh arbitrator.11

Background

Doctors Scott Sullivan and Frank Dellacroce, owners of various medical entities in New Orleans, engaged Stewart Feldman and his law firm to help ""mitigate financial risk and save taxes.""12 The investment plan ""fell apart"" after the doctors learned that the U.S. Tax Court had deemed a risk pool in the arrangement not to be a ""bona fide insurance company.""13 The ensuing dispute led to nine separate, overlapping arbitrations, culminating in a single hearing before the ""final four"" arbitrators.14 The hearing, held at a five-star resort, cost over $300,000 in room fees alone, and resulted in four wildly different awards, reaching conflicting conclusions on the ""hotly disputed"" issue of class certification and the personal liability of Jeff Carlson, president of one of the Capstone entities.15 The amounts of the conflicting awards ranged from about $1 million to about $88 million.16

The district court entered a judgment ""embodying all four awards in their riotously varying glory.""17 The defendants appealed.18

The Reluctant Affirmance of Class Arbitrability

The panel ""reluctantly"" followed precedent holding that incorporation of the AAA Rules delegates class arbitrability issues to the arbitrators.19 The parties' agreement incorporated the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, which themselves incorporate the Supplementary Rules.20 One of the Supplementary Rules provides: ""[T]he arbitrator shall determine . . . whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class.""21

Circuit courts are split on the effect of incorporation of the AAA Rules into an arbitration agreement: the Second, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that incorporation of the AAA Rules delegates class arbitrability issues to the arbitrator, but the Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits have held it does not.22 The court acknowledged that its own precedent was ""questionable"" in light of the Supreme Court's admonishment inLamps Plus, Inc. v.Varelathat ''[l]ike silence, ambiguity does not provide a sufficient basis to conclude that parties"" agreed to delegate class arbitrability.23 Nevertheless, the court affirmed the award.

Prior toSullivan, three Fifth Circuit cases had charted a ""middle path"" between the two options.24 In 2012, the court held inPetrofac v. DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations Co., ""that the express adoption of [the AAA] rules presents clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.""25 But in 2019, the court decided 20/20 Communications, Inc. v. Crawford.26 In that case, the court considered a class arbitration bar which provided that the arbitrator ""does not have the authority to fashion a proceeding gas class or collective action.""27 The court concluded that the incorporation of the AAA Rules did not clearly and unmistakably delegate arbitrability to the arbitrator when ""compare[d]"" with the class arbitration bar.28 But as one observer has pointed out, ""the only way you get to the conclusion that the parties prohibited class proceedings is to read and interpret the contract,"" and ""the delegation provision should send all contract interpretation issues to the arbitrator.""29 Consequently,20/20 Communications""amounts to an elevation of the issue of class arbitrability.""30 In other words, in some cases, the incorporation of the AAA Rules may clearly and unmistakably delegate arbitrability to the arbitrator, and in other cases, it may not.

A 2024 Fifth Circuit case complicated the issue even further, because it is in tension with 20/20 Communications. In Work v. Intertek Resource Solutions, Inc., the court held that incorporation of the JAMS Rules clearly and unmistakably delegates class arbitrability.31 But the JAMS Rules at issue, unlike the AAA Rules, donotspecifically mention class arbitrability. Rather, they state only that ""[j]urisdictional and arbitrability disputes . . . shall be submitted to and ruled on by the Arbitrator.""32 The Sullivan court thus described Work as an ""outlier"" in that ""[n]o other circuit court has held that a rule generally delegating arbitrability questions carries with it a delegation of class arbitrability.""33 The Fifth Circuit declined to rehearSullivanen banc to resolve this tension.34

The tension between these cases derives from developing Supreme Court precedent over the past three decades concerning delegation of arbitrability and its relationship to class arbitrability. In First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, the Supreme Court unanimously held in 1995 that ""[c]ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is 'clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]' evidence that they did so.""35 This case thus established the rule for delegation of arbitrability issues in general.

Five years later, inStolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., the Court expressed some skepticism towards class arbitration, holding that an arbitration agreement that was ""silent"" as to class arbitration did not allow for it.36 In a 5-3 decision by Justice Alito, the Court reasoned that ""class-action arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator.""37 The ""differences between bilateral and class-action arbitration"" were ""too great for arbitrators to presume . . . that the parties' mere silence on the issue of class-action arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings.""38

In the 2013, the Supreme Court considered the interaction between class arbitration and delegation in Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter.39 In that case, the Court unanimously held that an arbitrator may determine class arbitrability when ""[t]he parties agreed that the arbitrator should decide whether their contract authorized class arbitration.""40 This case thus ""seemingly took a step back fromStolt-Nielsen"" and its skepticism towards class arbitration.41 The Court held that an arbitrator's decision on the issue was controlling ""as long as the arbitrator '(even arguably) interpreted the contract.'""42

But in 2019, the Court expressed renewed skepticism towards class arbitration in Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela.43 There, the Court held 5-4 that ""[c]ourts may not infer from an ambiguous agreement that parties have consented to arbitrate on a classwide basis.""44 Chief Justice Roberts authored the majority opinion, and Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan wrote four dissents. Since then, Justices Barrett and Jackson have replaced Justices Breyer and Ginsburg on the Court.

The interaction of this line of Supreme Court cases has worked itself out in the Circuit Courts to produce the circuit split described above. Based on this history, some commentators have suggested that the Supreme Court is likely to rule that ""incorporation of the AAA rules is not 'clear and unmistakable' enough to delegate"" to the arbitrator the authority to decide class arbitrability.45

The Multiple Arbitrators and the Four-Month Deadline

Apart from the class arbitrability issue, the parties' arbitration agreement contained provisions that ""encouraged, or at least permitted, a veritable parade of arbitrations.""46 One provision gave the arbitrator the ""thesole and exclusive abilityto rule on all aspects of the arbitrator's appointment.''47 Another provided that ""either party may directly appoint the single arbitrator"" who ""shall proceed to resolve the dispute.''48 The arbitrators construed the ""single arbitrator"" provision to mean that ""multiple arbitrations could proceed simultaneously"" because each arbitration was a different ""dispute.""49 The parties' agreement did not allow the court to ""second-guess"" the arbitrators' decision, ""as long as the arbitrator's decision 'draws its essence' from the contract—even if [the court] disagree[s] with the arbitrator's interpretation.''50 Therefore, under the parties' agreement, the court was bound to defer to the arbitrators.51

Other provisions, too, contributed to the Bleak House ""parade."" The agreement stated: ""[T]he arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve all disputes and challenges to the formation and enforceability of this"" agreement.52 If the arbitrator did not complete the arbitration within four months, ""any party then may file another written demand for arbitration . . . with another"" arbitrator.53 The final four arbitrators all agreed that this deadline was ""unenforceable as unconscionable.""54 The court refused to review this determination, following the parties' agreement.55 Under Supreme Court precedent, ''[t]he sole question for [this court] is whether the arbitrator[s] (even arguably) interpreted the parties' contract, not whether [they] got its meaning right or wrong.''56 The court therefore declined to ""upend"" the arbitrators' unconscionability finding.57

The clause delegating enforceability questions thus backfired here against the drafter in a way similar to the AAA Rule delegating questions of arbitrability, including class arbitrability. At least one scholar has suggested that the law should ""distinguish[] between agreements to arbitrate a complaint and agreements to arbitrate the enforceability or scope of an arbitration provision"" by treating delegation clauses ""like weaker cousins of agreements to arbitrate the merits: terms that are presumptively valid but also laden with commonsense exceptions.""58 Although such concerns have usually been expressed in the consumer and employment arbitration contexts, this case shows that even sophisticated parties like the law firm in Sullivan may find there is a drawback to such broad delegations of authority.

Conclusion

This case illustrates complications arising from the circuit split over whether incorporation of the AAA Rules serves to delegate class arbitrability issues to the arbitrator—or in this case, arbitrators. Although the arbitrators reached opposite conclusions on this issue, the court was bound by precedent not to second-guess them.

This case also stands as a reminder to those who draft arbitration agreements of what can go wrong when parties delegate to arbitrators issues which will thereafter be unreviewable by courts. The parties' agreement stated that arbitration must take place before a ""single arbitrator"" over ""four months,"" but the arbitration took place before eleven arbitrators over five years.

Those drafting arbitration agreements ought to weigh carefully the pros and cons of extensive delegation of authority to arbitrators. Depending on the circuit, they should consider whether they want class arbitrability, in particular, to be decided by the arbitrators or by the courts.

All five were accused of allegedly assisting in the gambling operation and booked into the Ada County Jail.
On Monday, families rushed to Elmore County Jail, where the ACLU of Idaho found many detainees were being held.

Donations continued pouring into the ACLU to help families stock up on food and essentials, especially for children left without their parents.","WILDER, Idaho — A week after federal agents raided a horse racing arena in Wilder, families remain separated, and questions linger about how an investigation into illegal gambling resulted in more than 100 people being detained by immigration authorities.

The Oct. 19 operation at La Catedral Arena began as a quiet race day before more than 200 federal, state and local law enforcement officers descended on the venue around 2 p.m.

Officers zip-tied attendees' wrists and moved them to a holding area inside the arena. People with documentation were eventually released, while 105 undocumented individuals were loaded into vans and transported to facilities in Boise and Mountain Home.

""My wrists were ziptied so tight until I couldn't move anymore,"" Sujei Teo said. ""We were all just in like a big bunch. A big bunch of people we just wanted to get out of there.""

Five people were arrested in connection with an alleged illegal gambling operation: Ivan Tellez, the owner of La Catedral; Samuel Bejarano; Dayana Fajardo; Alejandro Estrada; and Cesar Orozco. All five were accused of allegedly assisting in the gambling operation and booked into the Ada County Jail.

The FBI stated that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations division ""was present as part of the broader federal team to process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations during the course of the investigation."" The agency said ICE's presence was separate from the criminal gambling investigation.

On Monday, families rushed to Elmore County Jail, where the ACLU of Idaho found many detainees were being held. Others returned to La Catedral to retrieve the vehicles of those who had been taken.

""I've only slept like two hours. It's been so tough,"" one family member said.

Protesters gathered at the Canyon County Administration Building, demanding answers about why more than 100 people were detained when the operation targeted five people allegedly involved in illegal gambling.

""They cannot do this to our kids,"" one protester said. ""Our kids deserve to be at school.""

By Tuesday, Tellez appeared in federal court in Boise and was released on conditions. Bejarano appeared but was not released due to his past criminal history. Estrada appeared and was released. Fajardo did not appear due to a transport issue. Orozco appeared on Wednesday and was released.

""He's a legal permanent resident. These allegations are very much out of character for Mr. Orozco,"" Max Williams, Orozco's attorney, said.

Attorneys said the 105 detainees were split up and taken to facilities in Utah, Rigby and Burley. Immigration attorneys meeting with affected families began questioning the FBI's handling of the operation.

""I think this could have been handled better,"" Nikki Ramirez said. ""If they were going to detain people for illegal activity, they could have just detained them. Why did everyone need to be questioned about their citizenship? That was irrelevant to the case they were investigating.""

On Thursday, Canyon County officials spoke publicly for the first time since the raid. Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said he needed to clarify statements made by the Department of Homeland Security.

""Unfortunately, when people like the federal government, specifically DHS or Homeland Security, ICE comes into our community and they do these types of polarizing operations, we're left with the aftermath,"" Ingram said. ""A lot of those relationships since Sunday have been broken. The trust has been broken. So I feel like as a leader, it's my job to really engage with a community that feels that there's a divide right now.""

On Saturday, community members gathered to show support for families missing loved ones. Donations continued pouring into the ACLU to help families stock up on food and essentials, especially for children left without their parents.

""We need everybody. All of us,"" one Nampa resident said. ""We can't just stay by ourselves and make it. We need to join up and help each other.""",https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/b810ce80-f865-418f-87f8-87f409916841/20251027T040709/b810ce80-f865-418f-87f8-87f409916841_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:03:01.577798

As is typical for Mr. Trump, he has identified a real problem — illegal immigration — but responded with a destructive solution.
For decades, the United States tolerated a level of illegal immigration that fostered a sense of lawlessness at the border and frustrated many Americans, including many Latinos.
As if to prove the protesters’ point, federal agents have reacted with more abuses of power, using tear gas and pepper balls on peaceful demonstrators.","The Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration has become a campaign of discrimination against Latinos. Federal agents are rounding up people with brown skin, catching both U.S. citizens and legal immigrants in their dragnet. Some Latinos are now afraid to speak Spanish or listen to Spanish music in public. Some are missing Mass and staying home on Sundays, or asking friends to pick up their children from school. American citizens are living in fear of a government that is sworn to protect their liberties and keep them safe.

They have reason to fear. In President Trump’s anti-immigration blitz, federal agents have repeatedly violated civil liberties and humiliated people. Masked officials have shattered car windows and pulled out drivers, leaving children sobbing in back seats. In the middle of the night in Chicago, agents with rifles swarmed an apartment building, broke down doors and dragged people from their homes in handcuffs. Dozens of those taken away were U.S. citizens. Nationwide, immigration officials have detained more than 170 American citizens, including 20 held for more than 24 hours without the ability to make a phone call, ProPublica reported.

These actions are undermining the public trust that is necessary for effective enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws. The behavior of federal agents is provoking an angry backlash in many of the communities that Mr. Trump claims he is trying to help. If all of this is supposed to convey a sense of renewed law and order, it is not working.

As is typical for Mr. Trump, he has identified a real problem — illegal immigration — but responded with a destructive solution. For decades, the United States tolerated a level of illegal immigration that fostered a sense of lawlessness at the border and frustrated many Americans, including many Latinos. The Biden administration’s porous policies worsened the situation, making possible the largest immigration surge in American history, with most of the arrivals lacking legal permission to enter the country. Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to reverse those policies, and he has an electoral mandate to do so. At the border, he has succeeded at reducing illegal entries to the lowest levels in decades.

Yet he does not have a mandate to treat people cruelly or to break the law himself. Polls show that most Americans disapprove of his handling of the issue. The country does not need to choose between the chaos of the Biden approach and the chaos of the Trump approach. The best solution remains a comprehensive law that secures the border, deters future illegal entries, expands legal immigration and provides a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized migrants who have made their lives in the United States and are otherwise law-abiding members of society. Short of that — and Congress shows no signs of passing such a law — Mr. Trump can address illegal immigration in ways that are both more humane and effective. This country needs to enforce its laws without terrorizing innocent Americans and abandoning its values.

Of the many problems with Trump immigration policies, two themes stand out: the brutality toward immigrants who are here illegally and the unfairness toward citizens and legal immigrants.

People who entered this country illegally often did so at great risk to themselves, seeking a better life in the United States. They violated the law, yes, but the response should be proportional to their crimes. It should be both firm and humane. Instead, the Trump administration has reveled in harshness. Masked, plain-clothed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have tackled and body slammed people on the streets. Officials have launched raids into homes, destroying people’s property.

In one video, a federal agent said to a group of Latinos, including a U.S. citizen: “You got no rights here. You’re an amigo, brother.” After that encounter, one agent told another, referring to the immigrants, “We’re going to end up shooting some of them.” In another video, an agent yelled “adios” to the concerned wife of a detained migrant before he shoved her into a wall and she collapsed. Other disturbing videos have filled social media.

The tactics violate both the law and human decency. On the legal side, recent court decisions have emphasized that people accused of being here without permission have a constitutional right to some due process. That right is to all of our benefit: If the federal government could simply say that someone is in the country illegally without having to prove the claim, it could deport anyone with impunity. On the human side, a vast majority of these migrants have done nothing worse than come to the country illegally, in search of a better life. Federal agents should respond appropriately, not with the expectation that violence is necessary.

The second problem with the Trump approach is that its breadth inevitably sweeps up U.S. citizens and other legal residents. Federal officials are relying on racial profiling in a country where 20 percent of the population is Latino, most of whom are legal residents or citizens. The administration is able to do so because of Congress’s acquiescence on the topic and a wrongheaded ruling that the Supreme Court issued last month, upholding the use of racial profiling in the raids.

The use of racial discrimination in law enforcement should be an affront to all Americans. Videos show that many federal agents believe that the burden of proof is on Latinos to show they are here legally, not on the government officials who are accusing them of a crime. During a raid in California, officials yanked George Retes, a U.S. citizen who served in Iraq, from his car and held him for three days. Mr. Retes said he had a government ID in his vehicle, but officials did not let him show it to them. Similar treatment befell Javier Ramirez in California, Julio Noriega in Illinois and an unnamed military veteran in New Jersey, among others.

Americans have responded to these problems with protests. As if to prove the protesters’ point, federal agents have reacted with more abuses of power, using tear gas and pepper balls on peaceful demonstrators. Even after a federal judge demanded an end to these practices, they have continued.

Federal agents’ masks exacerbate the problems. Agents with masks know they are more likely to get away with violence and abuses of power because they are anonymous. To the community, masks signal that the government cares more about protecting its agents’ identities than democratic accountability. They create a sense that the government is sending faceless storm troopers to terrorize families.

Despite its aggressiveness, the crackdown has not even been effective at dealing with the millions of people who are in this country without legal permission. The administration is missing its own deportation benchmarks. It is on pace to deport fewer people than the Obama administration did in some years. The Obama administration’s approach made sense. It focused on people who arrived recently and on those who had committed crimes since arriving in this country — and it typically respected people’s rights to due process. It did not resort to masked agents and violent raids.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/27/opinion/27immigration-editorial-image/27immigration-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 12:03:59.534559

The administration’s latest move has been revising the naturalization test, making it harder, and perhaps impossible, for the most perceptive immigrants to become citizens.

In the past, aspiring citizens had to answer at least six of 10 questions correctly, in an oral examination drawn from a pool of 100. As of last week, however, new applicants will be given 20 questions, from a pool of 128, with a passing score of 12.

According to the director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, the old test was “just too easy.” As explained by a spokesperson, the new test, in conjunction with “neighborhood investigations,” will weed out those who are not “fully assimilated” and cannot “contribute to America’s greatness.”

If the test accomplishes anything, it likely will subtly favor Trump-friendly immigrants, and disfavor MAGA skeptics.

In theory, tougher new questions have replaced softballs about geography or holidays, which had short, obvious answers. Thus, two questions about the oceans bordering the U.S. have been removed, superseded by supposedly more demanding ones.

That claim is belied by the recommended answers in the new USCIS study guide, which provides equally short, easily memorized answers to seemingly complex questions.

Question 111 asks “Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War?” The sole approved answer is, “To stop the spread of communism.”

Anyone who attempted to provide a nuanced or historically comprehensive answer — say, about geopolitical rivalry or control of resources — would risk being marked wrong, and perhaps branded an unassimilated threat to American greatness.

In an oral examination with open-ended questions, the only smart approach is to stick to the answer in the study guide. It isn’t any harder to remember “stop communism” than it is to memorize “Atlantic Ocean.”

Memorization aside, the test presents a profound problem for applicants who have been paying attention to the news. The approved answers plainly contradict the conduct of the Trump administration. For many of the civics questions, honest answers would likely be unacceptable, while the approved answers clash with Trumpian reality.

Question 6, for example, asks “What does the Bill of Rights protect?” The answer, which would have been accurate before Jan. 20, is “The basic rights of people living in the United States,” with no mention of citizenship or immigration status.

The Trump administration, however, has seized people “living in the United States” without warrants, and shipped them to a notorious prison in El Salvador without any semblance of due process required by the Fifth Amendment.

Citizens and non-citizens alike, including children, have found themselves detained, roughed up and zip-tied in violation of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on arbitrary search and seizure. Nor has the First Amendment protected international students whose visas have been revoked because they disagree with U.S. foreign policy.

Question 15 asks why there are “three branches of government.” The given answer is “So one part does not become too powerful.”

Trump, of course, has asserted virtually unlimited power under the “unitary executive” theory, including an assertedly unreviewable power to order armed troops into U.S. cities, over the objections of state governors, under the pretext of “insurrection” or “rebellion.”

He also ordered the demolition of the East Wing of the White House without first consulting the National Capital Planning Commission. The list goes on.

Likewise, Question 18 asks “What part of the federal government writes laws?” The answer is “Congress.” And Question 20 asks to “Name one power of the U.S. Congress?” “Making the federal budget” is an approved answer.”

Trump has set about governing by executive order, including the unilateral imposition of tariffs, which is a power specifically given to Congress under Article I of the Constitution. He has often ignored congressional budget legislation, repeatedly disregarding the Impoundment Control Act by freezing or withholding previously authorized appropriations, grants and even disaster relief funds.

Perhaps the new test is intended as a teaching vehicle by including the ostensible reasons for the Korean, Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars — communism, communism, and freeing Kuwait. There is no question about the Iraq War, perhaps because an answer about false intelligence reports wouldn’t “contribute to America’s greatness.”

In any case, the test has a decidedly right-wing tilt, with four questions or answers about the Federalist Papers, and two suggesting Trump’s preferred version of birthright citizenship.

Most Asian immigrants were ineligible for naturalization until 1952, under racist insistence that they could not be assimilated into American society. Over 70 years later, USCIS has revived the same rationale for denying naturalizations.

Question 124 asks for the meaning of the national motto “E Pluribus Unum.” The answer, “out of many, one,” is accurate for the time being. Under Trump, it may soon be changed to, “out of many, only the right ones.”

Hamdi is a journalist and commentator who appears on British TV networks to analyze developments in the Middle East.
According to his social media, Hamdi regularly goes on speaking tours and has recently traveled to Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa, as well as the US.
Hamdi was detained Sunday morning at San Francisco International Airport by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, CAIR said in a statement.
Hamdi’s detention comes as the Trump administration has taken similar actions against pro-Palestinian activists and revoked the visas for people who have criticized Israel’s war in Gaza.","British commentator Sami Hamdi was detained on Sunday by federal immigration officers during a speaking tour in the United States, in what a Muslim advocacy group said was retaliation for his criticism of Israel.

The Trump administration said its decision to detain Hamdi and revoke his visa underscores that the US has no obligation to host foreigners “who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans.”

But the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has called Hamdi’s treatment a “blatant affront to free speech” and called for his release.

Here’s what we know.

Who is Hamdi?

Hamdi is a journalist and commentator who appears on British TV networks to analyze developments in the Middle East. Recently, he has spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza and international plans for the post-war governance of the enclave.

Based in London, Hamdi also writes about UK foreign policy and domestic politics. According to his social media, Hamdi regularly goes on speaking tours and has recently traveled to Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa, as well as the US.

He is also editor-in-chief of International Interest, a political risk consultancy in London.

When was he detained?

Hamdi was detained Sunday morning at San Francisco International Airport by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, CAIR said in a statement.

On Saturday, Hamdi had spoken at CAIR’s annual gala in Sacramento, California, and had been due to speak at the gala of CAIR Florida the next day.

CAIR said its lawyers were “working to address this injustice.” and called on ICE to release him.

“Abducting a prominent British Muslim journalist and political commentator on a speaking tour in the United States because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide is a blatant affront to free speech,” CAIR said.

Israel’s war in Gaza, launched after Hamas’ terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 68,000 people and reduced much of the enclave to rubble. Israel says its offensive has targeted Hamas and that it takes measures to avoid killing civilians, but a United Nations inquiry last month concluded for the first time that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel denies the allegation.

Why now?

Laura Loomer, a conservative activist with a direct line to Trump, said Hamdi’s arrest came after her “relentless pressure” on the State Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In a series of posts on X, she claimed Hamdi was “an individual with Islamic terror ties” and a supporter of Hamas.

The State Department confirmed it had arrested Hamdi, saying the US will continue to revoke the visas of foreigners who “support terrorism” and make Americans unsafe. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the approach showed common sense.

Loomer called on the Trump administration to take further action against CAIR by revoking its 501(c)(3) status, which makes the nonprofit organization exempt from federal taxes.

CAIR said Loomer, who has taken credit for a slew of high-profile firings in the Trump administration, was an “anti-Muslim extremist.” Loomer has previously described Islam as a “cancer on humanity” and said Muslims should not be allowed to seek political office in the US.

What are the legal issues?

Hamdi’s detention comes as the Trump administration has taken similar actions against pro-Palestinian activists and revoked the visas for people who have criticized Israel’s war in Gaza.

In October, Mario Guevara – a Salvadoran journalist who documented immigration raids – was deported to El Salvador after spending months in federal custody. He was arrested in June while covering an Atlanta-area “No Kings” protest against what organizers describe as Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda.

Legal experts and judges have voiced concern over the legal basis for such detentions. In September, William Young – a federal judge appointed in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan – issued an extraordinary 161-page rebuke of the Trump administration, saying its efforts to deport non-citizen activists represented a “full-throated assault on the First Amendment.”

Young’s ruling is expected to be appealed.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2187203810.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-27 13:03:05.531001

The salient points include the provisions that any H-1B petitions that are approved for an extension of stay, amendment or change of status – including change of employer petitions -will not be subject to the Presidential Proclamation or the associated $100,000.00 filing fee.

Additional Key Provisions:

USCIS also indicated that foreign nationals located within the United States with approved H1B petitions will not be subject to the proclamation or associated $100,000 fee if they depart the United States. A departure from the USA by a foreign national while an H-1B petition is pending will trigger the H-1B visa fee.

H-1B petitions filed with consular notifications after the effective date of September 21st, 2025, will be subject to the $100,000 fee regardless of whether the foreign national was in the United States at the time of the H-1B filing, apart from certain foreign nationals who hold current H-1B status.

Filing for Exceptions:

To qualify for a national interest exception, USCIS regulations mandate a high level and threshold mandating that the U.S. employer is unable to locate a qualified U.S. worker available for the role and contrary to the Proclamation itself, USCIS does not permit exceptions on a company-wide or industry-wide basis.

Eligibility for national interest exceptions would be granted only in ‘exceptionally rare’ circumstances where the following criteria may be met:

The foreign national’s presence in the United States is in the interest of the national interest of the United States;

No American worker is available to assume the position offered;

The foreign national does not pose a security threat to the United States;

Payment of the $100,000 fee by a U.S. employer would significantly undermine the national interest of the United States.

Considerations:

Travel Outside the United States after petition approval –If a foreign national employee departs the United States after the petition is approved, they will not become subject to the $100,000.00 fee because of their departure.

“The stated aims of the proclamation are to curb H-1B program abuses by prioritizing high-skilled, high-paid workers and to avoid the displacement of U.S. workers,” Dyer said.
Not explicitly clarified in the updated guidance was who exactly is supposed to pay the $100,000 fee.
“Maybe a company like Amazon or Meta could afford to pay $100,000 per worker to hire H-1B employees,” Minear said.
Specifically, Minear emphasized that H-1B visas are often the only temporary visa status available to Virginia’s doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers and teachers.","An executive order signed by President Donald Trump last month has left business immigration attorneys scrambling to understand its potential fallout and impact on their clients.

On Sept. 19, Trump signed the “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers” proclamation, mandating a new $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa petitions filed beginning on Sept. 21.

The H-1B visas allow employers to hire foreign workers in “specialty occupations” that require four-year college degrees, such as technology, engineering and medicine, on a temporary basis.

Charlottesville attorney Jennifer Minear, director of McCandlish Holton’s immigration practice group, said her inbox “exploded with inquiries about the proclamation” in the days following the announcement.

“To say that I have been fielding concerned calls about this issue would be a considerable understatement,” Minear said.

Henrico attorney Dustin Dyer, whose firm solely focuses on immigration law, said the proclamation could have impacts beyond the ultimate goal of the order.

“The stated aims of the proclamation are to curb H-1B program abuses by prioritizing high-skilled, high-paid workers and to avoid the displacement of U.S. workers,” Dyer said. “While the stated aim sounds lofty, the restrictions imposed by this proclamation are short-sighted and detrimental to the U.S. economy.”

Ultimately, attorneys in the business immigration space have cautioned that advice to clients remains subject to change as the situation develops, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services providing updates as recently as Oct. 20 on the proclamation, clarifying who is subject to the fee and exemptions.

“Because clients simply do not know whether this fee will apply, and because they know they can’t pay the fee if it does apply, I am already seeing multiple clients question whether they should proceed with job offers to those seeking H-1B status,” Minear said.

Proclamation

Per the executive order, the $100,000 fee for new H-1B applicants went into effect on Sept. 21 and would remain effective for one year, with the goal to target alleged “abuse” of the visa system by some employers.

The order cites statistics showing a growing percentage of foreign workforce share in areas such as computers and math, which the White House claimed “has made it even more challenging for college graduates trying to find IT jobs, allowing employers to hire foreign workers at a significant discount to American workers.”

To say that I have been fielding concerned calls about this issue would be a considerable understatement.

— Jennifer Minear, Charlottesville

Left unanswered in the proclamation was who would be on the hook for the $100,000 fee and which specific applicants are exempt from the fee.

“The proclamation was, to put it generously, poorly drafted and missing a lot of important information necessary to understand its scope and meaning,” Minear said.

On Oct. 20, USCIS issued guidance related to the $100,000 proclamation, clarifying that the fee does not apply to “an alien inside the United States” requesting an amendment, change or status or extension of stay, and that current H-1B visa holders are not prevented from traveling in and out of the country.

USCIS further stated that the secretary of Homeland Security can grant exemption to the $100,000 payment “in the extraordinarily rare circumstance where the Secretary has determined that a particular alien worker’s presence in the United States as an H-1B worker is in the national interest” and that no American worker can fill that role.

Notably, the updated guidance includes the terms “extraordinarily rare” and “high threshold,” terms absent from the initial executive order.

Minear said that the “national interest” exemption “is narrowed considerably” by the USCIS language.

“I am extremely skeptical that anyone will be approved for an exemption based on the process and criteria described,” Minear said.

USCIS also provided a pay.gov link through which “petitioners should submit the required $100,000 payment” and clarified that petitioners must make payment prior to filing with USCIS.

Not explicitly clarified in the updated guidance was who exactly is supposed to pay the $100,000 fee.

While the stated aim sounds lofty, the restrictions imposed by this proclamation are short-sighted and detrimental to the U.S. economy.

— Dustin Dyer, Henrico

Minear said her clients, many of whom are in the health care or education industries, are seeking guidance on next steps regarding the fee.

“Maybe a company like Amazon or Meta could afford to pay $100,000 per worker to hire H-1B employees,” Minear said. “My clients sure can’t.”

The updated guidance by USCIS comes as two federal lawsuits have been filed challenging the executive order.

The U.S Chamber of Commerce filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Oct. 16, arguing that Congress has the authority over H-1B visas and that the $100,000 fee would inflict significant harm on American businesses.

Some two weeks earlier, a diverse group of plaintiffs representing multiple industries filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, providing similar arguments and claiming harms to health care and education employers.

Due to the pending federal suits, Minear cautioned that it is “exceedingly difficult to advise clients in this environment.”

Looking ahead

Dyer anticipated potential economic impacts should the executive order survive scrutiny by the federal courts.

“H-1B professional workers, particularly those in fields like technology, health care and research, play a critical role in driving innovation and filling labor gaps that U.S. workers cannot always address,” Dyer said. “Limiting their entry by imposing an outrageous fee to utilize the H-1B program not only threatens America’s global competitiveness but also undermines businesses and industries that rely on specialized skills.”

Minear said her office receives so many inquiries on the H-1B visa issue that she has created templated email responses to the inquiries.

“There are, of course, no clients who can afford to pay a $100,000 additional fee to use the H-1B program, so if the fee is allowed to stand, it will effectively gut the H-1B visa program,” Minear said.

Dyer noted a possible alternative for long-term success that he theorized would benefit all stakeholders.

“The long-term economic costs far outweigh any perceived short-term benefits, and the U.S. should instead focus on policies that support both domestic workers and the talent we attract from around the world,” Dyer said.

Ultimately, Minear said the situation remains fluid while practitioners await more definitive guidance from the federal government and the resolution of the federal lawsuits.

“Hopefully, we will soon have an injunction from a federal District Court or, at minimum, further guidance from the administration that blunts the catastrophic impact of this proclamation on sectors of the economy that rely heavily on H-1B workers,” she said.

Specifically, Minear emphasized that H-1B visas are often the only temporary visa status available to Virginia’s doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers and teachers.

“The impact on Virginia’s education and health care system is certain to be profoundly negative if the proclamation remains in effect,” she said.",https://valawyersweekly.com/files/2025/10/Depositphotos_335369082_XL.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:02:10.780367

While CIS believes the DHS proposal will improve the status quo, CIS proposed additional reforms to ensure that the H-1B program fulfills its statutory purpose: to allow U.S. employers to temporarily hire truly high-skilled workers when qualified U.S. workers are unavailable — without displacing or undercutting American labor.

Replacing the purely random selection process with one that prioritizes higher wages and higher skill levels will help restore the program’s original intent, discourage abuse, and protect both U.S. and foreign workers from unfair labor practices. In tandem, CIS requested that DHS amend its regulations to only provide cap exemption eligibility for workers who are directly employed by a qualifying employer, reinstate USCIS’s itinerary requirement, repeal USCIS’s deference policy, tighten the “specialty occupation” definition, and work with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to raise wage rates to close known loopholes and enhance oversight.

Taken together, these changes would make the H-1B program more transparent, merit-based, and consistent with the letter and spirit of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) told Source New Mexico that a volunteer in her office spent the last several months creating AGUAS-NM.com in response to widespread—but hard-to-verify—reports of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arresting people across the state.

“Our community is held to the rule of law, so why shouldn’t law enforcement…be documented in hopes that they will follow the law as well?” she told Source on Thursday in a phone interview. “It was born of frustration and hope that when we shine a little bit of light that hopefully transparency wins.”

The website greets visitors with a disclaimer about the potential inaccuracy of individual arrest reports, and it warns that the website should not be used to interfere with law enforcement operations, which Anaya also stressed in the interview.

Users can anonymously submit photos, videos or summaries of potential ICE arrests to the website, which will then appear on the map as “unverified” until representatives of community groups visit the site in person and talk to witnesses, Anaya said.

Adding a layer of verification should help instill trust in the website while also aiming to stop the spread of misinformation, she said.

“Often people will think that a private security guard is ICE when really they may not be,” she said. “And I think that’s why we’re focusing so heavily on making sure that we have validated and unvalidated check marks.”

Spokespersons for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and El Centro de Igualdad and Derechos, two immigrant advocacy organizations, declined to comment Friday on the new website.

Data about how many ICE arrests have occurred in New Mexico amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push is hard to come by, though national data suggests arrests are increasing. The number of people ICE has detained in the state’s three detention centers has steadily increased, as well.

Some statewide elected officials are trying to collect information about ICE arrests to distribute to the public, including in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County. That’s another potential source of “verified” reports for the AGUAS-NM website, Anaya said.

“When it comes to other areas of the state, clearly, that’ll work a little bit differently,” she said. “But for us, it’s more about transparency. I think the video and photo option also just really helps the community to be able to make up their own mind about whether or not it is a valid documentation or not.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ICE.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 11:17:05.358822

Guardian Australia has spoken to lawyers for eight people who have since been sent back to immigration detention awaiting their eventual deportation.
Upon his re-detainment, Adnan told border force officers he wanted to see his wife and children after being apart for more than a decade.
Adnan says he found out about his visa for Nauru in the middle of the night when border force officers came to his door and took him back into detention.","Adnan* says he had never heard of Nauru when Australian Border Force officers showed up at his door in the middle of the night to inform him Nauru had granted him a 30-year visa.

Initially believing Nauru was part of Australia, Adnan felt a brief sense of relief before he realised he was being sent back to a place he had become uncomfortably familiar with – immigration detention.

“I thought there had been a mistake. I hadn’t had a lawyer for years, and I had never really understood what was happening in my case,” he told Guardian Australia through his lawyer.

“I have been in detention since, trying to figure out how all of this happened to me, and why I have been selected for this punishment.”

The man, whose real name Guardian Australia is not using to reduce the risk of reprisal, is one of more than 350 people within the so-called NZYQ cohort, which the federal government has promised to deport to the tiny Pacific island in a $2.5bn deal.

In 2023, the high court ruled the government’s policy of indefinitely locking up non-citizens who cannot be deported to another country was unconstitutional. The judgment paved the way for the group’s release.

It’s a cohort consisting of many different stories. Some – including Adnan – have had their visas cancelled on character grounds after being convicted of crimes and sentenced to 12 months or more in jail. Others have been refused a visa but cannot be deported because they are refugees or stateless.

A number of people within the group have since been subject to strict monitoring conditions, including ankle monitors, as part of tough restrictions to ensure community safety.

A deal struck with Nauru in February means authorities can apply for long-term visas on behalf of people within the NZYQ cohort without their knowledge. Once Nauru grants the visa, Australian authorities can re-detain the visa holder in an immigration detention centre until they are sent to the island.

The government swiftly passed laws in September stripping non-citizens on removal pathways of natural justice – a legal principle affording everyone access to a fair hearing and to a decision without bias.

The changes aim to speed up deportations by removing the cohort’s right to taking further legal challenges that might delay their deportation.

In recent months, authorities have been conducting night-time and dawn raids on those within the cohort who have been granted a 30-year visa for Nauru – an island home to just 12,000 people and with limited physical and mental health services.

Guardian Australia has spoken to lawyers for eight people who have since been sent back to immigration detention awaiting their eventual deportation. Many more are believed to have been re-detained but with the government refusing to release any details, human rights groups are left to investigate who is suddenly missing from the community.

Adnan says it feels as if he is “living in a nightmare”.

Upon his re-detainment, Adnan told border force officers he wanted to see his wife and children after being apart for more than a decade. Adnan could not leave the country or bring his family to Australia prior to his conviction because he had been placed on temporary protection visas.

Adnan says he found out about his visa for Nauru in the middle of the night when border force officers came to his door and took him back into detention.

“These days are like living in a nightmare. I made mistakes since I came to Australia – I have been punished for those mistakes. I have tried everything to put my life back on track. I am not a young man – I cannot keep rebuilding my life. I do not know why Australia has selected me for this terrible punishment,” he says.

The deputy chief executive of the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre, Jana Favero, says Australia’s treatment of noncitizens with criminal convictions is divisive and unfair.

“If two people commit the same crime, but only one faces exile to a remote island penal colony after they’ve done their time, that’s not justice – it’s divisive and sends a message to people without citizenship that they will never be equal,” she says.

Details about the criminal histories of the people within the NZYQ cohort are scant but the home affairs department in March said 13 had been convicted for murder or attempted murder.

About 95 have had a criminal history of sex-based offending and 133 have been previously convicted of assault, violent offending, kidnapping or armed robbery. At least nine have been found guilty of low-level crimes or have no criminal history. All were detained after serving their sentences.

Favero says border force’s unannounced night-time visits to people mirrored controversial intimidation tactics by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“What we’ve seen with ICE in the US is now becoming reality here – and families will be torn apart, with devastating, lifelong consequences,” she says.

“This kind of alarming behaviour by border force officials is copying the worst of tactics from Trump and ICE, turning up unannounced and intimidating people, and in some cases detaining them, simply because of where they were born.”

The Human Rights Law Centre’s legal director, Sanmati Verma, told Guardian Australia the government is ignoring the “brutal reality” of its actions.

“Under the cover of secrecy, the Australian government is pulling people out of the community, locking them in detention, and smuggling them out of the country,” she says.

“No matter where we are from, or what visa we hold, there is a common dignity that binds our communities together. We should not accept our government inflicting lifelong punishment on migrants and refugees, simply because of their visa status.”

A home affairs department spokesperson says it does not comment on operational matters but is “committed to maintaining a migration system that is robust, effective and in the national interest”.

“A memorandum of understanding between Australia and the Republic of Nauru signed on 29 August 2025 enables Australia to effect the removal of individuals who have no legal right to remain in Australia and cannot be returned to a country of which they hold citizenship,” the spokesperson says.

Travis County v. ICE Local law enforcement officials in the Austin area have often been at odds with Republican state and federal political leadership over the role local law enforcement should play in immigration enforcement.
Other options are less expansive, like training sheriff’s deputies to run their own immigration checks from county jails.","ICE agents are seizing more people from jails in the Austin area, county officials tell The Texas Newsroom, sometimes visiting the facilities multiple times per day as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement nationwide.

“For inmates in our care and custody, they usually wait 24 hours or less because we get pickups from [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] almost every day,” Kristen Dark, Public Information Officer of the Travis County Sheriff’s Office, said in an interview this month.

She added: “Sometimes they do pick up from us twice a day.”

Aggressive immigration sweeps and arrests have become a hallmark of Trump-era immigration policy. Cities in blue states like California and Illinois have seen the most public crackdowns, including the deployment of federal troops. But, in Texas, where local leaders are compelled to hand people arrested on other charges over ICE directly from county jails, many immigration arrests remain hidden from public view.

The Texas Newsroom filed records requests and spoke to immigrants’ advocates and law enforcement officials to get a clearer picture of how immigration enforcement has changed here under Donald Trump’s second term.

The findings reveal that a growing number of people in Travis County find themselves facing deportation after sometimes routine run-ins with the police.

The jump in the number of people in the county jail identified for ICE arrest coincides with similar increases in other Texas counties, according to data from the Deportation Data Project.

Dark says the local increase can largely be attributed to a growing jail population. Others point to Trump administration policies that have swept a growing number of people into ICE custody and deportation proceedings.

Some local law enforcement officials, like Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez, worry the current administration’s aggressive policies could further interfere with their efforts to build healthier connections with immigrant communities. Hernandez is one of several law enforcement officials in Texas who have been reluctant to cooperate with federal immigration agents.

Despite these concerns, even more people will likely face deportation after entering the jail system under a new state law taking effect next year.

“Hernandez always says, we want people to run to us, not away from us,” Dark said. “If someone is a victim of crime, we don't want them to be afraid to talk to us. We want to hear from them.”

The state’s top Republican politicians, like Gov. Greg Abbott, have voiced strong support for policies that compel local officials to enforce federal immigration rules.

""Texas finally has a partner in the White House,” Andrew Mahaleris, Press Secretary for Abbott wrote in response to a request for comment. “Governor Abbott fully supports the Trump Administration’s efforts to deport those who intentionally broke our laws and entered our country illegally.""

Civil rights advocates point out that ICE is, increasingly, detaining people who are in the county legally or are pursuing a path to legal residency.

ICE detainers go up

In Texas, jails will hold someone for an additional 48 hours if a background check reveals the person may be in the country without legal status. This “immigration hold,” which is also called an “ICE detainer,” gives federal agents more time to take them into custody.

People can be arrested and sent to county lockup for reasons as innocuous as driving without a license to far more serious allegations like assault. Until final conviction, they are presumed innocent.

Immigration attorney Iris Albizu believes part of the increase in immigration arrests from county jail is because ICE is detaining more people who are in the process of applying for legal residency.

“What is shocking is that people that are already in the system, people that already have a protected status [...] those people are being detained,” Albizu said.

In response to an open records request, the Travis County Sheriff's office provided The Texas Newsroom with snapshots of the number of people in county jails on the first day of each month for the past several years.

Six out of the nine months this year showed higher numbers of people with ICE detainers as compared to this same period last year. It was the highest in May, when 343 people in Travis County jails were flagged for pickup by ICE. That month, people with ICE detainers accounted for nearly 15% of the local jail population.

But monthly point-in-time numbers only tell part of the story, as some people may be moved from the jail and then to ICE detention before they are counted, and others may stay in jail for months appearing in multiple counts.

Analysts said a better metric is to measure the growth in ICE detainers issued to people booked into jail.

ICE data compiled by the Deportation Data Project, a project run by UCLA and UC Berkeley, shows the number of detainers issued to people booked into local jails was 40% higher in the first six months of this year than during that same period last year.

“It's clear that the Trump administration's priorities around increasing immigration enforcement and mass deportation — they are doing that in Travis County,” said Jacob Kang-Brown, a researcher who studies the use of county jails in immigration enforcement at the Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank that advocates against mass incarceration.

This uptick cannot be fully explained by an increase in the local jail population. While overcrowding has been an issue in Travis County jails, the rise in detainers issues appears to have outpaced jail population growth.

“Texas has one of the highest rates of ICE arrests, and that's really being driven by the arrests that are happening in the local jails,” Kang-Brown added.

The Texas Newsroom has asked for more detailed data on ICE detainers to provide a fuller picture of local enforcement patterns.

Travis County v. ICE

Local law enforcement officials in the Austin area have often been at odds with Republican state and federal political leadership over the role local law enforcement should play in immigration enforcement.

Hernandez unsuccessfully fought a 2017 law that mandated that counties hold all inmates flagged with ICE detainers for pickup. Since then, she has complied with the mandate.

But, unlike some other counties, Travis has not partnered with federal or state agencies to enforce immigration policy beyond the detainer system. This affects communication between the agencies, which is already limited.

Dark said neither ICE nor the Texas Department of Public Safety have notified the Travis County Sheriff’s ahead of time when they conduct immigration sweeps or raids.

ICE did not reply to an emailed list of questions from The Texas Newsroom.

But under a new state law passed this year, coordination between ICE and local sheriff’s departments will expand despite this reticence.

The new law, which will go into full effect by the end of next year, will require departments to choose from three different options for how to form deeper partnerships with federal immigration agents.

One will allow counties to create their own immigration task forces, empowered to check people's citizenship status while out on patrol. Other options are less expansive, like training sheriff’s deputies to run their own immigration checks from county jails.

""We're looking at all of the models very, very carefully. And we'll be considering the cost and the impact of each before we make our decision,"" said Dark.

No matter what model counties chose, immigrants advocates say the law is sure to increase the already growing number of people who find themselves facing deportation after being detained by local authorities for unrelated reasons.

“That person may be innocent of whatever they’re charged with,” said immigration attorney Iris Albizu, “But, because now they’re caught by immigration, they’re trapped.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0238af0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd0%2F80%2F3b374b864fb490236bebd123f39f%2Ftravis-county-correctional-complex-50839314891-o.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:16:55.094459

Mr. Hamdi is the managing director of the International Interest, an organization that “advises on geopolitical environments and risks across the globe,” according to its website. He has appeared as a commentator on the British television news channel Sky News and other outlets.

He had been on a speaking tour in the United States, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization. He attended the organization’s annual gala on Friday night in Sacramento and was scheduled to speak at a gala in Florida on Sunday night.

Mr. Hamdi was detained at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning, according to CAIR, which called for his release. Mr. Hamdi is based in London, according to his LinkedIn account.

CAIR said in a statement that Mr. Hamdi had been detained “because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide” while on his speaking tour. It called the action “a blatant affront to free speech.”

CAIR has long been controversial in Washington, presenting itself as a champion of civil rights for Muslims in an era of Islamophobia yet regularly pilloried by many, especially on the political right, as an apologist for extremism.

“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” Ms. McLaughlin said in the social media post on Sunday.

Earlier this fall, judges rebuked Secretary of State Marco Rubio for taking similar actions against other pro-Palestinian activists. A judge in Massachusetts last month ruled that the Trump administration had used the threat of deportation to systematically silence noncitizens in academia who protested in support of Palestinians. He said the government had violated the First Amendment as part of a broader strategy to stamp out campus activism.

On its X account, the State Department reposted Ms. McLaughlin’s announcement about Mr. Hamdi and added: “We’ve said it before, we’ll say it again: The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans. We continue to revoke the visas of persons engaged in such activity.”

In August, the Trump administration said it had paused approvals of visitor visas for people from Gaza, including young children who arrived with serious medical conditions.

President

Arab American Institute

A century ago, Gibran Khalil Gibran wrote a love poem to Lebanon, ""You have your Lebanon, I have my Lebanon."" He spoke of his affection for the captivating qualities of generosity and hospitality of the Lebanese people and the sheer beauty of the country and contrasted this with Lebanon’s petty, bickering politicians who sought nothing more than their own aggrandizement. When I read this poem, I saw parallels between the understanding of the contradictions at play in Lebanon and those in my country, the United States of America.

Today, many Americans are living in fear and even despair as they watch their president, seemingly unchecked, tearing down some of the foundations of democracy and gutting social and economic programs that have for decades provided for the safety, security, and well-being of millions. They ask: “How could this be happening?” and “Can our country survive this onslaught?”

But, as has always been the case in America, while some have felt hopeless, others are driven to respond. And so it was that a week ago, seven million Americans took to the streets in 2,700 cities and towns to demonstrate their resolve to save America’s democracy and arrest the drift toward authoritarianism.

All of this should serve as a reminder that there have always been these two Americas: one pushing to restrict democratic freedoms and the other working to expand them. Both have defined our history.

America, after all, was born with the original sins of genocide against native peoples, the forced enslavement of Africans, and the annexation and subjugation of Spanish-speaking peoples of the Southwest. As the country grew and attracted immigrants, these newcomers, whether they were Irish, Italians, Central Europeans, Jews, or Arabs were often met with discrimination, repression, and even violence.

This, however, was always only one part of America’s story. On the other side, for every racist, segregationist, anti-immigrant bigot, there were abolitionists who fought slavery, and organized movements that championed immigrants, labor, and civil rights for Blacks, Latinos, and Native peoples. And in the last century, for every xenophobe like Fr. Coughlin or Pat Buchanan, or segregationist like Bull Connor or George Wallace, there was a Martin Luther King, Caesar Chavez, and Jesse Jackson. And despite persistent bigotry and waves of recurring anti-immigrant bigotry, what remains are the core of Dr. King’s “I have a dream” speech and the spirit of the Statue of Liberty’s words welcoming the “tired and poor, yearning to be free.”

This is my family’s story. While my father’s mother and siblings were all able to immigrate to America after World War I, he was delayed and then unable to secure a visa because Congress determined that there were too many immigrants from the Mediterranean region. (One Senator famously said, “We don’t need any more Syrian trash in America.”) Eager to reunite with his family, he got a job on a ship sailing to Canada and then crossed into the US without documents in 1923. He received amnesty in the 1930s and became a citizen in 1943. Four decades later I was serving as a deputy campaign manager for Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign and was given to opportunity to place his name in nomination at the 1984 Democratic Convention.

Reflecting on my personal history as a metaphor for the broader American story, I noted in my speech that “I am the son of an illegal immigrant who is nominating for president the great grandson of a slave. Nowhere else but America could this happen.”

It’s important to remember that these two Americas are always with us. And we must never forget either one. If we forget the threats and challenges to freedom, we let down our guard and become vulnerable to the assaults when they come. But if we forget the promise of America and fail to recall the heroes and movements who in every generation have fought and won, then we lose hope and fail to meet the challenges before us.

And so, to those who despair and say that what is happening today is” un-American” as they witness efforts to gut voting rights, curtail immigration, use of military force to violently expel migrants and threaten freedom of speech and assembly—we must respond that we've been here before and we’ve always risen up to confront these threats to liberty. And we’ve won.

The bottom line is that we should remember that we’ve been through other dark periods in our history. In my lifetime, we’ve witnessed: the hysteria and repression of the McCarthy era’s manufactured anti-Communism scare; the racism and violence that followed the civil rights movement; the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Dr. King; the deeply polarizing Vietnam war; the national trauma of 9/11 and the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hate crimes and government repression that followed; and the disastrous failed wars against Afghanistan and Iraq. Each time, we rose to meet these challenges.

Given our history, I feel confident that in the face of today’s xenophobia, racism, repression, and hate, we will rise again. Like Gibran, we will assert: “You have your America, I have my America.”

International Coordination and Enforcement These domestic effects would be amplified by international coordination that extends the reach of American FTO authorities globally.","Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designations are one of the most powerful legal instruments in America’s counterterrorism arsenal. Originally conceived to combat international terrorist networks like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS), these designations trigger sweeping financial sanctions, severe criminal penalties, and extensive surveillance authorities. President Donald Trump’s comments at a White House roundtable on “Antifa” earlier this month make it likely that his administration will designate this decentralized anti-fascist movement as an FTO — a move that would create an unprecedented expansion of counterterrorism authorities into the domestic political space.

During the roundtable, Trump was asked directly whether he would designate Antifa as an FTO. The president’s response was unambiguous: “I think it’s the kind of thing I’d like to do. If you agree, I agree. Let’s get it done.” This was not casual political rhetoric. It was a directive from the Commander-in-Chief to his national security apparatus, witnessed by millions of Americans. It is also something the first Trump administration took steps toward enacting near the end of the president’s first term in office. (For example, see section 2 of the Executive Order issued on Jan. 5, 2021.) The implications could extend far beyond anti-fascist activists to the entire architecture of American civil society and constitutional governance.

The FTO Framework: Powerful by Design

To understand why an Antifa FTO designation would be so consequential, one must first grasp the extraordinary scope of authorities that such designations unleash. The FTO system was deliberately constructed to maximize governmental power against international terrorist threats. Created by the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the framework provides the executive branch with extraordinary authorities that are designed to dismantle terrorist networks quickly and comprehensively.

Once an organization is designated as an FTO, providing “material support” to it becomes a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison, or life if the support results in death. The statutory definition of “material support” is intentionally expansive and includes providing: “currency or monetary instruments, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, personnel, and transportation.” Only medicine and religious materials are explicitly exempted.

The breadth of this definition reflects Congress’s determination to eliminate all forms of assistance to designated organizations. The statute applies to U.S. persons regardless of where the prohibited conduct occurs, creating global reach for American terrorism prosecutions. The Supreme Court’s decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project clarified that even speech intended to promote peaceful conflict resolution may constitute material support if provided to a designated organization.

Financial consequences activate automatically upon designation. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requires all U.S. financial institutions to freeze assets within ten business days and report the frozen funds to the government. This financial disruption is designed to immediately sever designated organizations from the global financial system, preventing them from accessing resources needed for operations.

The Holy Land Foundation case demonstrates the scope of these authorities when applied to charitable organizations. Five charity officials received sentences ranging from 15 to 65 years for providing aid to Palestinian communities that prosecutors argued were under the influence of Hamas, a designated FTO. While the defendants maintained they were providing legitimate humanitarian assistance, the court found that the statutory framework criminalized their support regardless of the charitable intent.

Immigration Consequences and the Specter of Denaturalization

Beyond criminal prosecution and financial sanctions, FTO designation triggers severe immigration consequences that could create an underclass of vulnerable individuals subject to expulsion. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, any non-citizen who is a member or representative of a designated FTO is automatically inadmissible to the United States and subject to removal proceedings. The State Department may immediately revoke visas of any foreign nationals deemed to be members, representatives, or supporters of the designated organization. This authority extends to individuals who have “endorsed or espoused terrorist activity” or provided any form of material support, creating an exceptionally broad basis for visa revocation and deportation. (That said, similar provisions for removal of foreign nationals lawfully in the United States are currently being challenged in court on First Amendment grounds.)

The consequences reach even further for naturalized American citizens. Federal law permits denaturalization of individuals who were members of or affiliated with a “terrorist organization” within five years immediately following naturalization. Once Antifa receives FTO designation, any naturalized citizen who attended a counter-protest, donated to a legal defense fund, or expressed support for anti-fascist principles during their first five years as a citizen could face citizenship revocation proceedings.

The recent expansion of denaturalization enforcement, with the Department of Justice announcing in June 2025 that denaturalization cases would become one of its top five enforcement priorities, creates a particularly acute vulnerability for many of the estimated 25 million naturalized Americans. Consider a German immigrant who became a U.S. citizen in 2023 and maintained connections with anti-fascist groups in her home country, or a French national who was naturalized in 2024 after years of participating in counter-demonstrations against far-right movements in Europe. Both could face potential citizenship revocation and deportation based on activities that were entirely legal when undertaken.

The denaturalization standard requires only “clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence” in civil proceedings — a lower threshold than criminal conviction — and carries no statute of limitations. This creates a permanent cloud of legal jeopardy hanging over millions of naturalized Americans whose past political associations could be reinterpreted as terrorism support under an expansive FTO designation.​

Civil Liability Under the Anti-Terrorism Act

The designation of Antifa as an FTO could also potentially expose individuals and organizations to devastating civil liability under the Anti-Terrorism Act (18 U.S.C. § 2333). The ATA authorizes any U.S. national injured “by reason of an act of international terrorism” committed by a designated FTO to sue for treble damages, plus attorneys’ fees and costs. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), enacted in 2016, expanded this authority to include aiding-and-abetting liability against “any person who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with” those who commit acts of international terrorism. This creates possible exposure not just for alleged Antifa subjects themselves, but for anyone deemed to have provided material support — including nonprofits, donors, and service providers.

Unlike criminal cases requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, ATA civil cases proceed under the lower “preponderance of the evidence” standard, making them easier to win. Even frivolous ATA lawsuits could impose crippling litigation costs — defense firms specializing in terrorism cases charge hundreds of dollars per hour, and cases routinely take years to resolve. The threat of ATA liability could force organizations to obtain expensive specialized insurance (if available at all), conduct exhaustive vetting of all partners and donors, and potentially abandon any activities that could be remotely connected to anti-fascist activism. This civil liability mechanism could thus accomplish through private litigation what criminal prosecution alone might not achieve: the significant curtailment of civil society organizations engaged in political opposition to “anti-fascism,” not through direct government action but through the specter of catastrophic financial liability.

The FISA Surveillance Integration

An FTO designation would also seamlessly integrate Antifa into America’s most sophisticated surveillance infrastructure. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the government may conduct electronic surveillance of “agents of foreign powers,” including “groups engaged in international terrorism.” Once Antifa is designated as an FTO, anyone deemed an “agent” of this “foreign power” becomes eligible for FISA surveillance — including American citizens (though with some stricter standards).

This surveillance integration represents a qualitative escalation beyond traditional criminal investigation. FISA surveillance operates under different standards than domestic criminal investigations. Federal agents need only demonstrate probable cause that “the target of the surveillance is a foreign power or [an] agent of a foreign power” and that “a significant purpose” is obtaining “foreign intelligence information.” The standard does not require demonstration that criminal activity is planned or imminent.

The National Security Agency’s (NSA) authorities under FISA are extensive and largely classified, but publicly available documentation confirms the agency “relies on Title I of FISA to conduct electronic surveillance of foreign powers or their agents, to include members of international terrorist organizations.” These capabilities extend beyond simple wiretapping to include comprehensive electronic monitoring, physical searches, and business records collection.

For American citizens associated with anti-fascist activities, FISA designation could mean potential subjection to the full spectrum of intelligence community surveillance capabilities, all conducted in secret with limited judicial oversight. Unlike criminal investigations, FISA surveillance does not require notification of targets, potentially allowing years of monitoring without the subject’s knowledge.

Social Media Transformation: From Resistance to Compliance

The surveillance implications extend beyond government agencies to encompass the private sector platforms where much contemporary political organization occurs. The impact on digital platforms would be immediate and comprehensive. Major social media companies — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram — maintain terms of service prohibiting content from designated terrorist organizations. Currently, these platforms often resist government information requests about political activists based on First Amendment principles. An FTO designation could eliminate the legal foundation for such resistance.

Facebook’s Community Standards explicitly state that “organizations that are engaged in terrorist activity are not allowed on the platform.” Once Antifa is designated as an FTO, any content expressing support for anti-fascist principles, sharing protest logistics, or providing resources for activists could become prohibited terrorist content subject to immediate removal. Users posting such content could also face permanent account suspension.

The technological infrastructure already exists for comprehensive content monitoring. Social media companies have developed sophisticated algorithmic systems to identify terrorist content, with Twitter reporting suspension of over 1.5 million accounts for terrorism-related violations between 2015 and 2020, 90 percent identified through automated systems rather than user reports.

The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) – comprised of YouTube, Twitter/X, Facebook, and Microsoft, and other platforms – maintains shared databases of “digital fingerprints” from known terrorist content. Anti-fascist organizing materials, protest footage, and political commentary could be added to these databases, creating automated, cross-platform content removal and user identification systems.

These changes could extend beyond direct content removal to comprehensive user profiling. The same machine learning systems currently used for content recommendation could begin identifying users based on engagement with anti-fascist content, creating detailed profiles for potential government intelligence gathering. This transformation would convert social media platforms from potential sources of opposition to government overreach into comprehensive surveillance and enforcement networks.

Organizational Vulnerabilities: A Hypothetical Case Study

The abstract legal framework above becomes more concrete when applied to real-world organizational structures. Consider how an FTO designation could impact the “Alliance for Democratic Resistance” (ADR), a fictional but realistic progressive non-governmental organization (NGO), as well as other civil society organizations. ADR operates from a headquarters in Washington, D.C., with regional offices in Portland, Chicago, Atlanta, and Austin. The organization maintains partnerships with civil rights groups in Germany, the U.K., and France, and receives grants from European foundations supporting anti-fascist education programs.

ADR’s activities include organizing counter-protests against white supremacist demonstrations, providing know-your-rights training for protesters, maintaining a legal defense fund for arrested activists, publishing research on far-right movements, and hosting international conferences on combating extremism. These activities, while entirely legal under current law, could become potentially criminal once Antifa is designated as an FTO.

The organization’s international partnerships could be recharacterized as coordination with foreign terrorist entities. Its legal defense fund might constitute material support for domestic terrorists. Research publications could be classified as terrorist propaganda. Training programs might be deemed terrorist instruction.

Within ten business days of designation, OFAC would require ADR’s banks to freeze all accounts and report holdings to the Treasury Department. Staff members would face FBI investigation for potential material support violations. Donors — from major foundations to individual contributors — could become targets for financial crimes prosecution. International partners would be barred from entering the United States.

Beyond criminal charges and asset freezes, ADR could conceivably face civil suits from anyone injured during a protest or counterdemonstration where Antifa was present. A business owner whose property was damaged, a counter-protester who was injured, or even a police officer hurt during a demonstration could sue ADR for treble damages under the ATA, arguing the organization aided and abetted Antifa’s activities by providing meeting space, legal support, or protest coordination. The treble damages provision means a $100,000 injury claim could result in a $300,000 judgment, plus potentially millions in legal fees.

The organization would face immediate operational collapse regardless of whether criminal charges are ultimately filed. Legal defense costs alone could reach millions of dollars. Donors would flee to avoid association with designated “terrorists.” Foundation grants would be suspended pending investigation. Staff would resign to protect themselves from legal jeopardy. Office leases would be terminated, insurance policies cancelled, and nonprofit tax status revoked.

This scenario reflects how FTO designations can destroy organizations through the process itself, independent of successful criminal prosecutions. The mere initiation of terrorism-related investigations creates financial and reputational damage from which most organizations cannot recover.

Cascading Effects Across Civil Society

The destruction of directly targeted organizations represents only the beginning of a possible broader social transformation. The impact could cascade far beyond directly targeted entities, creating a comprehensive chilling effect across the entire progressive political ecosystem. Every progressive nonprofit, civil rights group, and political organization would face immediate compliance assessments. Legal counsel would advise clients to avoid any activities potentially construed as supporting anti-fascist principles. Foundation boards could vote to suspend grants to organizations with possible connections to counter-protest activities.

Academic institutions would face particularly complex challenges. Universities might cancel conferences on combating fascism, restrict faculty research on anti-fascist movements, and suspend student organizations engaged in counter-protest activities. The chilling effect on academic freedom would be profound, as scholars avoid research topics that might create legal jeopardy.

Media organizations may similarly self-censor. Publishers might refuse books on anti-fascist history or strategy. Journalists could avoid reporting on anti-fascist activities to prevent potential material support liability. Documentary filmmakers might cancel projects examining anti-fascist movements.

Religious and community organizations engaged in social justice work would face difficult choices about continuing programs that could be interpreted as supporting a designated terrorist organization’s ideology. Labor unions might prohibit solidarity activities with anti-fascist activists. Nonprofit legal organizations could suspend representation of activists facing charges.

This phenomenon, known to scholars as “anticipatory conformity,” demonstrates how the mere existence of broad criminal penalties can achieve censorship objectives without formal enforcement. Organizations and individuals modify behavior to avoid potential prosecution, effectively accomplishing the government’s regulatory goals through self-censorship. The cumulative effect would be the systematic elimination of civil society infrastructure supporting resistance to far-right political movements.

International Coordination and Enforcement

These domestic effects would be amplified by international coordination that extends the reach of American FTO authorities globally. The European response to Trump’s domestic Antifa designation in September reveals the international dimension of this campaign. Far-right parties across Europe have demanded similar designations in their own countries. The Dutch parliament passed a resolution calling for a terrorist designation. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced parallel measures. A draft resolution reportedly backed by 79 Members of the European Parliament from 20 countries calls for EU-wide designation.

This international far-right strategic coordination – simultaneously targeting “Antifa,” an amorphous movement with no clear organizational hierarchy, across multiple democracies – serves a common purpose: eliminating organized resistance to far-right governance by recharacterizing political opposition as terrorism.

An American FTO designation could provide legal foundation for far-right European prosecutions of American activists traveling abroad. Under existing mutual legal assistance treaties, European authorities could request extradition of Americans for “terrorism-related” activities that constitute protected political speech in the United States. International asset freezing orders could create global enforcement networks targeting democratic opposition.

The Hungarian approach illustrates these possibilities. The government of Viktor Orbán has used its Antifa classification to pursue terrorism charges against Italian MEP Ilaria Salis for allegedly participating in counter-demonstrations against far-right groups. This demonstrates how terrorist designations can transform routine political disagreement into criminal conspiracy, creating a template that could be applied to American activists abroad.

The integration of domestic and international enforcement could create a comprehensive global system for monitoring and prosecuting political opposition, transcending national boundaries and constitutional protections that have traditionally limited government surveillance authority.

The Self-Defeating Logic of Counterterrorism Overreach

The profound irony of designating Antifa as an FTO is that weaponizing counterterrorism authorities against domestic political movements will inevitably undermine those very tools when deployed against genuine international terrorist threats. The FTO framework and material support statutes have proven remarkably effective in disrupting al-Qaeda and ISIS networks precisely because courts have afforded them substantial deference based on their narrow application to FTOs that pose legitimate national security threats.

Once these authorities are stretched to encompass domestic political opposition — applied to Americans engaged in constitutionally protected speech and association — that judicial deference should evaporate. Federal courts confronting cases where naturalized citizens face denaturalization for attending protests, or where nonprofits are prosecuted for providing legal defense funds, will likely be compelled to impose constitutional limitations that have been unnecessary when the targets were genuinely foreign terrorist networks. The inevitable wave of successful constitutional challenges will probably force courts to narrow material support definitions, impose heightened intent requirements, and establish First Amendment protections, as well as other safeguards, that will then apply equally to prosecutions of actual terrorism support.

Congressional appetite for FISA reauthorization — already strained by documented FBI abuses in querying Section 702 data on protesters, political donors, and even members of Congress — will surely further erode when those authorities are systematically deployed against political opposition rather than foreign intelligence targets. The House Judiciary Committee has already advanced legislation to substantially curtail FISA authorities in response to civil liberties concerns, and adding domestic political targeting to this record could make reauthorization politically untenable.

The result of pursuing the chimera of “Antifa terrorism” could lead to the systematic dismantling of the legal infrastructure that has successfully prevented another September 11th-scale attack, opening genuine vulnerabilities to al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other international terrorist organizations that pose real threats to American security. By misappropriating tools designed to protect Americans from foreign terrorism to instead target Americans for their political beliefs, the administration risks achieving the ultimate counterterrorism failure: strengthening the nation’s real enemies while weakening the legal framework designed to combat them.

Strategic Response Options for Civil Society

Despite these formidable challenges, civil society organizations and democratic institutions retain several avenues for strategically responding. Understanding these options becomes crucial as the threat of FTO expansion moves from theoretical to imminent. Congressional oversight represents a potential avenue for institutional resistance, though one unlikely to bear immediate fruit given current political alignments. While the House and Senate Judiciary Committees technically possess authority over terrorism designations and could demand detailed justifications for applying FTO frameworks to domestic political movements, prominent members of Congress have become some of the loudest advocates for FTO designation.

Congressional appropriators theoretically could restrict funding for enforcement activities targeting constitutionally protected political speech, but such efforts would face steep political headwinds. The more realistic congressional strategy focuses on building a factual record through minority oversight efforts — hearings, letters, and reports documenting constitutional concerns — that could support future legal challenges and lay the groundwork for legislative reform should political conditions change after subsequent election cycles. In the immediate term, however, civil society must look beyond Congress to other institutional mechanisms for resistance.

State and local governments also retain significant authority to resist federal overreach. State attorneys general possess independent prosecutorial discretion and could refuse cooperation with federal investigations targeting protected political activity. Several states are considering legislation limiting cooperation with federal political surveillance operations, similar to existing immigration sanctuary policies.

Legal challenges could focus on multiple constitutional vulnerabilities. First Amendment protections for political association create barriers to criminalizing ideological movements. Due Process violations in the secretive designation process could provide grounds for challenge. Equal Protection concerns about selective targeting of left-wing movements while ignoring comparable right-wing threats might support discrimination claims or claims of arbitrary and capricious government conduct.

Out of an abundance of caution at least, organizations should establish robust compliance monitoring and due diligence frameworks to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape. This includes implementing comprehensive legal review processes for activities, partnerships, and funding sources that could face heightened scrutiny under expanded terrorism authorities. Legal counsel should regularly assess organizational exposure under material support statutes and maintain current knowledge of designation criteria and enforcement trends. Organizations should establish systematic tracking of relevant legislative and regulatory developments, including congressional hearings, agency guidance, and judicial decisions that could affect operational parameters. Financial compliance protocols should include enhanced due diligence on funding sources, grant recipients, and international partnerships to ensure alignment with applicable sanctions regulations. Regular legal audits of programs, communications, and institutional relationships can help identify potential vulnerabilities before they become predicates or excuses for enforcement issues. Organizations should also establish clear documentation protocols for activities, decision-making processes, and compliance efforts to demonstrate good faith efforts to operate within legal boundaries.

Professional associations — bar organizations, academic societies, and press freedom groups — must take public stands against FTO expansion into the domestic political space. The American Bar Association, representing over 400,000 lawyers, could provide crucial legitimacy to constitutional and other legal challenges while offering resources for targeted individuals and organizations.

Strategic communications efforts must educate the public about the implications of applying foreign terrorism authorities to domestic political movements, though public opinion on constitutional rights presents a complicated picture. Recent polling shows 53 percent of Americans believe the First Amendment “goes too far in the rights it guarantees,” while 47 percent support “a strong leader that breaks the rules.” These attitudes create favorable conditions for executive overreach, making strategic communications critical to connect abstract FTO designation to concrete consequences such as: targeting nonprofit donors, criminalizing protest participation, censoring social media, and enabling deportation of naturalized citizens for political activities. These tangible consequences may resonate more powerfully than appeals to constitutional principles, particularly when framed around personal vulnerabilities that terrorism authorities would create for millions of Americans across the political spectrum.

Constitutional Crisis and Democratic Resilience

These response strategies operate within a broader context of a constitutional crisis that transcends any single policy or legal framework. The potential designation of Antifa as an FTO represents a fundamental test of American constitutional democracy’s resilience. To be clear: The U.S. government already has the legal tools necessary to investigate domestic criminal activity by Antifa adherents. The FTO framework was designed to combat genuine foreign terrorist threats to American security. Applying these powerful authorities to domestic political movements would represent an unprecedented expansion that threatens core constitutional principles.

The implications extend well beyond anti-fascist activists to any domestic political movement maintaining international connections. Environmental groups coordinating with European counterparts, labor unions participating in international solidarity campaigns, and human rights organizations working with foreign partners could all theoretically face similar targeting under expanded FTO authorities.

As White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has articulated, the administration views opposition to its policies through a conspiratorial lens. He has characterized the Democratic Party as “a domestic extremist organization” and claimed the existence of “a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country.” This stated worldview creates conditions where routine political opposition could be reframed as terrorism worthy of the full spectrum of counterterrorism responses.

The systematic weakening of oversight mechanisms — from inspector general dismissals to civil rights office closures — has created ideal conditions for expanding terrorism authorities into the domestic political space. Without effective institutional constraints, the powerful authorities designed to combat foreign terrorism could be redirected against American citizens engaging in constitutionally protected political activity.

The designation would mark a dark turn in American democratic development. Once the precedent is established that domestic political movements can be criminalized through foreign terrorism designations, constraining these authorities becomes exponentially more difficult. The secrecy surrounding counterterrorism operations, the broad scope of material support statutes, and the deference courts typically show to national security claims create conditions where such authorities tend to expand rather than contract.

The current moment requires extraordinary vigilance from American civil society. The FTO system represents one of the most powerful tools in the federal government’s legal arsenal, deliberately designed to dismantle targeted organizations quickly and comprehensively. While these authorities have served important national security purposes when applied to genuine foreign terrorist threats, their application to domestic political movements would fundamentally alter the balance between security and liberty that defines American constitutional democracy.

The only reliable safeguard against such expansion is sustained lawful opposition from informed citizens, civil society organizations, and constitutional institutions committed to preserving the framework that makes democratic opposition possible. The stakes have never been higher, and the time for preventive action is rapidly diminishing.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239999886.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 09:56:40.250713

The ECHR forms part of UK law but is interpreted by a European court

Unlike other human rights treaties, the ECHR has a court to rule on whether governments are compliant. The UK agreed to let people take cases to the European Court of Human Rights in the 1960s.

In addition, the Human Rights Act 1998 made the ECHR part of UK domestic law. People can appeal against government immigration decisions, such as a family visa refusal or deportation for criminal offending, before an immigration judge in the UK if there is a human rights angle.

The 1998 act also requires the UK courts to “take into account” the case law of the European Court. As a result, the precedents set by the court in Strasbourg affect UK immigration law even if the UK is not involved in the case.

Article 3 and Article 8 of the ECHR can be used to contest immigration decisions

Under the European Court’s “living instrument” doctrine, its interpretation of ECHR rights can change over time. In the 1980s, the court began to rule that migrants could invoke Article 8 and Article 3 of the ECHR.

Article 8 protects the right to family and private life. Article 8 does not give families a right to choose their country of residence, but it may require someone to be granted residence rights depending on the individual circumstances. These circumstances, such as the strength of the family’s ties in the country of residence and the obstacles to living together abroad, have to be balanced against the state’s interest in immigration enforcement to see whether removal is proportionate.

Article 3 prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. If someone would experience treatment reaching this threshold, as interpreted by the court, they cannot be removed under any circumstances.

Article 8 cases involve balancing the public interest with individual circumstances

ECHR rights are reflected in the UK’s immigration rules and appeals system. This means that people can be granted residence rights based on ECHR considerations where they would not otherwise qualify (for example, if they had been living here without authorisation).

The immigration rules on Article 8 family life include allowing people to stay if there would be insurmountable obstacles to a couple living together outside the UK or if there would be unjustifiably harsh consequences for the family. Separate rules on Article 8 private life cover scenarios where people have been living in the UK without authorisation as children or for many years.

People whose Article 8 claim is denied by the Home Office can appeal to the immigration tribunal in the UK. The judge will weigh up the public interest in immigration control against the person’s family or private life, taking a wide range of factors into account, to decide whether removal is proportionate. This is known as the “balancing exercise” or “balance sheet” approach.

In cases where the person has committed a criminal offence, legislation passed in 2014 has raised the bar for an appeal to succeed, although British judges still retain some discretion to block deportation in compelling cases.

From 2015 to 2024, around 61,000 ECHR appeals were successful in the first-tier immigration tribunal. Recent media coverage has highlighted appeals by criminals specifically, although successful challenges based solely on the ECHR represent around 3% of completed deportations for criminal offending.

The Labour government wants to reinforce previous attempts to limit ECHR rights

Under Theresa May, the Home Secretary from 2010 to 2016, the government changed the immigration rules and passed primary legislation aiming at limiting discretion in Article 8 cases. The courts have sought to demonstrate respect for this aim while upholding their role in adjudicating on what constitutes a breach of ECHR rights in individual cases.

Since taking office, the Prime Minister and several Cabinet ministers have said that they believe too many ECHR cases are successful despite not being truly exceptional. An internal government review is underway and an immigration white paper has promised legislation on Article 8.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Egypt sent a team of experts to Gaza this weekend to help locate the bodies of deceased Israeli hostages, according to a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. The spokesperson added that Netanyahu had approved a purely “technical team” and that its members were not connected to the Egyptian army. Egyptian state media reported that logistical support and earth-moving equipment had been sent to Gaza. Senior Hamas Official Khalil al-Hayya said on Sunday that Hamas has started searching in new areas of Gaza for the remaining 13 hostages. Isabel Kershner reports for the New York Times; Samy Magdy and Melanie Lidman report for AP News.

The U.S. military is operating surveillance drones over the Gaza Strip to ensure that both Israel and Hamas adhere to the ceasefire agreement, Israeli and American officials said on Friday. The sources added that the surveillance missions are operating to support the new Civil-Military Coordination Centre in southern Israel. Natan Odenheimer and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

“We have […] made it clear regarding international forces that Israel will determine which forces are acceptable to us,” Netanyahu said yesterday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that the international force would be made up of “countries that Israel’s comfortable with.” Steven Scheer reports for Reuters.

Israel’s military said on Saturday that Israeli forces carried out a “targeted strike” on a member of Islamic Jihad in central Gaza, who was allegedly planning an attack on Israeli troops. Islamic Jihad said in a statement that the Israeli military’s claim of a planned attack was a “mere fallacious allegation.” Local medics said that four people were wounded in a drone strike, but there were no immediate reports of deaths. Witnesses separately reported that Israeli tanks had shelled eastern areas of Gaza City. The Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters reports.

An Israeli drone attack today has killed at least one person in Abasan al-Kabira, near Khan Younis in Gaza, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Al Jazeera reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

UNRWA said yesterday that Israel continues to block its international staff and humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. Around 12,000 of its local staff are pushing ahead with providing “health-care, psychosocial support, and education to the people,” UNRWA added in a post on social media. Tim Hume and Stephen Quillen report for Al Jazeera.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russian drones killed three people and injured 31 others, including six children, in an air attack on Kyiv on Saturday night. A separate drone attack on Friday night killed two people and injured 13 others, also in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Moscow had used nearly 1,200 attack drones, more than 1,360 guided aerial bombs, and over 50 missiles against Ukraine in the last seven days. Lidia Kelly and Pavel Polityuk report for Reuters; Anastasiia Malenko reports for Reuters.

Russia successfully tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, a weapon that Moscow says is capable of piercing any defence shield, Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday. Russia’s Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov, told Putin that the missile travelled 14,000 km and was in the air for around 15 hours. Guy Faulconbridge and Lidia Kelly report for Reuters

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Argentinian President Javier Milei’s Freedom Advances party secured nearly 41% of the national vote in Argentina’s legislative elections yesterday, nearly doubling its representation in Congress. Trump congratulated Milei on his “landslide victory” on social media, later adding “BIG WIN […] for Javier Milei, a wonderful Trump Endorsed Candidate!” Ali Walker reports for POLITICO.

Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas announced yesterday that Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh would temporarily assume the leadership of the Palestinian Authority if Abbas were to step down or die. Sheikh would hold those powers for 90 days before elections would take place to pick a new leader. Aaron Boxerman and Adam Rasgon report for the New York Times.

Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) announced yesterday that it is withdrawing its fighters from Turkey to northern Iraq “to avoid clashes or provocations.” The PKK had announced earlier this year that it would disband and renounce armed conflict in Turkey, ending four decades of fighting. Stella Martany and Cinar Kiper AP News.

The Pakistani military said yesterday that 5 Pakistani soldiers and 25 fighters from Afghanistan died in clashes near the border. Officials from both countries arrived in Istanbul on Saturday for talks aimed at preventing a full-scale conflict. Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja said that failure to reach an agreement in Istanbul would mean “open war.” Ariba Shahid reports for Reuters.

Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary yesterday claimed that it had captured the Sudanese army’s headquarters in El-Fasher. Two videos shared by the RSF show its soldiers cheering outside the army base; Reuters was not able to verify the date of this video. The army has yet to give a statement on its current position. Khalid Abdelaziz and Nafisa Eltahir report.

Israeli strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon yesterday killed three people, the Lebanese Ministry of Health said. The Israeli military said it had targeted Hezbollah members, adding that it had killed Ali Hussein al-Mousawi, who “played a significant role in the re-establishment and strengthening of Hezbollah.” Hezbollah has not confirmed any information about the deaths. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon said that an Israeli drone had dropped a grenade close to one of its patrols on Sunday afternoon. Al Jazeera reports.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Sixty-five nations this weekend signed the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime in Hanoi. The treaty establishes the first universal framework for investigating and prosecuting offences committed online and facilitates the sharing of electronic evidence across borders. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “It is a vow that no country, no matter their level of deployment, will be left defenceless against cybercrime.” Vibhu Mishra reports for UN News.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Trump administration is planning to reorganize ICE by replacing several senior leaders in field offices across the country, according to sources. The sources said that the proposals stem from frustration in the Homeland Security Department and the White House that Trump’s goal of deporting over 1 million people in his first year in office is not being met. Hamed Aleaziz and Tyler Pager report for the New York Times.

The Department for Homeland Security said on Friday that it plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Gracia to the “thriving democracy” of Liberia within a week, according to a court filing. The Justice Department has previously attempted to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, but none of these countries agreed to take him. Julianna Bragg reports for Axios.

Immigration authorities yesterday detained British commentator Sami Hamdi and revoked his visa, a Homeland Security Department official said. Hamdi spoke at a gala for the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) in California on Saturday and was due to speak in Florida on Sunday but he was detained at San Francisco International Airport. Conservative activist Laura Loomer took credit for Hamdi’s arrest on social media. Stephen Coates reports for Reuters.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

A U.S. military strike against an alleged drug vessel on Friday killed six people in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on social media. Hegseth said it was the first strike carried out at night and claimed that the vessel was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart report for Reuters.

Hegseth has ordered the deployment of the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, along with its accompanying warships and attack planes, to the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, the Pentagon said on Friday. The enhanced U.S. military presence “will bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,” a Pentagon spokesperson said. It is unclear when Ford will be moving to the region or where exactly it will be positioned. Charlie Savage and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

USS Graveley, a U.S. guided missile destroyer, yesterday docked in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago’s capital. U.S. officials and officials from Trinidad and Tobago said the warship will remain in Trinidad until Thursday so that both countries can carry out training exercises. Venezuela said the “dangerous conduct of military exercises” in the waters of a neighboring country constitutes a “serious threat” to the Caribbean region, according to a statement from the Venezuelan foreign ministry. AP News

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump cosigned a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia yesterday on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. The first phase of the agreement involves Thailand’s release of 18 Cambodian soldiers and the removal of heavy weapons and landmines from the border region. Malaysian troops are being deployed to ensure the fighting does not restart. Erin Hale and Tim Hume report for Al Jazeera.

A Navy helicopter and a fighter jet based on the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier yesterday crashed into the South China Sea within 30 minutes of each other, the U.S. Pacific Fleet said in a statement. The causes of the two crashes are under investigation. Trump said today that the incidents could have been caused by “bad fuel,” ruling out foul play. Konstantin Toropin reports for AP News.

U.S. intelligence, obtained in 2022, shows that the United Arab Emirates gave technology to China to upgrade its long-range missiles fired from fighter jets, according to six sources. Two sources said that the technology was passed to Huawei by G42, the UAE’s AI group. G42 disputed the U.S. intelligence, saying it categorically rejected the “false and defamatory allegations.” Demetri Sevastopulo reports for the Financial Times.

Chinese and U.S. negotiators said yesterday that they had agreed to a framework deal on tariffs and other issues ahead of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s meeting this week. The issues discussed include bilateral trade, export controls, reciprocal tariff extensions, fentanyl-related tariffs, and cooperation on combating fentanyl trafficking, according to the Chinese negotiators. Jamieson Greer, the U.S. representative, said, “We talked about extending the truce, we talked about rare earths, of course, we talked about all kinds of topics.” Keith Bradsher and Zunaira Saieed report for the New York Times.

Trump announced on Saturday that he would increase tariffs on Canadian goods by 10% following the Canadian television ad that used clips from an address by Ronald Reagan. Matina Stevis Gridneff reports for the New York Times.

The Treasury Department announced on Friday that it was sanctioning Colombian President Gustavo Petro because he provided “benefits” to “narco-terrorist organizations” since taking office in 2022. The department has also sanctioned Petro’s wife, his son, and Colombia’s interior minister. Julie Turkewitz reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty on Friday morning to felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James’s trial is set to go ahead in late January 2026. Devan Cole, Lauren del Valle, and Kara Scannell report for CNN.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

A Pentagon spokesperson said on Friday that the Defense Department had accepted an anonymous gift of $130 million from a wealthy donor to pay military salaries during the government shutdown. Two sources named Timothy Mellon, a billionaire and major financial backer of Trump, as the anonymous donor. Mellon has not confirmed this. White House officials said that covering the cost of military pay for the first half of October totalled about $6.5 billion. Leo Shane III, Paul McLeary, and Jack Detsch report for POLITICO; Tyler Page reports for the New York Times.

The Justice Department said on Friday that it will monitor polling sites in California and New Jersey ahead of the November 4 election “to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.” Shawn Hubler and Laurel Rosenhall report for the New York Times.

The Trump administration will not use emergency funds to cover the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Food Assistance Program during the government shutdown, according to a memo obtained by POLITICO. SNAP is set to run out of federal funds at the end of the month, which would leave around 42 million people without the necessary food benefits from November. Administration officials believe that Democratic governors and anti-hunger groups will sue the administration for not tapping into the contingency fund for SNAP, two sources said. Grace Yarrow and Meredith Lee Hill report.

Trump last week nominated Hegseth’s senior military aide Lt. Gen. Chrisopher LaNeve to replace Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. James Mingus. The Senate still needs to approve LaNeve. Hegseth did not announce LaNeve’s nomination, nor did Mingus announce his departure, even though he is less than halfway through a four-year role. “Hegseth wants [LaNeve] in,” a defense official said. “Who he replaces doesn’t matter.” Paul McLeary reports for POLITICO.

He argued that the Trump administration’s actions bring to mind the way China and Iran’s repressive governments have previously executed drug smugglers.
“They summarily execute people without presenting evidence to the public,” Paul contended in his conversation with Bream.
The Kentucky libertarian joined Democratic US senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam Schiff of California in introducing a war powers resolution that would have blocked the Trump administration’s use of military strikes within or against Venezuela.
They’re going to be – like – dead.” Paul has had military-related disagreements with Trump before his Sunday interview on Fox.","The Trump administration’s military airstrikes against boats off Venezuela’s coast that the White House claims were being used for drug trafficking are “extrajudicial killings”, said Rand Paul, the president’s fellow Republican and US senator from Kentucky.

Paul’s strong comments on the topic came on Sunday during an interview on Republican-friendly Fox News, three days after Donald Trump publicly claimed he “can’t imagine” federal lawmakers would have “any problem” with the strikes when asked about seeking congressional approval for them.

US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.

Speaking with Fox News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream, Paul asserted that Congress has “gotten no information” on the campaign of strikes from Trump’s administration – despite the president claiming the White House would be open to briefing the federal lawmakers about the offensive.

“No one said their name, no one said what evidence, no one said whether they’re armed, and we’ve had no evidence presented,” Paul said of the targeted boats or those on board. He argued that the Trump administration’s actions bring to mind the way China and Iran’s repressive governments have previously executed drug smugglers.

“They summarily execute people without presenting evidence to the public,” Paul contended in his conversation with Bream. “So it’s wrong.”

Paul’s comments separate him from other Republican members of Congress who have spoken in favor of the Trump administration’s offensive near Venezuela, including US House representative Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, as reported by the US news website Semafor.

The Kentucky libertarian joined Democratic US senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam Schiff of California in introducing a war powers resolution that would have blocked the Trump administration’s use of military strikes within or against Venezuela. But the measure failed to win a majority in the Senate.

Trump on Friday told the media that his administration would be willing to brief lawmakers on the strikes but simply saw no reason to seek congressional authorization for them.

“I think we’re just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” Trump said. “We’re going to kill them. They’re going to be – like – dead.”

In August, a man ran away from federal agents onto a freeway in the same state and was fatally struck by a vehicle.","A 24-year-old Hondurian national was struck and killed by a vehicle while fleeing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Virginia last week.

Josué Castro Rivera was on his way to his gardening job Thursday when ICE officers pulled over his vehicle and tried to detain him and three other passengers, according to his brother, Henry Castro.

Castro Rivera bolted on foot from the scene and attempted to cross Interstate 264 in Norfolk — where a 2002 Ford pickup fatally struck him, according to state and federal authorities.

He was pronounced dead on the scene around 11 a.m., according to the Virginia State Police.

“He had a very good heart,” his devastated brother said Sunday.

Castro Rivera had been living in the US for four years and was sending money back to Honduras for his family, Henry said.

ICE officers had been carrying out a “targeted, intelligence-based” operation, and that the passengers were detained for allegedly living in the country without legal permission, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

Castro Rivera “resisted heavily and fled” and died after a passing vehicle hit him, the DHS said.

“He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him,” his heartbroken brother said.

Castro Rivera’s family plans to raise money to send his body back to Honduras for a funeral, blasting his death as an “injustice.”

The DHS said the garden-worker’s death was “a direct result of every politician, activist, and reporter who continues to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission and ways to avoid detention.”

Similar deaths during immigration operations have triggered outrage and calls for additional investigations.

Last month in a Chicago suburb, federal immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican man during a traffic stop.

The DHS initially said a federal officer was “seriously injured,” but police body camera video showed the federal officer walking around and describing his own injuries as “nothing major.”

In July, a farmworker died after falling from a 30-foot-high roof during a chaotic immigration raid at a southern California marijuana farm.

In August, a man ran away from federal agents onto a freeway in the same state and was fatally struck by a vehicle.

Immigration detention is supposed to be administrative, not punitive.","TORONTO, Oct. 27, 2025 /CNW/ - In a major procedural victory, the Ontario Court of Appeal has unanimously upheld the certification of a national human rights class action challenging Canada's practice of placing immigration detainees in provincial jails.

The matter is directed to proceed to trial as a Class Action.

In Richard v. Canada (Attorney General), more than 8,300 non-citizens detained in provincial and territorial prisons between 2016 and 2024 will pursue claims that the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) violated their Charter rights and acted with systemic negligence. These immigration detainees were held in 87 provincial jails under agreements between CBSA and provincial governments. Many were asylum seekers or permanent residents.

The class members were detained in jails for purely administrative reasons. None of the members of the certified class were detained for criminal charges.

All provinces have now ended their immigration detention agreements and arrangements with the CBSA.

The Court of Appeal confirmed that claims alleging systemic negligence and breaches of sections 7, 9, 12 and 15 of the Charter should proceed to trial. These claims concern fundamental rights concerning liberty, arbitrary detention, cruel treatment, and discrimination. The Courts have ruled that those claims raise common legal and factual issues for the class which are deserving of adjudication at trial.

Human-Rights Criticism

The Canadian Red Cross, the UN Human Rights Committee, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International have all criticized Canada for detaining non-citizens in jails alongside convicted offenders, subjecting them to strip searches, lockdowns, segregation, and restricted access to counsel and family.

Their findings describe these practices as inconsistent with international standards, which require immigration detention to be non-punitive, humane, and a measure of last resort.

The saga began when the Trump administration sent federal immigration agents into Los Angeles earlier this year to conduct large-scale raids and arrests.
He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.” At issue in each case, however, is Trump’s legal authority to federalize the National Guard and use it for domestic law enforcement.
On most days, each state’s National Guard is a state militia by default with the governor serving as commander-in-chief.
Armed with that deferential standard, the three-judge panel proceeded to green-light Trump’s deployment of the National Guard because of the facts on the ground.","Three states—California, Oregon, and Illinois—are currently suing the Trump administration over its National Guard deployments in separate lawsuits with mixed results. Last week, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a major setback to California Governor Gavin Newsom by allowing Trump to continue to deploy the National Guard units while litigation continues.

There are significant legal questions at stake in these cases, namely when and how the president can deploy the National Guard on American soil, and what courts, states, and Congress can and have done to constrain him. In another sense, what’s really at the core of these cases is whether judges can see what’s happening right in front of them.

Newsom v. Trump is extraordinarily tangled at the moment because separate portions of the case are being considered simultaneously in different federal courts. Last week’s ruling by the Ninth Circuit dealt with the lower court’s decision to issue a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration over the summer. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on that initial TRO and the court decisions that followed it.

The saga began when the Trump administration sent federal immigration agents into Los Angeles earlier this year to conduct large-scale raids and arrests. Those raids drew large numbers of protesters. In response, Trump federalized the California National Guard and ordered it to protect federal immigration agents as they carried out their raids and arrests. California Governor Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration to challenge the National Guard’s federalization and deployment.

In the lawsuit, Newsom argued that the deployment was unlawful, unconstitutional, and procedurally invalid. Judge Charles Breyer, who happens to be the younger brother of retired Justice Stephen Breyer, ruled in the governor’s favor and granted a temporary restraining order. His ruling was blunt about what had happened.

“At this early stage of the proceedings, the Court must determine whether the president followed the congressionally mandated procedure for his actions,” Breyer wrote. “He did not. His actions were illegal—both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.”

At issue in each case, however, is Trump’s legal authority to federalize the National Guard and use it for domestic law enforcement. The administration has pointed to language from a provision in federal law known as Section 12406, which comes from the Militia Act of 1903. On most days, each state’s National Guard is a state militia by default with the governor serving as commander-in-chief. The law in question, however, allows the president to “call [National Guard units] into federal service” under three circumstances.

One of those circumstances is if the United States is “invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation.” While the Trump administration has claimed that the “invasion” language in other laws and constitutional provisions can be triggered by the presence of undocumented immigrants, they did not rely on that argument here. Instead they pointed to the other two circumstances: if there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of [the federal government],” or if the president is “unable with the regular forces to execute [federal law].”

The administration argued that the latter two conditions were met in Los Angeles (and in the other two cities, for that matter) because protesters were obstructing federal efforts to carry out mass deportations. Before that point, however, it also argued that the federal courts had no jurisdiction over Trump’s actions, citing the 1827 case Martin v. Mott.

Martin involved President James Madison’s use of the New York militia during the War of 1812. Jacob Mott, a member of the militia, refused to comply and was court-martialed after the war ended. This was not uncommon as many Federalists in New England opposed the war. In a subsequent lawsuit, Mott claimed that his court-martial was invalid because he had not disobeyed lawful orders, effectively rejecting Madison’s authority to call up and direct the militia during the war.

The Supreme Court disagreed and ruled that Madison’s actions were lawful. Justice Joseph Story wrote in broad strokes. He concluded that Congress had lawfully delegated the discretion about activating the militia to the president, and that his decision as to whether or not an emergency existed to justify it was “conclusive upon all other persons.” Story gave broad latitude to the president in these circumstances. “Whenever a statute gives a discretionary power to any person, to be exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule of construction, that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts,” he wrote.

That sounds, at least on its face, like a pretty strong precedent for the administration to cite. Breyer was unconvinced. He noted that the court’s deference stemmed at least in part from its historic pattern of deferral to the president in matters of war and national security. The War of 1812 obviously counted as such; law-enforcement raids in Los Angeles plainly do not. In addition, Breyer noted, the Supreme Court had not embraced such a deferential approach to presidential decision-making in general in the two hundred years of rulings that followed Martin.

“Between the unique concerns raised by federal military intrusion into civilian affairs and the fact that federal officials are not uniquely positioned to ascertain what is happening on the ground (as compared to, say, state and local officials), the Court is not convinced that the judiciary cannot question presidential assertions about domestic activities leading to military action,” Breyer concluded.

The three-judge Ninth Circuit panel, which consisted of two Trump appointees and a Biden appointee, took a much different approach. It viewed the Martin ruling as broadly applicable to the present day. The panel noted that “some of the Martin Court’s reasoning addressed factual circumstances of that case that are not present here, particularly the Court’s consideration of the nature of a foreign invasion and concerns about militiamen disobeying orders.” Nonetheless, it concluded that “we must give a great level of deference to the President’s determination that a predicate condition exists” because of the ruling.

California asked the Ninth Circuit to review the panel’s decision in an en banc hearing, meaning that the entire appellate court would review it. (Since the Ninth Circuit is so large, it only uses a subset of eleven judges for en banc hearings.) The court declined to do so, keeping the lower court’s restraining order on ice for now. That drew a strenuous dissent from Judge Marsha Berzon and some of her colleagues, who castigated the panel’s decision.

Among Berzon’s critiques was the panel’s approach to Martin. “Martin cannot, and does not, change the meaning of a statute not in effect when Martin was decided and whose predecessor, the Militia Act of 1795, was distinct from and not considered in Martin,” she explained. “Read carefully, in fact, Martin did not address at all courts’ authority to review the President’s exercise of his delegated power to call forth the militia.” (Emphasis hers.) Armed with that deferential standard, the three-judge panel proceeded to green-light Trump’s deployment of the National Guard because of the facts on the ground.

This is a fraught exercise, to say the least, because Trump’s own arguments for the deployments often appear to be either exaggerated or even false. The president’s choice of targets also appears to hinge less on whether there is an actual emergency and more on whether he likes the city and its residents. Los Angeles and Chicago are disfavored and suffered accordingly; San Francisco, on the other hand, escaped Trump’s targeting for now because Silicon Valley billionaires called him this week and asked him not to intervene.

The panel found that events on the ground met that threshold. “There is evidence that the day before, protesters threw objects at ICE vehicles trying to complete a law enforcement operation, ‘pinned down’ several FPS officers defending federal property by throwing ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid, and other objects,’ and used ‘large rolling commercial dumpsters as a battering ram” in an attempt to breach the parking garage of a federal building,’” it noted when summarizing the evidence presented to it.

Breyer drew different conclusions. “While [federal officials] have pointed to several instances of violence, they have not identified a violent, armed, organized, open and avowed uprising against the government as a whole,” he wrote. “The definition of rebellion is unmet.” The judge pointed out that while some protesters threw bottles and rocks, they were not carrying firearms and did not follow some central or organized authority that sought to overthrow the civil power.

The episodes of violence also occurred during otherwise peaceful protests. “Courts have repeatedly reaffirmed that peaceful protest does not lose its protection merely because some isolated individuals act violently outside the protections of the First Amendment,” Breyer observed. He rejected the notion that the collective totality of protests became a “rebellion” on such broad grounds.

On the other Section 12406 condition, that the president is “unable to execute the laws,” Breyer also found insufficient support for that reason. The Trump administration claimed it could have apprehended more people but for the protests. That was not enough, the judge concluded. “Nor does the statute allow for the federalizing of the National Guard when the president faces some risk in executing the laws, though of course federal employees should never have to fear danger when performing their jobs,” Breyer wrote. “The statute requires that the president be ‘unable’ to execute the laws of the United States. That did not happen here.”

The panel took a far more deferential view of the matter, however, and blocked Breyer’s temporary restraining order solely on the third condition—the “unable to execute the laws” one—by concluding that one was sufficient. That decision drew more criticism from Barzon when the Ninth Circuit denied en banc review. She noted that the third condition had only been invoked once before in its century-long existence under far more urgent circumstances.

“Although Section 12406(3) has been in existence for over 100 years, the only other time it has been invoked was when President Nixon federalized the National Guard to sort and deliver mail following a strike by over a quarter of all national postal workers, an event that “threatened to bring the nation to a standstill,” she noted. In an era before emails and the internet, this would have been devastating for the national economy—and crippling for the federal government’s basic operations.

Berzon was careful to note that while historical practice was not the actual boundary of the Section 12406 power, it could be highly indicative of its scope. “The 1970 invocation confirms that the text means precisely what it says: for the President to call forth the National Guard, he must actually and significantly lack the capacity to carry out certain laws through ordinary means,” she explained.

What truly separated the opinions of Breyer and Berzon from the panel’s opinion was not just different standards of review or jurisdictional questions, but a deeper sense of this country’s history and principles. These cases are not merely about whether the president happened to comply with a few pre-conditions in a particular federal law; they are about bedrock principles in the Anglo-American legal tradition.

“The rejection of military involvement in civil law enforcement except upon the most exigent circumstances traces to the events immediately preceding the American Revolution,” she wrote. “At that time, the British government used troops to enforce laws that American colonists widely considered oppressive and so inspired deep and enduring antagonism towards military involvement in domestic law enforcement.” These events led the Framers to put strict limits on when and how the military could be used on American soil for domestic purposes.

Newsom v. Trump is unlikely to be the vehicle by which these disputes reach the Supreme Court. That fate will likely fall to the Illinois litigation since the federal district-court judge and the Seventh Circuit all sided with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, which simplified matters. But the different approaches between the various judges in the California case are likely to be more illustrative of how the Supreme Court handles the matter. At its core, this is a case about determining whether the president is acting in good faith when wielding immense power. The justices’ track record on that front is not reassuring.",https://images.newrepublic.com/dc6712d7d281750de6b36cf1888296f657684e42.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-10-27 06:57:25.414425

But Canal Street’s western portion is a civic disgrace.
Developers began buying up small Canal Street properties a few years ago with plans to tear them down and put up modern new buildings.
As a result, little redevelopment has come to the street’s western fringe since 2017.
Canal Street’s cacophonous western portion has long seemed more of a rough outskirt than a handsome boulevard the border between Soho and Tribeca deserves.","The Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on Canal Street was not a pretty sight.

If President Trump wants to ensure Zohran Mamdani’s election so he can “take over” the city, as he’s warned, he couldn’t come up with a spectacle more certain to drive liberal New Yorkers into Mamdani’s camp than a squad of masked ICE agents, accompanied by an armored vehicle, descending on unlicensed street vendors in broad daylight to bust a whopping dozen or so for peddling counterfeit goods.

But unlike agitators who screamed “Fascist!” at the agents, our emotions should be nuanced. With City Hall unable or unwilling to protect legitimate Canal Street businesses and the public from the scourge of unlicensed sidewalk merchants, somebody had to do the job or at least begin to — even if the optics were terrible and the results minuscule.

I celebrate and honor the Big Apple’s diversity and singularly colorful street life. But Canal Street’s western portion is a civic disgrace. The cheap wooden animals, “I ❤️ New York” caps and bogus Gucci and Cartier products — and the guys who sell them — have Canal in a stranglehold. The abandonment to sidewalk anarchy stalled a nascent revival that was on the point of making the run-down boulevard worthy of its potentially iconic crosstown location.

Imagine how much worse it would be if misdemeanor-friendly Mamdani gave the hustlers even more free rein than they already enjoy!

Developers began buying up small Canal Street properties a few years ago with plans to tear them down and put up modern new buildings. One owner told me in 2017, “Canal is in significant flux.” But that was before “bail reform,” “Raise the Age” and legions of leftist judges and elected officials made prosecution of most crimes short of murder ineffectual.

As a result, little redevelopment has come to the street’s western fringe since 2017. Reason No. 1: The lawless sidewalk scene scared off potential retail tenants needed to anchor new buildings.

“I buy and sell and lease on Canal, so you can’t use my name. It was already the worst and noisiest traffic bottleneck in Manhattan. But the vendors are the worst deal-breakers,” one real-estate executive told me after the ICE raid. “I don’t like the way ICE did it, I’m the farthest thing from a Trumper, but somebody had to get a handle on this thing.”

The day after the raid, with the hustlers (at least for now) chased out, I was able to truly see — and appreciate — the street for the first time I could remember. Canal Street’s cacophonous western portion has long seemed more of a rough outskirt than a handsome boulevard the border between Soho and Tribeca deserves. Recent incremental changes made it a somewhat softer and gentler outskirt. The familiar engines of urban regeneration — lower rents than in neighboring districts, easy transit accessibility and enough surviving old-school grit to qualify as “edgy” — drew small boutiques, art galleries and even a hotel or two.

The blocks along the Holland Tunnel approach now have enough interesting shops and galleries to seem cutting-edge, the way Alphabet City did before gentrification. A stroller west of Canal’s bustling Chinatown portion will find the “largest Banksy museum in the world,” a former bank turned into a haunted house, Nordic Knots handmade rugs, the members-only “Social Wellness Club” and a Brooklyn Circus menswear shop. They uneasily share the sidewalks with mysterious shopping arcades and retailers of hardware, lighting fixtures, plastics and a thriving foam-rubber shop with a “Now hiring” sign.

But as the funky brick-and-mortar improved inch by inch, the unchecked proliferation of menacing vendors made much of the street a creepshow, especially at night.

Hustlers so dominate Broadway and Canal’s south corner that my wife and I, having alighted from the subway, took a cab to a restaurant just three blocks away to avoid a gauntlet of aggressive, marijuana-puffing vendors backed by a soundtrack of boom-box rap music. The scene wasn’t merely ugly — it was scary.

It’s not only my impression. NY1 reported last month that 800 local business owners signed a petition demanding more NYPD enforcement on and around Canal Street, citing open drug dealing, unreported muggings and robberies and sidewalk defecation. The NYPD responded that it’s conducting “targeted operations” to stem the sleaze, but before ICE stormed in, there was little if any visible improvement.

Of course, shoddy goods fill sidewalks all over Midtown. Hustlers even took over the Brooklyn Bridge’s narrow pedestrian walkways until a New York Post exposé shamed Mayor Adams’ team into getting rid of them (although they’ve begun crawling back).",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/newspress-collage-j9xi1ipkb-1761500729558.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1761486389&w=1200,N,,2025-10-27 07:16:47.242582

""Abducting a prominent British Muslim journalist and political commentator on a speaking tour in the United States because he dared to criticize the Israeli government's genocide is a blatant affront to free speech,"" said the Washington, DC-based Council on American-Islamic Relations in a statement. Hamdi was in California to speak at CAIR's annual gala on Saturday. On Sunday, he was heading to Florida to speak at another of the group's events.

US Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed on social media Sunday that ""thanks to the work of"" DHS chief Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ""and the men and women of law enforcement,"" Hamdi's visa was revoked and he is in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody pending removal.

Under President Donald Trump, McLaughlin said, ""those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country. It's common sense.""

""We call on ICE to immediately account for and release Mr. Hamdi, whose only 'crime' is criticizing a foreign government that committed genocide.""

McLaughlin also linked to a social media post from Amy ""Mek"" Mekelburg, the founder and editor-in-chief of Rise Align Ignite Reclaim (RAIR), which CAIR identifies as ""a hate organization and website that regularly publishes anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim conspiracy theories."" Both Mekelburg and far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer publicly celebrated ICE's detention of Hamdi.

Meanwhile, CAIR said that ""our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice. We call on ICE to immediately account for and release Mr. Hamdi, whose only 'crime' is criticizing a foreign government that committed genocide.""

""Our nation must stop abducting critics of the Israeli government at the behest of unhinged Israel First bigots,"" the group added. ""This is an Israel First policy, not an America First policy, and it must end.""

Throughout Trump's second term, his administration has provided the Israeli government with diplomatic and weapons support—like his Democratic predecessor—while targeting foreign scholars critical of Israel's genocide in the Gaza Strip for deportation. The administration has also engaged in a broader crackdown on dissent.

Blasting Hamdi's detention and potential deportation, Yasir Qadhi, a Pakistani American Muslim scholar and dean of the Islamic Seminary of America in Texas, said on social media Sunday: ""Our government is doing this on behalf of and as Israel's proxy, because he is a vocal critic of that genocidal regime. Our country is heading towards a fascist dictatorship in which any speech that goes against the official narrative is going to be criminalized.""

""This is happening within the context of the most hate-filled, blatant, anti-Muslim bigotry we've seen in our lifetimes,"" he continued, pointing to the New York City mayoral race. ""Disagree with Sami's message all you want, but do so with facts and evidence, not by banning and deporting. Unless they come back to their senses, these same people who are being whipped up into such hysteria will happily and willingly become the very embodiments of evil that they claim to fight, and that inhumane evil will be directed against multiple minorities, not just Muslims.""

Hamdi is ""the managing director of the International Interest, a global risk and intelligence company,"" according to his LinkedIn profile. He advises governments on the geopolitical dynamics of Europe and the Middle East and North Africa region, and ""has significant expertise in advising companies on commercial issues related to volatile political environments.""

Hamdi has bachelor's and master's degrees from the prestigious SOAS University of London, and has provided commentary on Al Jazeera, BBC, TRT World, and other outlets. In response to Hamdi's detention, Drop Site News shared his recent interview on Sky News about the ceasefire in Gaza after two years of US-backed Israel's genocidal assault.

This past summer, Hamdi took a speaking tour in South Africa, where he spoke with The Voice of the Cape, the country's first Muslim radio station. In an interview, he credited his father, Mohamed Hechmi Hamdi, for his political awareness.

""My father was very active in politics; he was the head of the student movement in Tunisia, head of the Islamist Tunisian Student Movement, sentenced at 20 years of age, imprisoned at 19, imprisoned at 20, had to flee Tunisia, went to Algeria and then Sudan, and then ended up in London,"" Hamdi explained. ""He then became a prominent voice in trying to push back against dictatorial regimes in Tunisia, and I grew up under that sort of umbrella, even if it was not something I wanted to embrace, as I wanted to be a footballer.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61932282&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C10%2C0%2C10,N,,2025-10-27 08:56:50.142729

Why it matters: Fear in one of the country's poorest regions shows how the Trump administration's immigration crackdown is shaking a vulnerable labor force, mostly undocumented, overwhelming churches and food banks.

The raids in the region are also partly forcing the Trump administration to warn Americans of a looming food crisis brought on by its own crackdown on undocumented farmworkers.

Zoom in: Axios recently interviewed more than a dozen farmworkers, volunteers, advocates and religious leaders in the Coachella Valley, who said the panic is pushing families to the brink of starvation and mental health breakdowns.

They said some families with undocumented members are being reduced to one breadwinner (or none) as farmworkers opt not to work out of anxiety that a raid could nab them away.

They said families are keeping U.S.-born children home from school, often over images they've seen on social media from other cities of immigration agents arresting parents in cars while picking up students.

They said three-bedroom trailers have become homes to three families, sometimes accommodating as many as 15 people per dwelling, as people try to combine resources for survival.

What they're saying: ""People are scared to even come out of the house. They just sit inside, getting depressed,"" farmworker organizer Rosalba De La Cruz told Axios in Spanish.

""I've never seen it like this,"" Imelda Barragan, a farmworker, said in Spanish. She's seen periodic raids in the area over the decades.

Reyes Lopez, a lead community organizer with the Inland Congregations United for Change, said the cruelty of the raids puzzles people, especially since workers are needed in this area, which can get to 115 degrees.

The other side: ""Under Secretary (Kristi) Noem, our brave law enforcement officers are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin tells Axios.

""Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training. There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson tells Axios.

Zoom out: The Coachella Valley, a desert area in Southern California that's a 2 1/2 hours drive east of Los Angeles, is a popular tourist destination with towns like Palm Springs and events like the Coachella music festival.

It also supports year-round farming because of its warm, sunny climate and access to irrigation fed by the Colorado River.

It employs tens of thousands of farmworkers, generating billions of dollars annually.

The region produces crops during the winter months when other areas can't, helping stabilize the national food supply.

The valley is one of the country's leading producers of winter vegetables and fruits, particularly dates, leafy greens, bell peppers, table grapes and citrus fruits.

Between the lines: Religious and multifaith groups like PICO California and Catholic archdioceses are stepping in to help farmworkers.

Axios witnessed volunteers and fellow farmworkers with permanent residency status organize a food bank at Mission San Juan Diego in Mecca, Calif. Dozens of cars of needy farmworkers lined up for three days' worth of donated food.

Meanwhile, some struggling families are taking in U.S.-born children of parents recently deported.

Over 65% of people in the Eastern Coachella Valley live in poverty, according to the Coachella Valley Rescue Mission.

The bottom line: Rev. Rocendo Herrera of Our Lady of Guadalupe Sanctuary in Mecca tells Axios that since the raids, every week the Catholic church gets around 4,000 people for services.

Morales and Olazaba are both U.S. citizens born in the country, but Morales says the officers, who were dressed in plain clothes, basically attacked him without provocation.

""I'm feeling multiple punches being thrown to the back of my head,"" Morales said. ""The entire time I'm screaming 'help, help, help.' I still don't know who they are. I'm just guessing, assuming they were ICE.""

Federal agents eventually transported Morales to FBI headquarters in Chicago, where he was released with no charges.

Agents took Olazaba to Rush Copley Hospital in Aurora for the injury to her head. They also gave her a citation for allegedly obstructing an arrest.

A group of protestors went to the hospital as well, and some of them confronted the federal agents.

Aurora Mayor John Laesch met them at the hospital to check on Aurora police and to document the activities. He is opposed to the federal agents being in Aurora at all.

""We believe a lot of these detentions are unconstitutional,"" Laesch said. ""These are US.. citizens, Aurora residents, and we need to make sure they're protected.""

""I'm an American citizen. Born and raised in Aurora,"" Morales said. ""I'm 35 years old. Never have I been treated Ike this by anybody.""

The mayor says he's looking into an ordinance similar to Chicago and other communities that would prevent ICE from being in the community without a warrant.

ABC7 Chicago has reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment but they have not yet responded.

DHS issues statement on Saturday's operations in Chicago

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement Sunday about a separate incident in Chicago, saying, ""On October 25, 2025, Border Patrol conducted an operation that resulted in the arrest of, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico, who has previously been arrested for assault.

During the operations Border Patrol agents were surrounded and boxed in by a group of agitators. Federal law enforcement issued multiple lawful commands and verbal warnings, all of which were ignored. During the operation, two U.S. citizens were arrested for assaulting and impeding a federal officer. To safely clear the area after multiple warnings and the crowd continuing to advance on them, Border Patrol had to deploy crowd control measures.

""Our officers are facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, abusers, and gang members. Secretary Noem's message to the rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18075195_102625-wls-aurora-hospital-protest-clean-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-27 07:16:58.570335

By Mel Leonor Barclay andJasmine Mithani for The 19th

Nonprofits working to combat domestic violence and sexual assault have notched a string of legal wins as they push back against efforts by the Trump administration to put restrictions on work that goes against the administration’s views.

A series of lawsuits has, at least temporarily, blocked the administration from enforcing restrictions on millions of dollars of funding for upcoming grants and forced it to return grants it took away from some nonprofits working with LGBTQ+ victims.

Domestic violence groups and the broader network of gender-based violence nonprofits have been on high alert since the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders — followed by a temporary federal freeze in late January — to end federal funding for programs or organizations out of step with the administration’s ideology. The funding, advocates say, is essential to providing life-saving services to vulnerable victims, who are more likely to be women.

Related | Shocker: Trump thinks domestic violence isn't really a crime

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.

The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”

Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.

The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.

“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”

Related | Sexual assault victims are being abandoned—just as Trump ordered

A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”

Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.

Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.

“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.

“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”

A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.

The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.

In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”

The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.

LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.

FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.

The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.

The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.

The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?

They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”

“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)

“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”

The administration notified states of the new rule in August. It is expected to take effect in November.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1492180/story_image/AP469146883244.jpg?1761341268,N,,2025-10-27 09:56:52.749402

Hamdi had spoken at a gala for the group on Saturday in California and was heading to Florida for another event prior to his arrest.

Boston University News Service

President Trump announced a proclamation to revise the H-1B non-immigrant visa program on Sept. 19, 2025, stating that it has been widely “abused” by employers. The H-1B visa program was initially established by the Immigration Act of 1990, signed into law by former President George H. W. Bush.

Under the original act, immigrant categories were divided into three groups: family-based immigrants, employment-based immigrants, and diversity immigrants. This structure allowed people to immigrate to the U.S. (S.358 — 101st Congress).

Employment-based immigrants, listed under Title 1: Immigrants, Subtitle B: Preference System, Part 2: Employment-Based Immigrants, are primarily skilled workers with “extraordinary ability” in research or academic roles and are limited to a maximum stay of six years. The H-1B Specialty Occupations visa serves as a step toward obtaining an Employment-Based green card or offers a faster pathway for individuals to enter the U.S.

Since 1990, amendments have been made, including the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA), which temporarily increased the number of visas issued annually, and the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act of 2000, which extended the visa cap again.

Recent changes to the H-1B visa program, including a new payment requirement, could lead to a decline in research activity and a reduction in healthcare providers and access to medical treatment. According to a 2024 report by the American Medical Association, the U.S. already faces a significant physician shortage, leaving millions without proper healthcare access.

Immigration attorney Giselle M. Rodriguez said many people are already on high alert about these changes and are preparing backup options.

“While the full implementation of the new rules is still pending, we’ve already seen a shift in behavior from both employers and foreign nationals,” said Attorney Rodriguez. “There’s increased caution, especially among companies that rely heavily on H-1B talent. Some are delaying sponsorship decisions until there’s more clarity on costs and eligibility. There is really a sense of urgency and uncertainty. Many are actively exploring backup options or alternative visa categories.”

In President Trump’s new revision of the H-1B policy, all individuals petitioning for a non-immigrant visa program will be required to pay or be endorsed with a payment of $100,000 for entry into the United States. This proclamation came into effect on Sept. 21, 2025, and will remain in effect for 12 months after this date.

Attorney Rodriguez warns that the H-1B policy has broader implications for healthcare and the overall economy of the United States.

“The proposed changes could impact how U.S. employers approach hiring international talent,” said Attorney Rodriguez. “There’s a large pool of highly qualified people from around the world, especially in areas like engineering, healthcare, finance, and research, who contribute meaningfully to the U.S. workforce. In the long run, employers may need to be more selective and intentional about who they sponsor, which could limit opportunities for some while opening doors for others.”

Boston University is one of the few universities that welcomes a diverse group of international students from around the world. According to the U.S. News & World Report, 21% of Boston University’s student body are international students.

For any future Boston University international graduates or any other international individuals, Attorney Rodriguez advises planning and taking advantage of programs and organizations that will allow individuals to stay in the U.S.

“Be proactive and strategic. Start planning as early as possible, ideally before graduation. Take full advantage of programs like OPT [Optional Practice Training] and STEM OPT extensions, and consider employment with cap-exempt institutions such as universities or research organizations,” said Attorney Rodirguez. “It’s also important to build a strong resume in your field and target employers with a history of successful H-1B sponsorship. There are resources you could find online to help with this. Keeping open communication with your school’s international office and consulting with an immigration attorney can also help keep you updated with all these changes.”

Due to the fast action of students, ICE’s location became somewhat common knowledge across campus, allowing individuals to take action to protect themselves.

This degree of protective community action left The Phoenix in awe of the resources gained by neighbors joining together to share information. Yet, while social media spreads knowledge quickly, it also has the potential to spread fear and misinformation.

As student journalists, we want to use our platform to create a consolidated location for verified ICE sightings to be shared within the community. Furthermore, we were disappointed by the lack of information given to students by the university after repeated ICE sightings. We have created a map of ICE sightings in Rogers Park and Edgewater which we have been able to verify. That information can be accessed here.

The Phoenix is vehemently against the unconstitutional use of ICE in our neighborhood, city and country. Immigrants make America great — from the Northern corners of Rogers Park, to the Southernmost parts of Edgewater and, broadly, to the greater Chicagoland area. We stand in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors, working people and at-risk community members.

We need the community’s help to keep our neighborhoods safe from ICE engagement.

This map can only be effective when we all join together to alert our friends and community of potentially dangerous and unpredictable ICE interactions. We implore you to join us in spreading information to keep our affected neighbors safe.

Our map will only include sightings in Rogers Park and Edgewater, but if you see ICE outside of the neighborhood and send the information to us, we will send it to other news sites who are tracking throughout Chicago.

As NBC Bay Area reports, federal agents with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement approached Gerardo, 42, in his driveway as he was leaving for work at 7:45 am Saturday, which was captured on the family’s Ring camera (included in the below video clip). The footage then shows Gerardo’s wife Idalia attempting to intervene and asking for a warrant. Neighbors also caught parts of the incident on video, which is also included in the below clip.

Idalia told NBC Bay Area there were seven or eight agents at the scene, at least three of whom weren’t wearing uniforms, and none of them identified themselves. She said an agent used a taser on Gerardo, and a woman who wasn’t in uniform hit her 22-year-old daughter with a baton, neither of which was caught on video.

Per NBC Bay Area, Idalia reported the arrest, along with her daughter’s injuries, to the Mexican Consulate in San Jose. She also contacted the Rapid Response Hotline.

As SFist reported earlier this week, Trump deployed federal agents to the Bay Area earlier this week before suddenly calling them off Wednesday evening, first in San Francisco and then Oakland.

Prior to Saturday’s incident, about 50 agents were spotted in San Jose on September 10 when at least one person was arrested, per NBC Bay Area. Additionally, at least 13 immigrants were taken into custody in San Francisco on August 28, with seven detained outside an apartment complex near 10th and Harrison streets, according to Milli Atkinson, director of the San Francisco Immigrant Legal Defense Collaborative, per NBC Bay Area.

Advocates recommend the public report ICE sightings immediately to the Rapid Response Hotline. Stay up to date on nearby ICE sightings and arrests with the ICE Activity Tracker, and the Immigration Defense Project has a wealth of resources and information on knowing your rights and how to deal with ICE.

Hamdi is the latest of numerous immigrants who have been arrested and deported by ICE over pro-Palestinian views.","British journalist Sami Hamdi was reportedly detained on Sunday morning by federal immigration authorities at San Francisco international airport, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) says that action is apparent retaliation for the Muslim political commentator’s criticism of Israel while touring the US.

A statement from Cair said it was “a blatant affront to free speech” to detain Hamdi for criticizing Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza while he engaged on a speaking tour in the US. A Trump administration official added in a separate statement that Hamdi is facing deportation.

“Our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice,” Cair’s statement said. The statement also called on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “to immediately account for and release Mr Hamdi”, saying his only “‘crime’ is criticizing a foreign government” that Cair accused of having “committed genocide”.

The press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, wrote of Hamdi in a social media post: “This individual’s visa was revoked, and he is in ICE custody pending removal”.

McLaughlin’s post also said: “Those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”

During his tour, Hamdi spoke on Saturday at the annual gala for Cair’s chapter in Sacramento. He was expected to speak on Sunday at the gala for the Florida chapter of Cair.

McLaughlin’s post about Hamdi’s detention was shared by Trump administration ally Laura Loomer, who took credit for his being taken into custody.

Loomer, who has called herself a “white advocate” and a “proud Islamophobe”, has often peddled conspiracy theories such as endorsing claims that the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 were an “inside job”.

In 2018, she infamously chained herself to Twitter’s headquarters in New York City in protest of her account being banned. Billionaire businessman Elon Musk reinstated her account after he bought the social media platform in 2022.

“As a direct result of … my relentless pressure on the [state department] and Department of Homeland Security, US officials have now moved to take action against Hamdi’s visa status, and his continued presence in this country,” Loomer posted on social media.

Hamdi is the latest of numerous immigrants who have been arrested and deported by ICE over pro-Palestinian views. Earlier in October, journalist Mario Guevara was deported to El Salvador after having been detailed while live streaming the massive, anti-Trump No Kings protest in June.

On 30 September, a federal judge appointed during Ronald Reagan’s presidency ruled the administration’s policy to detain and deport foreign scholars over pro-Palestinian views violates the US constitution and was designed to “intentionally” chill free speech rights.

The ruling is bound to be appealed, possibly all the way to the US supreme court, which is dominated by a conservative supermajority made possible by three Trump appointments. The state department, meanwhile, has said it will continue revoking visas under the policy.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d72d87d05aed116a4039a4bff37bee809846a37/667_532_3436_2748/master/3436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d1f9723d879aefc060f6aa3eb0d15af",N,,2025-10-26 18:17:31.804398

” Why was Hamdi detained?","British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi was detained by ICE at San Francisco International Airport after his visa was revoked. Officials stated those supporting terrorism and undermining national security are barred from the US. Hamdi, editor of The International Interest, was reportedly detained due to his criticism of the Israeli government.

A British Muslim journalist and political commentator, Sami Hamdi, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning, officials said. His visa was revoked, and he remains in ICE custody, according to Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin wrote on X. She also praised Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for Hamdi’s removal, calling it “It’s common sense.” Hamdi is a journalist and political commentator, serving as the Editor-in-Chief of The International Interest, a magazine that covers Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and UK politics. He has also contributed articles to Al Jazeera in 2022. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned the detention, calling it an “injustice.” “Earlier this morning, ICE agents abducted British Muslim journalist and political commentator Sami Hamdi at San Francisco Airport, apparently in response to his vocal criticism of the Israeli government during his ongoing speaking tour,” CAIR said. “We can confirm that Mr. Hamdi has not been deported and remains in custody. Our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice.” CAIR further condemned the arrest as an attack on free speech, according to Kron4 News. “Everyone should recognise that arresting a British citizen legally visiting the United States because he dared to criticise a foreign nation’s genocide is our government’s latest blatant affront to free speech,” the organisation said. “Our nation must stop abducting critics of the Israeli government at the behest of unhinged Israel-first bigots; this is an Israel-first policy, not an America-first policy, and it must end. ”

Why was Hamdi detained?

According to RAIR Foundation USA, Hamdi has repeatedly praised attacks carried out by Hamas, including the October 7, 2023 massacre in which over 1,200 civilians were killed. He described the hostage-taking and killings as “victorious” and “merciful,” and publicly glorified the operation, reposting videos of victims. DHS officials said that such actions qualify as espousing terrorist activity and demonstrated a clear alignment with a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. Beyond his public statements, Hamdi has participated in international training programs linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, a network identified by US authorities as cultivating operatives for political and ideological influence abroad. While in the United States, he reportedly instructed audiences to destabilise support for US allies, target officials, and weaponise elections. ICE cited these activities as evidence that Hamdi was using US soil to further extremist agendas, radicalise audiences, and operate as an embedded actor for a foreign network hostile to American interests.

It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.
These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy.
Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.” And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities.
As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement has inked a new $5.7 million contract for AI-driven social media surveillance software, according to federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.

The five-year contract with government technology middleman Carahsoft Technology, made public in September, provides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) licenses for a product called Zignal Labs, a social media monitoring platform used by the Israeli military and the Pentagon.

An informational pamphlet marked confidential but publicly available online advertises that Zignal Labs “leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning” to analyze over eight billion social media posts per day, providing “curated detection feeds” for its clients. The information, the company says, allows law enforcement to “detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.”

The Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, has in the past procured Zignal licenses for the US Secret Service, signing its first contract for the software in 2019. The company also has contracts with the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation.

But the September notice appears to be the first indication that ICE has access to the platform. The licenses will be provided to Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s intelligence unit, to provide “real-time data analysis for criminal investigations,” per the disclosure.

Zignal joins ICE’s growing arsenal of social media surveillance tools, many of which employ artificial intelligence to generate leads and identify “threats” from vast quantities of online data. These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy.

Several pro-Palestinian activists, including Mahmoud Khalil, were targeted and jailed by immigration authorities after being doxed online by right-wing, pro-Israel blacklist websites like Canary Mission. Just this week, immigration agents raided street vendors in New York City after a right-wing influencer posted a video of the block online, demanding action by authorities.

Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.”

And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities. As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.

Advocates told The Lever that ICE’s purchase of Zignal Labs licenses, like its other uses of digital surveillance tech, raises civil liberty concerns.

“[The Department of Homeland Security] should not be buying surveillance tools that scrape our social media posts off the internet and then use AI to scrutinize our online speech,” said Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “And agencies certainly shouldn’t be deploying this kind of black box technology in secret without any accountability.”

“Tactical Intelligence” to Israel and the Pentagon

Zignal Labs, founded in Silicon Valley in 2011, initially catered to public relations firms and political campaigns, advertising data analytics and media monitoring to help identify and respond to narrative trends online.

But like the many private companies that now provide digital surveillance tools to the federal government, Zignal Labs soon moved into the defense and intelligence industries, formally announcing the new focus, along with a “public sector advisory board” staffed by industry veterans, in 2021. One Zignal pamphlet from this year advertises the company’s work with the Israeli military, saying its data analytics platform provides “tactical intelligence” to “operators on the ground” in Gaza. The pamphlet also highlights Zignal’s work with the US Marines and the State Department.

Zignal Labs did not return a request for comment about its work with Israeli forces or its new contract with ICE.

The unions’ lawsuit over the Trump administration’s use of social media surveillance details the myriad digital surveillance tools that ICE already has at its disposal, including ShadowDragon, a software that uses publicly available websites to map out an individual’s online activity, and Babel X, which links social media profiles and location information to a target’s Social Security number.

“We’ve been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE’s surveillance regime.

This week, ICE signed a $7 million contract with the firm SOS International LLC, for “skip tracing services,” a term that refers to tracking a person’s whereabouts, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. The multimillion-dollar contract comes just three months after SOS International LLC, which also does business as SOSi, announced that the company had hired Andre Watson, an ICE Homeland Security Investigations intelligence chief, to “expand [the company’s] business and deliver capabilities to state and federal law enforcement agencies.”

Many of these services tout that their surveillance capabilities are enhanced by artificial intelligence, including Zignal. In a July post announcing the latter company’s partnership with Carahsoft Technology, Zignal’s CEO boasted that the latest iteration of the software used AI to scour global digital data, “helping defense and intelligence teams detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.” Two months after this announcement, ICE signed its new contract with Carahsoft for Zignal licenses.

ICE’s use of AI to surveil vast swathes of the internet in real time presents serious privacy and free speech concerns, the labor unions argued in their lawsuit against the Trump administration.

“The government’s utilization of AI and automated tools for viewpoint-driven online surveillance gives teeth to its threat to surveil ‘everyone’ online for disfavored expression,” attorneys with the civil liberties group the Electronic Freedom Foundation and Yale Law School’s Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic wrote in the complaint, saying that such tools “exacerbate the chilling impact of that surveillance.”",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24115300/ice-phone.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 20:56:50.929906

The fatal incident occurred on the busy eastbound Interstate 264 near the Military Highway interchange in Norfolk, southeastern Virginia. The Virginia State Police stated they were not involved in the chase, and the deadly accident remains under investigation.

This is the third known deadly incident involving migrants attempting to escape armed, masked federal officers—part of the Trump administration’s relentless crackdown on immigrants and the unprecedented nationwide expansion of ICE operations.

In August, 52-year-old Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez from Guatemala was killed on a highway after fleeing an ICE raid at a warehouse roughly 32 kilometers northeast of downtown Los Angeles, California. His death came just a month after another fatal ICE operation in Southern California.

In July, 56-year-old Jaime Alanis Garcia, a Mexican farmworker, fell nine meters from a greenhouse roof while fleeing federal agents in Ventura, California. Alanis Garcia, who had lived and worked in the U.S. for nearly 30 years to support his family in Mexico, suffered catastrophic injuries and was removed from life support after two days. This incident occurred during a raid in which over 300 people were arrested.

Trump and his anti-immigration advisors repeatedly claimed that the unprecedented resources and authority given to ICE were aimed at removing so-called “illegal criminals” from U.S. streets.

However, official data show that migrants with no criminal record now constitute the largest group in U.S. immigration detention. The number of individuals without criminal records arrested and detained by ICE under Trump has surpassed the number of those accused of crimes.

According to recent NPR research, at least 20 people have died in ICE detention so far this year, making 2025 the deadliest year since 2004.",https://www.mizanonline.ir/files/en/news/2025/10/26/14322_752.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 19:57:00.493654

Police named Jose Castro-Rivera, 24, of Honduras, as the deceased individual.

Agents were conducting a vehicle stop as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation” when the man “resisted heavily and fled the scene onto a busy highway,” according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Castro-Rivera was then hit by a pickup truck on Interstate 254 at the Military Highway Interchange in Norfolk, according to Virginia State Police, who were not involved in the chase but are investigating the death.

A similar death occurred in August, when Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez of Guatemala died after running onto a highway in Monrovia, California, during a chase involving immigration agents.

As part of the Trump administration’s deportation push, masked agents in unmarked cars have been surged to cities around the country and have often used aggressive, raid-style tactics against crowds in public places like Home Depot parking lots. Last month, more than two-thirds of those in ICE detention had no prior criminal conviction.

In September, a 79-year-old U.S. citizen and car wash owner sued federal immigration officials, alleging masked officers shoved him to the ground, dogpiled on top of him, and held him without charges or medical attention for 12 hours during a raid on his business.

Earlier this month, a federal judge in Illinois temporarily barred agents from using rubber bullets, tear gas, and chemical munitions on protesters and journalists, following a lawsuit from press associations and faith leaders accusing Donald Trump’s administration of “a pattern of extreme brutality.”

At least 20 people have died in immigration detention this year, the deadliest in decades.

CHICAGO – More than 200 people participated in the 2025 Illinois Together Against Hate: Human Rights in Action Conference on Oct. 21 in Champaign, Illinois. The Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR), the Illinois Commission on Discrimination and Hate Crimes (CDHC), and the City of Champaign’s Equity & Engagement Department collaborated efforts to amplify conversations and strengthen partnerships to combat hate.

The event served as a powerful, in-person gathering for community members, civil rights advocates, and human rights professionals to share actionable tools, innovative strategies, and impactful connections that drive lasting change.

The keynote address was delivered by Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idriss, a leading scholar and author on extremism and radicalization, and founder of the Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University.

Attendees participated in sessions and workshops covering topics ranging from understanding discrimination protections in Illinois to emerging, evidence-based strategies for preventing hate and extremism.

Acts of hate are defined as those that target people based on their actual or perceived race, creed, color, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, citizenship, immigration status, or national origin. Hate incidents are categorized into hate crimes, bias-motivated civil rights violations, and hateful, but legal expressions.

Officials urgently call on all residents to report acts of hate through the Help Stop Hate initiative—a safe, confidential service that provides support and resources. Almost one year since the program’s launch in October 2024, it serves as a vital lifeline for survivors, offering immediate relief through anonymous reporting, trauma-informed care, and connections to services—such as legal aid—to fill gaps where traditional systems fall short.

“The spread of hate and human rights violations is inextricably bound to the erosion of our democracy,” said IDHR Director Jim Bennett. “We are seeing acts of hatred and violence compound. By convening these important conversations, we are taking practical steps to make all Illinoisans safer. We will lead by example, showing America and the world that there is another way forward—one that honors our shared humanity and rejects the politics of fear and division.”

“At a time when presidential rhetoric emboldens extremists and targets vulnerable communities, we are encouraging Illinoisans to take action by reporting all acts of hate,” said CDHC Executive Director Elana Kahn, “This conference represents a critical step forward in amplifying conversations and partnerships. By working together, residents alongside local and state leaders can move the needle on hate and take practical steps to protect our democracy.”

Help Stop Hate is a statewide priority that supports targeted individuals while informing new policies for confronting hate. However, underreported acts of hate limit the ability to prevent and respond to hate effectively. Progress hinges on support from every Illinoisan.

“Illinois is at the forefront of state efforts to counter and prevent hate and the violence that comes from it,” said Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idress. “This event comes at exactly the right time and gives me hope that the urgency and commitment Illinois brings to this issue will shine a light for the rest of the country.”

Help Stop Hate allows Illinoisans to report acts of hate safely and anonymously, with no affiliation to law enforcement or immigration authorities. Personal information will only be shared with law enforcement if legally required and will never be shared with immigration agencies.

Illinoisans can report online to Help Stop Hate anytime in seven languages: English, Spanish, Polish, Mandarin, Tagalog, Arabic or Hindi. The phone line is open between noon and 9 p.m. CT, Monday to Friday, to English and Spanish speakers. Additional translation services are arranged as needed.

Over the last several months, Nicholas Pierce’s work as an asylum, refugee and deportation defense lawyer on the Front Range has meant playing catch-up. The immigration policies and orders that seem to come on a near-daily basis from the federal government have been hard to keep up with.

In a recent interview, Pierce tried to make sense of the latest effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which activists said was called “Freaky Friday,” offering unaccompanied immigrant children cash to self deport, and potentially depriving them of the right to hearings. A local human services agency had reached out to him earlier in the day asking how it would impact the young immigrants in their care.

He couldn’t answer. Instead he had to turn to others, including a contact at ICE, to figure it out.

“It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” Pierce said about the impact the president’s immigration crackdown has had on Colorado. “I was an immigration lawyer during the first Trump administration, and there was just a lot more checks and balances in the system.”

With about 400 cases on his plate through his Denver-based firm Amistad Law, Pierce said he’s seen firsthand how families and communities are being torn apart. He said many have had their legal statuses stripped away, through things like ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans — many of whom sought refuge in Colorado. Others, he said, have chosen to go into hiding for fear of being detained when appearing for their asylum interviews.

Pierce, who is a former U.S. Army Reserve service member and whose work receives state funding through the Colorado Refugee Support Program, is one of hundreds of Coloradans polled by CPR News and other outlets in the Colorado News Collaborative who have expressed either complete opposition to or frustration with some of the ways Trump has carried out his campaign promise to close the southern border and reduce the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country.

A small number we heard from say they support the president’s actions, calling them necessary to free up government resources for things like housing and Medicaid for citizens or protect the country from socialism.

Since the beginning of the year, the Trump administration has increased immigration raids across U.S. cities, including in Colorado, escalated tactics like sending the National Guard to back up ICE in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and reversed Biden-era policies, including allowing arrests at schools and churches.

What Coloradans are saying about immigration

In the survey circulated by Colorado newsrooms, including CPR News, a majority of the nearly 400 respondents said that, even if they supported some of the president’s stated goals, they opposed some of the immigration enforcement tactics currently being used by federal agents.

Specifically, Coloradans take issue with federal agents violating due process and not focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst” criminals.

“I have no problem with deporting those convicted of felonies, but ambushing families is despicable,” said a woman in Grand Junction.

“I am in favor of the overall goal, but I do take issue with some of the practices,” said a man from Broomfield. “Treat people as human beings, even if they are criminals.”

A man in Durango summarized it like a report card. He gave efforts to close the border an A+, deporting criminals a C-, visa restrictions a D-, the use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement an F and described the use of the National guard as illegal. He said Trump also failed in the area of “Politicalization.”

“Deport criminals not workers,” said a woman in Durango. ICE tactics like “unmarked cars, civilian clothes, refusal to identify themselves should be eliminated.”

“It’s a waste of time to deport people contributing to the economy,” said a man in Colorado Springs. “I’m more concerned with the affordability of housing and health care.”

“The response has been too extreme and brutal,” said a woman in Colorado Springs. “It targets too many law-abiding, legal, U.S. residents,: denying due process to detainees.”

Evergreen resident Norman Sherbert said he believed the president was carrying out what he promised to do when elected and correct the previous administration’s actions.

“I’m not here to tell the government how to do their job,” Sherbert elaborated via email. “All I know is that 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants coming into our country, seeing pictures of the masses of people standing at our borders, and hearing of children without guardianship being used to gain entrance into the U.S. is not good policy. And, in the long run over the next generations, will have a deteriorating effect on our society and way of life.”

Sherbert sees the administration’s extreme measures as a necessary way to right the situation with the limited time and resources it has.

At a flea market in Colorado Springs on a recent weekend, JoAnn Antaya said she believed Trump wanted to help people during his first administration but doesn’t agree with the tactics being used today.

A German-born American who remembered how difficult it was to adjust to a new culture as a child, Antaya believes society has lost its compassion.

“We do not care about our fellow man,” Antaya, 63, said. “So it’s easy to put a wall between here and Mexico because you know what? They have nothing to do with you. Heaven forbid if you should hand them a crust of bread. No, I’m not happy with my country.

“It’s like they’re not compromising. They’re not coming to a happy medium. They’re just combative. And that’s all it is: Argument, argument, argument.”

What the polls say about immigration concerns

Opinion polling suggests how Coloradans feel about immigration has a lot to do with where they live.

A poll from the Colorado Health Foundation released earlier this year looked at top issues facing Coloradans. It surveyed over 2,300 people across the state.

It found that “illegal immigration” was a major concern for about half of the residents surveyed, though the extent of the concern depended on where respondents lived, lower in urban areas (39 percent), versus suburban (58 percent) and rural (65 percent).

Ninety percent of respondents on the Eastern Plains believe illegal immigration is a problem in Colorado compared to 46 percent in Denver metro.

On the flip side, 20 percent of all respondents said the mistreatment of immigrants was an “extremely serious” concern compared to 42 percent of respondents saying it was “not too serious.”

Broken down by region, that concern fluctuated, with 44 percent of urban respondents saying mistreatment is extremely or very serious compared to 30 percent of suburban respondents and 23 percent of rural respondents.

“The regional, the urbanity and the partisanship seemed to really be driving how folks react to those problems and react differently to the two different framings that we tested,” said Lucia Del Puppo, senior vice president with the research firm that conducted the Pulse Poll.

CHF spokesperson Katie Peshek says Pulse Poll findings are shared with policymakers to help them understand the real issues residents are facing and prioritize those concerns.

“With a third of poll respondents pointing to government and politics as the state’s leading challenge, it’s clear that on issues like immigration, the cost of living and housing, Coloradans are ready for real action and solutions,” Peshek said.

Meanwhile, a national Gallup poll released this summer found that only 30 percent of Americans say immigration should be reduced, a position that has shrunk by fifteen points since last year.

But the support for stanching immigration largely falls along party lines, with the poll finding “Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration.”

In a recent national poll of registered voters by the New York Times/Sienna, “51 percent said they thought the government was deporting mostly people who ‘should be deported,’ while 42 percent said the government was deporting the wrong people.”

That poll, too, found respondents wrestling with the administration’s aggressive tactics.

“More than half of voters, 53 percent, think the process of deporting people has not been fair; 44 percent said it was mostly fair,” according to The New York Times.

How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions

Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has used his office’s powers to fight against federal immigration actions, from defending in-state tuition for noncitizen students to suing a sheriff’s deputy for involving ICE in a traffic stop that resulted in the detainment of a college student.

In the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill designed to protect undocumented immigrants from coming to the attention of federal authorities. And over the summer, Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress toured the state’s only immigration facility in Aurora, only to leave with more questions than answers.

Colorado governments are in danger of losing federal funds and the state is being sued by the federal government for so-called sanctuary policies, but Democratic leaders have so far resisted the administration’s pressure campaign, arguing immigration enforcement is not the state’s problem.

That doesn’t mean inter-agency coordination isn’t happening. Despite state laws strictly limiting when officials can cooperate with ICE requests, state agencies were found to have provided federal immigration officials with Coloradans’ personal information in response to subpoenas several times this year. Those actions by the Polis administration have riled fellow Democrats and immigration advocates.

Looking ahead

Even though state laws prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal agents, targeted immigration raids continue to take place across the state, including outside of metro regions. In the last couple of weeks, local news outlets have reported on an incident in Alamosa where ICE detained a family with a baby inside a vehicle at gunpoint, smashing a car window, and a situation in Routt County where a county commissioner was blocked by ICE vehicles.

For Pierce, it’s not just new policies that have made it difficult for him — or other lawyers — to do this job. He’s seen announcements of immigration court judges resigning or being fired, resulting in longer processing times for cases. Clients are also being transferred to detention facilities out of state, making it hard to connect with their legal counsel and putting them at risk of being deported within days.

“So when it comes to hurting people, the system’s gotten a lot faster. When it’s come to helping people, the system’s gotten a lot slower,” he said.

The majority of Pierce’s cases involve Afghan men who fought alongside the U.S. military during the Afghanistan War and are now waiting to get legal residency. Most of them filed petitions in 2022 or 2023 but still don’t have a court date set. With the reimposition of the so-called Muslim ban by the Trump administration this summer, it has been difficult for them to be reunited with their families. Pierce says these policies betray a promise made by the U.S. government for fighting alongside its troops.

The situation is leaving the men with two options: risk likely death to join their families back home or wait in the U.S, in the hope that their families will eventually be allowed to join them.

It’s gotten so bad that Pierce has found himself for the first time ever advising people to seek asylum in Argentina or Chile. He’s even started to offer powers-of-attorney services so that family or friends with U.S. citizenship can take control of bank accounts and other assets if their loved ones are rapidly deported.

The meeting focused on evaluating how the city could support residents impacted by recent ICE activities and assessing the approaches taken by other cities. The presentation highlighted existing policies, regional contexts, and various options available for the City Council’s consideration.

Fullerton complies with the California Values Act, Senate Bill 54, which restricts local law enforcement’s involvement in federal immigration enforcement. The Fullerton Police Department does not engage in civil immigration enforcement and adheres to policies in accordance with state law. Additionally, the City offers public resources through its website, including Immigration Enforcement and Immigration Information pages, along with a Police Department resource page. These resources feature bilingual materials that connect residents with legal and community service providers.

In response to recent immigration enforcement activities in Southern California, various jurisdictions have been reviewing their policies to find ways to support residents while complying with state and federal laws. Common strategies among those cities included public education, community partnerships, and coordination with nonprofit organizations that provide legal and humanitarian assistance.

The City Council, during its meeting, voted 4-0-1 (with Dunlap absent) to direct staff to prepare and submit an amicus brief in coordination with other local jurisdictions regarding the case of Perdomo, et al. v. Noem, et al., pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. This case challenged the legality of “roving patrols” by federal immigration enforcement agencies, claiming that such practices could lead to detentions without reasonable suspicion. The City intended to participate in the amicus brief to support constitutional due process and fair enforcement practices consistent with established law.

On August 29, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a temporary restraining order, allowing the federal government to resume immigration enforcement operations at public locations such as bus stops, car washes, and home improvement stores while litigation continued.

Regionally, cities have focused on several key actions:

Public education and outreach,

Partnerships with nonprofits and legal aid organizations,

Funding programs for humanitarian or legal support, and

Policy resolutions reaffirming local values and compliance with state law.

Based on these regional examples, Fullerton considered several options for moving forward. One option was to continue existing outreach and education efforts through the City’s website and the Police Department. Another option involved partnering with nonprofits or legal aid organizations to provide localized support. Furthermore, the City could explore developing funding or policy initiatives based on successful models from neighboring jurisdictions.

City staff sought direction from the council on whether to maintain current practices or pursue new initiatives. Should the city council choose to continue with informational outreach, minimal costs could be absorbed within existing departmental budgets. However, any new programs, such as legal aid partnerships or additional funding assistance, could require the use of city discretionary funds, including local discretionary or general funds. This might involve reallocating funds from the general fund contingency or special event accounts, a step taken by other cities in similar situations. It is important to note that federal and other restricted funds, such as Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and HOME funds, cannot be utilized for these purposes.

At the public comments for this item 30 people spoke in favor of helping immigrant families who have endured trauma from the ICE raides. One person spoke against helping the immigrant community. And there was one AI phone call that was also against helping.

After the city council members deliberated, the item passed with a vote of 3 to 2 (Jung and Dunlap voted NO). This item will be discussed at a future city council meeting.

Public Comments

Patty Tudor: I’m a planning commissioner, but I am speaking as a resident today. Like many of you, I am deeply concerned about the people affected by the recent actions taken by ICE. I want to help those who are struggling and provide mutual aid in any way I can. However, I have found it challenging to connect with a group that can guide me on the right support to offer. I imagine many of you in this room share that same difficulty.

I believe it would be beneficial for Fullerton to take the lead on organizing efforts like this, as it would make it easier for all of us to provide assistance to the residents in our city who need help. Therefore, I urge you to create a space for those of us who want to help so that we can effectively support our community. Thank you.

Laura Cook: I want to speak from the heart about my experience living in Fullerton. You will likely hear many stories about the trauma caused by ICE raids, and I’ve shared my thoughts on that in a previous meeting as well. However, my experience in Fullerton has been that it’s a town filled with neighbors who care for one another.

During the formula shortage in the pandemic, complete strangers from my Buy Nothing group were texting each other to help find formula for babies and dropping it off on porches. This summer, when the ICE raids created a similar atmosphere of fear and uncertainty for many families, people came together to support one another. Neighbors, friends, and even strangers bought groceries and delivered them to those in need, and they dropped off toys for kids who were stuck at home and bored during the summer.

My experience in Fullerton is that it’s fundamentally a community of neighbors who believe in helping each other. On a personal note, my brother served in the military for 13 years and died in a war zone. As a Gold Star sibling, I know that the America he fought for is one where we help our neighbors and offer asylum to those in need. I believe he would echo these sentiments tonight, and I know that many people in Fullerton would agree.

We want to take care of our neighbors, and it’s important to do that. Financially, I believe we can make strong moral and ethical choices with our budget. If you sat down with most Fullerton residents, I am confident they would say that helping each other is the right thing to do.

Malika Contado: I have lived in Fullerton for 35 years since immigrating with my family to the United States from the Philippines when I was three years old. I am here today because I love Fullerton and am proud to call it my home. However, for many of our immigrant neighbors, including myself, home may not feel safe or secure. Immigrants make up almost 30% of our city’s population—28.7% to be precise. I’m rounding that up to illustrate my point.

This evening, I am asking you to commit to building a Fullerton where everyone belongs. I appreciate the presentation given today and believe we can do more to ensure that immigrants feel safe, supported, and empowered to thrive in the community they already love.

Across Orange County, our neighbors are demonstrating what is possible. For instance, Santa Ana funds universal immigration legal defense so that no resident faces deportation alone. Anaheim has created “Welcoming Anaheim,” joining a national network that measures inclusion and allocates real funds to address immigrant needs. We should follow their lead. Costa Mesa has publicly confirmed that its police do not participate in immigration enforcement, which helps build trust between residents and officers. These are not partisan gestures; they are practical strategies for community safety that strengthen our neighborhoods and families.

My nieces are here; they are second-generation Pacific Drive Dolphins. I want them to feel safe and to experience childhood without fear of what might happen around their school. Fullerton can take similar steps by launching a “Belonging First Fullerton” initiative. As a resident, I can dream alongside you.

We could create a small immigrant legal defense fund, possibly sourced from the $6.3 million discretionary fund in our general budget. This fund could be modeled after Santa Ana’s established microgrants—around $200,000—to help families stay housed during immigration crises, thus lessening the trauma these events cause.

I also propose adopting a welcoming resolution affirming that everyone, regardless of origin or immigration status, should feel welcome in our city and that they belong here. When people feel safe in their neighborhoods, when they feel safe calling 911, sending their kids to school, or opening businesses, our entire city benefits.

Belonging is not just a feeling; it’s a practice that we can build together. I will hold our council members accountable to this vision.

Vanessa Estrella: I am a proud trustee for the Fullerton School District, a mother, a small business owner, and a resident of District 5 in Fullerton. In my role, I see how family well-being and student success are intertwined. When a parent faces detention, deportation, or eviction, that pain doesn’t stay at home; it follows children into the classroom.

Just this past August, a Fullerton family with three young children—two of whom attend our local schools—found themselves at risk of deportation after escaping violence in their home country. They are currently here under asylum, yet their future remains uncertain. Local partners have stepped up to raise legal funds and provide temporary housing to keep the family safe and together.

These stories make it clear that good intentions and volunteer efforts aren’t enough; families need structural support. That’s why I am here, asking this council to set aside funding to support immigrant families through legal aid, family assistance, and fair housing protections. Other cities, such as Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, and Anaheim, have already shown what is possible here in Fullerton. We can do the same by directing resources to trusted community partners who already serve our families.

If the city isn’t ready to build new programs from scratch, it can strengthen existing ones by funding local organizations that are already doing this important work, like Amino Immigration Services, which provides legal defense, deportation support, and family assistance. These institutions exist here in Fullerton, and they deserve our investment.

According to Data USA, nearly 30% of Fullerton residents were born outside of the United States, and almost half of our students come from immigrant households. Immigrant families power our schools, our businesses, and our community life, and their economic contributions are undeniable. The California Immigrant Data Portal reports that immigrant households across California contribute over $51 billion in state and local taxes, $81 billion in federal taxes, and hold more than $354 billion in spending power.

When we invest in the safety and stability of immigrant families, we invest in Fullerton’s economy and in our city’s future. So tonight, I urge you to take compassionate and practical action to ensure that every family, regardless of status, feels safe in our community. A strong city, like a strong school district, is built on belonging, and belonging means knowing your community is there for you.

Jennifer Garcia: I am a resident and pastor at Sojourners Church in Fullerton. I wanted to bring to your attention that either last weekend or this weekend would typically be the time for Saint Mary’s Carnival and Festival, which has been held at Ambridge Park every year for as long as I can remember. However, this year, they decided not to hold the event due to concerns from many of their neighbors about attending.

It’s disheartening to see something that has been a cherished gift to our community being lost because of fear. They made this difficult decision to forgo the festival to protect their most vulnerable community members—those living in heightened fear. This situation underscores the severity of the current crisis.

I serve on our county’s Continuum of Care board, and something interesting happened about a month ago. City managers from the North Service Planning Area (NOCSPA), which includes the 11 cities in North Orange County, attended our Continuum of Care board meeting to request funding. I found myself at the opposite end of the diocese, reviewing their funding requests.

Jason Phillips: I’m a resident and a pastor at Sojourners Church in Fullerton.

However, this year, they decided not to hold the event. This decision was made because many of their neighbors were afraid to attend.

It’s disheartening to see something that has been a gift to our entire community being lost due to fear. They made this difficult decision to forgo the festival for the sake of their most vulnerable community members—those living with the greatest fear. This situation emphasizes how deep the current crisis is.

Darlene Ruiz: I am an eighth grader at Ladera Vista Junior High School of the Arts. Immigration services have devastated many Hispanic families by causing fear, family separation, and barriers to jobs, housing, and healthcare. Children often experience trauma when their parents are detained, and many avoid seeking help due to their legal status.

Fortunately, there are many resources available, such as Races United, We Dream, Catholic Charities, and the National Immigration Law Center. In the Pledge of Allegiance, it says “justice for all,” but where is the justice in this country?

What has helped my family and me the most is solidarity. Solidarity has significantly impacted our community since 2012. We appreciate all the staff members who have been and continue to be a part of this effort. They have not only offered help but have also changed many lives.

So, we come here to ask for your support in creating an immigration aid fund.

Stacey: I also attend Ladera Vista Junior High School. The involvement of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has profoundly affected my family and me, shaping our lives with fear, uncertainty, and disruption. The constant threat of deportation has led to ongoing psychological trauma for us. This situation has limited our ability to fully participate in opportunities at work, school, and within our community.

These pressures have created financial and social instability, undermining our sense of security and belonging on a personal level. The emotional toll has been immeasurable, as the fear of family separation weighs heavily on our daily lives.

From a broader perspective, our experience reflects the systemic impact of immigration enforcement policies that disproportionately burden families. These policies leave lasting consequences on mental health, economic stability, and overall well-being.

Therefore, we ask for your assistance in creating an immigration aid fund here in the city of Fullerton.

Julia Aviles: I’ve lived in Fullerton since I was about four years old, and I’m now 17 and a senior at Fullerton Union High School. Although I haven’t been directly affected, the situation impacts my elders and my community, including my family. I can’t help but feel empathy for them as I watch them live in a constant state of paranoia and suffer financially.

Southern California has a significant immigrant population, which plays a crucial role in economic activity. Immigrant-run businesses create a home-like environment and foster a sense of security. Without these businesses, there are neither consumers nor producers, which disrupts the community. With many of these businesses closing down and ICE enforcement being an ongoing threat, many immigrants are forced to either stay home or risk deportation if they venture out.

I had to stay indoors for a couple of months without the ability to work and earn money, while some of my family members had to sell personal belongings to get by. I know they endured great hardship during this difficult time, both emotionally and financially.

Additionally, most of my family members are immigrants, and I can see how uncomfortable they feel going out, even to places like the corner store. This issue affects me personally as I witness their struggles and anxiety. It would mean a lot to me and my loved ones if you could support the creation of immigration aid funds.

Julia Crosby: I am a freshman at Fullerton Union High School, raised in Fullerton my whole life. My family, like many others, suffers from the impact of ICE enforcement in our community. Events are being canceled, and the fear of ICE is making it hard for people to enjoy time outdoors with their families.

For instance, my grandma can only go outside at night because she feels unsafe during the day. She no longer shops in person and must order everything online, which limits her freedom and joy.

We urge the mayor and the council to support initiatives that help immigrant families feel safe and included in our community. Fullerton is our home, and everyone deserves to live without fear. To thrive, we must ensure that our community is safe and welcoming for all.

Alejandro Delgado: I was born in Pomona but moved to Fullerton, where I have lived my whole life. I’m here because our community is only whole when every neighbor belongs, especially those who are most targeted and vulnerable. Right now, in Fullerton and across Orange County, many families are living in fear. Parents worry that a normal day could end in separation, and kids go to school wondering if their family will still be together when they get home. This fear spreads, affecting our schools, neighborhoods, and the trust that keeps our community strong.

For many of us, home means more than just a place to live; it means safety, dignity, and stability. However, for too many families here, that sense of home feels uncertain. Other cities in Orange County have already taken action. In Santa Ana, a program called Frontera, which means “Hope without Borders,” offers legal defense and direct help for families. Costa Mesa set up a $200,000 legal aid fund to help families stay in their homes, and Anaheim added $250,000 to its immigrant aid fund to assist families with rent and utilities when a loved one is detained. These cities are demonstrating what compassion looks like in action, reminding us that when we invest in people, we build strong communities.

Fullerton has the chance to do the same. Instead of viewing our city’s budget as limited, we can see it as a tool for abundance—a way to express what we value most. Our budget is more than just numbers; it’s a reflection of our priorities. Let’s choose to invest in safety, stability, and dignity for every family. Let’s choose hope over fear and abundance over scarcity. Let’s work to make Fullerton a city where every person truly feels at home. As someone who will be voting in the next election, I hope you will make the right decision for our community.

Kate: I work for Solidity NPO, a nonprofit organization that offers an after-school program. I also serve as the Youth Director at One Life City Church. Recently, we heard from some of the teams that participate in our program. It’s important to note that these young people represent the next voters, contributors, leaders, and activists in our city. They are actively contributing, advocating, and sharing their voices as they live, work, and play in our communities. We urge you to listen to their voices and the voices of others present today, particularly in support of the creation of the Immigration Aid Fund.

In recent months, our community has faced trauma as we witnessed our loved ones living in fear, being homebound, and targeted by those in charge who are supposed to serve the public good. Many of us have sought ways to help and have turned to one another for support through organizations and grassroots relationships that embody belonging, safety, and love.

Today, we believe that you, as the City of Fullerton and as the City Council, have an invaluable role in making our city safe, stable, and accountable to the residents who live here—just as we are accountable to you.

In recent conversations with the youth about what has happened in the past months, I’ve heard stories of heartbreak and limited ways of living. People who came here seeking better lives have faced violent incidents. One student shared that their friend’s church was raided by ICE, and their grandmother was taken. They expressed, “I liked that grandma too.” Another student mentioned that their family used to go out more, taking their kids places like the beach during the summer. However, due to these raids, they have had to remain indoors.

In a world filled with distrust and targeting, we must consider, what are we teaching our kids? Fullerton has an opportunity to address these gaps and show support in tangible ways. Hardworking families have found themselves unemployed and lacking resources, often leaving their young adults or teens to bear responsibilities that they should never have had to shoulder. This is the reality we are facing.

We ask that Fullerton follows the example set by Costa Mesa, Santa Ana, and other cities that have taken action. We strongly urge the council to establish a legal aid fund—a direct aid fund—to support our immigrant brothers, sisters, and neighbors, and to help make Fullerton feel like home.

Bianca: I live in District 3 of Fullerton, and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton as well as a volunteer with the Orange County Rapid Response Network. I am the child of two Asian immigrants. When my parents came to this country, all they wanted was a home, and they found one here in Orange County. A home is a place of belonging—it’s where you rest, where you have the support of loved ones around you. My parents found that home.

However, today, many others are losing theirs. Families are being torn apart, and children are being separated from their parents. When ICE detains a person, they are not just taking someone away; they are disrupting a home and tearing apart the fabric of a family.

I witnessed an incident that illustrates this reality. I saw ICE officers pull their vans into a lot in front of a building. One officer turned to their partner and asked, “Do you think we have enough booster seats?” Just then, a mother came out of the building, holding two young children in her arms, both of whom couldn’t have been older than two. They entered the van in silence, and the officers drove away. This is the harsh reality of what ICE does.

Home is not just a physical structure; it is made up of people and love. Fullerton can be a home, but the individuals who contribute to that sense of community are being ripped away, pushed into a system that has never cared for them.

Council members, you have the power to make a difference. We urge you to support organizations that are doing vital work and need funding. Other cities, like Santa Ana, Anaheim, and Costa Mesa, have already established legal aid funds, providing over $200,000 to support their residents. We can do the same.

In addition, families left behind when a breadwinner is taken by ICE need support. Losing a primary income can leave a family in financial distress. Establishing a direct aid fund could mean the difference between a child having dinner the night their parent is taken and going without. We ask you to consider creating this fund.

Brandy Morales: I’m a lead organizer with the Orange County Congregations Community Organization, also known as OCCCO. We focus on developing grassroots leaders to create systemic change, aiming to build communities where everyone can live with dignity and thrive. More importantly, I am a single Latina mother and a lifelong resident of Fullerton, currently in District 4. Fullerton has always been my home because of the diverse immigrant community in which I grew up.

I’m here today to ask that you allocate funding to support immigrant families who have been impacted by the recent ICE raids that occurred a few months ago. During one of the healing circles we held here in Fullerton, a young girl approached me after a session and asked, “What if one of my parents, or both, get detained? What happens then?” Her question broke my heart and made me realize how unprepared we are as a community.

Our community needs more than just lawsuits or statements of support; they need security, stability, and, most importantly, a sense of unconditional belonging. At that moment, all I could do was hand her a few phone numbers, but I wondered if that was enough. I didn’t think so.

I began to ask myself: What if I were detained? Or if one of my loved ones were detained? Could I afford it? Who would take care of my children? I reflected on this because ICE is targeting anyone who fits their stereotype of what an immigrant looks like, and my loved ones and I fit that description.

Imagine if I could tell that young girl, “Our city sees you. Our city has a plan.” Imagine if she knew that Fullerton was investing in families like ours. Our city budget is a moral document; it should reflect our values and support the people who make this city strong and diverse.

So today, I am asking you to invest in our immigrant community and allocate funds for families impacted by ICE enforcement. Thank you, and I pray that you choose to acknowledge the pain and fear that has affected our immigrant communities.

Kathy Plate: I’m a homeowner in Fullerton, and my wife and I are raising two kids who are attending Rolling Hills and the Fullerton School District. I want to emphasize that our community is only whole when everyone feels welcome, safe, and that they belong, especially at the beginning of the school year.

While many families were preparing for back-to-school season, I became aware that some families in our city were unable to drop their kids off at school due to fear of detention. I know our school district is doing everything it can to serve our students and families, but there are larger issues that our schools alone can’t address. I believe it’s time for this council to step up and do more.

The impact we’ve seen from fears of separation, the effects on employment, and the stories shared tonight are significant—much more than what one part of our community can handle. I hope we can partner with the nonprofits here tonight to come up with solutions. As a parent, I strive to ensure our home is a sanctuary and a place of trust and safety—not just for my kids, but also for their friends, our neighbors, and the larger community.

One way we do this is by teaching our kids to make good choices. They’re still learning, as am I, that it’s important to share—whether it’s toys or snacks—and to invite others to play and not exclude anyone. We remind them of their school motto to be kind, safe, and responsible beyond our home.

Fullerton is our larger home, and everyone in our city deserves to feel like they belong and that they are cared for with dignity and safety. No one should feel that they need to stay confined to their house. The city budget should reflect these values.

Our neighboring cities in Orange County, such as Santa Ana, Anaheim, and Costa Mesa, have already stepped up, and I urge the council to do the same. I propose that we establish a legal aid fund so that every resident has access to due process and legal representation. We should also create a direct aid fund for families who may be struggling with rent, food, and essential needs, as well as protect tenants from unjust evictions.

Home should be a place of belonging for all of our immigrant neighbors. I hope the council can make wise choices, be kind, safe, and responsible, and recognize the importance of funding initiatives that ensure our city is a place where everyone can thrive.

Elliot Chung: I serve as one of the pastors at One Life City Church, and I am proud to be a resident of District 5. As a pastor, husband, and father, I speak on behalf of my congregation and my family to emphasize that Filipinos are part of a community where everyone belongs. When one of us is in fear or in need, the whole community feels it.

We are here out of compassion—as citizens, friends, and neighbors of this beautiful city. We have witnessed the impact that ICE raids have had on our immigrant neighbors: families who are part of our schools, our churches, our small businesses, and our friendships. In my Korean culture, there is a term that embodies this kind of love and kinship, which holds a community together. It’s called “jeom” (점) I have reflected on this word recently, as it signifies the deep connection among people—love expressed through presence, shared meals, and simply being there for one another.

This is a love that doesn’t require words to be genuine. I also see “jeom” (점) in my Christian faith when I hear Jesus say, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” This kind of love is not merely sentimental; it is practical. It nourishes, shelters, and protects. It reminds us that every person, including you, me, and every immigrant family in this city, is made in the image of God. Just as Esau recognized Jacob in their reconciled relationship, we need to see each other, for in seeing one another, we see the face of God.

Many cities have already addressed this current brokenness by allocating funds in their budgets. They have responded with love and compassion. Even my small church has managed to set aside funds to assist our neighbors in Maple and Richmond. By God’s grace, we have been able to support 17 families, distributing over $9,000. I mention this not to boast, but to demonstrate that while our little fund is a start, it is just a drop in the bucket compared to the overwhelming need.

Though we may have limited resources, including a building that has cockroaches and no grass, we chose to create a mutual aid fund because the times demand it. I believe Fullerton can do the same. Therefore, I urge this council to establish some form of legal aid fund, a direct assistance fund, or a rental registry to protect our neighbors, congregants, friends, and family.

Fullerton is our home, and it is where love and “jeom” (점) can be made visible. It is where we can truly embody what it means to love our neighbor as ourselves. I encourage you to lead with that kind of care and love, building a city where no one has to live in fear.

Debbie Langenbacher: Deborah Longenbach: Before I begin, I want to congratulate all the young people who have had the courage to come forward and share their stories. It takes a lot of bravery, and although you may not see it, the smiles on their faces and the pride they feel when they return to their seats is truly heartwarming. Thank you all for that.

My name is Deborah Longenbach, and I have been a resident of Fullerton for 25 years. I am also a member of the Unitarian Universalist congregation, and I am here to represent my fellow congregants. We, Unitarian Universalists, adhere to a set of principles that include the inherent worth and dignity of every person, justice, equity, and compassion in human relations. We are committed to building a diverse and multicultural beloved community that actively addresses issues such as racism and oppression, both within ourselves and within our institutions.

We are currently living in a time when racism and oppression are rampant in our city. ICE raids in Fullerton have primarily impacted the Latino community, leaving families fearful of leaving their homes in case they encounter ICE agents. Children are afraid to attend school, worried that their parents may not be there when they return home. None of us desire this situation—nobody in this room wants it.

Fullerton is our home, and we must work as a city to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone, to the extent that we can. Our small congregation is doing what we can, but we are few in number. We urge the city of Fullerton to take action and do its part.

Recently, Costa Mesa, a city with a smaller population than Fullerton, established a legal aid fund of $200,000 to assist immigrant families in their community. As you may have heard, Anaheim and Santa Ana have similar initiatives. These actions reflect a commitment to justice, equity, and compassion in those communities while addressing concerns related to racism and oppression.

How can Fullerton do the same? How can we ensure that Fullerton truly becomes a home for marginalized communities? How can we set an example for other communities in Orange County as a city that supports all its residents—everyone who calls Fullerton home?

Vixon in Spanish: Buenas noches, miembros del Consejo. Esta noche les hablaré en español porque es crucial dirigirnos a nuestras familias y residentes inmigrantes, especialmente a aquellos que hablan español y se han visto afectados por las redadas de ICE.

Hablar en su idioma es una muestra de respeto y garantiza que nuestras voces se escuchen con claridad y propósito. Me llamo Vixen y estoy aquí como orgullosa miembro de la comunidad de Fullerton, apoyando a las familias afectadas por las redadas de ICE. Me acompaña mi colega, Steven Acevedo, quien también hablará sobre la realidad de nuestra situación.

El 3 de octubre, Steven fue atropellado dos veces por un vehículo de inmigración. En lugar de investigar este uso de la fuerza y proteger los derechos de un miembro de la comunidad, la policía de Anaheim optó por ignorar la situación. En lugar de defender a nuestros residentes, optaron por proteger a una agencia federal con un largo historial de causar daños a las comunidades inmigrantes. Este no es un incidente aislado; forma parte de un patrón preocupante. Nuestra comunidad ha sido vigilada, discriminada y perjudicada no solo por ICE, sino también por la complicidad y el silencio de los sistemas locales que deberían protegernos.

Quiero dejar claro que todos los residentes de nuestra comunidad tienen el derecho legal de observar y registrar las acciones de ICE para garantizar nuestra seguridad y rendición de cuentas durante estas redadas. Este tipo de observación debe ser pacífica y está protegida por la ley.

Les instamos a tomar dos medidas importantes. En primer lugar, solicitamos que el Departamento de Policía de Fullerton aclare clara y públicamente su protocolo con respecto a ICE y cómo se relaciona con el derecho de los residentes a observar y registrar legalmente las acciones. En segundo lugar, solicitamos al Ayuntamiento que cree y apruebe un fondo para apoyar a las familias afectadas por redadas y deportaciones. Cuando se lleva a uno de los padres sin previo aviso, toda la familia, incluidos los niños y los ancianos, sufre.

Por último, quiero recordarles a los miembros del consejo que tienen el poder de actuar en este asunto. Por favor, decidan ayudar a nuestros residentes y proteger a nuestras familias. Gracias.

Vixon in English: Good evening, Council members. I will be speaking in Spanish tonight because it is crucial to address our immigrant families and residents—especially those who speak Spanish and have been affected by ICE raids.

Speaking in your language is a sign of respect, and it ensures that our voices are heard with clarity and purpose. My name is Vixen, and I am here as a proud member of the Fullerton community, standing in support of families impacted by the ICE raids. I am joined by my colleague, Steven Acevedo, who will also speak about the truth of our situation.

On October 3, Steven was struck twice by an immigration enforcement vehicle. Instead of investigating this use of force and protecting the rights of a community member, the Anaheim police chose to look the other way. Rather than defending our residents, they opted to protect a federal agency with a long history of causing harm to immigrant communities. This is not an isolated incident; it is part of a troubling pattern. Our community has been surveilled, profiled, and harmed not only by ICE but also by the complicity and silence of local systems that should be protecting us.

I want to make it clear that every resident in our community has the legal right to observe and record ICE actions to ensure our safety and accountability during these raids. This kind of observation should be peaceful and is protected by law.

We urge you to take two important actions. Firstly, we request that the Fullerton Police Department clearly and publicly clarify its protocol regarding ICE and how it relates to residents’ rights to observe and record actions legally. Secondly, we ask the City Council to create and approve a fund to support families impacted by raids and deportations. When one parent is taken away without prior notice, the entire family—including children and elders—suffers.

Lastly, I want to remind our council members that you have the power to act on this issue. Please choose to help our residents and protect our families. Thank you.

Bethany Anderson: I want to share something important that I personally witnessed. Just two weeks ago, I overheard a conversation between ICE officers in the office, where one officer asked another, “What’s up, killer? You out there disappearing people for us?” This exchange clearly highlights the troubling atmosphere surrounding immigration enforcement.

My name is Bethany Anderson, and I am the Executive Director of Solidarity and Communal Immigration Services, a nonprofit organization that has been serving the Fullerton community for over 20 years. As an expert and practitioner of immigration law, I can tell you that what we are witnessing in our community and across the country reflects the worst aspects of humanity. We see businesses under siege, and innocent individuals tackled to the ground based on their skin color and the language they speak. This includes U.S. citizens, as I personally observed during a raid at a car wash in Anaheim just last Thursday.

Furthermore, our legal immigration system is being dismantled, leading to a growing number of undocumented immigrants daily. This crisis affects many hardworking individuals in our city who are striving to obtain legal status. The vast majority have no criminal records and live in mixed-status families, including immediate family members who are U.S. citizens. We are officially in a crisis situation.

As someone who runs an immigration legal service organization, one of the few dedicated to helping the Fullerton community, I can assure you that the need for financial support for our residents is overwhelming. This support is essential for accessing legal services, covering rent, and providing direct aid. Just yesterday, I spoke with a local woman whose husband was kidnapped off the street last Thursday. As a result, she is now worried about how she will pay rent this month. Her husband has lived here for over 20 years, has no criminal record, and is the father of three U.S. citizen children. She is concerned about how she will feed her children and continue to support her child with special needs.

As a community, we are doing everything we can. We have raised funds for rent and groceries for our neighbors, accompanied individuals to court and check-ins, and provided emotional support for one another. However, our efforts alone are not enough. We need a larger, collective initiative to make a meaningful impact.

As I mentioned earlier, we are witnessing the worst of humanity right now, but this also presents an opportunity for us to show the best of humanity. I invite each of you to join us in our collective effort to care for our city, our home, and our community in a significant way. By creating this fund, as I said during my last visit, we are at a crucial point in our legacy as individuals and as a city. Let us come together and be on the right side of history. Thank you.

Danny: I am part of the OCR network, and we help monitor ICE operations legally, as my partner has mentioned before. I have been at Fullerton College for about four years, pursuing different degrees. I’m here because our community is only whole when every neighbor belongs, especially those who are most targeted and vulnerable. No one should ever have to fear going to school, grocery shopping, or simply walking outside. People are being taken off the streets without any judicial or deportation orders. This affects every family, not just undocumented immigrants. The separations caused by these actions, along with their ripple effects on housing, schools, and the community, should be thoroughly studied.

I want to emphasize that home means more than just shelter; it represents safety, dignity, and stability. Other cities, like Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, and Anaheim, have already taken action. Santa Ana has the Help Without Borders program, which provides both legal defense and direct family assistance. Costa Mesa has established a $200,000 legal aid fund and is exploring a rental registry to keep families housed, which I encourage our council to consider. Anaheim recently added $250,000 to its Immigrant Aid Fund to help families pay rent and utilities when their loved ones are detained.

I urge the council to establish legal aid funds for all residents to ensure they have access to due process and legal representation. We need to create a direct aid fund to support families left behind with rent, food, and essential needs. Additionally, exploring a rental registry could help keep tenants stable and prevent unjust evictions.

Earlier, we recited the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes an amendment stating that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment by a grand jury. No one should be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against themselves, nor should they be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. I want to emphasize the phrase “no person,” as it does not specify “citizen.”

Our budget should not be immoral and should not be merely sentimental; it must be strategic. It should prevent harm, support families, and build trust between residents and their government. We are human beings, and every individual deserves a place of belonging. Home is where we feel safe, where we flourish, and where we practice mutual care. Belonging means more than just accommodation. It consists of cherishing and valuing the contributions that every individual, family, and community brings to our city as a whole.

Steven Acevedo: Imagine being struck by a vehicle not once, but twice, by a federal agent, and having your cries for justice ignored by those sworn to protect you. This is not just an isolated incident; it is a glaring example of the systemic failures that continue to put our community at risk. I stand before you not only as someone who has been wronged, but also as a voice for all of us who have been failed by the very institutions meant to protect us. I am here to advocate for accountability, transparency, and justice.

My name is Steven Acevedo, and I was struck by a federal agent twice. On October 3rd, 2025, an ICE agent hit me with their vehicle. I never expected this to happen to me. I never imagined that someone in a position of authority would use their vehicle as a weapon. But that is exactly what transpired. And what did the police do? They turned a blind eye; they chose to protect the federal agent instead of seeking justice for me, the victim, a community member and an American citizen.

Instead of upholding the law and ensuring accountability, the police disregarded the very principles they are supposed to serve. The police should be here to protect citizens, to serve and defend us. Instead, they sided with ICE — an agency known for instilling fear and division rather than fostering safety and community trust. ICE agents are not here to protect our communities; they are here to terrorize. They enforce policies that not only instill fear but also tear families apart and create anxiety in our neighborhoods.

This is not the kind of protection we need in our city. What we need is accountability and transparency. The actions of the police and federal agents cannot go unchecked. We cannot permit a system in which the abuse of power is ignored, where the rights of American citizens are trampled, and where there is no accountability for actions that harm us all. It is up to us to demand better — to demand a police department that truly serves the community and a system in which federal agents are held accountable for their actions.

We will not stand idly by while our rights are ignored and violated, and while our safety is jeopardized. We must hold our leaders accountable, advocate for transparency, and ensure that justice is served. Together, we can make a difference. Together, we can ensure that those who are meant to protect us are held to the highest standards of accountability. This is our city, and we will stand for justice. Thank you.

Todd Harrison is speaking on behalf of his wife, Yolanda Harrison, who is suffering from laryngitis. She expressed her frustration by writing, “Laryngitis sucks.” Yolanda has been typing tirelessly for the last hour to share her thoughts.

As an immigrant, she wanted to attend the No Kings event, but chose to stay home because she has lost her voice. Her husband is concerned about her safety due to the potential implications for her immigration process. Yolanda expressed pride in everyone who stood up for the No Kings initiative, even though she understands the risks her words might pose.

She reflected on her grandfathers, who both lived through difficult times in 1949. They did not endure their suffering so that future generations would face similar challenges. Yolanda wants to see Fullerton support immigration and believes it is essential for the city to do so.

She would like to see a hard copy of all organizations that can assist immigrants, especially for those updating their status safely and in compliance with regulations. There have been incidents of immigrants being detained during their hearings, which terrifies her. Having printed resources is crucial because they can be distributed like the red cards given out during the first No Kings event. Relying solely on online information is inadequate when there is no Internet access.

Yolanda is not only fearful for her own safety, but also for her husband’s and anyone else who is an immigrant or appears to be one. She worries about what may happen once immigrants are no longer targeted—will they go after other marginalized groups next, like those identified by pink triangles or yellow stars?

She emphasizes the importance of remembering that today’s immigrants could be tomorrow’s voters. There is much more she wants to say.

Todd Harrison: Yes, I’m an American citizen. I was born in a hospital in Manhattan. Doctor Charles and I share something important: we each have two Jewish grandmothers. I had a wonderful mother, and before she passed away, she was a strong influence in my life. Additionally, I share something else with at least three-fifths of the City Council: either I, my parents, or my grandparents were immigrants at some point in our history. We can trace our roots back to various groups, whether it’s the Chinese immigrants who built the railroads through the Rockies or Ahmad and his relatives from Syria, and Doctor Charles with her long line of ancestors.

When I was 11 years old, after returning to New York from living in Europe, I was introduced to an elderly uncle of mine who had numbers tattooed on his forearm. Now, we see that Nazis are resurfacing, trying to divide our country by race and beliefs, and tearing our communities apart. I believe all residents and officials of Fullerton owe it to our shared heritage—not just for those around us today, but for our ancestors—to fight against this division. We must support each other in every possible way because it truly does not matter what makes someone stand out; anyone could become a target next.

Current events have shown us that there is no limit to the atrocities that prejudice can inflict. I even wrote to my wife so she could respond while we were sitting here together. I hate to say this, but I am concerned about your visibility in a public forum with your green card up for review. This is how they win—by silencing us.

I won’t go into the entire history, but we all know the saying: they came for others, and I did not speak up. Anyone who has been to school is probably familiar with that, and it remains true today. Therefore, regardless of the risks, we must all speak up and act in support of one another. Thank you.

Diane Kurtzman: I am a lifelong resident of North Orange County, having grown up over the hill in La Habra and spent the last 21 years in Fullerton. For the past 15 years, I’ve lived in our vibrant downtown, and I love the joyful noise that comes with it, as many of us do. A significant part of my appreciation for this lively public square stems from my German Jewish grandparents, who hid their identities in the United States for fear of being targeted, as their family members had been in Germany. My great-grandmother used to call me “Anka,” the same nickname as Anne Frank.

I was raised to be quiet, to know how to hide, and to be hyper-vigilant. Now, as a parent of a beautiful, fierce preteen son and twin daughters, I find myself not only worried about how to protect my children from the violent, indiscriminate kidnappings being carried out by secret police, which leave them weeping and terrified, but also actively engaging in community support. I take groceries to the families of my children’s classmates who can’t leave their homes, and I walk children to school because their parents can’t get them there safely.

As grassroots organizers and first responders, we cannot do this alone. We need your assistance to access funds that we would like to use to support our neighbors—your constituents. I urge you to allocate at least $200,000, like Costa Mesa did, to established organizations such as Camino and Gription Services to assist with legal aid and create a direct aid fund. We are all contributing our money to help, and we would appreciate having some of our tax dollars returned to support these efforts.

As others have mentioned, there are many places where this funding can be sourced. Additionally, as a side note, anyone who speaks a language other than English knows that Google Translate on the website is not a sufficient option; we can and should do better. Please do not be the ones who look the other way when the Gestapo came for their neighbors.

Next speaker. Good evening. All people in our Fullerton community are beloved and include our neighbors, families, friends, co-workers, colleagues, employers, and employees. The important word here is “all,” which encompasses everyone, including immigrants. Communities should help and take care of everyone, which is why I urge the council to approve measures that the City of Fullerton can take to support those impacted by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities.

People are afraid to leave their homes, go to work, or participate in daily life. Children are scared to go to school, fearing that their parents will disappear. I recently attended an important forum sponsored by Mayor Pro Tem Charles—thank you for that—focused on the mental health impacts of ICE activities in our community. The trauma is ongoing and relentless, and it is extremely damaging.

I ask that you establish a fund in the budget to assist these affected individuals, providing support for food, rental assistance, and legal aid. Partner with nonprofits to help in as many ways as possible, and include in our legislative platform support for state legislation that forbids many of the currently used illegal tactics. Other cities and counties are implementing these measures. Fullerton can demonstrate that we care for and support everyone; everyone belongs with us and to each other. We are all striving for the same things for ourselves and our families.

The trauma being inflicted is severe, and we can help alleviate some of the tragic effects through our actions. We have the power to make a difference in the kind of community we foster, and I urge you to take action tonight. Please help.

That’s my prepared statement. Now, I’d like to add some personal thoughts. Listening to everyone tonight, this whole immigrant raid situation has broken my heart more than anything else happening in our country. It pains me to see these beautiful people, speaking their lovely languages and wearing their traditional costumes, made to feel like they have to hide. This is incredibly upsetting and detracts from our entire community. Anyone who has witnessed these raids knows they are wrong—absolutely wrong and ugly. There seems to be no clear path forward; the rules are changing all the time. I know of a family affected by these circumstances.

Harry Longenbach: I have lived in Fullerton for over 25 years and have worked with people across the city on various issues facing our community. I believe that the issue we are discussing now is the greatest moral crisis our city has faced during my time here. I hope you will address it and do everything you can to confront it.

I would also like to take a moment to thank the city manager’s department and the staff who prepared the report on this issue. I believe they went above and beyond the call of duty in their work. They were tasked with looking at what a few other cities have done, and they produced a comprehensive 99-page report of resolutions and examples from various cities, including Goleta. I think they are very capable staff members who have acted with compassion. If you give them direction to work on specific solutions for us, I believe they will bring you something valuable. Thank you.

Next Speaker: I can’t really add to anything that’s already been said. The perspectives that were shared today were heartbreaking and incredible. All that I ask is please protect our community.

Jodi Aegis Vallejo: I live in Fullerton, specifically District 2, and I am a professor at USC, specializing in immigration policy and immigrant integration. I’d like to share some recent statistics released by the USC Equity Research Institute regarding Orange County. This data highlights how deeply immigrant communities are integrated into the fabric of our area, as you heard from the young people who spoke tonight. Our immigrant community in Orange County, especially in Fullerton, is essential to our social and economic structure.

In Orange County, there are over 210,000 undocumented residents, which constitutes one-fifth of all immigrants living here. As noted, a significant majority of these undocumented individuals have been here for a long time—more than a decade—raising families, paying taxes, and building homes. Their roots are our roots.

Think about how connected you might be to immigrants—whether through family, coworkers, students, members of the police force, or city management. Every one of us is touched by this issue. Currently, 216,000 people in Orange County live with undocumented family members. Among our youngest children, research indicates that 16% have at least one undocumented parent. These are our students, our coworkers, and our future leaders—people growing up in fear.

When ICE conducts raids in our neighborhoods and workplaces, it harms not just immigrants but also undermines public safety. The situation is likely to worsen. It is our responsibility at the local level to take proactive measures. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has received $170 million to become a militarized police force. Their budget surpasses that of any other country’s military, except for the United States and China, and is larger than that of any branch of the U.S. military.

So, we must ask: to what end? It is crucial for us to act local. I do not want my tax dollars funding ICE; I would prefer them to be invested in initiatives that make our city a home. Therefore, I urge you to set aside funds for a legal defense fund. We have people in this city actively supporting our community, often without public recognition. This work is happening right under our noses, and they need our support.

These stories are ongoing, and they will not stop. It is up to us to take action.

Z: I truly believe in the importance of consistency, and I want to clarify that I’m not here to ask for anything from you. Just as I wouldn’t seek your help if I were involved in a bicycle accident, I’m here to make an offer. I work as an educational psychologist and am trained as a high school counselor. If Bethany Anderson is still present, I believe she is the executive director of something important.

I would like to offer my services as a volunteer to this community, and I hope more professionals will step forward to provide support for our neighbors, friends, and loved ones. So, that’s my offer. My name is Z, and if you would like my phone number, I’m seated in the back row. I’m happy to volunteer and contribute to protecting our citizens. Thank you for your time, City Council.

Kurt Johnston: I would like to draw attention to ICE on a national level. We all know that ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but I believe it’s important to look at its impact across the country. I was watching a case on a program called Court TV about a man named Abera, who came over the border from Venezuela with three other people. Thanks to government assistance, he received a free flight to New York and a paid hotel stay. Unfortunately, he ended up killing a nursing student named Lakin.

As I explored other cases on Court TV, I discovered numerous instances where people have been killed due to immigration violations on a national scale. For me, it’s crucial to see the broader picture. I’m not entirely sure what ICE represents at the local level, but when I think about its national implications, I appreciate the acronym: National Immigration and Customs Enforcement (NICE). It signifies a commitment to keeping our country safe.

Curtis Gamble: I am an activist for homeless veterans, Cal State Fullerton students, OCTA bus drivers, seniors, and low-income communities. I want to express how challenging this situation is. I served my country as a veteran in the United States Navy and have traveled around the world twice, visiting many different countries.

While in those countries, I was always welcomed, and I made a promise to myself that if anyone ever came to America, they would be welcomed here as well. We Americans pride ourselves on our ability to travel anywhere we please, but if we don’t take care of those at home, we risk being treated the way we are treating others when we are abroad. That thought is frightening to me.

Many of us sailors formed bonds and got married during our four-year terms, which means that many people we speak about are like family to us. It pains me to see anyone treated as if they are unwelcome. This is part of the reason I served my country—to make everyone feel welcome, just as we were welcomed in other nations.

Over the past eight years, we have opened 14 to 15 emergency shelters. I believe that immigrants should be able to use these shelters as needed. After all, they are emergency shelters, and there should not be restrictions on what qualifies as an emergency.

Immigrants should have access to a CTA bus to reach one of these shelters if they feel unsafe. These shelters typically have security personnel, usually around six to eight security guards, to ensure safety, along with the support of others present.

We should utilize our resources wisely, and I recommend that we make these shelters available to anyone in need according to our municipal codes. Thank you very much.

Zoom Callers

Jose Trinidad Castaneda Casa Sanchez Mejia Nava Luhan Flores III: I will be brief and to the point. After researching possible policy opportunities to address the immigration challenges posed by ICE and the federal administration in 2023, and collaborating with the architects of these policies at the Legal Aid Defense Fund, I strongly advocated for my then-city water park to allocate a portion of its planned reserve funds to establish a new legal defense fund. Unfortunately, when I sought support from my colleagues, Council Member Conor Trout vehemently declined to back this initiative during the Biden administration, despite the favorable circumstances at that time.

Now, you have an opportunity here in Fullerton to turn this proposal into reality. It is essential to have some form of economic stabilization fund for our community because undocumented immigrants are part of our families, neighborhoods, and the larger community. They are employees, business owners, and integral to the fabric of our local economy.

Our economy is under threat, and it is being destabilized by a federal government that exhibits cruelty, particularly towards Latinos and immigrants in general. Many people in our community are affected by this, and if we do not act now, we will all face further economic destabilization.

I urge you to appropriate those planned reserve funds—which would not have been designated for other programs, projects, or departments—into a newly created legal aid defense fund. This action will distinguish you from my former colleagues in Buena Park, who failed to take action before the situation worsened. We are now in challenging times, and we must utilize reserve funds that are meant to support us during difficult periods.

This is not an exaggeration; it is a matter of literal survival for many in our community here in Fullerton. Establishing this fund is the most fiscally responsible decision we can make. Thank you.

Kayla: I admit that I haven’t read the entirety of the policy, but as someone who did review a lot of the policy for Santa Ana and looked into Costa Mesa’s as well, I am very pleased to see that Fullerton is trying to adopt similar measures. I’m particularly interested in the utility aspect—specifically, whether the city would need to cover those costs, or if they could simply forgive or suspend payments temporarily, since the city collects a lot of these bills, such as water.

I understand that city funds could definitely be used for essential needs like rent, food, especially now that some of these payments are being suspended, as well as for electricity and internet access. I just wanted to highlight that point and express my full support for the initiative being brought forward. I echo many of the comments that others have made so far regarding this issue.

Additionally, I think we should explore doing more, such as considering the creation of a Sanctuary Advisory Board where we consult with lawyers and nonprofits to discuss measures to protect our communities beyond this fund. I know that we passed a law at the state level regarding ICE agents, and I believe we can build on that.

Artificial Intelligence call was allowed to speak at City Council

The editor of the Fullerton Observer loudly objected from the audience to the AI bot being allowed to continue its rhetoric.

Mayor Fred Jung asked, “Mr. City Attorney, do we have this council any legal right to stop an AI voice? And somebody who publishes an local newspaper should realize and understand that.”

City Attorney Dick Jones responded, “As far as the speaker goes, we can’t verify whether it’s an AI voice or not. In the event the law does provide for remote speakers to come on and speak during the three minute comments.”

Council Comments

Council Member Dr. Ahmad Zahra:

I want to start by sharing something personal. I am an immigrant; I came here in my 20s, and I vividly remember the events of 9/11. For the younger generation, it may now be a historical event, but I lived through it as a young immigrant with just a green card. I remember the fear that our Muslim community experienced, but I also recall how our community came together during that difficult time—Jewish, Christian, Sikh, and others united to support one another.

Today, we are facing similar challenges and fears. I believe we should come together as a community, not judging each other’s backgrounds or status, but as neighbors and taxpayers who contribute to this country. Many of us have families that include American citizens and immigrants. I know from the community members who have spoken that everyone is affected; I am impacted, and my neighbors are impacted too. I proudly represent a district with many immigrants, and I know our mayor represents a similarly diverse community that includes first, second, and third-generation immigrants.

There are moral and practical reasons for our budget to reflect our values. When there is disruption in our community—whether from fear, economic instability, or other factors—we see it affect our businesses, our children’s education, and our local economy. We are losing out on revenue because individuals, who are also taxpayers—whether through property taxes or sales taxes—are unable to participate fully in the economy.

It is only logical that when there is a disruption in our community, we allocate funds to help those in need. From a practical standpoint, I propose that we create a resolution to reaffirm our values and establish a fund for both legal defense and humanitarian assistance, including rent support. We can model this after other cities by creating a flexible fund that collaborates with local nonprofits to assess needs and determine how much money we can allocate toward it.

Additionally, I suggest we open this fund to community donations. For instance, we could add a line on water bills that allows residents to contribute to this fund, providing an additional source of support. We could also seek partnerships with companies, corporations, and foundations that might be willing to help fund these initiatives, ensuring that the burden does not fall entirely on the city budget.

To summarize, this is not only a values statement but also a practical proposal. I would like to make a motion to move forward with the creation of this fund so that our staff can bring these items to the council for approval.

Now, regarding the legal defense fund, do you have an allocated amount in mind? I believe it is crucial for staff to have a clear figure because these expenses can add up. I suggest we start with no less than $100,000 for legal defense, and for the assistance fund, we should also allocate no less than $100,000. In total, that would be $200,000.

Lastly, I would like us to get practical legal advice. Mr. City Attorney, can a public entity establish a fund for donations? I thought we needed to maintain a separation of church and state. Please investigate if we can identify a public purpose to justify this initiative. We need to ensure that we involve the appropriate parties in this effort. We’ve successfully opened a donation fund before, such as for the murals, which received significant community support.

Mayor Pro Tem Dr. Shana Charles:

I just seconded Zahra’s motion, so you know where I stand on this issue—I believe it is something worth examining. I want to clarify that what we are doing tonight is discussing possibilities for action at the next meeting. We are not voting on this tonight, but I do hope that it will ultimately pass, given what we have heard today.

I want to emphasize something that struck me during the public comments. As someone who teaches the Constitution, I truly appreciate the importance of constitutional amendments. Specifically, the First Ten Amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, are fundamental rights that the states insisted on when this country was founded. Among these is the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits illegal search and seizure by the government. It explicitly states that no person should be subjected to such actions.

There are other parts of the Constitution where citizenship is clearly mentioned, indicating that the Founding Fathers were mindful of this matter. In fact, the presidency is the only office that explicitly requires a person to be a natural-born citizen, while Congressional members can be naturalized citizens. This inclusivity extends to other levels of government as well.

I feel fortunate to sit here between two gentlemen who are immigrants to this country. I have immense respect for anyone who has the courage to pick up and start anew in a different land. Many people immigrate out of choice, but lately, it seems that choice is increasingly becoming a privilege.

Most recent immigrants are fleeing from difficult circumstances, places that lack the protections guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Their governments often persecute individuals without any recourse.

In supporting the amicus brief for Perdomo v. ICE, we are addressing the issue of due process violations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They often act without search warrants, disregarding the rights of all individuals, regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens or undocumented. There have been over 50 reported cases in Fullerton alone, and this is likely just the tip of the iceberg.

The implications extend beyond those who are undocumented. I am very concerned about the lack of legal representation, which is essential for ensuring due process. It’s heartbreaking to think of children—some as young as three years old—being forced to appear in court alone, without a lawyer or adult to advocate for them. Such circumstances are unconscionable and should never happen to any resident.

I agree with the Founding Fathers: no person should be denied these protections. Everyone deserves due process, and providing legal assistance is a crucial part of that. I believe that the City of Fullerton can take action in this regard, and I hope our staff can devise a way to create a $100,000 legal defense fund.

Additionally, we need a basic needs fund, and I’ve heard from many community members who want to donate but don’t know how to contribute. This could serve as a fantastic opportunity for community collaboration. The newly established Fullerton Community Foundation aims to do good work and could be a great avenue for this support. I hope we can all come together to agree on these proposals.

Council Member Jamie Valencia:

“We are voting on the motion proposed by Council Member Zahra, which is not one of the current options.” She has asked the City Clerk to review the motion again.

City Clerk Lucinda Williams:

The motion is to return at the next meeting with a resolution outlining values for consideration. It also includes the establishment of two funds: one for legal assistance and another for basic needs, with each fund set at a minimum of $100,000. Additionally, the motion includes the acceptance of donations.

Valencia:

Is there a way to amend this? I would like to work with all the nonprofits in our community, as that was one of the options presented by staff.

Council Members Charles and Zahra:

They affirmed that work with all the nonprofits was part of the original motion.

Mayor Fred Jung:

Throughout my life, I’ve often been reminded that I am an immigrant, with people telling me even now to “go home.” I understand when desperate communities cry out for help—this is why the Council has decided to defend them from a legal standpoint. However, we are facing a $10 million paper deficit, which is not a practical reality. That is simply the truth. There’s nothing practical about it. I’ve spoken with many of you in private about this matter, and I understand your concerns. I hope you can understand mine as well.

Voting Results:

Council Member Dunlap: No

Council Member Valencia: Yes

Council Member Zahra: Aye

Mayor Pro Tem Charles: Aye

Mayor Jung: No

Abrego’s deportation dispute and Africa’s role

Abrego’s case became symbolic of the complexities surrounding Washington’s “third-country” deportation strategy, which seeks to resettle deported migrants in nations with no direct connection to their origin or criminal history.

The policy, critics argue, exposes deportees to human rights risks and undermines international asylum norms.

Liberia, in a statement through its Ministry of Information, said its decision to receive Abrego was made “on a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis” following a formal U.S. request as per Reuters.

The government added that it would ensure the migrant is not transferred “to any country where he may face substantial risk of persecution, torture or other serious harm.”

Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis temporarily halted the deportation, pending a ruling on Abrego’s legal challenge for release from immigration detention. It remains unclear whether the new agreement will alter the court’s position.

Trump’s third-country deportation drive

The Trump administration has increasingly relied on bilateral arrangements with African and Central American nations to offload deportees when their home countries refuse reentry. However, several African governments including Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Libya have previously resisted or outright rejected third-country deportation proposals, citing sovereignty concerns, security risks, and public opposition.

Analysts say the Liberia deal may signal Washington’s determination to continue pursuing its global deportation network, even amid diplomatic resistance.

Congress took neither of those actions this time, though lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to get legislation addressing federal workers’ pay through Congress, as recently as this week.
Last week, Trump acted unilaterally, repurposing a reported $8bn in defense department funds meant for research and development to pay the military in the middle of October.
The experts viewed Trump’s move to pay troops as his latest attempt to shift the power of the purse away from Congress and into the executive branch, but differed over how significant it was in the long term.
Mirasola connected the pay decision to Trump’s deployment of national guard troops into cities across the country, including Washington DC, Chicago and Portland.","By ordering that US military personnel receive paychecks even though the government is shut down, Donald Trump is seeing to the needs of a politically untouchable constituency that has been caught up in the congressional logjam over federal spending.

But experts who spoke to the Guardian warn that he is doing so in a way that is almost certainly illegal and, if left unchecked, bodes ill for Congress’s constitutional authority to control government spending. Some fear it could set the stage for the president to unilaterally fund other contentious decisions in the future, such as the deployment of the military on US soil.

“I’m with the people who believe that there’s really no good legal justification for moving the money around in this way,” said Phil Wallach, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the separation of powers in the US government.

“There’s no congressional authorization for troop payment for this new fiscal year. So it’s going pretty far out on a legal limb, and just sort of daring anybody to do anything about it. Because, of course, substantially, nobody thinks it’s very bad to pay the troops.”

The federal government shut down at the start of October after Democrats and Republicans in Congress failed to agree on legislation to extend funding beyond the end of September. About 700,000 federal workers have been furloughed, while hundreds of thousands of others continue to report to work, but are not getting paychecks.

Troops were paid during previous government shutdowns because Congress had either approved defense department spending, or passed bills specifically to guarantee their salaries, said Bobby Kogan, a former White House office of management and budget official who is now with the Center for American Progress, a liberal thinktank.

Congress took neither of those actions this time, though lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to get legislation addressing federal workers’ pay through Congress, as recently as this week.

Last week, Trump acted unilaterally, repurposing a reported $8bn in defense department funds meant for research and development to pay the military in the middle of October. Kogan called the decision “super duper duper illegal” under federal law.

“If you try to spend money you have on the wrong purpose, you’re in trouble. And if you try to spend money into a purpose that you don’t have money for that purpose, then you’re in trouble as well,” he said.

On Thursday, Trump said an unnamed “friend” had contributed $130m to pay service members during the shutdown, later revealed by the New York Times to be reclusive billionaire and Trump supporter Timothy Mellon. Sean Parnell, the chief spokesperson for the Pentagon, confirmed acceptance of the funds “under its general gift acceptance authority. The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of Service members’ salaries and benefits.”

Christopher Mirasola, a law professor at the University of Houston, said that the civil servants who carried out Trump’s order to repurpose funds could theoretically be prosecuted for violating a law called the Antideficiency Act. But such prosecutions have never happened in the past, and he said in an interview he finds it difficult to believe Trump’s justice department, or even another president, would carry them out.

“I’m just not sure if a future administration would have the appetite to bring career government officials who at that point would have suffered years of abuse at the hands of the administration for complying with something even if they knew that it was illegal,” Mirasola said.

Trump foes who tried to sue over it – think Democratic lawmakers or civil society groups – may have trouble proving that they were harmed by paying the troops, a necessary component for bringing a case, Kogan said.

“You’re in tough places here to find standing under this supreme court, at least under the Trump administration,” he said.

The experts viewed Trump’s move to pay troops as his latest attempt to shift the power of the purse away from Congress and into the executive branch, but differed over how significant it was in the long term. Since taking office, he has used a variety of methods to halt government spending on areas his administration opposes, including a controversial pocket rescission of foreign aid funds.

“I think the crisis will start to feel more acute if we start seeing the president moving money around to do things that are very politically controversial,” said Wallach, noting that paying US armed forces is “something that basically everybody agrees on”.

The ball is now in the Republican-controlled Congress’s court to make clear that it is they who make the decisions about spending, Wallach said.

“I certainly don’t think among GOP appropriators, they’re like wanting to see the White House just take things over. I’m really quite certain that they’re distressed by this dynamic and want to get away from it as fast as they can,” he said.

Kogan warned that Trump was launching an offensive against Congress’s appropriations process, by which lawmakers, usually working in a bipartisan fashion, outline how much the government will spend, and on what.

“If the president can just completely ignore anything and everything, can spend money into existence, he can drain accounts and use them on whatever he wants, right?” Kogan said. “Like, what are we even doing there? That makes you an appropriations king.”

Such decisions may paradoxically make finding an agreement to reopen the government harder, by sapping the trust in Congress that any legislative deal Democrats sign on to will be honored by Trump.

“The whole point of the budget deal is to figure out how you’re going to allocate your limited resources. We are going to figure out what we want to prioritize in the government, and if the president has complete and unilateral authority to ignore every part of that deal, how can you ever do appropriations? How can you ever make a funding deal?” Kogan.

Mirasola connected the pay decision to Trump’s deployment of national guard troops into cities across the country, including Washington DC, Chicago and Portland. He views many of the federal laws that govern how the military may be used on US soil as outdated, and the main obstacle Trump faces is his ability to get Congress to pay for the soldiers.

“If my theory that appropriations are the most important limit on these domestic military deployments, if that’s true, then moves like this to edge Congress out of the appropriations process [are] really a strike at one of the most significant amendments on the president’s authority to use the military in the United States,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c884ab773bdc8f41040f7ff0a604bf2d6e95f4f3/250_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=82cd07b6fd2514c641d7b3a9e8dddbf8",N,,2025-10-26 10:57:29.617247

Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.
The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown.
“I will not support a shutdown deal that strips healthcare from tens of thousands of my constituents,” she said.","Twenty-two days into the government shutdown, California Rep. Kevin Kiley spent an hour of his morning in Washington guiding a group of middle school students from Grass Valley through the empty corridors of the U.S. Capitol.

Normally, one of his staff members would have led the tour. But the Capitol is closed to all tours during the shutdown, unless the elected member is present. So the schoolchildren from Lyman Gilmore Middle School ended up with Kiley, a Republican from Rocklin, as their personal tour guide.

“I would have visited with these kids anyway,” Kiley said in his office after the event. “But I actually got to go on the whole tour of the Capitol with them as well.”

Kiley’s impromptu tour is an example of how members of California’s congressional delegation are improvising their routines as the shutdown drags on and most of Washington remains at a standstill.

Some are in Washington in case negotiations resume, others are back at home in their districts meeting with federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay, giving interviews or visiting community health centers that rely on tax credits central to the budget negotiations. One member attended the groundbreaking of a flood control project in their district. Others are traveling back and forth.

“I’ve had to fly back to Washington for caucus meetings, while the opposition, the Republicans, don’t even convene and meet,” Rep. Maxine Waters, a longtime Los Angeles Democrat, said in an interview. “We will meet anytime, anyplace, anywhere, with [House Speaker Mike] Johnson, with the president, with the Senate, to do everything that we can to open up the government. We are absolutely unified on that.”

The shutdown is being felt across California, which has the most federal workers outside the District of Columbia. Food assistance benefits for millions of low-income Californians could soon be delayed. And millions of Californians could see their healthcare premiums rise sharply if Affordable Care Act subsidies are allowed to expire.

For the California delegation, the fallout at home has become impossible to ignore. Yet the shutdown is in its fourth week with no end in sight.

In the House, Johnson has refused to call members back into session and prevented them from doing legislative work. Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.

“I have certainly emphasized the point that the House needs to be in session, and that canceling a month’s worth of session is not a good thing for the House or the country,” Kiley said, noting that he had privately met with Johnson.

Kiley, who represented parts of the Sacramento suburbs and Lake Tahoe, is facing political uncertainty as California voters weigh whether to approve Proposition 50 on Nov. 4. The measure would redraw the state’s congressional districts to better favor Democrats, leaving Kiley at risk, even though the Republican says he believes he could still win if his right-leaning district is redrawn.

The Senate has been more active, holding a series of votes on the floor and congressional hearings with Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The chamber, however, has been unable to reach a deal to reopen the government. On Thursday, the 23rd day of the shutdown, the Senate failed to advance competing measures that would have paid federal employees who have been working without compensation.

The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown. Democrats backed a bill that would have paid all federal workers and barred the Trump administration from laying off any more federal employees.

“California has one of the largest federal workforces in the country, and no federal worker or service member should miss their paychecks because Donald Trump and Republicans refused to come to the table to protect Americans’ health care,” Sen. Alex Padilla said in a statement.

Working conditions get harder

The strain on federal employees — including those who work for California’s 54 delegation members — are starting to become more apparent.

Dozens of them have been working full time without pay. Their jobs include answering phone calls and requests from constituents, setting the schedules for elected officials, writing policy memos and handling messaging for their offices.

At the end of October, House staffers — who are paid on a monthly basis — are expected to miss their first paycheck.

Some have been quietly told to consider borrowing money from the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union, which is offering a “government shutdown relief loan program” that includes a no-interest loan of up to $5,000 to be repaid in full after 90 days.

The mundane has also been disrupted. Some of the cafeterias and coffee carts that are usually open to staffers are closed. The lines to enter office buildings are long because fewer entrances are open.

The hallways leading to the offices of California’s elected officials are quiet, except for the faint sound of occasional elevator dings. Many of their doors are adorned with signs that show who they blame for the government shutdown.

“Trump and Republicans shut down the government,” reads a sign posted on the door that leads into Rep. Norma Torres’ (D-Pomona) office. “Our office is OPEN — WORKING for the American people.”

Rep. Ted Lieu, a Democrat from Torrance, posted a similar sign outside his office.

Rep. Vince Fong, a Republican who represents the Central Valley, has been traveling between Washington and his district. Two weeks into the shutdown, he met with veterans from the Central Valley Honor Flight and Kern County Honor Flight to make sure that their planned tour of the Capitol was not disrupted by the shutdown. Like Kiley’s tour with the schoolchildren, an elected member needed to be present for the tour to go on.

“His presence ensured the tour could continue as planned,” Fong’s office said.

During the tour, veterans were able to see Johnson as well, his office said.

Shutdown highlights deep divisions

California’s congressional delegation mirrors the broader stalemate in Washington, where entrenched positions have kept both parties at a negotiation impasse.

Democrats are steadfast in their position that they will not agree to a deal unless Republicans extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits expiring at the end of the year, while Republicans are accusing Democrats of failing to reopen the government for political gain.

Kiley is one of the few Republicans who has called on Johnson to negotiate with Democrats on healthcare. Kiley said he thinks there is a “a lot of room to negotiate” because there is concern on both sides of the aisle if the tax credits expire.

“If people see a massive increase in their premiums ... that’s not a good thing,” he said. “Especially in California, where the cost of living is already so high, and you’re suddenly having to pay a lot more for healthcare.”

Rep. Robert Garcia, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, in a press event Wednesday with five other California Democrats talked about the need to fight for the healthcare credits.

Garcia, of Long Beach, said he recently visited a healthcare center in San Bernardino County that serves seniors with disabilities. He said the cuts would be “devastating” and would prompt the center to close.

“That’s why we are doing everything in our power to negotiate a deal that reopens the federal government and saves healthcare,” he said.

As the shutdown continues, many Democrats are digging their heels on the issue.

At an Oct. 3 event outside of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, for instance, Rep. Laura Friedman held a news conference with nurses and hospital staff and said she would not vote for a bill to reopen the government unless there is a deal on healthcare.

Last week, the Glendale Democrat said her position hasn’t changed.

“I will not support a shutdown deal that strips healthcare from tens of thousands of my constituents,” she said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/908468d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5703x2994+0+404/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F83%2F494200f74ea08a318ce235971ba3%2F1526823-na-congressman-kiley-6951.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:57:32.914472

Matt Wyatt, 51, who also voted for Mr. Trump, agreed.
Mr. Leeds said he has traveled to the country 25 times and used dollars paid by Iowa farmers to foster strong bonds with Chinese importers.
Iowa’s large beef industry then recoiled after Mr. Trump suggested he would try to lower the cost of beef by importing more from Argentina.
Peter Orazem, an economics professor at Iowa State University, linked that to layoffs of migrant workers.","When President Trump announced a $20 billion bailout for Argentina this month, Larry Ory, 86, a farmer in Earlham, Iowa, could hardly believe it, especially after boatloads of Argentine soybeans began shipping to China, a once-critical customer for Mr. Ory's family.

For Iowans, losing China’s soybean market in the president’s trade war was only one of many economic shocks that have hit the state since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. The cost of tractors and fertilizers have shot up with his tariffs. Labor has grown scarcer in agribusinesses. Major manufacturers have laid off workers. Even the ubiquitous wind turbines that provide income for some Iowa farmers are in the president’s sights.

“Right now, we’re fighting different economic wars all at once,” said Summer Ory, 37, the wife of Mr. Ory’s grandson, Dan. The couple works in the family’s farm business. “You can sustain it one at a time, but right now it’s death by a thousand paper cuts.”

Since siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s gross domestic product dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska.

Manufacturing, which drives 17 percent of Iowa’s economic output, has been hit with higher production costs in part because of steep tariffs on inputs like aluminum and steel. Meatpacking plants, which help make Iowa the nation’s leading pork producer, rely heavily on foreign-born workers, hundreds of thousands of whom saw their legal status stripped away by the president. Mr. Trump’s war on renewable energy also threatens the wind industry that produces more than half of Iowa’s electricity.

Some of the state’s troubles, like bad weather, high interest rates, an aging and shrinking rural population, and global commodity prices, are beyond the president’s control. But new economic policies have magnified the state’s woes, according to economists, agricultural groups and some business leaders.

“This is as challenging as I’ve seen it,” Kirk Leeds, the chief executive of the Iowa Soybean Association, said. “We’ve got uncertainties beyond compare.”

Next year’s midterm elections could indicate how Iowans feel about those policies. At least two competitive House districts will be up for a vote. The state will also choose a replacement for its retiring governor, Kim Reynolds, and a retiring senator, Joni Ernst. All those posts are held by Republicans.

“People are hurting everywhere in Iowa, and they’re looking for something different,” said Josh Turek, a Democratic state house member running for Ms. Ernst’s seat.

Mr. Trump has argued the tariffs will help protect American jobs and rectify trade imbalances, while enforcing immigration laws will free up work for citizens.

“There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, adding that the president was “capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws.”

And many Iowans remain loyal. Doug Keller, 63, who farms about 15 miles southwest of Waterloo, said he was hopeful the president will reach a new trade deal with China that will benefit farmers in the long run. Matt Wyatt, 51, who also voted for Mr. Trump, agreed.

“Money is tighter than it should be,” said Mr. Wyatt, who works with Mr. Keller to grow corn and soybeans on close to 1,500 acres of land. “But we try to stay optimistic around here.”

For now, times are tough. Iowa is the country’s second-largest producer of both corn and soybeans. America exports as much as half its soybeans, and the vast majority of that had gone to China — $12.6 billion worth last year.

But this year, China stopped purchasing soybeans from the United States to retaliate against Mr. Trump’s tariffs. American producers have spent decades working with people in China on how to use soy in animal feed, part of an effort to build up that growing market. Mr. Leeds said he has traveled to the country 25 times and used dollars paid by Iowa farmers to foster strong bonds with Chinese importers.

“I’m not exactly sure how we repair some of these relationships,” Mr. Leeds said.

The president’s bailout of his ally, President Javier Milei of Argentina, has rankled many Iowans, since China moved immediately after it was announced to lock up Argentine soybean exports to fill the gap from Beijing’s boycott of American soy.

“Who are you subsidizing, our competitors or us?” Larry Ory asked.

Iowa’s large beef industry then recoiled after Mr. Trump suggested he would try to lower the cost of beef by importing more from Argentina. Bryan Whaley, the chief executive of the Iowa Cattlemen’s Association, said Mr. Trump’s comments roiled cattle markets, and a volatile market “provides less of an opportunity for our producers — cattlemen and women here in Iowa — to make decisions that are going to help keep them profitable and viable.”

The president said he will take some money raised by his tariffs and “give it to farmers” as a bailout, but that is not necessarily welcome news.

“We would much rather farm with no federal assistance whatsoever,” Mr. Wyatt said. “We want to be able to sell our products for a good value, and normally we can.”

John Gilbert, a farmer in Iowa Falls, said he expected the government payments to favor larger agribusinesses and to drive more consolidation in an industry that has been dominated by big corporations.

“The payments are skewed to the bigger guys,” said Mr. Gilbert, a Democrat whose family has about 800 acres of land for grains and livestock.

As he deals with those higher prices, Aaron Lehman, a fifth-generation farmer in rural Polk County, said he will continue to use his more than 25-year-old, worn combine. A machine with greater power and a more sophisticated GPS system would cost upward of $100,000 used and more than $250,000 new, he said.

Mr. Lehman wondered whether his 26-year-old son could realistically earn a living working full time on the family farm.

“Our farms, and lots of farms, are having to assess if there’s real opportunity for years down the road,” said Mr. Lehman, who serves as president of the Iowa Farmers Union.

The economic pain has spread beyond agriculture to truckers who transport seeds and grains, agronomists who help farmers innovate, and the Main Street restaurants where farmers eat and drink.

“Everywhere you turn, people are asking, ‘How are you going to make it?’” Ms. Ory said.

Dan Ory, 37, her husband, called it “just the perfect storm.”

John Deere, a leading manufacturing employer that makes agricultural equipment, has laid off hundreds of workers from its Iowa factories this year as sales decline and tariffs on steel and aluminum cost the company more than $300 million.

Employment in Iowa’s food manufacturing is down too. Peter Orazem, an economics professor at Iowa State University, linked that to layoffs of migrant workers. JBS Foods, a Brazilian meatpacker, laid off approximately 200 workers from Haiti, Cuba, El Salvador and Honduras at a plant in Ottumwa in June, said Paulina Ocegueda, vice president for the local chapter of LULAC, a Hispanic civil rights organization.

“It’s not costless to replace that number of workers,” Dr. Orazem said. He added that it was “difficult to find domestic workers who take these jobs.”

In Waterloo, some Haitian workers lost jobs at a Tyson pork processing plant, said Yves Fleurima, a community outreach coordinator for World Grace Project, which helps refugees and other new migrants in Waterloo find employment. Workers had received letters from the Department of Homeland Security telling them their legal immigration status would be terminated and they should leave the country, he said.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for Homeland Security, said humanitarian parole programs “undercut American workers” and allowed “poorly vetted” people into the country.

JBS employs more than 5,000 people at four production facilities in Iowa, according to Nikki Richardson, a spokeswoman for the company. Two more plants are under construction and expected to create close to 1,000 additional jobs in Iowa, she added.

“We are focused on hiring team members who are legally authorized to work in the United States and will continue to follow the guidance provided to us by the U.S. government,” she said in an email.

Tyson did not respond to requests for comment.

Iowa’s renewable energy sector is also facing uncertainty, driven by what appears to be the president’s personal animus toward wind power. The Trump administration and Congress have cut funding for major renewable projects, phased out renewable energy tax credits and issued new rules to make it harder for some projects to qualify for those credits.

“Upon entering U.S. custody, they (Ushakov and Skitsan) were separated without explanation,” said América Diversa.

América Diversa, a group that advocates on behalf of LGBTQ immigrants, told the Washington Blade that Andrei Ushakov and Aleksandr Skitsan fled Russia on March 14, 2024, “after the government began labelling LGBTQIA+ organizations as ‘extremist.’” Skitsan “faced direct threats at his workplace, forcing them to flee for their safety.”

The State Department’s 2023 human rights report specifically notes a Russian authorities “used laws prohibiting the promotion of ‘non-traditional sexual relations’ to justify the arbitrary arrest of LGBTQI+ persons.” The 2023 report also cites reports that “state actors committed violence against LGBTQI+ individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly in Chechnya” and “government agents attacked, harassed, and threatened LGBTQI+ activists.”

Advocacy groups in August sharply criticized the State Department after it “erased” LGBTQ and intersex people from its 2024 human rights report. Immigration Equality and other organizations say this omission could jeopardize the cases of LGBTQ who are seeking asylum in the U.S.

Couple separated, not receiving proper medical care in ICE custody

América Diversa says Ushakov and Skitsan arrived in Mexico on March 15, 2024.

The men used the CBP (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) One app the Biden-Harris administration created that allowed them and other asylum seekers to schedule an appointment at a port of entry. Their appointment was on Nov. 27, 2024, and America Diversa said they asked for asylum on that day once they entered the U.S.

The Trump-Vance administration discontinued the CBP One app on Jan. 20, the day it took office.

“Upon entering U.S. custody, they (Ushakov and Skitsan) were separated without explanation,” said América Diversa.

Ushakov and Skitsan were initially detained at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, Calif., which is in the state’s Imperial Valley.

“Andrei was placed in an overcrowded unit with more than 60 detainees, where poor sanitation, excessive air conditioning, and the lack of adequate medical care have put his health at risk,” said América Diversa.

The group says the couple are now at the San Luis Regional Detention Center in San Luis, Ariz.

“They are now being denied all communication with each other, despite being legally married and sharing the same asylum case,” said América Diversa.

The group notes Ushakov has a “chronic medical condition that requires continuous medication and quarterly monitoring.”

“Despite repeated requests, he faces long delays in treatment and limited access to medical services,” said América Diversa.

América Diversa also noted Skitsan suffers from a “chronic ear infection, which causes ringing and temporary hearing loss, as well as untreated stomach issues.” América Diversa said Skitsan had been scheduled to see a doctor in December, but his “recent transfer to Arizona has jeopardized that case.”

“Their transfer to the San Luis Regional Detention Center has further worsened their situation,” said América Diversa. “At this new facility, they have been prohibited from communicating with each other, an act that violates not only basic humanitarian principles but also their rights as a legally married couple under both U.S. and international law.”

América Diversa Managing Director Yonatan Matheus on Oct. 22 told the Blade he had just spoken with Ushakov.

“He couldn’t talk with his husband, he was only able to talk with me for less than five minutes,” said Matheus. “The calls are recorded and monitored. He is very afraid to speak.”

The couple’s case are among those that have garnered attention since the Trump-Vance administration took office.

The White House earlier this year “forcibly disappeared” Andry Hernández Romero, a gay Venezuelan makeup artist who asked for asylum in the U.S., to El Salvador. He returned to his homeland in July after he spent more than 100 days in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, a maximum-security prison known by the Spanish acronym CECOT.

ICE agents in August arrested Alice Correia Barbosa, a transgender Brazilian woman, while she was driving her car in Silver Spring, Md. A senior Department of Homeland Security official who misgendered Correia told the Blade that she “overstayed his visa by almost six years” and DHS plans to deport her.

Brazil has the highest number of reported murders of trans people in the world.

ICE did not respond to the Blade’s request for comment about Ushakov and Skitsan’s case.

On Tuesday, Vladimir Putin took his oath of office becoming the second ever longest serving leader of the modern Russian state since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, who held power from 1922 until his death in 1953.

Putin’s tenure in office has been marked by his acquisition of concentrated political power in part due to his eradication and imprisonment or the deaths of his political opponents, such as his rumored unproven involvement in the assassination of fierce Putin critic Boris Nemtsov on Feb. 27, 2015, just steps away from the gate to the Kremlin, and more recently in the prosecution and imprisonment of another high profile Putin critic, Alexei Navalny, who died on Feb. 16 at a penal colony north of the Arctic Circle.

Putin ordered military operations in August 2008, which led to the Russo-Georgian War and diplomatic relations were broken. To this day, the two countries have maintained no formal diplomatic relations. Then in February and March 2014, Russian troops at his direction invaded the Crimean Peninsula, part of Ukraine, and annexed it. The resulting hostilities also spread to the far-eastern Ukrainian oblasts, [provinces] which culminated with Russia invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since the end of World War II in 1945.

As the war drags on Putin’s threats of military escalation against NATO countries and use of battlefield nuclear weapons has created a tense relationship with a majority of the European Union as well as with the United States. Russia has been heavily sanctioned by the West and is turning to other totalitarian regimes like China, Iran, and North Korea for support.

In his inaugural speech Putin made oblique reference to his oft stated desire to recreate a hybrid of the former Soviet Union:

“In these solemn and crucial moments of assuming the office of the president, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the citizens of Russia across all regions of our country, as well as those living in the historical territories of Russia who have won their right to stand united with our Motherland.”

The Russian president then thanked the forces fighting in the invasion of Ukraine saying:

“I humbly honor our heroes, the participants in the special military operation, and all those who are fighting for our Fatherland. I would like to thank you again for the trust you have placed in me and for your unwavering support. These words are directed to every citizen of Russia.”

On the domestic front Putin has stifled media outlets with draconian laws passed designed to keep the Russian population largely ignorant of the cost both human lives and governmental spending as the warfare in Ukraine drags on and losses to the Russian military continue.

The Associated Press reported neither the U.S., U.K. nor German ambassadors attended. The U.S. Embassy said Amb. Lynne Tracy was out of the country on “prescheduled, personal travel.”

A handful of EU envoys attended even though top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said he told them “the right thing to do is not to attend this inauguration,” because Putin is the subject of an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.

In his speech Putin issued a veiled threat to critics of his regime that dissention would not be tolerated:

“We can see that the atmosphere in society has changed, and how much we now value reliability, responsibility, sincerity, integrity, generosity, and courage. I will do everything in my power to ensure that those who have displayed these admirable human and professional traits, and who have proved their loyalty to the fatherland through their deeds, achieve leading positions in state governance, the economy and all other spheres.

We must ensure reliable continuity in the development of our country for decades to come and bring up new generations who will strengthen Russia’s might and develop our state based on interethnic accord, the preservation of the traditions of all ethnic groups living in Russia, a civilizational nation united by the Russian language and our multi-ethnic culture.”

The Russian president has also targeted the country’s LGBTQ community with passage of multiple laws that forbid public mention or acknowledgment of queer Russians. In his speech he emphasized his commitment to maintaining “family values.”

“Our top priority is the preservation of the people. I am confident that the support of centuries-old family values and traditions will continue to unite public and religious associations, political parties, and all levels of government.

Our decisions regarding the development of the country and its regions must be effective and fair and must promote the prosperity of Russian families and improve their quality of life,” he said.

The Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank in D.C., noted recently:

“Escalating state discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community in Russia is directly informed by the Putin regime’s struggle to maintain legitimacy and public support, especially as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on. Russian federal elections are scheduled for 2024, and officials are reportedly planning to project record levels of public support for Putin.”

The war in Ukraine and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community are both popular policies among the socially conservative interest groups that make up Putin’s strongest base of support, and Russian policymakers draw clear connections between the Kremlin’s narrative that Russia is fighting Western ideology by proxy in Ukraine and the Kremlin’s attack on the LGBTQ+ experience in Russia.

Putin’s inaugural speech today signaled his future intentions on conducting the war in Ukraine and his ongoing persecution of LGBTQ+ Russians.”

Legislation that will effectively ban the existence of transgender Russians was signed on Monday as expected by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The new law, which takes effective immediately, was passed earlier this month by the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, and then last week by the Federal Council, which is its upper body.

The law now bans Russians from changing their gender on official government identity documents including internal and external passports, driver’s licenses and birth certificates, although gender marker changes had been legal since 1997.

Medical healthcare providers are now banned from “performing medical interventions designed to change the sex of a person,” including surgery and prescribing hormone therapy.

The law, which human rights organizations have labeled draconian and barbaric, also bans individuals who have undergone gender reassignment from adopting children and annuls marriages in which one of the partners is trans.

LGBTQ activists have warned that the law will lead to a further increase in already high rates of suicide and suicide attempts among trans Russians. Worse, say sympathetic physicians and trans rights advocates, it will foment an underground market for surgeries and medications, which are dangerous as unproven drugs or outright fake drugs may cause irreparable harm.

LGBTQ activists also said that this law will lead to an increase in attempted suicides among trans youth unable to access medical care.

“The way how these people see their future is collapsing,” Yan Dvorkin, the head of Center-T, a group that helps trans and nonbinary people in Russia, said in an interview with The Moscow Times earlier this month.

During debate over the law, Deputy Duma Speaker Pytor Tolstoy, a co-sponsor of the legislation, pointed out that banning the “practice of transgenderism” was in the interest of national security.

The diagnosis of “transsexualism,” he added, refers to gender identity disorders and is the basis for recognizing a citizen as unfit for military service. In addition, “we must not forget that by changing the sex of one of the partners, a homosexual couple gets the right to adopt a child. Unfortunately, there are already such cases in Russia,” he said.

LGBTQ and human rights organization ILGA-Europe issued a statement condemning the actions of the Duma and offered support and solidarity with the Russian trans and queer communities.

“We firmly assert that such legislation flagrantly violates fundamental human rights standards and principles.

ILGA-Europe firmly believe in the inherent dignity and equal rights of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. International human rights standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, emphasize that everyone has the right to self-determination, privacy and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Denying trans and gender diverse individuals access to trans-specific healthcare and legal gender recognition blatantly disregards the international human rights framework,” ILGA-Europe wrote.

A young woman who only identified herself to Russian freelance journalist Sergei Dimitrov by the name Elena, told him in an interview in St. Petersburg earlier this month:

“There is no safety anymore, soon they will openly hunt us like swine, we no right to exist they say,” she said.

The young woman also said that since the latest passage of laws including expansion of the Russia’s “gay propaganda” law to include adults last December, coupled with the crackdown by the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, abbreviated as Roskomnadzor, on any websites and on popular phone apps that cater to LGBTQ people, she has now begun efforts in earnest to leave the country.",https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/10/Aleksandr_Skitsan_and_Andrei_Ushakov_insert_courtesy-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:57:48.857823

Nonprofits working to combat domestic violence and sexual assault have notched a string of legal wins as they push back against efforts by the Trump administration to put restrictions on work that goes against the administration’s views.

A series of lawsuits has, at least temporarily, blocked the administration from enforcing restrictions on millions of dollars of funding for upcoming grants and forced it to return grants it took away from some nonprofits working with LGBTQ+ victims.

Domestic violence groups and the broader network of gender-based violence nonprofits have been on high alert since the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders — followed by a temporary federal freeze in late January — to end federal funding for programs or organizations out of step with the administration’s ideology. The funding, advocates say, is essential to providing life-saving services to vulnerable victims, who are more likely to be women.

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.

The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”

Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.

The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.

“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”

A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”

Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.

Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.

“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.

“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”

A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.

The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.

In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”

The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.

LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.

FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.

The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.

The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.

The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?

They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”

“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)

“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”

The administration notified states of the new rule in August. It is expected to take effect in November.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Domestic-violence-nonprofit-illustration-for-Oct-26-2025-story.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 08:57:03.039460
