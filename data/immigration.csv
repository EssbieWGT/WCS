Among the many corrosive consequences of Mr. Trump’s actions is a loss of faith in almost anything that his Justice Department does.
The Justice Department was hardly perfect before Mr. Trump took the oath of office a year ago.
As the second year of Mr. Trump’s second term begins next week, there are some modestly encouraging signs of resistance — but not nearly enough.
But the Republican Party has largely been a silent partner as its leader removes all sense of justice from the Justice Department.","President Trump is celebrating the anniversary of his return to power by accelerating his attack on the rule of law. He has spent the week leading up to Jan. 20 using the mighty powers of the Justice Department as an extension of his personal and political interests. The department has started a fabricated criminal investigation of the Federal Reserve chair, searched the home of a Washington Post reporter and created a White House-controlled fraud unit that would streamline partisan prosecution.

Mr. Trump does not attempt to hide his use of law enforcement powers for vengeance. He glories in it. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported, he hosted federal prosecutors at the White House and complained that they were not moving fast enough to punish the rivals, critics and truth tellers he wished to target. This followed months of pressure by the president on his attorney general to do more to prosecute those who oppose his actions and those who tried to hold him accountable under the law in the past.

These efforts have become a defining feature of Mr. Trump’s second term, and it can be easy to become numb to them. We urge you not to. His usurpation of law enforcement power threatens us all. His meddling with the independence of the Fed undermines the economy. His attacks on members of Congress and the news media threaten people’s right to speak freely and hold the government accountable. His move to control investigation and prosecution from the White House portends an America where the state uses force to promote the political interests of its leaders, rather than uphold the laws passed by our representatives.

One year into his second term, America risks losing a central feature of our democracy: that we are a country ruled by laws, not by one man.

Among the many corrosive consequences of Mr. Trump’s actions is a loss of faith in almost anything that his Justice Department does. Consider the situation in Minnesota that attracted so much of the nation’s attention in recent days. On Jan. 7 an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot to death Renee Good, who was protesting ICE’s raids in Minneapolis. Under any other modern president, the next steps would have been clear. The government would have conducted a sober-minded inquiry about whether the agent had acted appropriately.

Under Mr. Trump, the verdict was preordained. The ICE agents on the scene prevented a bystander who identified himself as a doctor from treating Ms. Good as she sat slumped and bleeding in her car. The ICE agent who shot her sped away shortly afterward, videos suggest. Mr. Trump quickly posted a misleading description of the confrontation on social media. Later that day, the F.B.I. barred state investigators from joining them in collecting and analyzing evidence from the scene.

Senior Trump officials accused Ms. Good of “domestic terrorism,” and the Justice Department made a mockery of itself by opening an investigation into Ms. Good and her partner for their political activism. At least 10 federal lawyers in Washington and Minnesota have since resigned or retired. Their response is honorable, although it leaves even fewer principled officials to stand up to future abuses.

The Justice Department was hardly perfect before Mr. Trump took the oath of office a year ago. Still, between Richard Nixon’s resignation in disgrace and Mr. Trump’s second term, the department under both political parties took steps to remain independent from the White House so that Americans could have confidence that federal law enforcement was nonpartisan. If the government investigated somebody — or decided not to — the reasonable assumption was that it was on the merits. That assumption is in tatters, as the events in Minneapolis demonstrate.

After hollowing out the functions of the federal government’s system of justice that ensure fairness and guard against misconduct, the Trump administration has turned what remains into the agent of Mr. Trump’s personal and political impulses. If you are on the president’s side, you will be protected and even pardoned of crimes. If you threaten his interests, you risk retribution from federal law enforcement.

On Sunday, Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said the Justice Department had served him with subpoenas in a bogus criminal investigation. The department claimed it was looking into whether he had misled Congress about the cost of renovations to the Fed’s headquarters, but he said he had provided exhaustive details to Congress and had the bank’s internal watchdog examine the construction costs. Mr. Trump’s real motive is obvious. He wants to replace the Fed’s leadership with officials who betray its tradition of independence from partisan politics and rapidly cut interest rates to goose the economy before midterm elections this year. The targeting of Mr. Powell, who will leave his role in May, serves to remind his successor that there is a cost to independence.

Three days after Mr. Powell’s announcement, federal agents took the extraordinary step of searching the home of Hannah Natanson, a reporter for The Washington Post, and seizing her phone as part of a leak investigation. This violates traditional government policy and appears designed to chill valuable reporting by making sources nervous about talking to journalists. Ms. Natanson had helped expose some of the negative consequences of the Trump administration’s policies.

The list of Trump critics and opponents who face or have faced legal action by the administration also includes another Fed governor, Lisa Cook; the former F.B.I. director James Comey; Attorney General Letitia James of New York; Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California; and Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California. This month Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would begin administrative proceedings against Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona — which could result in the reduction of Mr. Kelly’s military retirement rank and pension — after the senator participated in a video urging military service members to resist illegal orders. The five other Democratic lawmakers who participated in the video said they are also under federal investigation. On Monday, Mr. Kelly sued Mr. Hegseth and the Pentagon on free-speech grounds.

At the same time, a parade of actual criminals who curry Mr. Trump’s favor receive clemency, and investigations into suspicious behavior by his cronies are canceled or never opened. Many of the president’s uses of the pardon power seem partly aimed at diminishing confidence in legitimate past prosecutions — and trying to make previous administrations look as unethical as the current one.

Janet Yellen, a former Fed chair and Treasury secretary, summed up this inversion of the basic principles of American justice: “If you can bring charges for no reason whatsoever against your enemies, we’re no longer living in a society governed by the rule of law,” she said.

More than 200 of the department’s career lawyers have been fired, and thousands more have resigned. “I wouldn’t even call it the Justice Department anymore,” Dena Robinson, a lawyer who formerly worked in the civil rights division, said last year. “It’s become Trump’s personal law firm.”

The administration crossed another line last week when Vice President JD Vance announced that the White House would run an unnecessary new Justice Department division on fraud. The department already has an anti-fraud section, but it has been depleted by administration cutbacks; what’s different about this new division is that the White House controls it directly. The new outpost is particularly suspicious, given Mr. Trump’s loose and expedient definition of fraudulent behavior as occurring only in states run by Democrats. The announcement suggests it will be another piece of his partisan use of legal powers. For now, the new division is centered on the social-service fraud that has occurred in Minnesota, though he has his eyes on other Democratic states as well.

The Minnesota fraud is real, and the people who perpetrated it deserve to face charges. Many already have; one of the prosecutors who resigned Tuesday over the response to the ICE shooting had overseen the sprawling investigation. But Mr. Trump’s interest in fraud is selective, applying exclusively in jurisdictions that have opposed him. As KFF Health News reported, he gave pardons or commutations to at least 68 people convicted of fraud-related crimes during his first and second terms. And he fired or demoted more than 20 inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud.

As the second year of Mr. Trump’s second term begins next week, there are some modestly encouraging signs of resistance — but not nearly enough. Several Republicans in the House and Senate have said they do not believe Mr. Powell is a criminal, and Senator Thom Tillis said he would oppose the confirmation of any Fed governor until the investigation is concluded.

But the Republican Party has largely been a silent partner as its leader removes all sense of justice from the Justice Department. Some seem to grasp the danger to the economy of having Trump control the Fed, but they need to see the larger picture and grasp the danger to democracy of controlling law enforcement, too. On behalf of Americans who are now living without a functioning system of federal law and order, Congress should step up and end this self-interested destruction.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/opinion/17vengeance-editorial-image/17vengeance-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 01:58:09.869115

On Jan. 9, two days after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent’s shooting of Renee Good sent tensions in Minneapolis to a fever pitch, the Department of Homeland Security posted to social media an image of a man on a horse riding through a snowy, mountainous landscape with the words “We’ll have our home again.” That’s the chorus to a song about ousting a foreign presence by a self-described “folk-punk” band that the Proud Boys and other far-right and white supremacist groups have used.

The next day, the Department of Labor posted on X: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.” Several Trump critics on the social media site drew a parallel to a notorious Nazi slogan, “One People, One Realm, One Leader.”

And this past week, as President Donald Trump stepped up his pressure campaign to claim Greenland, the White House posted an image on X that showed a dog sled facing a fork in the trail, one that leads to an American flag and the White House and another that leads to the Russian and Chinese flags. Above the image was the phrase, “Which way, Greenland Man?”

The post refers to a meme that riffs off the title of a notorious white supremacist book titled “Which Way Western Man?” The administration had already used the framing in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruiting post last year, which asked, “Which way, American Man?”

The flurry of posts has renewed criticism about a recurring pattern in Trump’s second term — the sometimes cryptic use of imagery popular with the far right and white supremacists in the administration’s campaign to rally the nation behind its immigration crackdown, which it frames as a battle to preserve Western civilization.

Administration tells critics to ‘get a grip’

The administration says it’s tired of criticism that its messaging is framed around white supremacy or Nazi slogans.

“It seems that the mainstream media has become a meme of their own: The deranged leftist who claims everything they dislike must be Nazi propaganda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “This line of attack is boring and tired. Get a grip.”

Referring to the “We’ll Have Our Home Again” post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said it “was a reference to 20-plus million illegal aliens invading the country.”

“I don’t know where you guys are getting this stuff,” she added, “but it is absurd.”

César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University, said the administration’s references are a choice.

“You don’t have to dip into white supremacist sloganeering to promote immigration regulation,” he said, noting that former President Bill Clinton signed two bills toughening penalties on immigrants who were in the country illegally in the 1990s without doing so.

He added that the administration seems to calibrate its references.

“The imagery is not simply a reproduction of common white supremacist imagery or text, but a play on that imagery — and that gives them the breathing room they want,” Garcia Hernández said.

Trump won his second term with robust support from Latino voters and increased his backing among both Black and Asian voters, all while running on pledges of tough border enforcement and mass deportations.

Still, Trump for years has created enthusiasm among white supremacist groups, who see his nationalist and anti-immigrant stance as validating their own.

The president has complained that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and spoken favorably about white immigrants compared to other immigrants. In his first term, he bemoaned the number of immigrants coming from what he called “shithole countries” such as Haiti or ones in Africa, while wondering why the U.S. doesn’t draw more people from Norway. Last month, he called Somali immigrants “garbage.”

Trump changed immigration policy to favor whites in one area by shutting down the admission of refugees except for white South Africans, whom he contends, against evidence, are being discriminated against in their home country.

Online appeal for the far right

Some of Trump’s most prominent supporters have openly embraced the cause of white nationalists.

Elon Musk, who was Trump’s biggest donor during the 2024 presidential campaign and ran the president’s Department of Government Efficiency for the first part of last year, recirculated a user post on X, the social platform he owns, that called for “white solidarity” to prevent the mass murder of white men and added a “100” emoji indicating agreement.

The administration’s history has led to claims that it’s using white supremacist language even when there is no evidence for it.

In the aftermath of the Good shooting in Minnesota, a sign that appeared on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s lectern during a news conference — reading “One Of Ours, All Of Yours” — drew widespread attention on social media, with many commentators suggesting it was a Nazi phrase. The Southern Poverty Law Center, however, could not trace the words to any Nazi slogan.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said it was a reference to the subject of the press conference: “a CBP officer who was shot — he was one of our officers and all of the country’s federal law enforcement officer,” she wrote in an email.

Hannah Gais, a senior researcher with the SPLC, has long tracked white supremacist groups and said she thinks the administration knows what it’s doing with its messaging slogans.

“They know their base is this overly online right-winger who they know will go nuts if they say ‘Which Way, Western Man?’” Gais said. “I don’t think it’s a tenable strategy for the long term because the stuff is incomprehensible to most people. And if it is comprehensible, people don’t like it.”

Abigail Spanberger signed 10 executive actions that broadly targeted affordability and pushed the commonwealth away from former Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's approaches to education, immigration and race.

She also signed an action that delegates broad emergency and day-to-day authority to Bonnie Krenz-Schnurman, her longtime chief of staff, hours after taking Virginia's high office.

The orders also put the risks to Virginia's economy and budget posed by federal funding cuts from Congress and President Donald Trump in the public discussion more so than under the previous administration.

""Today, we are responding to the moment. We are setting the tone for what Virginians can expect over the next four years: pragmatic leadership focused on lowering costs and delivering results,"" said Spanberger in a statement.

While governors do not have the power to appropriate funds, Spanberger's executive orders also reflected her and top Democrats' apparent preference to avoid using Virginia's general fund to lower costs and raise wages, arguing that raising taxes is another cost for families.

Spanberger, who is also the first woman to be elected Virginia's governor, did not take questions from the press after signing all 10 actions.

The directives on affordability were to identify cost savings for families, which state-facilitated services are most at risk due to federal policies, and finding housing regulations that may be cut in order to spur new home and apartment construction.

The executive order named housing, health care, energy, education, child care and living expenses like groceries as areas of particular concern. Health care and identifying potential ways to loosen housing regulations got their own executive orders.

In the order on health care funding, Spanberger created an ""Interagency Health Financing Task Force"" to coordinate health care financing and sort out all the various funding risks posed by the congressional passage of HR1. Hundreds of thousands of Virginians are at risk of losing their health care or being priced out due to the bill's provisions.

It also includes a review of Managed Care Organizations, a key part of Medicaid services in the commonwealth. Recently, a forecast from the Department of Medical Assistance Services said that MCOs would need an additional $3.2 billion in state funds to maintain current services for the 1.6 million Virginians enrolled, according to December data from DMAS.

The underlying challenges for Spanberger and Virginia's tight spending plan, given rising education and health care costs, compound the limitations of state government according to Terry Clower, director of George Mason's Center for Regional Analysis.

""Saying that 'we are going to make affordability better for you in the short run' is really hard for government to do, and particularly state government,"" Clower told VPM News in an interview Friday.

Virginia normally conforms to federal tax law on a ""rolling"" basis, with some exceptions. However, state lawmakers paused that conformity in 2025 in light of the federal cuts to taxes that could have trickle-down effects on Virginia's tax collections — to the tune of billions of dollars.

Democrats said during the opening of the General Assembly session they would not look to conform to many of new federal tax law's provisions.

Spanberger directed Virginia's agencies to identify what risks the federal government's policies will have in one order. Clower noted that tariffs have an inflationary effect, immigration crackdowns could affect labor costs and availability, and jobs connected to the federal government are affected.

""We've also seen a trend now for professional business services jobs that are declining,"" he said. The effects ""are crossing different levels of households, so you're creating some pressures in the economy.""

Higher education governance also got special attention. Executive Order 6 requires recommendations for legislative or policy changes to how board of visitor members are appointed or selected. It follows tumult at University of Virginia (Spanberger's alma mater) and resignations of at least three board members shortly before Saturday's inauguration.

In the order's wording, Spanberger cited federal interference as the need for the changes: ""These pressures underscore the urgent need for the Commonwealth to reevaluate how governing boards are appointed, ensuring they are composed of individuals dedicated to upholding the quality, independence, and reputation of our institutions.""

That is but one of a few departures from the approach of Youngkin's administration to university governance.

The new governor's Day 1 EOs also give specific mention to diversity and opportunity. Executive Order 4 mentions ""inclusive"" education and closing ""opportunity gaps,"" while EO 9 tells agencies to take ""affirmative measures … to emphasize the recruitment of qualified minorities, women, disabled persons, and older Virginians to serve at all levels of state government.""

It heavily contrasts with the tone of Youngkin's administration, which praised the closure of DEI offices. In 2023 Martin D. Brown, Youngkin's chief diversity officer (whose title did not include the word ""equity""), declared that ""DEI is dead"" during a talk at Virginia Military Institute.

Spanberger also is rescinding a controversial executive order of Youngkin's that directed state and local law enforcement to pursue immigration-related enforcement duties. Executive Order 10 does not withdraw from existing 287(g) agreements, according to Spanberger Communications Director Libby Wiet.

It solely rescinds Youngkin's issued mandate — which directed Virginia's law enforcement agencies to become federally deputized for immigration enforcement and opened up Departments of Corrections facilities for immigrants' federal processing and detention.

Spanberger also issued orders that outline expanded powers for her chief of staff; Krenz-Schnurman has served as the newly installed governor's chief of staff since her first term in Congress.

Those EO- designated powers include budgetary and administrative roles (EO 8), as well as the limited ability to call forth the Virginia National Guard (EO 7) or declare a state of emergency if Spanberger is ""unable to be reached.""

Ugarte said that El Paso County will be entering into the warrant services officer model, which will check the federal system for inmates entering the El Paso County Jail to see if the individual has a warrant related to immigration and detain them.
""If we do immigration enforcement out in our community, that will create a divide between law enforcement and our community.
The sheriff told the El Paso Times that these new requirements could strain his already underfunded and short staffed office.
Fears in El Paso immigrant community Residents spent more than an hour asking Ugarte questions related to ICE operations in the county.","El Paso County Sheriff Oscar Ugarte met residents at a townhall meeting to explain an agreement to work with expanding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.

Dozens of residents attended the meeting on Saturday, Jan. 17, at the Socorro Ramírez Community Center in Sparks to hear Ugarte explain what will happen now that El Paso County is required by Texas state law to join the national 287(g) program to cooperate with ICE enforcement operations.

Ugarte explained that he was given three options for what type of agreement that his office could enter. Ugarte said that El Paso County will be entering into the warrant services officer model, which will check the federal system for inmates entering the El Paso County Jail to see if the individual has a warrant related to immigration and detain them.

""We picked this model because we believe that it will have the least affect on our community,"" Ugarte told residents. ""If we do immigration enforcement out in our community, that will create a divide between law enforcement and our community. We don't want that. We don't (want) our community to be scared.""

The townhall was organized by the Border Network for Human Rights, an El Paso-based immigrant advocacy group. There was no way for El Paso to avoid being forced to participate, Samantha Singleton, the policy director for the BNHR, told attendees, because the county could be sued if they do not ""comply.""

The county must now join the 287(g) program with ICE after SB 8 went into effect on Jan. 1. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bill into law in June 2025 requiring all counties that operate a jail or contracts with a private vendor to operate a jail in Texas to sign one of three types of agreements with ICE: the Warrant Service Officer, the Jail Enforcement Model and the Task Force Model.

Over 225 counties in Texas already have signed agreements with ICE, according to the ICE's 287(g) program website. Only one county in New Mexico is participating in the program, the Curry County Sheriff's Office in Clovis.

ICE agents already had access to inmates detained in the El Paso County Jail due to a 2017 law that required them to work with federal agents.

Ugarte — a first generation American and Democrat who just completed his first year in office as sheriff — expressed his opposition to being forced to sign any new agreement throughout the townhall. The sheriff told the El Paso Times that these new requirements could strain his already underfunded and short staffed office.

""As local law enforcement, we have enough issues to deal with already,"" Ugarte said following the event. ""We don't have the resources, we don't have the manpower, we don't have the budget. Do I believe that local law enforcement should be focused on federal immigration laws? Absolutely not.""

Fears in El Paso immigrant community

Residents spent more than an hour asking Ugarte questions related to ICE operations in the county.

The questions from residents ranged between how his office had received emergency calls reporting federal agents, how would his office address racial profiling and what to do if federal agents leave a child behind after detaining their guardians, among many other questions.

Ugarte said that any emergency calls will be treated as any other call, but if the person identifies themselves as a federal agent, there isn't much deputies can do. He requested that residents do not protest at a close distance and not interfere with federal agents. He also pointed out that these policies were the result of the 2024 elections, and reminded residents to show their anger through voting.

The questions reflected the concerns of many residents of the Borderland, many of whom are immigrants and still have loved one who cross the border regularly.

There is fear in the community, Alfredo Agüero, a resident of El Paso, said after the townhall. The 68-year-old U.S. citizen was born in Juárez and was one of about 20 people to ask a question of the sheriff, asking how can residents have confidence that these masked individuals are actual federal agents when they do not identify themselves or present identifications and how the community can have confidence in the sheriff.

The sheriff's answer that there was nothing he could do did not ease his concerns, he said.

""I feel like we are in the same spot,"" Agüero said. ""The answers we received is that they can do whatever they want. It is not fair.""","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/17/PTX1/88236521007-lt-sheriff-oscar-ugarte-10.JPG?crop=3999,2250,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-18 02:57:07.141749

A group of local unions in Minnesota, meanwhile, has endorsed a planned statewide economic blackout in response to ICE actions in the state.

The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, first announced its endorsement alongside other regional bodies on Friday.

""The Minnesota labor movement is united against the violent ICE occupation of our beloved cities that has directly impacted union members, our workplaces and our families,"" the group said in a press release.

Dozens of community, faith, and union groups are organizing the Day of Truth and Freedom, a call to action asking Minnesotans to avoid work, school, and shopping on January 23 to pause the economy. There will also be a rally and march in downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. local time.

""We will gather with family, neighbors, and community to show Minnesota's moral heart and economic power,"" organizers said in a Facebook post.

Organizers listed several demands, including that ICE leave Minnesota and that federal funding for ICE be scrapped in the upcoming congressional budget.

The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation told Business Insider that ICE's presence is disrupting residents' daily lives.

""Working people from across sectors — hospitality, healthcare, education, custodial, construction, public works — are being targeted,"" the group said in a statement.

Thousands of ICE officers have descended on Minnesota as part of Operation Metro Surge, launched on December 1. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release earlier this month that the operation was targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state.

""Under President Trump, we will expose and deliver accountability for the rampant fraud and criminality happening in Minnesota. You won't steal from Americans or break our laws and get away with it,"" she said.

The Trump administration has criticized cities like Minneapolis that have passed so-called ""sanctuary"" laws preventing city resources and police from supporting federal immigration agents. In a statement shared on Friday, the White House said sanctuary cities create ""a climate of hostility that endangers federal officers and incites violence."" Earlier in the week, the administration said it would cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.

Business Insider reached out to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House for comment.

Many residents, meanwhile, have criticized the tactics that federal agents are using to locate and detain individuals. Tensions in the state skyrocketed after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen from Minneapolis, on January 7, leading to a wave of protests and outcry.

Days after the shooting, Minnesota's attorney general filed a lawsuit on behalf of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the state against Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, seeking to end the operation.

""As a result of this surge, municipalities have been forced to divert local law enforcement resources away from their normal public safety duties, emergency responder resources have been strained, schools have been forced into lockdowns and closures, businesses have been forced to close, and the rights of Minnesotans have been violated time and time again,"" a press release from the Minnesota Attorney General's Office said.

Homeland Security said officers have arrested over 2,500 individuals during Operation Metro Surge so far.

A second ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that did not cause a fatality happened Wednesday night when a Venezuelan who ICE said had illegally entered the United States fled during a targeted traffic stop.

That man and two others assaulted the ICE officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, and the officer shot the primary suspect in the leg to end the attack.

This all comes after the Portland mayor confirmed to CBS13 that he was warned by someone at the federal level of a possible ramp up of enforcement.

Lisbon Street, a major hub for businesses in Lewiston, felt unusually quiet on Friday. The door to an African supermarket was locked, even though online it says they are open until 8 p.m. A sign on the door read, “ICE is coming. Be prepared.”

The owner of Soya on Lisbon Street in downtown Lewiston says right now, it’s rare to find stores like hers open.

She’s limiting her hours, but remaining open, so her customers can buy groceries.

“Some customer called me that they are going to come in to get something to eat because they are staying home,” she said.

Ever since the rumors of increased ICE enforcement, many shop owners on Lisbon Street are afraid to leave their homes.

The shop owner says she sought asylum in the U.S. several years ago. Now she’s worried about herself and her two children.

“They are afraid,” she said.

""Whether or not they are residents, visitors, federal agents. Anyone that comes into our state is subject to our laws,” Cumberland County District Attorney Jacqueline Sartoris said.

Sartoris sent a firm statement Friday to ICE, saying while they can't arrest federal agents, they will investigate any agent that breaks Maine law.

""We are all watching this and saying this is not appropriate and necessary,” Sartoris said.

I can thankfully report that, shortly after, our employee was released and is safe,” Hochman wrote.
Our employee is a dedicated public servant who serves the people of Los Angeles County with professionalism and integrity.","A Los Angeles County district attorney’s office employee was “wrongfully detained” by federal immigration agents on Friday, according to an internal e-mail obtained by The Times.

L.A. County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman called the incident “unacceptable” in an office-wide memo sent out on Friday evening.

“A member of our Office was wrongfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I can thankfully report that, shortly after, our employee was released and is safe,” Hochman wrote. “This incident is unacceptable. Our employee is a dedicated public servant who serves the people of Los Angeles County with professionalism and integrity. This troubling situation caused great distress to our colleague, our co-worker’s family, and our entire Office family.”

The reason for the person’s detention was not immediately clear. A spokesman for Hochman declined to comment further and referred questions to ICE. Representatives for ICE did not respond to inquiries from The Times. .

Two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the incident, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to talk candidly, said the employee was not a prosecutor. The employee was also not engaged in protest activity, the officials said.

In the e-mail, Hochman said he personally reached out to federal authorities on Friday to make them aware of the situation and “urge them to be more respectful of the rights of those who reside in our community and ensure this wrongful conduct does not occur again.”

In the months since ICE and Border Patrol agents began carrying out President Trump’s sweeping immigration raids in U.S. cities, civil liberties groups have repeatedly sued the Department of Justice alleging agents are making stops based on race rather than reasonable suspicion.

After ICE and Border Patrol agents spent months raiding car washes and Home Depot parking lots around L.A. County, a federal judge in October found sufficient evidence that agents were violating the 4th Amendment by relying on the race, language and vocation of targeted individuals to form “reasonable suspicion” for arrest.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d131c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7929x4163+0+548/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8d%2Fe7%2F73c28b53419a828579bb0b64f29b%2F1511530-me-nathan-hochman-portrait-cmh-05.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 21:58:13.619836

Crowds began to gather, and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.","MINNEAPOLIS(AP) — Work starts around sunrise for many of the federal officers carrying out the immigration crackdown in and around the Twin Cities, with hundreds of people in tactical gear emerging from a bland office building near the main airport.

Within minutes, hulking SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans begin leaving, forming the unmarked convoys that have quickly become feared and common sights in the streets of Minneapolis, St. Paul and their suburbs.

Protesters also arrive early, braving the cold to stand across the street from the fenced-in federal compound, which houses an immigration court and government offices. “Go home!” they shout as convoys roar past. ""ICE out!”

Things often turn uglier after nightfall, when the convoys return and the protesters sometimes grow angrier, shaking fences and occasionally smacking passing cars. Eventually, the federal officers march toward them, firing tear gas and flash grenades before hauling away at least a few people.

“We’re not going anywhere!” a woman shouted on a recent morning. “We’re here until you leave.”

This is the daily rhythm of Operation Metro Surge, the Trump administration's latest and biggest crackdown yet, with more than 2,000 officers taking part. The surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, sparked daily clashes between activists and immigration officers in the deeply liberal cities, and left a mother of three dead.

The crackdown is barely noticeable in some areas, particularly in whiter, wealthier neighborhoods and suburbs, where convoys and tear gas are rare. And even in neighborhoods where masked immigration officers are common, they often move with ghostlike quickness, making arrests and disappearing before protesters can gather in force.

Still, the surge can be felt across broad swaths of the Twin Cities area, which is home to more than 3 million people.

“We don’t use the word ‘invasion’ lightly,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told reporters this week, noting that his police force has just 600 officers. “What we are seeing is thousands — plural, thousands — of federal agents coming into our city.”

Those agents have an outsized presence in a small city.

It can take hours to drive across Los Angeles and Chicago, both targets of Trump administration crackdowns. It can take 15 minutes to cross Minneapolis.

So as worry ripples through the region, children are skipping school or learning remotely, families are avoiding religious services and many businesses, especially in immigrant neighborhoods, have closed temporarily.

Drive down Lake Street, an immigrant hub since the days when newcomers came to Minneapolis from Norway and Sweden, and the sidewalks now seem crowded only with activists standing watch, ready to blow warning whistles at the first sign of a convoy.

At La Michoacana Purepecha, where customers can order ice cream, chocolate covered bananas and pork rinds, the door is locked and staff let in people one at a time. Nearby, at Taqueria Los Ocampo, a sign in English and Spanish says the restaurant is temporarily closed because of “current conditions.”

A dozen blocks away at the Karmel Mall, where the city’s large Somali community goes for everything from food and coffee to tax preparation, signs on the doors warn, “No ICE enter without court order.”

The shadow of George Floyd

It’s been nearly six years since George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, but the scars from that killing remain raw.

Floyd was killed just blocks from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, during a Jan. 7 confrontation after she stopped to help neighbors during an enforcement operation. Federal officials say the officer fired in self-defense after Good “weaponized” her vehicle. City and state officials dismiss those explanations and point to multiple bystander videos of the confrontation.

For Twin Cities residents, the crackdown can feel overwhelming.

“Enough is enough,” said Johan Baumeister, who came to the scene of Good’s death soon after the shooting to lay flowers.

He said he didn’t want to see the violent protests that shook Minneapolis after Floyd’s death, causing billions of dollars in damage. But this city has a long history of activism and protests, and he had no doubt there would be more.

“I think they’ll see Minneapolis show our rage again,” he predicted.

He was right.

In the days since, there have been repeated confrontations between activists and immigration officers. Most amounted to little more than shouted insults and taunting, with destruction mostly limited to broken windows, graffiti and some badly damaged federal vehicles.

But angry clashes now flare regularly across the Twin Cities. Some protesters clearly want to provoke the federal officers, throwing snowballs at them or screaming obscenities through bullhorns from just a couple feet away. The serious force, though, comes from immigration officers, who have broken car windows, pepper-sprayed protesters and warned observers not to follow them through the streets. Immigrants and citizens have been yanked from cars and homes and detained, sometimes for days. And most clashes end in tear gas.

Drivers in Minneapolis or St. Paul can now stumble across intersections blocked by men in body armor and gas masks, with helicopters clattering overhead and the air filled with the shriek of protesters' whistles.

Shovel your neighbor’s walk

In a state that prides itself on its decency, there’s something particularly Minnesotan about the protests,

Soon after Good was shot, Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat and regular Trump target, repeatedly said he was angry but also urged people to find ways to help their communities.

“It might be shoveling your neighbor’s walk,” he said. “It might mean being at a food bank. It might be pausing to talk to someone you haven’t talked to before.”

He and other leaders have pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, warning that the White House was looking for a chance to crack down harder.

And when protests do become clashes, residents will often spill from their homes, handing out bottled water so people can flush tear gas from their eyes.

Residents stand watch at schools to warn immigrant parents if convoys approach while they're picking up their children. They take care packages to people too afraid to go out, and arrange rides for them to work and doctor's visits.

On Thursday, in the basement of a Lutheran church in St. Paul, the group Open Market MN assembled food packs for more than a hundred families staying home. Colin Anderson, the group’s outreach director, said the group has seen a surge in requests.

Sometimes, people don’t even understand what has happened to them.

Like Christian Molina from suburban Coon Rapids, who was driving through a Minneapolis neighborhood on a recent day, taking his car to a mechanic, when immigration officers began following him. He wonders if it's because he looks Hispanic.

They turned on their siren, but Molina kept driving, unsure who they were.

Eventually, the officers sped up, hit his rear bumper and both cars stopped. Two emerged and asked Molina for his papers. He refused, saying he’d wait for the police. Crowds began to gather, and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.

So the officers left.

They left behind an angry, worried man who suddenly owned a sedan with a mangled rear fender.

Long after the officers were gone he had one final question.

“Who’s going to pay for my car?”

On Thursday afternoon, about two dozen adults lined the perimeter of Green Central Elementary School in central Minneapolis, just blocks from where Good was killed.
On Friday afternoon, he drove around Riverview Elementary School on Minneapolis’ west side — which has a large Latino population — watching sites he said have become flashpoints in recent weeks.
St. Paul Public Schools expressed gratitude for the “care and concern” from the community but noted the patrols are being organized independently.
The patrols in Minneapolis mirror tactics that have emerged in other Democratic-run cities amid stepped-up immigration enforcement.","MINNEAPOLIS — Standing outside his son’s elementary school, a father heard a warning crackle over his walkie-talkie: a suspicious car nearby.

At another school, volunteer Joe Dirkswager stood watch, nodding at passing vehicles. Miles away in St. Paul, Matthew Kearns was questioning unfamiliar individuals near the school he graduated from decades ago.

The three are among the volunteers who have begun patrolling streets around elementary and high schools in the Twin Cities, using walkie-talkies, Signal group chats and whistles to warn families and school staff of immigration enforcement activities. The informal patrols have emerged amid a sharp surge of federal immigration personnel in Minnesota and the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer last week.

On Thursday afternoon, about two dozen adults lined the perimeter of Green Central Elementary School in central Minneapolis, just blocks from where Good was killed. Patrol volunteers scanned nearby streets and relayed updates in real time.

The father, Greg, a 42-year-old who asked that his last name not be published because of safety concerns for his family, said the patrols have forced families into impossible decisions on a daily basis.

“Every morning I feel like I’m forced with the choice of ‘Do I try to do patrol to protect my daughter and her preschool or do I come to my son’s kindergarten to do patrol here?’” he asked.

“Those are the kind of choices that the community is being faced with.”

Greg and eight other volunteers who spoke with NBC News said the patrols are especially aimed at protecting parents and school staff who are not U.S. citizens and fear being detained while coming and going from schools.

More than 3,000 federal immigration personnel have descended on Minnesota in recent weeks, and more than 2,500 undocumented immigrants have been apprehended in Minneapolis since November, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The enforcement push — dubbed Operation Metro Surge — follows renewed scrutiny of a state fraud investigation involving a number of individuals of Somali descent, a link that community leaders say has fueled fear beyond those accused.

The heightened enforcement has coincided with clashes between teachers, parents and federal law enforcement officers.

On Wednesday, a parent was detained by ICE at a school bus stop in Robbinsdale, a Minneapolis suburb, according to a statement from Robbinsdale Area Schools Superintendent Teri Staloch. And last week, on the day Good was killed, U.S. Border Patrol agents clashed with teachers and protesters at the nearby Roosevelt High School. At least one educator was detained and released, according to the teachers union.

In response to the disruptions, the Minneapolis Public School District said last week it would offer online classes to its roughly 30,000 students until Feb. 12. St. Paul Public Schools, which serves more than 30,000 students, said Thursday it would offer a similar online option and will close school several days next week to prepare.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children,” and that “criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest.”

“Our officers are highly trained and in the face of rioting, doxxing, and physical attacks, they have shown professionalism,” she added. “They are not afraid of loud noises and whistles.”

Bearing witness

Kearns, 56, said the heightened enforcement has been visible beyond the schools where organized patrols first appeared. On Friday afternoon, he drove around Riverview Elementary School on Minneapolis’ west side — which has a large Latino population — watching sites he said have become flashpoints in recent weeks.

“We have basically a Gestapo coming in and infiltrating our neighborhood and just doing whatever they feel like they want to do,” he said.

The sightings pushed Kearns to begin patrolling the area around his former school.

“I grew up, born and raised here, went to this school, played football here, kissed my wife when I was a little boy,” he said, pointing to a field on the school’s property. “We protect our kids in our community. I mean, that’s what every other community would do in this situation or any situation.”

As NBC News spoke with Kearns, a handful of volunteers — most of them parents — watched nearby. Several appeared visibly shaken, declining to discuss how the patrols were organized or how volunteers communicate, citing safety concerns about publicizing their plans. St. Paul Public Schools expressed gratitude for the “care and concern” from the community but noted the patrols are being organized independently. The Minneapolis Public School District did not immediately return a request for comment.

The patrols in Minneapolis mirror tactics that have emerged in other Democratic-run cities amid stepped-up immigration enforcement. In recent months, volunteers in cities including Chicago and Los Angeles have deployed similar patrols.

Leah Hood, 42, an instructor at a nearby university, said she started patrolling Green Central Elementary School this week after hearing from her friends who were already volunteering. She said the presence of observers feels crucial in a moment when families fear encounters could happen without witnesses.

“I mean, how horrifying that you would be kidnapped off the street while coming and going from school at all?” she asked. “But how much more horrifying and terrifying is it to think that that could happen and no one would see it, and no one would be able to attest to the fact that this is real, and they did this to you?”

Hood pointed to directives from state and local officials in recent days. Prosecutors have asked the public to submit videos related to Good’s killing, as much of the evidence gathered by the FBI remains inaccessible to local authorities. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this week encouraged Minnesotans to “peacefully film ICE agents as they conduct their activities.”

Kids scared and confused

Parents and teachers who spoke with NBC News said children have been fearful and confused amid the heightened enforcement.

Desiree, who has patrolled Green Central Elementary School for weeks and asked that her last name not be published due to safety concerns, said her son has repeatedly asked about law enforcement sightings nearby.

“It’s not a mystery to them that something terrible is happening and that it’s happening right around them,” she said.

Greg said the community, shaped by past trauma over George Floyd’s killing, has responded with solidarity.

“You get on this corner and all day long it’s just cars passing by, and everyone’s waving and saying ‘thank you’ because we’re all looking out for each other,” he said.

Dirkswager, 38, said the events last week compelled him to patrol Bancroft Elementary School in the Central neighborhood of Minneapolis, blocks away from where Floyd was murdered in 2020.

“The events last week pushed me to the point where I had to get outside and do something — even if it’s just standing on a corner and blowing my silly little whistle at federal agents that are driving by,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260116-minneapolis-Joe-Dirkswager-mn-2237-66403f.jpg",N,,2026-01-17 19:57:59.151012

Last week, a man previously arrested by ICE outside the Portsmouth Police Department was due in Newport Superior Court but did not show up.

Advocates say ICE agents were outside court on that day as well.

The arrest was caught on surveillance cameras outside the station and released to the public from Portsmouth police.

A warrant for the arrest of 29-year-old Josue Perez Gomez was later issued.

Across the country, some immigrants have been skipping their court hearings out of fear that ICE agents will arrest and detain them.

""I've had some that don't want to pursue claims because they would have to show up at court,"" Dennis said when asked if he has clients who are concerned about showing up to court out of fear of ICE agents.

Advocates are asking the Rhode Island court system to allow people to hold their hearings virtually so that they don’t have to worry about showing up at court and finding ICE there to detain them.

""They have an absolute right to be heard in these proceedings. In workers' comp cases we don't make a distinction whether you're a documented or an undocumented. So they're entitled to it,"" Dennis said. ""I think it's ridiculous and immature that we don't allow it.""

Some Rhode Island Republicans are staunchly against the idea of virtual court hearings.

""For me that would feel a bit obstructionist for the judiciary to do that,"" Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz said.

""It's not just bad policy. It's deliberate. It's dangerous. And it's a calculated attempt to shield criminal illegal aliens from deportation,"" Anthony d'Ellena said.

""These people have nothing to fear if they're here legally,"" he said when asked about ICE agents detaining immigrants with legal status. ""If you're here illegally, you deserve to be deported. You broke the law coming into this country and you need to leave.""

The discussion around state immigration policy comes as there are renewed concerns about federal funding being withheld from Rhode Island.

In August, the Department of Justice released a memo threatening to cut off federal funding from ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" who they ""identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

Rhode Island is on the list.

""I certainly don't think that the administration would look at the judiciary here in Rhode Island and say, oh, well, that's okay. They would look at it just the same as the cities and towns who count themselves as sanctuary cities,"" de la Cruz said. ""It's like you know, don't play cute games. The administration has said if you try to obstruct us we will halt funding and if we don't want funding halted to our state then we need to comply with federal law.""

""Rhode Island refuses to follow federal law and should not receive a dime federal funding if we do not comply,"" D'Ellena said, adding, ""President Trump's Feb. 1st cut off on funding to sanctuary states is exactly what we need"" to compel the Rhode Island state legislature to adjust the state's sanctuary city policies.

""Rhode Islanders pay federal taxes to participate in federal programs, and we fully expect those dollars to flow back to Rhode Island through those federal programs,"" Gov.

Anti-ICE protesters force back small group of far-right activists

No injuries reported, but influencer says vest blocked stabbing attempt

Thousands of ICE agents deployed to Minneapolis

MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many immigrants live on Saturday, stoking tensions in a city on edge after the killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent 10 days ago.

Waving signs and screaming chants that called for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to leave Minneapolis, the anti-ICE protesters gathered downtown near City Hall. Scores of them moved forward, forcing about 10 far-right demonstrators against the outside of the municipal government center within minutes. Some in the crowd tossed water balloons that soaked the right-wing demonstrators as temperatures hit -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 Celsius) with the wind chill.

Police maintained their distance as the dueling protests played out. About an hour after the rallies began, the tiny contingent of right-wing activists quickly walked a few blocks away to a hotel, hounded by hundreds of anti-ICE protesters who screamed obscenities and told them to get out of the city. A few scuffles broke out, but Reuters did not observe any serious violence.

ONLINE INFLUENCER REPORTS STABBING ATTEMPT

Jake Lang, an online right-wing influencer and one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, organized what he called an “anti-fraud” rally. At no point could Lang's voice be heard by the crowd.

Later, Lang posted on X that he was stabbed during a scuffle but that his protective vest blocked the attempt. Reuters could not verify his account.

Minneapolis police said in an email to Reuters they were aware of Lang's social media post, but no official report had been filed with the department. Police had received no reports of injuries related to the protests from victims.

Camera feeds showed some people who appeared to be injured, police said, but those individuals left before officers could contact them.

The anti-ICE protest was organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump.

Trump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota. The president and administration officials have repeatedly singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants.

""We're here to support our Somali neighbors; they asked for their white allies to show up for them,"" said Laura, 56, who, like all protesters interviewed, asked that their last name not be used for fear of retribution by the federal government. ""I'm here to exercise my First Amendment right because my neighbors can't, they're too afraid to leave their house.""

Lang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure the U.S. for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week and has targeted Somali immigrants, most of whom are Muslim.

Some 3,000 agents from ICE and Border Patrol have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, after she drove away after being ordered by ICE agents to exit her vehicle. The officer who shot Good was positioned in front of her car on the left. DHS has said he was hit by the car and feared for his life, though videos show the agent remaining on his feet and raise questions about how much contact the car made with him.

The situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

This accountability led to the numerous videos that captured the moment when ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week, sparking a nationwide outpouring of anger and grief.

Good had been monitoring an elementary school as students were being dropped off before Ross stepped in front of her vehicle and shot her. Human and civil rights advocates who spoke to Salon have called this a classic example of law enforcement foisting on their victim a “deadly dilemma,” forcing the person to appear as aggressive or insubordinate and giving agents an excuse to react violently.

Before Good’s death, other civilians across the country who were recording or watching ICE had been threatened, physically assaulted and arrested, amplifying the sense among critics that ICE officers, the broader law enforcement establishment and the Trump administration view themselves as above the law and capable of getting away with it.

Nevertheless, critics say that ICE, Customs and Border Protection and other institutions have followed a similar playbook used by police states, maintaining the thinnest pretexts to justify their behavior in a way that gives, in theory, plausible deniability, and signals to critics that they’re too powerful to need a perfect alibi.

“They typically cite these vague concepts of obstruction, interference with an investigation, incitement in protest cases, entirely inapplicable statutes, presumably to sound official,” Seth Stern, advocacy director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Salon. “Let’s say somebody is following an ICE vehicle to record what the officers are doing, which does not actually fall under a stalking statute, to state the obvious. It is not stalking to follow a law enforcement officer to document what they’re up to — that’s constitutionally protected conduct. But more often than not, ICE officials on the ground, and higher-ups alike, will cite those loose concepts to intimidate and later justify their actions on social media or unofficial statements.”

“If anything, I’ve seen people reaffirm their commitment to continue documenting ICE and CBP activity because they see it as an essential form of holding on to whatever justice and democracy still exists.”

Federal court rulings have reaffirmed the right of citizens to observe and record police activity in public areas under the First Amendment. Civilians with little knowledge of statutes and court rulings or experience in dealing with law enforcement have proven, in many documented cases, to be fairly resilient against those kinds of tactics. But generally, they still operate with fewer defenses than professional journalists, and might, due to uncertainty over repercussions, put away their camera or delete their footage when confronted by an armed officer.

Organizations like Carolina Migrant Network and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) have been working to not only educate people about their rights when filming or watching ICE agents, but train them on how to effectively document the evidence while avoiding personal injury and unlawful arrest.

In one video, LULAC advises recorders to keep their camera focused on agents rather than their victims, verbally narrate the facts, strategically capture key information like badges and street signs, and potentially limited themselves to note-taking and other support roles while someone less at risk handles the recording. While some people might find themselves as unexpected witnesses of an ICE raid, other volunteers, such as those working with the Carolina Migrant Network, have formed or joined rapid-response text groups to coordinate movement and to be able to arrive on-site soon after an alert goes out.

“What happened in Minneapolis could have happened here in Charlotte, could have happened in Chicago, could have happened anywhere. It wasn’t shocking to folks who have been doing the work for a long time, because they’ve witnessed firsthand what ICE is capable of doing,” Stefania Arteaga, co-founder and co-director of the Carolina Migrant Network, told Salon. “If anything, I’ve seen people reaffirm their commitment to continue documenting ICE and CBP activity because they see it as an essential form of holding on to whatever justice and democracy still exists.”

The widespread protests over Good’s death are an example of just how far people have been pushed, but Arteaga expressed her wish that such outrage could be found earlier.

“There was a prevailing attitude that everything was good and dandy again until we found ourselves once again under a Trump administration where we’re being forced to confront the history of the United States and their treatment of immigrants and other minority groups,” she said. “More than before, white America is reckoning with the fact that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security didn’t start under Trump. But the fact that it took this long really shows the lack of humanity that is given to immigrants, immigrant voices, immigrant stories and immigrant life.”

During the Obama and Biden administrations and the first Trump administration, ICE used family separation, raids and physical and verbal aggression against immigrants, but were more prone to brush off witnesses as mere annoyances. The second Trump administration has overseen a marked increase in permissibility for particularly brazen actions, with the Department of Homeland Security making it official policy to prosecute those who videotape ICE agents and post the content on social media. While federal courts have usually ruled against newer or intensified ICE policy as unconstitutional or in violation of existing statutes, ICE has found ways to continue forcefully handling any perceived threats to their mission.

In the case of Good, ICE has maintained the narrative that they were acting in self-defense, even though they had surrounded her vehicle and threatened her before she attempted to drive away. The tactics ICE used against Good are recognizable across the country against people who may have narrowly avoided her fate. Sometimes, agents would issue contradictory orders which would force someone to risk serious danger either way; other times, they might trap cars, snatch people’s phones, and otherwise escalate the intensity of a confrontation, hoping, critics say, to make their victim panic.

“I had a scenario where an agent called the police on me. They are intentionally trying to frame the situation in ways that are completely disingenuous,” Arteaga recalled.

Meanwhile, state legislatures across the country have passed bills designed to codify limitations on the ability of civilians to hold ICE and law enforcement accountable. One popular proposal has been to ban recording police activity within a certain distance — usually around 25 feet. Those laws, which go far beyond punishing actual obstruction and interference, have largely been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. As with the earlier court rulings that reaffirmed the right to record ICE agents, however, those decisions provided little deterrent for them to use a thin pretext to target immigrants and neighborhood volunteers.

“Law enforcement agencies are all public institutions, and allowing the wider public to see what they’re doing and potentially object to what they’re doing and recognize that what they’re doing is wrong is not legally actionable interference,” Stern said. “That’s the purpose of good journalism, to expose wrongdoing and alert the public that their officials are not behaving as they should.”

“To the extent that officers consider journalism in and of itself to be obstruction,” he continued, “those are probably officers who should be obstructed.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2026/01/ice-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-GettyImages-2255783416.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:08.166633

This year threatens to be the one that makes or breaks the unique moral commitment to human rights that has underpinned, even when flawed, the global order for the past 80 years.

Instead, the message sent around the world by bombastic leaders, acted out by mobs, armies and militias and embedded into the technology that shapes daily life, is that some people are less than human, deserve less empathy, compassion, opportunity or even physical safety.

This is potentially even more dangerous than the implosion of the “international rules-based order”. It normalises heinous behaviour towards other human beings in a world that has never had greater capacity for self-destruction.

You hear it everywhere. The tone is set when the US President declares some people are scum or a Cameroonian “freedom fighter” succinctly says his opponents, “don’t see us as human. Likewise we don’t see them as [human]”.

Australia, thanks to the work of Labor party leader Doc Evatt, was one of the midwives of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But Australia remains the only liberal democracy not to have adopted its own constitutional or statutory bill of rights. Instead there is a patchwork of local laws and international agreements.

For all the talk about Australian values this absence is a telling reminder of the fragility of our rights as citizens and human beings.

This has come into sharp focus in the debate after the Bondi attack, and the implosion of the Adelaide writers’ week.

In the rush to blame, the principle is lost. When the threat feels existential, pluralism is attacked and tolerance as a virtue derided.

The Australian commitment to human rights is always subject to political whim. Legislation protecting rights has been voided to allow racially charged laws to pass, including the Northern Territory intervention. States that have legislated to recognise rights, readily vacate the legislation to remove them from some groups – most frequently First Nations people.

After years of work, legislation asserting the rights of artists – something that had been promised in the last South Australian election campaign – was introduced in 2025. But the parliament ran out of time to pass it. Among the principles outlined in the bill was that “all artists, makers and creatives in South Australia have the right to freedom of artistic and creative expression.” If this had been enacted, would it have changed the ground rules, and meant the conundrum played out differently?

Last year, in recognition of the increasing fragility of the international commitment to human rights, the government appointed former attorney general and sitting MP Mark Dreyfus as an International Human Rights envoy.

It would be good if he started his advocacy at home.

Given that the consensus is that Australian constitutional change is just too hard, a statutory bill of rights could have symbolic as well as practical impact. It would also strengthen Australian advocacy in a world where human rights are increasingly derided.

This is not just a legal debate: human rights and empathy touch everything.

In the tick-box world mediated by AI, it is likely to become even more pervasive. We know that the selection biases of technology are increasingly excluding people, ensuring that the world order as it exists in the minds of technocrats is imposed on us all. They generally don’t do empathy or pay attention to people not like them.

Much of the time we can work around this, but sometimes it is accentuated.

Over the summer break I had two experiences that threw this into stark relief. Not the grand infringements of human rights that capture the headlines, but mundane encounters that point to the banal cruelty of a data-driven world in which empathy has evaporated and shades of grey no longer exist.

In response to one of those slightly threatening Robodebt-inflected Centrelink letters I waited until I had the time to sit on a call – last time it took three hours – and was pleasantly surprised that after 38 minutes a human answered.

I provided the required case number and then said, “But the person has died.”

The operator proceeded, “Can you spell his name again … and the birth date … the reference number.” I did this, and then added, “I know you are working to a script, but when someone tells you the client has died, it would be appropriate to pass on your condolences.”

“Oh yes,” he replied, “You are right. I am working to a script, we don’t have that option.”

“Well in the interests of training and quality control I hope this call is recorded and that is fixed,” I said.

“I’m sorry,” the operator replied, and without missing a beat we continued to populate the form with the details the script required.

A few weeks earlier a brilliant young colleague, educated to the highest level in the Stem disciplines, said with unnerving clarity when discussing whether to appeal a questionable driving fine: “I don’t like to rely on human intervention.”

If we give up on human intervention, the technocrats have won. There will be even less room for human rights in the world they are crafting in the name of efficiency and profit, under a cover of bombastic rhetoric. It’s not a fight we can afford to lose.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e848919432d279e7f9dc018c50d5274afb17b49/0_0_3804_3044/master/3804.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7063f166142a8219f493d8d1ad6460c4",N,,2026-01-17 17:57:12.441872

Read more of Campbell’s analysis on federal agents’ powers here.","Minneapolis has seen tense demonstrations against the Trump administration’s deployment of federal agents to the city for an immigration crackdown, raising questions about what these officers can do on the ground and how President Donald Trump can respond.

As protests escalated following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, the Trump administration defended the agent and doubled down on its efforts in the Minneapolis area, sending in more resources.

Trump has also threatened to the extreme step of invoking the Insurrection Act to clamp down on the protests and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has suggested people may be asked to “validate their identity” in some cases.

Here are some of the most common questions, answered.

What is the Insurrection Act?

The law that Trump is threatening to invoke would allow him to deploy active-duty US troops to Minnesota as “necessary to enforce (US) laws or to suppress the rebellion.”

The law says the president can send troops to control situations they consider to be “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States.”

A state governor or legislature can also request troops — as was the case the last time the law was invoked in 1992 — but Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has openly rebuked the surge of federal activity in Minneapolis.

There is precedent of a president invoking the act without the support of a governor.

Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy both invoked the Insurrection Act against the wishes of governors in order to facilitate school integration after the Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling.

On Friday, Trump said there’s no reason to use the Insurrection Act “right now,” but that he’d invoke the law if he felt it were necessary.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it. It’s very powerful,” the president told reporters.

Read CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf’s analysis of the Insurrection Act here.

What authority has the Trump administration given to federal agents?

Immigration agents can use deadly force against someone who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, according to a DHS policy. Historically, federal law enforcement agencies have spent weeks or even months conducting exhaustive investigations before deciding whether an agent’s use of force was appropriate.

But Trump administration officials have rushed to offer full-throated defenses of immigration agents after high-profile use of force, raising questions about whether mechanisms meant to hold law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing have been abandoned in Trump’s second term, writes CNN’s Josh Campbell.

The administration has argued agents are immune to prosecution by state or local officials. And any federal prosecutions seem unlikely, Campbell writes, due to Trump’s installation of political loyalists atop the Justice Department and FBI.

In August, during the federal takeover of the Washington, DC, police department, Trump effectively gave law enforcement a green light to use force that may far outpace the severity of the circumstances, according to Campbell.

While lamenting images he claimed to have seen showing protesters spitting on officers, Trump said in August, “I said, ‘You tell them, “You spit, and we hit,”’ and they can hit real hard,” Trump said. “And they’re standing there, and people are spitting in their face, and they’re not allowed to do anything.”

“But now,” he added, “they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”

A similar carte blanche signal is being sent to ICE officers and other federal agencies assisting in Trump’s immigration crackdown, DOJ insiders have told CNN.

Can federal agents ask to see proof of citizenship?

Noem said Thursday that federal agents may also ask people around someone they’re targeting to “validate their identity.”

“If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they’re there, and having them validate their identity,” Noem said. “That’s what we’ve always done.”

Is this legal? CNN’s senior legal analyst Elie Honig said, “It’s illegal and it’s unconstitutional to require people to show their citizenship papers without some other basis to make a stop.”

“What you cannot do is just go arbitrarily up to people or set up a checkpoint or go door to door and say, ‘Hey, you need to prove to us that you’re a US citizen,’” Honig added. “The immigration officer needs to have some reasonable suspicion. You cannot just arbitrarily approach people and make them prove that they are in fact here legally.”

Cori Alonso-Yoder, an associate professor at University of Maryland law school, told CNN federal agents can ask for proof of citizenship, but people can resist showing their documents under the Fifth Amendment.

“ICE certainly can ask and then the question is, then, how does an individual in that circumstance respond,” Yoder, who is also the director of the law school’s immigration clinic, said. “Because there are protections under the Fifth Amendment, regardless of immigration status, to not incriminate oneself or to again assert one’s right to remain silent when engaging with law enforcement.”

What is the 10th Amendment, which Minnesota has invoked to block federal agents?

On Monday, Minnesota filed a lawsuit seeking to curb the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown in the state, arguing that it violates the 10th Amendment.

Illinois has also filed a similar lawsuit.

Michele Goodwin, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University, told CNN the 10th Amendment established that states retain sovereign power to make local laws and govern within their borders, and the federal government cannot impose its will over a state, unless that authority has been granted by Congress or the Constitution.

In its lawsuit, Minnesota emphasized strains on local police resources, asserting that Minneapolis and Saint Paul have been forced to divert officers from their usual duties to respond to incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, undermining local efforts to protect the community.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said earlier this week that the state’s lawsuit is aimed squarely at what he described as unlawful federal overreach, not at blocking immigration enforcement itself.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2255776689.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-17 17:57:40.243693

Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer.","A federal judge gave a significant victory to Minnesota protesters and observers of federal officers Friday, granting a preliminary injunction preventing the officers from retaliating against demonstrators.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting or detaining people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of 3,000 immigration officers and agents here. The Reformer talked to a protester who was detained for hours on Sunday and never charged.

The federal agents can no longer use pepper spray or other nonlethal munitions against people engaged in peaceful protest. They cannot stop or detain drivers where there is no “reasonable, articulable suspicion” that they are interfering.

ICE observers are frequently following cars they suspect are being driven by federal officers, tracking them, entering vehicle descriptions into a database and discouraging them from making immigrant arrests. The judge declared this legal and a protected activity: “The act of safely following (federal agents) at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop.”

The ruling comes out of a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU.

The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community.

Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs, pulled up to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer.

“I was genuinely afraid I was being kidnapped,” Tincher said at a press conference last year.

The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_661-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 18:58:10.364417

Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals. We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” – Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” April 16, 1963

""Sometimes, we were learning, we had to hold hands and walk forward into the darkness, even when we didn't know what the next step would bring. Walking by faith wasn't easy. But it was taking us places where the rules of organizing had not allowed us to go. No one knew just what we were becoming, but we knew one thing for sure: there was no turning back.""

— Rev. Willam J. Barber, The Third Reconstruction

“I have told the clergy…that we may be entering into that same witness. And I've asked them to get their affairs in order—to make sure they have their wills written, because it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us with our bodies to stand between the powers of this world and the most vulnerable. And it may mean that we are going to have to act in a new way…to put our faith in the God of life, of resurrection, of a love that is stronger than death itself.” – Bishop Rob Hirschfeld, Episcopal Diocese of NH, at a Concord vigil for Renee Nicole Good, January 9, 2026

January 17, 2026

Welcome to Martin Luther King weekend! Let us ground ourselves in the wisdom, courage and examples – past and present – of nonviolent and life-affirming movements for justice and peace. It will be nourishment for our spirits to be together at one or more of the many MLK community celebrations throughout the state. Here’s a good list (NHPR), and scroll down to the Events section for some highlights. We thank our friend Arnie Alpert for sharing the story with the NH Center for Justice & Equity of how NH people organized over decades (!) to establish this important holiday.

Read more about the statewide MLK Coalition’s celebration on Monday, January 19 in Manchester, where former NH Senator Melanie Levesque will receive the Martin Luther King award for her tireless leadership for voting rights, public education, and racial justice (read more here). NH Representative Alice Wade, a courageous champion for the rights of transgender people and civil rights for all, will receive the Vanessa Johnson Youth Award.

We were sad to learn last week of the passing of Claudette Colvin at the age of 86. At 15 years old, and already a student of active nonviolence, Claudette refused to give up her seat on the bus, nine months before Rosa Parks’ act of dignified defiance would launch the Montgomery bus boycott. “I felt like Sojourner Truth was pushing down on one shoulder and Harriet Tubman was pushing down on the other – saying. ‘Sit down girl!’ I was glued to my seat.” Read more about Claudette here. We at AFSC-NH have fond memories of welcoming Claudette to NH for our annual celebration back in 2009.

Strong opposition to death penalty bills

While last week’s public hearings on death penalty bills began in a chaotic fashion – due to an overscheduled daily calendar in the House Criminal Justice Committee, and outrageous speeches by bill sponsors – the messages delivered by members of the public to lawmakers were sacred testimonies of compassion, courage, and love. The most powerful voices were those of the family members of murder victims and other victims of violence – including the sisters and daughter of the late and beloved Renny Cushing, New England Yearly Meeting secretary Noah Merrill, NH Council of Churches executive director Lisa Beaudoin, and many others. Committee members also heard from Paul Hildwin, who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent three decades on death row in Florida. Hear some of his story here (WMUR).

In addition, compelling testimony was provided about the extraordinary financial cost and complexity of the infrastructure and procedures for capital punishment, and the lack of deterrent effects. No one except bill sponsors spoke in favor of the bills.

You can listen to the hearings here: January 14 (starting at 5:48:30), and January 15. And you’ll find news coverage at NHPR and InDepthNH. We also want to lift up an op-ed from our NH Program Associate, Ophelia Burnett: “The death penalty is inhumane - the ultimate form of slavery.”

In related news, the NH Attorney General argued last week that the death penalty sentence in Michael Addison’s murder conviction is “not excessive, nor disproportionate.” Read more here. Michael Addison, an African-American man convicted in the 2006 shooting death of police officer Michael Briggs, is still on death row in NH despite the 2019 repeal.

ICE activity expands in NH

Approximately 45 people gathered at the Strafford County jail in Dover on Friday in a vigil of solidarity with the family of Oscar Gutierrez Cardona, an immigrant who is being sent to Honduras this week, a place he fled many years ago in order to save his life. Oscar’s deportation leaves his wife and children without a beloved husband and father, and leaves the Manchester community he called home to mourn his absence and the injustice of his removal. Read more here and here. We are heartbroken, angry, and committed to continuing our resistance to the cruelty and violence of detention and deportation.

We’re frustrated to report that another NH town – Auburn – has signed a 287g agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), enabling more law enforcement collusion with the violent and often lawless actions of ICE. Auburn’s decision brings the number of NH law enforcement agencies with 287g agreements to 13, and to 14 in all of New England, a shameful tally. Read more here, and learn more about the efforts of our indefatigable colleagues at ACLU-NH to obtain the training materials 287g participants. New Hampshire people have a right to know how our locally funded law enforcement agencies will be ‘prepared’ to participate in the federal government’s mass deportation machine.

And one more bit of grim news on the immigration front – it appears that a site may have been secured for the rumored ICE “processing center” planned for Merrimack, NH, although local officials are still unwilling to confirm the news. Read more here. As many who testified last week in support of HB 1609, a commonsense bill that would prohibit the use of state or local funds for immigration detention, explained, there’s no good reason for local or state dollars to support a massively over-funded federal operation, especially in a state facing a “grim” budget picture. Read more here. Not to mention the moral arguments against our participation.

“A House of Dynamite” film discussion – 7 PM, on Zoom. Hosted by NH Peace Action and Back from the Brink. The current administration's plans to renew nuclear weapons testing is one alarming reminder that the threat of nuclear war is still a very real concern. “A House of Dynamite” is an apocalyptic political thriller that gives us a view of the devastating anticipation of a nuclear attack. Get drawn into the nerve-wracking decision rooms as this unsettling picture shows us what could become our future if the right choices are not made today. Watch the film (on Netflix) and then join us on zoom for a discussion about this film and what actions we can take now. Jeremy Love of Back from the Brink will lead the discussion to help us find a sense of purpose instead of hopelessness. Before watching the movie, we recommend you take a look at Back from the Brink's Beginner's Guide to Nuclear Weapons. Accessing the film: If you are not able to access this movie on your own, but would like to be a part of this discussion, let us know (info@nhpeaceaction.org). If there are enough people who need access to the movie, we will attempt to connect people to watch the movie together. As you watch the movie, think about how you feel about the threat of nuclear war, what you think is realistic considering the actions of current world leaders, and how you feel life would change after a nuclear attack.

Wearing a neon green vest and equipped with a whistle and walkie-talkie, Brown, an 81-year-old retired lawyer who lives nearby, kept his head on a swivel. His eyes were taking in each passing car and pedestrian near the campus as he stood ready to sound the alarm should federal immigration personnel approach the school, which teaches in English and Spanish and is around the corner from the spot where Good died.

""I never did like bullies, and that's what the federal government has become,"" Brown said, explaining why an octogenarian stood outside for four hours in -2 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chill (-19 Celsius). ""What's happening in my city is nothing more than authoritarian intimidation, and me and my neighbors are not going to put up with it.""

PARENTS PATROL SCHOOLS

The Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 federal agents across the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, making it the latest region targeted by the president's mass deportation program. People who normally might be organizing parent-teacher association meetings are arranging security patrols at their kids' schools to watch for immigration agents.

Some parents not on patrol are escorting foreign-born teachers or staff members, driving them to and from their homes and schools to make them feel safer. Others are delivering groceries and prescription medicines to immigrant families who are too afraid to leave their homes or send their kids to class.

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat representing Minnesota, said on Friday she had met with school principals from her state ""and heard horror stories of kids and parents 'under siege' by ICE.""

""Little kids scared. Dangerous encounters. This is no longer about a fraud investigation,"" Klobuchar wrote on social media, as she urged residents to remain peaceful.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, said this week more than 2,500 people have been arrested during the effort that officials have dubbed Operation Metro Surge. DHS has repeatedly said its agents are not targeting schools.

“ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. ""Criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense. If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened.""

But parents and school leaders say otherwise.

A spokesperson for Saint Paul Public Schools said in a statement that two of its contracted student transportation vans were pulled over by ICE agents this week. Several schools and daycare centers have emailed parents to notify them of teachers and staff who have been detained, according to school leaders and parents.

SOME STUDENTS LEARNING ONLINE

Schools have notified the public that some parents have been detained at bus stops after dropping off kids. Border Patrol agents clashed with protesters on the grounds of Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis as classes ended, just a few hours after Good was shot and killed. DHS said the clash followed agents' pursuit of someone who had rammed one of their vehicles several miles away and fled to the school grounds.

Several school districts — including those in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the state's two largest — have cancelled classes some days and are allowing students to learn online instead of attending classes in person for the next several weeks in response to the immigration operations.

“Many families in my area are afraid to send their kids to school because ICE is staking out our bus stops,” state Representative Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn, a Democrat and co-chair of the Minnesota House of Representatives' Children and Families Finance and Policy Committee, told the Star Tribune newspaper.

Nate Byrne, a spokesperson for Kids Count on Us, a coalition of 500 community-based childcare centers in Minnesota, said it is receiving daily reports about ICE officers on or near childcare center grounds, and that such centers in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods have seen a 50% reduction in attendance.

Kids Count on Us has received reports of childcare workers taken into ICE custody, Byrne said, though he did not have specific figures.

PARENTS DELIVER FOOD, RAISE MONEY

""Parents who are not fearful of being detained by ICE — typically because they are white — are forming teams to patrol outside their childcare centers during drop-off and pick-up and when staff need to come and go,"" Byrne said. ""Parents who are fearful of being detained by ICE due to the color of their skin are being extremely cautious.""

St. Paul parent Kelly, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, citing fears of retribution from the federal government, said she was helping deliver food to immigrant families that attend her children's school but were afraid to leave their homes. Parents are also raising money to help pay rent for the families across the metro area, as the parents are missing work, according to Kelly and other parents.

Kelly, who was attending a Friday night protest against ICE with her husband and two children, ages 6 and 9, said she was bewildered by what has become of her city amid the immigration raids. In years past, she volunteered for parent-teacher association events. Now, she carries a whistle everywhere she goes and said she is ready to confront federal agents if they approach her kids' school.

""There's no parenting handbook for this,"" Kelly said. ""My parents never had to sit me down and explain that my classmates who are suddenly missing from school aren't there because their parents are afraid of being snatched by the government.""

Local advocates say they're working to balance the need for an urgent response to good-faith reports of ICE activity, with making efforts to verify initial reports when possible.
The increase in Rapid Response reports indicates ""there’s heightened interest in protecting our neighbors,"" Roberts said.
""I'd rather falsely assume someone is ICE than falsely assume that they’re not ICE,"" said Maggie Carswell, a Tucson community organizer.
Carrasco said she's been heartened by the swell of support for Derechos Humanos and groups working to monitor and observe ICE activity here.","The phones at Sunnyside High School were ringing with calls from concerned parents on Thursday afternoon, as false reports of immigration agents on campus spread on social media, school officials said.

In fact, Sunnyside High and Los Amigos Elementary went into a precautionary ""soft lockdown"" Thursday — with the perimeter gates locked, but classes still in session — due to a nearby law enforcement operation on Tucson's south side.

Immigration agents were never on campus, and students were not at risk, said Marisela Felix, school district spokesperson.

The incident was one of several incorrect social-media reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Tucson in recent weeks.

Amid the federal government's violent crackdown in Minneapolis, and reports of an impending escalation of ICE enforcement in Phoenix, anxiety is surging among Tucson's immigrant and advocacy communities, advocates say.

Some false rumors have circulated online, and there's been an increase in reports of ICE sightings — some valid, some false alarms — to the local ""Rapid Response"" network, which sends trained observers to bear witness to potential ICE arrests.

Local advocates say they're working to balance the need for an urgent response to good-faith reports of ICE activity, with making efforts to verify initial reports when possible.

It's hard to say if there's been a true surge in ICE activity here this month, or if heightened awareness is leading to more reports, some volunteers say. But likely it's both, said Sarah Roberts, an immigrant-rights advocate and volunteer with Tucson's Coalición de Derechos Humanos, or Human Rights Coalition.

ICE is definitely active in Tucson, Roberts said, noting the hotline got a call Tuesday from a woman who said her husband had just been arrested by ICE and was seeking legal help.

Photos shared Friday by a Facebook user show three agents, wearing green vests that say, ""POLICE/ICE,"" at the Tucson Spectrum shopping center on West Irvington Road.

The increase in Rapid Response reports indicates ""there’s heightened interest in protecting our neighbors,"" Roberts said. ""That's a good thing.""

Immigration agents carry out arrests quickly and are often gone before observers with Rapid Response can arrive; advocates don't want community members to hesitate to report possible ICE activity for fear of making an incorrect report.

""I'd rather falsely assume someone is ICE than falsely assume that they’re not ICE,"" said Maggie Carswell, a Tucson community organizer.

Still, there's a real risk of burnout for activists and members of the immigrant community, who are often in a sustained state of hyper-vigilance, Roberts said. There's also a risk of ""secondary trauma"" from witnessing enforcement actions, she said.

Sunnyside officials are encouraging members of the public to be prudent about what they share online, as unverified rumors can cause unnecessary stress and confusion.

""False rumors have been circulating on social media claiming that 'ICE was at Sunnyside High School.' This is not true,"" Felix said in a Thursday email. ""We ask parents and our community to be part of the solution, and to be aware of the serious consequences of resharing information on social media that is not reliable and from a verified source.""

Local officials have been trying to prepare the public for a possible deployment of National Guard or other federal authorities to the area, though no such deployment has been announced.

ICE's media team has not responded to the Arizona Daily Star’s query about whether more ICE agents will soon be sent to Phoenix or Tucson.

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero directed city staff to create a website to help members of the public know their rights and prepare for potential encounters with federal agents.

Pima County Attorney Laura Conover urged Tucson residents to stay calm during interactions with federal agents and during protest activity.

""Here in Pima County, we expect our community members and our own local police to be safe from recklessness,"" Conover said in a written statement Monday. ""And to that end, I am urging our community not to meet recklessness with more recklessness. We must be smart and fight fire, not with more fire but with water. ... We must move in ways that are wise and pray that keeps us all alive.""

Operation on the south side

The law-enforcement operation near Sunnyside Thursday was led by the U.S. Marshals Service, part of the Arizona ""Wanted"" Task Force that targets violent offenders, U.S. Deputy Marshal Mindy Miller told the Star. The task force comprises local, state and federal agencies.

Border Patrol agents were present at the scene, near the intersection of South Campbell Avenue and Drexel, Miller said.

The Jan. 15 operation targeted Jorge Cardenas-Valencia, who is in the U.S. illegally and was wanted in Pima County on multiple criminal counts: transport of narcotic drugs for sale, misconduct involving weapons in the commission of a drug offense, use of wire communication in the commission of a drug offense, conspiracy, illegally conducting an enterprise and misconduct involving weapons of a prohibited possessor, Miller said in an email.

Maria Carrasco, a leader in Derechos Humanos and Rapid Response, was among those who responded to the scene of the south-side operation before details were known.

Rapid Response has been receiving dozens of calls each day, and Carrasco said she's trying to personally respond to as many reports as she can.

""We are all stressed like crazy. There's 10 of us answering the phone. I had more than 20 calls on my phone today,"" she said Thursday.

Carrasco said she's been heartened by the swell of support for Derechos Humanos and groups working to monitor and observe ICE activity here.

A recent training session for new volunteers was ""a full house,"" Carrasco said. That's good news, she said, because current volunteers are stretched thin.

""We have to be careful because we’re going to get burned out,"" she said. ""I'm very proud the community is coming together with one voice to protect our families and our community. ... I'm very hopeful that we’re going to change this government to the right side.""

Since the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Minneapolis mother Renee Good by an ICE agent, some advocates are newly fearing for their own lives and safety, said Lucia Vindiola, a volunteer with the Coalición de Derechos Humanos.

""There is that concern: If I continue, am I going to die? How far are Trump and ICE and immigration (authorities) going to go with all of this?"" said Vindiola, a seventh-generation Tucsonan, who said her family lived here before Arizona was part of the United States.

ICE's actions, such as wearing face masks, undermine trust in law enforcement broadly, harming public safety by discouraging people from reporting crime, advocates say.

""They don't know who to trust,"" Vindiola said. ""ICE covers up their faces like criminals. Why is that happening? Why are they not behaving like law enforcement agents, with their name tags and actual badges?""

Vindiola leads the emotional-support committee within Derechos Humanos, which holds art therapy sessions for kids and adolescents and offers therapy for adults.

The group is organizing a series of ""healing circle"" events, starting this weekend. The event — invite-only, for now — aims to help volunteers cope with the pressures they're facing, and find ways to manage stress in a sustainable way, she said.

""We are stressing out so much, and we need to be able to have a way to heal our own psyche, to heal our own energy,"" she said. ""We're trying to take care of our emotional health, as well.""

Police in St. Cloud are increasing staffing after a video surfaced showing an ICE agent hitting a man with a baton.

Chase Benjamin, the man in the video, said he was detained after the incident. Benjamin described the situation, saying, “The video shows it all, I’m just walking, trying to get through the crowd and just start getting attacked.”

Benjamin explained he was running errands at the Star City Mall in St. Cloud when clashes occurred between hundreds of people and ICE agents. He said he was attacked and then taken to the Whipple Federal Building in the Twin Cities, where he waited for 8 hours before being released later that night.

“At this point, I’m being kidnapped,” Benjamin said.

St. Cloud City Councilmember Karen Larson was present during the incident to encourage peace. “Tensions are high on both sides right now, and we need to calm ourselves,” Larson said.

She expressed concern about the potential for violence, stating, “We could have had another violent incident.”

ICE officials informed St. Cloud city staff that their operations are “ongoing” but did not provide specifics. Larson emphasized the importance of safety for those who feel targeted and supports both First Amendment rights and lawful law enforcement duties.

“There’s a third path where we can sit down in the middle and talk about the mess that we are all in to try and solve it,” she said.

Benjamin, an American citizen, is considering legal action following the incident. He had this message to the community, saying, “To the people, just protect your community, stand up for yourself. You’ve got the right to.”

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS reached out to Homeland Security to learn more about this incident, including why Benjamin was detained. When we hear back, we’ll post an update.",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ICE-OUTSIDE-THE-METRO_PKG_00.00.28.52.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:25.024313

Another letter argues that recent actions regarding immigration, law enforcement, and climate policy are unconstitutional and un-American.

A third writer claims current immigration enforcement is not about reform but about promoting division and hatred.

Here are this week’s letters to the editor of the Herald Times Reporter. See our letters policy below for details about how to share your views.

Who will take away his ‘License to Kill’?

Let’s examine “License to Kill” lyrics by Bob Dylan from his 1983 album “Infidels” in light of current U.S. leadership and recent events.

“Well, the judge, he holds a six-gun, / And the gospel he delivers / Is one that you can hear / In any saloon or alley”

This verse suggests justice is perverted and the law is enforced with violence, comparing it to the Wild West or urban crime.

“And the man who translates / Is a man who understands / That the law of the land / Is the law of the gun”

This highlights the role of interpreters or translators (possibly referring to U.S. advisers or diplomats) who understand the true law in these conflict zones is the law of the gun, not written laws or international agreements.

“And the man who translates / Is a man who understands / That the law of the land / Is the law of the gun”

This reinforces the idea that the U.S. government’s actions are driven by a desire for power and control, rather than a genuine concern for democracy or human rights.

“And the man who translates / Is a man who understands / That the law of the land / Is the law of the gun”

This suggests the U.S. government is complicit in the violence and suffering caused by its interventions, and that it is willing to sacrifice human lives for its geopolitical goals.

This is not OK

As I watch outrage after outrage in the daily news, and the attempts by many to justify and even normalize such things as much-needed change, I find myself in disbelief.

It is not OK for immigrants to be deported without having their day in court. Even if they have broken the law, it is explicitly stated in our Constitution that everyone has the right to a trial when accused of a crime, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Even the Jan. 6 rioters, who were filmed on TV committing crimes, were given trials before punishment.

It is not OK for a woman to be killed by an untrained paramilitary agent. Real law enforcement personnel are trained in de-escalation; lethal force is used only as a last resort. Whatever happened to shooting the tires to stop a vehicle? The tragedy in Minneapolis was an emotional, non-professional overreaction by an unaccountable militia. Definitely not OK.

It is not OK for the U.S. to pull out of the Paris climate accords. This was done, as usual, by presidential memorandum, without consultation with Congress. We are the only country in the world to leave this treaty. It is an embarrassing and foolish denial of basic climate science, driven by a single man who doesn’t like windmills.

I could go on — the list is long and profoundly un-American. Much of this is enabled by a weak Congress. Call your elected representatives to say what’s going on in this country is not OK.

This was never about immigration reform

The rationale for current immigration enforcement in the U.S. is often presented as an effort to reform a broken system and protect the public. However, the actions of authorities, especially ICE, reveal these stated motivations do not align with reality.

Enforcement is frequently justified as targeting the “worst of the worst,” yet ICE has detained preschool workers described as loving and trustworthy, and apprehending men seeking work at places like Home Depot, as well as hardworking farm laborers. These actions contradict claims that immigrants are draining welfare resources or refusing to work.

ICE has also targeted individuals attending legally mandated court proceedings, undermining the argument that enforcement is only about removing those unwilling to follow the law.

Deportation is not simply a return to home countries; it has resulted in community members being sent to brutal foreign prisons with due process.

Public safety is further called into question by incidents in which ICE endangered communities, such as recent shootings of three people in crowded streets. This $40 billion system of structural violence must end.

Transparency is lacking, with ICE officers operating unmasked and without proper identification. The Trump administration and its sycophants are accused of manipulating public perception to justify these actions, fostering a secretive and brutal police force. The underlying motivation appears to be promoting division and hatred toward immigrants.

Administrations have long failed to address illegal immigration meaningfully. The persistent harm caused by these policies demands action. I vow to fight for justice and humanity in the immigration system.

The death count for 2025 constituted the most deaths in ICE jails ever recorded outside the COVID-19 pandemic.

Khanna and a staff member visited ICE California City Detention Center on January 6, the largest ICE prison in California.","All eyes are on the Trump administration’s brutal “immigration enforcement” operation in Minnesota, where roving squads of federal agents in Minneapolis are demanding proof of citizenship from people of color on the street and lashing out against residents enraged by the deadly shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last week.

Far less visible is the rapidly expanding, nationwide network of jails and prisons where ICE and Border Patrol lock people up after they are arrested, and that is almost certainly by design. Four people died in federal immigration jails so far in 2026, and at least 32 people died in ICE jails over the course of 2025 as President Donald Trump ramped up his mass deportation campaign. The death count for 2025 constituted the most deaths in ICE jails ever recorded outside the COVID-19 pandemic.

“If we are seeing that sort of outward extreme violence in broad daylight in the streets of Minneapolis and streets across the country, imagine what people must be facing behind closed doors and behind bars in ICE detention centers,” said Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the Detention Watch Network, in an interview with Truthout.

The number of people imprisoned by ICE increased by 75 percent to nearly 66,000 in 2025, and despite repeated claims by administration officials about targeting “the worst of the worst,” nearly 74 percent have no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse immigration database. ICE’s “roving patrols” and “indiscriminate raids” have contributed to a 2,450 percent increase in the number of people with no criminal record held in ICE detention on any given day, according to the American Immigration Council.

Ghandehari told Truthout that ICE has long faced allegations of allowing abuse, medical neglect, inhumane conditions, and solitary confinement in its network of jails and prisons, which are used to incarcerate people facing deportation orders.

ICE’s carceral facilities are often run by for-profit prison companies or local sheriffs acting as contractors. While many detainees are held at remote facilities in Louisiana and Texas, far from families and legal support, Ghandehari said ICE is now operating nearly 200 jails nationwide after opening or reopening more than 130 facilities in 2025.

“What we have seen and are seeing in Minneapolis is enraging; it’s unacceptable, it’s out of control, but unfortunately it is unsurprising given that ICE is inherently a violent agency, and what we are now seeing in Minneapolis is really the manifestation of years of ICE being allowed to act with impunity,” Ghandehari told Truthout.

On January 15, the county medical examiner in El Paso, Texas, announced that the death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old man held at a massive immigration detention center at El Paso’s Fort Bliss military base, was likely a homicide. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Campos was attempting to kill himself and violently resisted when officers intervened but provided no evidence to back up that claim.

The most recent deaths among those imprisoned by ICE also include 46-year-old Parady La from Cambodia, who was arrested and jailed by ICE on January 6 and died three days later after receiving “treatment for severe drug withdrawal at the Federal Detention Center” in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to DHS. La was found unresponsive in his cell the next day and was later pronounced dead of brain and organ failure at a nearby hospital.

Withdrawal from certain drugs and alcohol can be fatal but is easily treatable with medical supervision and proper medications. In an attempt to revive La, DHS claims federal officers administered CPR and naloxone, a drug used to treat opioid overdoses, not withdrawal symptoms. The Bureau of Prisons maintains a protocol for safely supervising drug withdrawal in federal detention facilities.

Jonathan Feinberg, an attorney for La’s family, said nobody should die in custody from opiate withdrawal.

“We do not at this point know exactly what happened to Parady La, but the circumstances that have been reported are highly suspicious and concerning,” Feinberg wrote in an email to Truthout on Friday. “We intend to conduct a full investigation and pursue every legal remedy available to his family.”

A 2024 report by Physicians for Human Rights examined 52 deaths in ICE custody from 2017 to 2021 and found that 95 percent were preventable or possibly preventable if appropriate medical care had been provided. Civil liberties and international human rights groups have sounded alarm bells about medical neglect and preventable deaths in ICE custody for over a decade.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment by the time this story was published. However, the official statement on La’s death includes a list of mostly minor drug and alcohol violations and accuses the man of being a “career criminal,” reflecting a larger pattern of ICE smearing people who are harmed at the hands of its agents. After Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis while attempting to pull away from the scene in her vehicle on January 7, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem baselessly accused the mother and poet of being a “domestic terrorist.”

Other recent deaths in ICE custody include Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, 68, who was detained at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in California and died on January 6, and Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, 42, who was detained at the Joe Corley Processing Center in Texas and died on January 5, according to Detention Watch Network.

“You can imagine how bad the conditions have been getting,” Ghandehari said. “It’s not even a full two weeks into this new year, and we already have four deaths in ICE custody.”

ICE cannot place U.S. citizens in detention for extended periods of time, but multiple citizens have reportedly been arrested by ICE under Trump’s crackdown, including George Retes, a U.S. veteran who was wrongly detained by ICE in California for three days after a chaotic raid on a cannabis farm in August.

The Oglala Sioux Tribe, one of the largest tribal nations in the U.S., has accused ICE of illegally holding four members arrested during raids in Minneapolis, according to Axios.

From New Jersey to California to Minnesota, immigration officials have barred Democratic lawmakers from entering ICE jails to conduct unannounced inspections and check on incarcerated constituents. A federal judge recently struck down a policy requiring advance notice from lawmakers, but Noem instituted a new policy that blocked Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Democrats from visiting the central ICE holding facility in the Twin Cities shortly after Good was killed.

“When we appropriate funds as members of Congress, we are expected by the public to do oversight because the public requires their money be used with transparency and accountability,” Omar told reporters on January 10. “And what happened today is ICE agents decided that we were no longer allowed to fulfill our constitutional duties.”

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) says he may be the only member of Congress to conduct an oversight visit to an ICE jail under the Trump administration. Khanna and a staff member visited ICE California City Detention Center on January 6, the largest ICE prison in California. Khanna made the visit after one of his constituents “was beaten, unlawfully detained, and held at this very facility before being deported,” according to a social media post.

Khanna said he was “deeply disturbed” by his visit to the ICE prison, which currently holds nearly 1,500 people. When he spoke to families in the parking lot, they described their loved ones being subjected to “inadequate food, visible mold, and water that tastes like metal.” A lack of medical care was the most alarming failure, Khanna said, with one detainee telling the congressman that he was urinating blood but still had not received medical care.

“For illnesses like the flu, medicine is rarely provided; at best, [an] ibuprofen is given, but more often detainees are told to buy basic medicine from the commissary at exaggerated, unaffordable prices,” Khanna said. “With reportedly only one doctor for hundreds of people, the neglect is structural.”

Congress faces a self-imposed January 30 deadline to pass legislation funding the government, which gives lawmakers a chance to rein in ICE by defunding the infrastructure that makes Trump’s brutal “immigration” crackdown possible, including the expanding network of ICE jails and prisons, according to Ghandehari. ICE’s budget is set to balloon by $170 billion under the megabill championed by Trump and passed by Republicans in July 2025, but some progressive Democrats are now pushing to defund the agency.

“They can’t do what they are doing without infrastructure that has been built up over decades,” Ghandehari told Truthout, explaining that the only way to stop the Trump administration’s violence is by starting to dismantle ICE’s infrastructure. ”That’s why it’s so important that Congress do the right things this week and start the process of cutting ICE off.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2224632175-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 16:57:42.806376

They’re workers.","Donald Trump rode to reelection with racist attacks on immigrants and refugees and promising mass deportations. The first year of his second term was filled with heartbreak, trauma, and fear as his administration escalated its assault on immigrant communities: separating families, occupying cities, targeting workers, and expanding deportations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is using its bloated budget to recruit among Trump’s far right base. This comes amid ICE’s horrific killing of Renée Nicole Good in Minneapolis, staunchly defended by the Trump administration.

At the same time, we’ve seen inspiring community resistance to ICE and Trump across the U.S. Rapid response networks have grown. Teacher unions are defending immigrant students and families. There is growing mass resistance to ICE from Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis.

A year ago, Truthout spoke to several community and farmworker organizations about how they were preparing for the second Trump administration. We reached out to some of those participants again to reflect on the past year in a new roundtable interview. They discuss the anguish of the past year and the challenges immigrant communities have faced, as well as how organizers are proactively responding and what’s keeping people motivated and inspired.

Rossy Alfaro is a former dairy worker in Vermont and organizer with Migrant Justice, which organizes dairy farmworkers in Vermont and oversees the worker-driven Milk with Dignity campaign. María Carrasco is a longtime volunteer with Derechos Humanos, a grassroots organization supporting migrant rights in Tucson, Arizona, and she is closely involved with the group’s rapid response work. Jeannie Economos is the longtime pesticide safety and environmental health project coordinator for the Farmworker Association of Florida, which has organized farmworkers for over four decades.

Note: These interviews took place in December 2025 and were conducted separately and edited into a roundtable format afterward. Alfaro’s interview was done with interpretation provided by Migrant Justice.

Derek Seidman: A year ago, we discussed how you were approaching the new Trump administration. How has the past year been for your community and organizing efforts?

Jeannie Economos: It’s much worse than we expected. The tactics they’re using are very disturbing. Children are being ripped apart from their parents. It’s causing chaos and heartbreak and mental health issues. The community is traumatized. ICE is waiting for people at courthouses and even schools and is intimidating people by wearing masks and dragging people out of their cars. It’s terrible. This is unprecedented.

María Carrasco: We’ve seen so many things already. Bounty hunters are out there doing a lot of damage. Many racist people got jobs with ICE and they don’t respect human rights. Sometimes they’re really violent when they arrest people. Every day it’s becoming more dangerous, and this is barely the beginning, because ICE is receiving more money.

They’ve detained a lot of workers we know. Their families come to our meetings. It’s heartbreaking how the kids whose parents are in detention are suffering. We’re traumatizing them. I’m so worried about that.

So many people are missing in the system. We can’t find them. I try to calm down the families. They call me and they’re desperate. There are a lot of Venezuelans being taken. They’re being picked up and deported even though they’re refugees and have all their paperwork.

Rossy Alfaro: It’s had a huge impact on our community. The attacks have been so extreme. Even though we knew what was coming, you can’t really be prepared for it being so intense. So there’s a certain amount of panic in the farmworker community. People are feeling terrorized.

At the same time, people are really resolute, especially within our farmworker community here in Vermont. We fought hard for the protections that we’ve won, and we’re going to fight to retain them.

Can you discuss more what the administration’s escalating attacks on immigrants has meant for farmworker communities?

Economos: Things were difficult over a year ago with all the anti-immigrant sentiment and rhetoric, but that looks good compared to what we are seeing now, especially some of the tactics they’re using against the immigrant population. Before, farmworkers were afraid to file complaints for workplace violations, but now they’re afraid to go to work at all. Of course, some people still go to work, but they’re taking a risk. Some farmers have planted fewer crops because they are worried they won’t find enough workers to harvest. It’s causing chaos in agriculture.

Many employers in Florida are implementing E-Verify, a system which tracks immigration status, which means a lot of people won’t get jobs. So they end up in the underground economy working for unscrupulous employers who exploit them and commit wage theft because they’re undocumented and they know they’re very vulnerable.

In November, ICE stopped a bus of farmworkers near Immokalee. They were mostly women and asylum seekers going to work, just trying to take care of their families. They dragged them from the bus. Who will take care of their kids? Along with the fear, how do you go about your daily life with so much uncertainty? It’s terrifying. Some farmworkers are leaving the country.

Alfaro: In April 2025, Border Patrol detained eight farmworkers at a farm where workers had really begun to organize and stand up for their rights. This had a big impact. People felt fear and no longer wanted to speak out and organize. Some stopped going out to get groceries. People are just now feeling enough courage to start organizing again.

Migrant Justice spoke with the detained workers and their families and we launched a public campaign. We had marches and rallies, and thousands of people signed our petition calling for their release. This had a huge impact. The workers being held behind bars knew that they weren’t alone and they knew that the community was behind them.

How has your organization responded over the past year to the Trump administration’s intensified attacks?

Alfaro: We’ve really focused on educating people about their rights and how to prepare for potential encounters with federal agents and minimize risk in those situations. We’ve been building a system of support through our rapid response network so people can respond when there’s a detention happening. We have people trained on how to intervene to defend a person’s rights when they see an arrest — though it’s difficult to respond in time in rural areas.

We have people trained to go observe anytime there’s a rumor about ICE or Border Patrol in an area. That lets us differentiate fact from fiction and helps with that sense of panic that the community feels. This rapid response network has been important for our community, because we haven’t felt so alone. There are people here in Vermont who have our backs.

Economos: We have five offices in Florida. We’ve been doing Know Your Rights trainings with workers across the state. We’ve been handing out red cards in the fields. Some employers have actually asked us to do Know Your Rights trainings for their workers, which is unusual. Some local businesses have put up signs saying they’re a safe place for immigrants.

We’ve been working in coalition with other organizations locally, statewide, and nationally. We have a rapid response group. We’re keeping track of detentions and deportations. We hope to publish a report on this soon.

We were lucky to escape any hurricanes this [past] year. We’ve been really worried about what to tell people if there’s an evacuation order or they need to find shelter. We’ve been contacting local governments about their policies around sheltering undocumented workers. We’re trying to protect people. How can people go to shelters if there is no guarantee that ICE won’t target them there? There’s so much fear and uncertainty.

Carrasco: There are so many groups organizing in Tucson. It’s getting bigger and bigger. People are really pissed off. The more they try to oppress us, the more people are coming out.

We tell people to take out their phone and start recording if someone’s being detained. It’s our right. We keep eight feet away from them. As soon as someone starts recording, ICE wants to go hide. They’ll be less violent toward people. They don’t want to be recorded, because they know sooner or later, we’re going to take them to court. We’ve been cataloging their cars and license plates.

We’re just so mad. These ICE agents don’t even show their faces. They kick us and do whatever they want. They’re the criminals. We have the right to protest.

A lady from Chicago is sending me whistles and offered to train us on how to respond to tear gas. But big cities like that are different from Tucson. They’re crunched up, so when ICE shows up, people pour out together. It’s difficult in Tucson because our city is so spread out, and we’re so close to the border, so it’s more militarized.

Can you talk about your hotline in Tucson?

Carrasco: Some days the phone is ringing off the hook. Just now, while we’re talking, I received three calls. We get a lot of calls in the morning because ICE is getting people on their way to work. This is every day. They’re not criminals. They’re workers.

We’re trying to help people get lawyers. We try to help as many people as we can. Every day is a different story. One worker called us last month. A guy hired him and exploited him and then brought him to ICE. Those are the kinds of abuses we’re seeing. They’re dehumanizing people and stealing their wages.

After the Taco Giro raids here, I got 48 calls. People wanted to join our meetings and our rapid response network. Even though we’re in a really bad situation, people who never helped before are coming out to defend the community. There’s hope out there.

We need people to have our number and call us if you see anything. Call me every time. We have more than 200 people who are ready to come out.

Rossy, you were personally impacted this past year. Can you talk about that?

Alfaro: This is really difficult for me to talk about. My family members, Nacho and Heidi, were detained by Border Patrol and then held in ICE detention for a month. They were detained completely in violation of their rights, and it was done very violently. Their window was shattered, and they were pulled out of the car.

They both knew their rights. They refused to provide any information about themselves to those immigration agents. The agents took them in without any cause. But that also gave them the ability to challenge their detention on legal grounds and helped get them released, because they could show there was an unlawful arrest.

My son and I suffered terribly from all the stress and sadness of having our family separated. They were held for several weeks. But they trusted their community to fight for them. They have very high profiles as community leaders and as fighters for human rights. That faith that the community would fight for their release sustained them during those months in detention, until they ultimately came home.

Have you seen any victories this past year that you want to lift up?

Alfaro: One victory we’re most proud of is the passage of the Housing Access for Immigrant Families Act, which makes it easier for immigrant families to find housing in the state. We campaigned for this and won it last year. For farmworkers especially, having access to housing that’s not associated with your job really opens up opportunities.

Also, the Education Equity law we won that went into effect this year allows undocumented students to attend university and pay the same rate and receive the same financial aid as their classmates who were born here. My daughter is one of the students benefiting from that. She’s able to go to college because of this law that we fought for and that she helped get passed.

Amid the challenges and heartbreak of this past year, what is keeping you motivated or even hopeful?

Economos: All I can say is I’m more committed than ever. There’s no way that we can turn our backs now. It’s personal, too. A community member who’s on our leadership committee — her nephew was sent to Alligator Alcatraz. When you know people, you feel their pain and it makes you more committed than ever before.

Seeing what other people are doing — young people, students standing in front of ICE or blocking a road, pastors going to immigration court to try and protect people; seeing the risks people are taking, just an outpouring of resistance around the country to what’s happening — that’s inspiring.

Carrasco: People are waking up. People who’ve never protested are coming out to defend our community. A really old lady called me the other day. She was so mad. She wanted to join us. Even white people want to join us — people who are less afraid and who’ve never been active in the community, but who are waking up to what’s happening.

I’m hopeful. People are always calling me to help. Our communities are coming together and they’re defending each other every day. We’ll keep working and defending our communities regardless of what they do to us.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2195715331-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 15:58:28.651350

(WLS) -- Massive crowds returned to the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Saturday to continue protesting against federal immigration operations.

This comes as the Trump administration is ramping up its immigration crackdown after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minnesota.

Despite the freezing temperatures, demonstrators organized peacefully, saying their message to the Trump administration is more important now than ever before.

""This is our country, and it belongs to we, the people, and it seems to have been taken over by a group of people who don't have our best interests at heart,"" said demonstrator Mary Moreland.

It was the first protest seen at the ICE processing facility in quite some time since thousands gathered there weekly at the peak of immigrations operations across Chicagoland. With escalating tensions in Minneapolis in recent weeks, protesters say, now is the time to keep organizing.

""What's happening here is bad, but Minnesota, my God, that's like, ground zero. And to use that much tear gas on a crowd, for what?"" said demonstrator David Kav.

Of course, Saturday's demonstration, led by the organization American Opposition, came as clashes between protesters and immigration agents continue in Minneapolis, especially after Good's shooting death less than two weeks ago.

And just days ago, tensions flared up in that city once again after a federal agent shot an alleged undocumented immigrant in the leg during a traffic stop. The Department of Homeland Security says the agent was also attacked. Demonstrators could be seen throwing fireworks in response as agents deployed chemical irritants.

Meanwhile, sources told ABC News that federal officials have opened an investigation into Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, looking into whether they may have obstructed law enforcement activity in the state.

And while President Donald Trump and DHS Sec. Kristi Noem have said many anti-ICE protesters are paid agitators, demonstrators in Broadview pushed back against that narrative.

""I'm just an old white guy from the suburbs. I don't have a criminal record. I don't get paid for this. I do it because we have to. We have to get out in bad weather, good weather,"" said one protester, named Tony.

The crowd rallied right outside the west suburban ICE facility for a couple of hours before marching their way down 25th Street.

The Unified Command Center reported no arrests from Saturday's protest.

People there say it was important to send their message peacefully.

""It's about people who see what's happening and want to make a change, and that's why you have people out here in 12-degree weather, however cold it is, because they want to see change,"" Tovar said.

""We are here to send a clear message, that we are going to stay and we are going to stand up for what freedom actually is,"" Kav said.

That happened after they confronted ICE agents who got out of a car and brandished guns.
“I say, ‘Don't shove my fucking girlfriend,’ and he shoves me,” Valentine told the site, “and then then it evolves really fast from there.
ICE agents questioned them separately, and an agent asked Martin about her genitalia and if she’d had gender-confirmation surgery.
Valentine told Martin, “You know, I just realized that they probably knew Renee was a lesbian before they shot her.” Related: Who was Renee Nicole Good?","A queer transgender woman says she and her girlfriend were pepper-sprayed, handcuffed, and jailed simply for showing up to protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

Alice Valentine and her girlfriend, Sofia Martin, learned through a Signal group chat that ICE agents were swooping down Monday on St. Cloud’s Star City Mall, which is home to many Somali-owned businesses, The Handbasket reports. They are fairly new to protests but wanted to help their neighbors. Both are queer and trans and are U.S. citizens.

“Within a few moments of arriving at the parking lot, they were shoved to the ground by agents, pepper sprayed, thrown in a van and hauled away,” according to the site.

That happened after they confronted ICE agents who got out of a car and brandished guns. “I'm not a gun person, but the guns were really big. They weren't just like standard police pistols,” Valentine said. “And so I started recording.”

When the couple asked why the agents were armed, one agent pushed Martin. “I say, ‘Don't shove my fucking girlfriend,’ and he shoves me,” Valentine told the site, “and then then it evolves really fast from there. Like I have pepper spray in my eyes. It’s all over my body. And they’re putting handcuffs on both of us.”

Then the women were thrown into a van, along with three others. Two of them were likely Somali, Valentine said. They were taken to ICE headquarters at the Whipple Building in Minneapolis, where each received one bottle of water but no treatment for their pepper spray wounds.

ICE agents questioned them separately, and an agent asked Martin about her genitalia and if she’d had gender-confirmation surgery. She answered truthfully to avoid being groped. It occurred to them that LGBTQ+ people were being singled out for mistreatment. In the van, they discussed ICE’s killing of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week. Valentine told Martin, “You know, I just realized that they probably knew Renee was a lesbian before they shot her.”

Also, while in her cell, Valentine heard another woman asking to call her girlfriend. What crossed Valentine’s mind was “Why are so many lesbians being fucked up by ICE right now?” she said.

Valentine and Martin were released after several hours. No one told them why they were released or what to expect next. The agents returned their belongings except for their cell phones.

Valentine sprained an ankle when being roughed up by ICE, and she has been unable to work because of that. She and Martin own a salon that provides massages and electrolysis, with a focus on queer and trans clients. But while being treated at urgent care, Valentine met a neighbor who’s also interested in countering ICE, so she remains committed to the effort.

“In retrospect, I would have done it again,” she told The Handbasket. “Like, it was the most miserable day of my whole life. But I would do it again because I think that people need to know how evil ICE is and that this is happening, and that this isn't about putting murderers and rapists away. It's about racism, it's about Nazism, it's about fascism, and we need to do anything we can to stop it.”",https://www.advocate.com/media-library/queer-trans-ice-protester-recounts-abuse-jailing-by-agents.jpg?id=62826547&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C39%2C0%2C39,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:32.229080

A federal judge ordered on Friday that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must limit the tactics ICE uses against protesters in Minnesota.
“My focus remains where it’s always been: keeping our city safe.” The Hill has reached out to the DOJ for comment.","Democrats on Capitol Hill are defending Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) after the Justice Department (DOJ) accused him of obstructing federal law enforcement’s operations in the North Star State.

DOJ issued subpoenas for Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Friday, more than a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot a Minneapolis woman, sparking protests across the state and a brief threat by President Trump to send troops to the city.

“Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” the governor wrote on social platform X, responding to an article. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.”

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar responded to the subpoenas, calling them “an assault on our democracy and the rule of law.”

“Speaking out against what our government is doing is not a crime in America—not now, not ever,” she wrote on X.

Minnesota Reps. Betty McCollum (D) and Angie Craig (D) also expressed their support for the governor, taking a swing at the Trump administration’s actions.

McCollum wrote online that the country “deserves justice” and “not President Trump’s use of DOJ as a weapon against his perceived enemies.”

Craig called the move “even more proof that this has never been about making Minnesota safer.”

“It has always been about political retribution for President Trump and his allies,” the lawmaker wrote in a post on X. “I’m standing with @GovTimWalz and @MayorFrey.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also condemned the news, referencing the administration’s previous investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey.

“First it was Tish James and James Comey. Now it’s Senators, Governors, and the Fed Chair,” Schumer posted to X, also referring to an investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “In Donald Trump’s America you get a bogus investigation for doing your job. Americans reject this kind of totalitarian bullying. Where are Republicans? Hiding.”

Tensions between federal law enforcement and protesters were escalated after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer on Jan. 7 and a second shooting last week when a Venezuelan migrant was injured when he attempted to escape arrest.

A federal judge ordered on Friday that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must limit the tactics ICE uses against protesters in Minnesota. In her order, U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez wrote that the officials cannot retaliate against, arrest or detain “persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed Walz’s comments, blasting Trump for investigating the Minnesota officials “instead of seeking justice for Renee Good.”

“We will not stand by silently and be bullied into submission,” the Massachusetts Democrat wrote on X.

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who is also under investigation by the administration over his and other lawmakers’ decision to appear in a video advising members of the U.S. military not to obey “illegal” orders, called the DOJ’s subpoenas of Walz and Frey “un-American.”

“With each passing day, more and more of Donald Trump’s political opponents are finding themselves targeted by his Justice Department,” Kelly wrote online. “It’s not by accident. This is un-American, and we cannot allow it to continue.”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said in a video posted to his X account that “Congress plays a big role here,” citing the upcoming vote on DHS’s budget.

“Especially given the escalation that is happening in Minnesota today, we should not be approving that budget unless there are constraints on Donald Trump’s illegality,” he said.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a post on X after news of the DOJ probe broke, wrote, “A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.”

Frey called the investigation “an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city.”

“I will not be intimidated,” he added. “My focus remains where it’s always been: keeping our city safe.”

A Quinnipiac poll found 57% of voters disapproving of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws, with 40% approving, largely unchanged from Quinnipiac's previous polling in July. Most Democrats and independents disapprove of how ICE is enforcing laws; most Republicans approve.

A 58% majority disapproves of how Trump is handling immigration, while 42% approve, exactly the same as CNN measured in July.

The same poll found a slim 52% majority of Americans saying Trump's efforts to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally have gone too far, 31% said they have been about right and just 16% said they have not gone far enough.

The CNN poll found 61% of Americans disapproving of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's handling of her job, with just 38% approving -- worse than what Quinnipiac found among registered voters, more of whom voiced no opinion than in CNN's poll (36% approved, 52% disapproved).

The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Jan. 8-12 among 1,133 registered voters and has a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points.

A set of recently released polls found Americans largely at odds with the Trump administration and its defense of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who fatally shot Minneapolis woman Renee Good.

A Quinnipiac University poll found 53% of registered voters saying the shooting of Good was not justified, 35% saying it was justified and 12% with no opinion. Over 9 in 10 Democrats and roughly 6 in 10 independents said the shooting was not justified, but over three-quarters of Republicans said it was.

Similarly, a CNN poll found a 56% majority of Americans saying the shooting was an inappropriate use of force, with just 26% saying it was appropriate. Another 18% said they hadn't heard enough to say. About half (51%) said that the fatal shooting reflects bigger problems with the way ICE is operating.

The CNN poll also found 51% of Americans saying ICE enforcement actions were making cities less safe, with 31% saying they were making cities safer and 18% saying ICE was having little effect on safety.

There's a partisan split here, with 82% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying ICE enforcement was making cities less safe and 67% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents saying it was making cities safer.

More Americans said in the CNN poll that they were concerned about crackdowns against those protesting deportations (47%) rather than the protests getting out of hand (37%).

And Americans voiced little trust in the federal government to carry out a fair and thorough investigation of the shooting in Minneapolis, according to the CNN poll, with 62% saying they had just some or no trust at all -- including nearly half (47%) who said they had no trust at all. Just 17% said they trust the government ""a great deal"" to investigate the shooting.

In all, according to the Quinnipiac poll, 82% of U.S. voters have seen the video of Good being fatally shot by the ICE agent.

A woman who was caught on video getting forcibly pulled from a vehicle by agents in Minneapolis on Tuesday said she feels ""lucky to be alive.""

The woman, Aliya Rahman, said she was driving to an appointment at the Traumatic Brain Injury Center when the incident occurred.

""Masked agents dragged me from my car and bound me like an animal, even after I told them that I was disabled,"" she said in a statement on Thursday. ""This happened just two blocks from where Renee Good was murdered, so I am very aware that this confrontation could have ended differently for me.""

Rahman said that while in federal custody she asked for a doctor but was taken to a detention center, where she said she lost consciousness before being taken to a hospital.

""I may have more to say in the coming days but for now, I am relieved to be safe and ask for privacy as I heal from my injuries and navigate how to move forward from this traumatic experience,"" she said.

In a statement on the incident, Homeland Security said a crowd ""began impeding law enforcement operations"" of ICE officers and that several people were taken into custody for assault.

In her ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall sided with a contempt motion filed by attorneys for Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles.
Los Angeles police faced multiple allegations of excessive force during protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown last summer.
The department’s response already spawned lawsuits, including from the Los Angeles Press Club, which pointed to video evidence and scores of testimonials suggesting that law enforcement violated its own guidelines and state law.
Earlier this year a different federal judge issued an order barring the LAPD from using less-lethal munitions against journalists and nonviolent protesters — a ruling that is under appeal.","A federal judge banned Los Angeles Police Department officers from using some so-called less-lethal launchers at protests, after finding that the department violated previous court restrictions by using such projectile weapons to disperse crowds at last summer’s mass demonstrations against immigration enforcement.

In her ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall sided with a contempt motion filed by attorneys for Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles.

That same day LAPD officials sent a department-wide memo announcing an immediate moratorium on the use of the 40-millimeter weapons in light of Marshall’s ruling. The memo advised those seeking further clarity to contact the department’s risk management and legal affairs division.

“Accordingly, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY the 40mm SHALL NOT be used during any CROWD CONTROL situation,” said the memo, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times.

A preliminary injunction handed down by Marshall in 2021 placed certain restrictions on the weapons’ use, including requiring specialized training for handlers; the issuance of a warning before firing such weapons; and restricting their use only to situations in which “the officer reasonably believes that a suspect is violently resisting arrest or poses an immediate threat of violence or physical harm.”

The latest order halts the use of a weapon, recognizable by its neon green handle, that has been used by police during recent protests to clear crowds after demonstrations were declared unlawful. The weapon launches projectiles the size of a mini soda can at speeds of more than 200 mph.

But attorneys for Black Lives Matters-L.A. argued that LAPD routinely flouted the injunction — citing numerous apparent violations in their contempt motion. Officers already were barred from firing their weapons from five feet away or closer, or from targeting a person’s head, groin or spine, but attorneys argued that police repeatedly did so.

One lawyer said the department also seemed to be violating its own guidelines governing the 40-millimeter’s use by shooting journalists and others in sensitive areas such as the head.

“And they’re certainly not supposed to shoot them in the back of the head as they’re trying to leave,” said Carol Sobel, a prominent attorney whose litigation forced the LAPD to scale back aggressive crowd-control practices in the past. “The bottom line is the LAPD is going to bankrupt the city with its refusal to follow the law.”

The motion also cited a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that found such weapons shouldn’t be used to disperse crowds. It was the latest legal challenge to the use of the 40-millimeter, which the LAPD also uses in day-to-day operations. The order doesn’t apply to such uses.

In the past the department issued similar, if temporary moratoriums on the use of other projectile weapons that fire so-called skip and beanbag rounds.

This week the City Council voted in favor of new limits on the deployment of LAPD officers at protests, encouraging a “graded response” in which officers in riot gear would be deployed only if needed.

Buffalo Mayor Sean Ryan announced Friday that his administration is drafting an executive order that will prohibit the Buffalo police and other city departments from working with federal immigration agencies.

The order, he said, would ensure “no apparatus of city government interacts in any way with federal immigration.”

“And that’s going to be from building inspectors, to garbage collectors to police officers,” he said.

“What we don’t want is any chilling effect,” Ryan told civic and advocacy groups assembled at the Buffalo State University Alumni Visitor Center. “We don’t want people not coming to City Hall to avail themselves of services because they’re afraid that somehow their visit … is going to yield a phone call to immigration officials.”

Ryan did not give a timeline for signing the executive order, saying only that it would come “soon.”

Other cities, including Rochester and New York City, have laws in place that prohibit city employees from inquiring about a person’s immigration status and ban police from enforcing federal immigration law.

The mayor’s announcement follows Gov. Kathy Hochul’s endorsement Tuesday of two pieces of immigration-related legislation, part of her State of the State address.

One proposed law would allow New York residents to bring state-level civil lawsuits against federal immigration agents who they believe violate their constitutional rights. The second would ban immigration agents from schools, doctor offices, daycare centers and houses of worship unless they have a judicial warrant.

Hochul has yet to endorse the New York For All Act, which would provide a statewide ban on local law enforcement and other municipal employees from inquiring about a person’s immigration status or sharing information about their status with federal agents. New York Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins endorsed that bill earlier this month.

At Friday’s event — the annual legislative and policy briefing hosted by Partnership for the Public Good — advocates from organizations including Showing Up for Racial Justice, the New York Immigration Coalition, and Justice for Migrant Families voiced support for New York For All and Ryan’s proposed executive order.

“An executive order of non-collusion will send a powerful and needed message of solidarity and hope to those who are now living in shock and fear,” said SURJ Buffalo member Allie Doran. “Stop waiting upon the state, stop hoping police will merely withstand the pressure to comply. We must take responsibility for our own city.”

Jennifer Connor, executive director of Justice for Migrant Families, urged the Ryan administration to implement the proposed executive order.

“As a city, we can ensure that our city resources are not being used to enforce a violent federal agenda against immigrants,” she said. “We can do it and we should do it.”

Investigative Post reported last month that a handful of local agencies, including the Erie County Sheriff’s Office and Cheektowaga Police Department frequently turn detained migrants over to border agents. Those agents then send migrants to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Residents in Cheektowaga this week protested that cooperation at a town council meeting, calling for a prohibition on the police force from working with federal immigration agencies.

Ryan on Friday said city police would still enforce criminal law against migrants but that such enforcement would not result in a call to federal immigration authorities.

“If there’s any criminal activity, regardless of someone’s immigration status, law enforcement gets involved, and that’s gonna continue,” he added. “But we’re going to make sure that no apparatus of the City of Buffalo’s government is working with Homeland Security and ICE to harass people.”

Ryan declined to say that his executive order constituted a “sanctuary city” policy, saying “I don’t know what those words mean.”

He noted that Buffalo has grown in population and tax base due to refugees and immigrants settling in the city.

“We are a city with [fewer] vacant houses and [fewer] vacant storefronts, for one prime reason. We have new Americans moving into the city of Buffalo,” he said. “Stopping immigrants from coming into Buffalo is bad for our economy.”",https://www.investigativepost.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7611.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 14:58:07.244054

The Justice Department the following month fired attorney Erez Reuveni, who conceded in court that Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported.
Joseph Tirrell was mindful of his job security from the very start of the Trump administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Michael Ben'Ary was driving one of his children to soccer practice on an October evening last year when he paused at a red light to check his work phone. He was in the middle of a counterterrorism prosecution so important that President Donald Trump highlighted it in his address to Congress.

Ben'Ary said he was shocked to see his phone had been disabled. He found the explanation later in his personal email account, a letter informing him he had been fired.

A veteran prosecutor, Ben'Ary handled high-profile cases over two decades at the Justice Department, including the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent and a suicide bomb plot targeting the U.S. Capitol. Most recently he was leading the case arising from a deadly attack on American service members in Afghanistan.

Yet the same credentials that enhanced Ben'Ary's résumé spelled the undoing of his government career.

His termination without explanation came hours after right-wing commentator Julie Kelly told hundreds of thousands of online followers that Ben'Ary had previously served as a senior counsel to Lisa Monaco, the No. 2 Justice Department official in Democratic President Joe Biden's administration. Kelly also suggested Ben'Ary was part of the ""internal resistance"" to prosecuting former FBI Director James Comey, even though Ben'Ary was never involved in the case.

As Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, approaches her first year on the job, the firings of lawyers such as Ben'Ary have defined her turbulent tenure. The terminations and a larger voluntary exodus of lawyers have erased centuries of combined experience and left the department with fewer career employees to act as a bulwark for the rule of law at a time when Trump, a Republican, is testing the limits of executive power by demanding prosecutions of his political enemies.

Interviews by The Associated Press of more than a half-dozen fired employees offer a snapshot of the toll throughout the department. The departures include lawyers who prosecuted violent attacks on police at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021; environmental, civil rights and ethics enforcers; counterterrorism prosecutors; immigration judges; and attorneys who defend administration policies. This week, several prosecutors in Minnesota moved to resign amid turmoil over an investigation into the shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

""To lose people at that career level, people who otherwise intended to stay and now are either being discharged or themselves are walking away, is immensely damaging to the public interest,"" said Stuart Gerson, a senior official in the George H.W. Bush administration and acting attorney general early in Bill Clinton's administration. ""We're losing really capable people, people who have never viewed themselves as political and attempted to do the right thing.""

Justice Connection, a network of department alums, estimates that more than 230 lawyers, agents and other employees from across the department were fired last year, apparently because of their work on cases they were assigned or past criticism of Trump, or seemingly no reason. More than 6,400 employees are estimated to have left a department that at the end of 2025 had roughly 108,000, the group says.

The Justice Department says it has hired thousands of career attorneys over the past year. The Trump administration has characterized some of the fired and departed workers as out of step with its agenda.

Ben'Ary left with unfinished business, including the prosecution stemming from the airport bombing in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and the national security unit he led at the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Left to pack his belongings, he posted a typed note near his door that functioned as a distress call, reminding colleagues they had sworn an oath to follow the facts ""without fear or favor"" and ""unhindered by political interference.""

But, he warned, ""In recent months, the political leadership of the Department have violated these principles, jeopardizing our national security and making American citizens less safe.""

Unparalleled in scale, scope and motivation

Since its founding in 1870, the Justice Department has occupied elevated status in American democracy, sustained through transitions of power by reliance on facts, evidence and law.

To be sure, there has always been a political component to the department, with lawyers appointed by the president.

But even during turbulent times, when attorneys general have been pushed out by presidents or resigned rather than accede to White House demands — as in the Watergate-era ""Saturday Night Massacre"" — the department's rank and file have generally been insulated thanks to long-recognized civil service protections.

""This is completely unprecedented in both its scale and scope and underlying motivation,"" said Peter Keisler, a senior official in the George W. Bush Justice Department.

In his first term, Trump pushed out one attorney general and accepted another's resignation, but the workforce remained largely intact. He returned to office in January 2025 seething over Biden-era prosecutions of him and vowing retribution.

The firings began even before Bondi arrived in February. Prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team that investigated Trump were terminated days after the inauguration, followed by prosecutors hired on temporary assignments for cases resulting from the Capitol insurrection in 2021.

""The people working on these cases were not political agents of any kind,"" said Aliya Khalidi, a Jan. 6 prosecutor who was fired. ""It's all people who just care about the rule of law.""

The firings have continued, at times surgical, at times random and almost always without explanation.

Adam Schleifer, a Los Angeles prosecutor targeted in a social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer over past critical comments of Trump, was fired in March. The Justice Department the following month fired attorney Erez Reuveni, who conceded in court that Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported. Reuveni later accused the department of trying to mislead judges to execute deportations. Department officials deny the assertion.

Two weeks after Maurene Comey completed a sex trafficking trial against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, the New York prosecutor was fired, also without explanation. Like Ben'Ary, she wrote a pointed farewell, telling colleagues that ""fear is the tool of a tyrant."" Her father, the former FBI director who was a frequent Trump target, said those same words after being indicted in September in a case that has been dismissed.

Among the most affected sections is the storied Civil Rights Division. A recent open letter of protest was signed by more than 200 employees who left in 2025, with several supervisors recently giving notice of plans to depart. The Public Integrity Section, which prosecutes sensitive public corruption cases, has also been hollowed out by resignations.

The Justice Department has disputed the accounts of some of those who have been fired or quit and has defended the termination of those who investigated Trump as ""consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.""

""This is the most efficient Department of Justice in American history, and our attorneys will continue to deliver measurable results for the American people,"" the department said in a statement. More than 3,400 career attorneys have been hired since Trump took office, the department says.

The departures have caused backlogs and staff shortages, with senior leaders soliciting job applications. It has affected the department's daily business as well as efforts to fulfill Trump's desires to prosecute political opponents.

Desperate for lawyers willing to file criminal cases against Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, the administration in September forced out the veteran U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, replacing him with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide with no experience as a federal prosecutor.

Halligan secured the indictments but the win was short-lived.

One judge later identified grave missteps in how Halligan presented the Comey case to a grand jury. Another dismissed both prosecutions outright, calling Halligan's appointment unlawful.

Smith, the special counsel who investigated Trump but left before he could be fired, has himself lamented the losses. ""These are not partisans,"" he recently told lawmakers.

""They just want to do good work,"" he added, ""and I think when you lose that culture, you lose a lot.""

'Our dream was to be federal prosecutors'

Khalidi joined the department in 2023 in a group of new prosecutors hired to help with the hundreds of cases stemming from the Capitol riot.

Upon Trump's return to the White House, she watched cases she prosecuted get dismantled by Trump's sweeping clemency for all 1,500 defendants charged in the riot, including those who attacked police.

Less than two weeks later, a Justice Department demand for the names of FBI agents involved in Jan. 6 investigations triggered rumors of potential mass firings. Worried about the agents she worked with, Khalidi spent the day checking in on them. But as she started preparing dinner one Friday evening, she received an email suggesting she had lost her own job.

Attached was a memo from then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordering the firings of prosecutors such as Khalidi who had been hired for temporary assignments but were moved into permanent roles after Trump's win, a maneuver Bove called ""subversive personnel actions by the previous administration."" Neither the email nor memo identified the fired prosecutors, leaving them to guess.

Khalidi grabbed a suitcase to collect family photos and other personal items she kept at work and rushed to the office, retreating with fellow shocked prosecutors to a bar where they received termination emails.

The group of 15 fired attorneys later assembled to surrender their computers and phones, entering the same room where they gathered on their first day in 2023.

""For a lot of us, our dream was to be federal prosecutors,"" Khalidi said. ""And so we had happy memories of that room, of being excited on our first day. So it was just kind of surreal to be back there turning in our stuff.""

The news came for Anam Petit, an immigration judge, during a break between hearings.

Hired during the Biden administration, she said she felt a little uneasy when Trump won the election but also figured her position would probably be safe because immigration judges generally have job stability and because they bear responsibility for issuing removal orders for those who are in the United States illegally, a core presidential priority.

Petit arrived on Sept. 5 bracing for bad news because it was the Friday of the pay period before her two-year work anniversary, when her probationary appointment was poised to become permanent. Though she said she had received strong performance reviews and had already exceeded her case completion goal for the year, she had become anxious as colleagues were fired amid an administration push to accelerate deportations.

She was in the courtroom between hearings when she learned via email that she had been fired. She left to text her husband, then returned to the courtroom to render a decision in the case before her.

""I just put my phone back in my pocket and went into the courtroom and delivered my decision, with a very shaky voice and shaky hands, trying to center myself back to that decision just so that I could relay it,"" Petit said.

Joseph Tirrell was mindful of his job security from the very start of the Trump administration. As the department's chief ethics officer, he had affirmed that Smith, the special counsel, was entitled to a law firm's free legal services, a decision he sensed had the potential to rile incoming leadership.

But he remained in the position and over the ensuing months counseled Bondi's staff on the propriety of accepting various gifts, including a cigar box from mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor.

He was fired in July, just before a FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey that Tirrell had said Bondi could not ethically accept a free invitation to. He was not terribly surprised, he says, when it was later reported that Bondi attended in Trump's box. The Justice Department said in a statement that none of Tirrell's advice ""was ever overruled"" and that ""the Attorney General obtained ethics approval to attend this event in her official capacity as a member of the FIFA Task Force.""

""There's a great deal of fear there just because I was fired and just because so many others were summarily fired,"" Tirrell said. ""Are you going to get fired because you provided ethics advice? Are you going to get fired because you have a pride flag on your desk?""

'Our country depends on you'

Trump was promoting his administration's commitment to counterterrorism during his address to Congress in March when he announced a success: the capture of a militant from the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate who was charged in the Kabul airport bombing that killed 13 American service members during the 2021 withdrawal from the country.

Mohammad Sharifullah arrived the following day in the United States, encountering Ben'Ary in an Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom.

Ben'Ary spent the next several months working on the case, but on Oct. 1, he was fired. It was the apparent result, he told colleagues, of a social media post he said contained ""false information"" — a reference to the one from Kelly, the commentator.

The termination was so abrupt that Ben'Ary could not tell his colleagues where he had saved important filings and notes. Another prosecutor listed on the case, James Comey's son-in-law, Troy Edwards, had resigned days earlier upon Comey's indictment. Once set for trial last month, the case has been postponed.

In his farewell note, Ben'Ary observed that he was not alone, that in ""just a few short months"" career employees like himself had been removed from U.S. attorneys offices, the FBI ""and other critical parts of DOJ.""

""While I am no longer your colleague, I ask that each of you continue to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons,"" Ben'Ary wrote. ""Follow the facts and the law. Stand up for what we all believe in — our Constitution and the rule of law. Our country depends on you.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2026/01/17/AP26009728317687_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:04.448984

Walz says Trump has 'weaponized' federal justice system

WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation of Minnesota officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, over an alleged conspiracy to impede immigration agents, a source familiar with the probe said on Friday.

The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said subpoenas were prepared for Walz and Frey as part of the inquiry, but it was not immediately clear whether they had been served.

The investigation, first reported by CBS News, stems from statements made by Walz and Frey about the thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents deployed to the Minneapolis region in recent weeks under orders from President Donald Trump, the source said.

Reacting on social media to news of the investigation, Walz, who unsuccessfully ran for the vice presidency in the 2024 election won by Trump, said the federal justice system was being weaponized to intimidate Trump's perceived political enemies.

""Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly. Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic,"" Walz said.

The governor was referring to U.S. Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, Democrats from Michigan and Arizona, who made a video statement urging members of the military to resist illegal orders, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump has criticized as being too hesitant to raise interest rates.

Reacting to a CNN report on the investigation, Frey said separately: ""This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city.""

The Justice Department declined to comment. But U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a message on social media platform X on Friday evening, saying: ""A reminder to all those in Minnesota; No one is above the law.""

It would be highly unusual for federal prosecutors to bring a criminal conspiracy case based on statements from public officials about government policies.

The Trump administration has sent nearly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota since early last week, triggering angry protests in Minneapolis over the surge in immigration agents on the streets of the state's most populous city.

Confrontations between residents and federal officers have become increasingly tense after an ICE agent fatally shot a U.S. citizen, Renee Good, 37, behind the wheel of her car, in Minneapolis on January 7, triggering daily protests that have spread to other cities.

Although he has urged protesters to remain peaceful, Walz also has encouraged citizens to record video of any arrests or other encounters between ICE agents and members of the public in order to create a database for potential ""future prosecution"" of wrongdoing by law enforcement.

Walz and Frey have repeatedly demanded that Trump end the ICE deployment, saying the militarized deportation drive was a reckless operation aimed at sowing chaos, fear and headlines, and was putting civilians in danger.

Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche earlier this week blamed Walz and Frey for the confrontations and said he was focused on stopping them by ""whatever means necessary, opens new tab

Legal experts have said the Justice Department's demands for voter roll data are unprecedented and raise privacy concerns.
In his ruling on Thursday, Carter said the Justice Department has not provided an adequate basis for its need to access such sensitive, nonpublic voter roll data.","A federal judge in California this week struck down the Justice Department's demand for the state to hand over sensitive voter roll data, ruling that it would trample on residents' privacy rights and potentially disenfranchise voters.

""The taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece-by-piece until there is nothing left,"" said David Carter, a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of California, in a ruling on Thursday.

""The case before the Court is one of these cuts that imperils all Americans. The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the Legislative Branch, not the Executive. The Constitution demands such respect, and the Executive may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections it seeks to do so here.""

The decision is the first formal court decision of what is expected to be many, after the Justice Department filed nearly two dozen lawsuits around the country ordering states to hand over voter roll data containing sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, addresses and driver's license numbers.

Another federal judge in Oregon, meanwhile, separately signaled earlier this week he tentatively plans to dismiss the Justice Department's voter roll lawsuit against the state.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has sent demands to at least 43 states so far asking them to hand over voter roll data, according to a tally kept by the Brennan Center for Justice. On Friday, the division added another, filing a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Virginia for failing to produce its voter registration lists.

The Civil Rights Division has claimed it needs the data to ensure compliance with two federal laws — the Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act — which require states to establish programs for maintaining clean voting lists so people ineligible to vote, such as convicted felons.

But government documents previously reviewed by CBS News show that the Justice Department is actually working with the Department of Homeland Security to hand over the data so that it can be used in pursuit of criminal and immigration investigations.

Justice Department officials have not communicated their plans to share the data with DHS with the states.

In an Aug. 28 virtual meeting with secretaries of state, a former Civil Rights Division official told them the data would only be used to ensure they had clean voter lists and pledged to analyze the information ""securely and discreetly,"" according to notes on the meeting shared with CBS News by a participant.

Legal experts have said the Justice Department's demands for voter roll data are unprecedented and raise privacy concerns. The federal Privacy Act requires the government to provide public notice and comment before it collects records on individuals.

The Justice Department has argued it also has a right to access the data under the Civil Rights Act, which requires states to retain voter registration records for up to 22 months after an election.

The law states that the Justice Department can issue a written demand to inspect the records, but it must provide ""a statement of the basis and the purpose"" for the request.

In his ruling on Thursday, Carter said the Justice Department has not provided an adequate basis for its need to access such sensitive, nonpublic voter roll data.

He also cited prior media reports showing that the true purpose behind the data request is to use it for immigration and criminal enforcement.

""The Court does not take lightly DOJ's obfuscation of its true motives in the present matter,"" Carter wrote. ""Congress passed the NVRA, Civil Rights Act, and HAVA to protect voting rights. If the DOJ wants to instead use these statutes for more than their stated purpose, circumventing the authority granted to them by Congress, it cannot do so under the guise of a pretextual investigative purpose.""

Dax Goldstein, the Election Protection Program Director at the States United Democracy Center, hailed the decision from the court on Thursday.

""Today the court sent a clear message: states run elections, not the administration,"" Goldstein said in a statement to CBS.

""This decision serves as a vindication of what states have been arguing for months: There is no legal basis for the federal government's sweeping demands for voters' most sensitive information.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/16/9d60cdc3-b220-4bdd-bf6c-97278f4c9c47/thumbnail/1200x630/c513578ac422aa0e43a0c4b6511b979b/gettyimages-2244588264.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 15:58:45.057755

Whether ICE or some other law enforcement officer asks you that question, don’t answer it, Hwang said.

He recommends using the same question: “Am I free to go?”

If the officer says no, and you’re undocumented, Hwang said your best bet is to, once again, remain silent and ask to speak with a lawyer.

“ICE needs probable cause to arrest you, and if they don’t know who you are, the only way that they can get that probable cause to arrest you is through things that you say to them,” Hwang said. “That’s why they’re asking you these questions. That’s why they’re going to keep badgering you — to give them enough information that allows them to arrest you.”

What shouldn’t you do?

Don’t try to run away or flee the situation, Hwang said.

In addition, don’t lie to an officer or show any false documents.

“If you do any of these things, then that might give them sort of probable cause to be able to then detain you and arrest you,” Hwang said.

Should you film ICE agents?

Hwang says yes — in fact, bystanders play a more critical role than ever in this moment.

“Having video, graphic evidence of what ICE is actually doing is incredibly important,” he said. “Not just for the person who’s subject to this enforcement … but really to hold ICE accountable — to try to change their actions and show them that they can’t keep pushing the line [and] that what they are doing is improper and illegal.”

Although ICE agents can certainly tell people to stop filming, you don’t have to stop.

“Courts have long recognized the right to record law enforcement carrying out their duties in public spaces,” Hwang said. “We do this because we have to be able to hold officials accountable for their actions.”

But at the same time, Hwang said, use your best judgment.

Before recording, he recommended asking yourself: Will recording escalate the situation? Are you in a safe position? Is the person interacting with ICE in a safer position with you recording?

What should you do with ICE footage?

One thing Hwang asks is that people don’t live stream or post to social media without permission from the detainee.

“There are immigrants and people in our country who come here fleeing persecution, and they may have good reasons to not want their face publicized or their names out there — because they fear harm or some retribution,” he said.

NPR reporters on the ground in Minneapolis have witnessed federal agents pulling people off the streets and out of their cars or questioning people of color on their immigration status.

In response, community members have protested, throwing snowballs at federal agents and blocking ICE vehicles. In turn, agents have deployed tear gas, tackled, or arrested those demonstrators.

Experts on immigration and policing say what is unfolding in Minneapolis reflects a broader national shift: federal immigration authorities are pushing the limits of their power, deploying to cities with little formal coordination with local officials — a move that is creating confusion, fear and mistrust.

The Trump administration, however, says this is what Americans want, and the actions of immigration in Minnesota are justified.

In a statement to NPR, Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin says, ""President Trump and [DHS] Secretary Noem are delivering on the American people's mandate to deport illegal aliens.""

McLaughlin continues, ""70% of illegal aliens arrested by ICE have been charged with or convicted of a crime in the U.S. The American people, the law, and common sense are on our side, and we will not stop until law and order is restored after Biden's open border chaos flooded our country with the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""

Data published by the University of California Berkeley's Deportation Data Project shows that in the first nine months of President Trump's second term, around 75,000 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not have a criminal record – over a third of all ICE arrests.

Shifting norms

The scenes in Minneapolis underscore how dramatically immigration enforcement has changed, says Nithya Nathan-Pineau, a policy attorney and strategist with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an advocacy group that provides legal resources for immigrants

""These sort of established ways of working … really seem to have eroded and changed,"" she says, pointing to more physically aggressive tactics by agents when arresting individuals and in responding to protesters.

Just months ago, NPR published a guide explaining what is — and is not — legal during ICE encounters. Even then, legal experts warned it was ""a very confusing time for lawyers and the public alike.""

Since then, advocates say, federal authorities have pushed the boundaries of enforcement practices even further, making it harder for people to know their rights or trust they will be respected.

""There's always a fear of telling somebody, well, these are your rights, and then realizing that that officer might not, at that moment, recognize them,"" says Janice Iwama, a professor at American University in Washington, D.C., who studies immigration and policing.

A confusing collection of federal agencies enforce immigration law

On Thursday, the ACLU and its Minnesota chapter filed another lawsuit against the federal government on the behalf of three Minnesotans challenging ""the administration's policy of racially profiling, unlawfully seizing, and unlawfully arresting people without a warrant and without probable cause.""

More than 2,000 federal immigration agents are currently operating in Minnesota, a number that officials say is expected to increase.

In her statement to NPR, McLaughlin says that Operation Metro Surge, the name of the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, ""is the largest DHS operation in history.""

The Department of Homeland Security declined to get into specific resources or the number of personnel.

There's a patchwork of federal agents - all trained in different policing methods – carrying out immigration enforcement. Based on NPR reporter observations the deployment in Minneapolis includes agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Bureau of Prisons – agencies typically focused on criminal investigations or running the nation's prisons rather than civil immigration enforcement.

Minneapolis isn't the only place this has happened. Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives have been involved in immigration operations in other cities, according to analysis by the CATO Institute, a Libertarian think-tank based in Washington, D.C.

Nathan-Pineau said that in her 15 years working in immigration law, she has never seen operations ""of this scale launched in so many locations in such a short period of time.""

That's even considering former President Barack Obama's two terms in office, which were characterized by record-high deportation numbers. The American Immigration Council says from fiscal year 2009-2016, the U.S. saw more than 2.7 million deportations – at the time more people than any other president in U.S. history.

Former U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske agrees, ""this is unique and different [from] anything that's ever been done.""

Tensions arise over tactics and training

Former Commissioner Kerlikowske says immigration law is among the most complex areas of U.S. law, blending civil and criminal elements — and that most federal agents now participating in these operations have no background or training in it.

He says the same is true for policing dense, urban environments.

""The Border Patrol is called the Border Patrol for a reason, and they work best in these isolated areas along the border or within 25 miles of the border at checkpoints. Policing an urban environment is very, very different"" and requires special skills and knowledge, he says.

Those training gaps, he says, are visible in videos from Minneapolis and other cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, where federal agents have used pepper balls and tear gas in ways that violate standard policing practices.

In her statements to NPR, McLaughlin strongly defends the training and experience of agents on the ground and their tactics, explaining they are ""subject to months of training,"" which includes de-escalation and arrest techniques, firearms instruction and conflict management.

But Kerlikowske says he sees officers that are "" totally unprepared and incapable of handling these crowds,"" he said. ""They're not only intense and aggressive – they're operating outside of any of the standard practices of a law enforcement agency.""

He pointed to videos showing officers firing pepper balls directly at people or throwing tear gas canisters from moving vehicles — tactics he said no police department allows.

""They are totally unchecked,"" he says.

However, the Trump administration maintains agents are well-trained, but are dealing with aggressive protesters.

DHS tweeted about a Jan. 13 incident during which ICE arrested four people they call ""illegal aliens."" While officers made these arrests, ""a significant crowd surrounded them and began impeding law enforcement operations — a federal crime. One agitator ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene, she was arrested for obstruction,"" according to the post.

In response to criticism over training, assistant secretary McLaughlin says, ""DHS law enforcement officers are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and our officers.""

Targeted operations are no longer the norm. What does that mean for residents?

Historically, immigration enforcement focused on targeted arrests of people with final orders of deportation or conducting workplace raids based on specific intelligence.

For months now, immigration agents have been seen riding in unmarked vehicles to public spaces and making arrests.

Many of these arrests are being done in public because officers are still required to have a warrant to conduct any type of search or seizure, says Iwama, the American University professor.

ICE and Border Patrol agents have the authority to question and detain people they believe are in the country unlawfully, but experts say the way that authority is being exercised raises serious concerns.

Vice President JD Vance said in a press conference recently that immigration agents plan to go door to door in an attempt to find undocumented immigrants. Whether agents are actually doing this has yet to be confirmed by NPR.

On Monday, NPR witnessed multiple instances where immigration agents drove around Minneapolis and questioned people, including some U.S. citizens, about their immigration status. Some took place in the parking lots of big box stores. All of the people questioned were people of color. All of them were able to prove they were in the U.S. legally after showing documentation.

Kerlikowske says agents are increasingly relying on these so-called ""Kavanaugh stops,"" which are brief detentions based on minimal suspicion, which can quickly escalate.

Assistant Secretary McLaughlin continues to defend the actions of agents, telling NPR ""allegations that ICE engages in 'racial profiling' are disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE…. A person's immigration status makes them a target for enforcement, not their skin color, race or ethnicity.""

What is the long-term impact of this kind of operation?

It's standard practice for federal agencies and local police to coordinate a joint task force for major crime events. Except for immigration, says Kerlikowske, where there may not be the same level of coordination, since immigration enforcement rests entirely with the federal government.

""You don't want to be a police chief and then have a federal agency parachute into your city and start taking enforcement action without some level of communication and coordination,"" says Kerlikowske, who spent nine years in Seattle as a police chief prior to his work with the federal government.

""But it's very clear that that is not happening in any of these cities,"" he adds.

The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office says they are not working with federal agencies in their immigration enforcement. There are six local law enforcement agencies within the state of Minnesota that have a 287(g) agreement – which means they are coordinating with federal authorities on immigration enforcement, according to ICE's own database.

McLaughlin said in response to NPR's question on current efforts to get Minneapolis-area law enforcement agencies to sign 287(g) agreements, ""We would love for state and local law enforcement to sign 287(g) agreements to help us remove criminal illegal aliens from Minnesota. 287(g) is critical to having the enforcement we need to arrest criminal illegal aliens across the country.""

The Trump administration's position is that these street-level enforcement actions wouldn't be necessary if sanctuary cities, like Minneapolis, didn't prevent ICE from picking up undocumented individuals from local jails.

""Why are DHS law enforcement surging to sanctuary cities? Because sanctuary jurisdictions won't let us in their jails to arrest the violent criminal illegal aliens in their custody,"" says McLaughlin. ""As a result, DHS officers are forced to find the released criminal illegal aliens on the streets WITHOUT the support of local law enforcement.""

But the continued presence of federal agents ""puts local police officers in an impossible position,"" says Iwama. Because most residents are not differentiating between the federal agents they see taking away their immigrant neighbors and local police they see in their communities.

This is especially unfortunate given that local police in Minneapolis have worked in recent years following the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent protests to regain the trust of residents, she said. ""And of course, here now you have this event happening which is out of their control.""

The consequences, Iwama and Kerlikowske say, will ripple beyond immigration enforcement, affecting crime reporting, community cooperation and public safety across entire cities.

""When federal law enforcement leaves, local police officers are going to be required to deal with trying to make amends with a community that might no longer trust any agents,"" Iwama says.

The ruling comes ahead of planned weekend protests against the widespread immigration action in the city and follows the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier this month.

The US Department of Homeland Security said it is taking measures to protect officers from rioters.

On Friday, Minnesota officials urged protesters expected to take to the streets this weekend to stay orderly and peaceful.

The state's National Guard has been placed on alert and other law enforcement officers have been deployed ahead of both expected anti-ICE demonstrations and a counter march being planned by a conservative influencer.

Judge Menendez's 83-page order bars federal agents from arresting and ""using pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity"".

The ruling, which stems from a lawsuit filed by a group of protesters in December, also limits agents from ""stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering"" with their work.

Despite wind chills that plummeted below zero, throngs of demonstrators protested in the snow Friday night near the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis.

Demonstrations intensified last week after 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was fatally shot in her car by an ICE agent. Tensions flared again this week when another agent shot and injured a Venezuelan man accused of “violently” resisting arrest, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Ruling protects peaceful protests

Federal agents from Operation Metro Surge are not allowed to arrest or retaliate against peaceful protesters or use “pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools” against them, US District Judge Katherine Menendez ruled in a preliminary injunction issued Friday.

Menendez also said the agents can no longer stop and detain drivers when there is “no reasonable articulable suspicion” they are forcibly obstructing or interfering with federal operations. “The act of safely following” the officers “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge added.

The order only applies in Minnesota and only to agents involved in the current operation, and does not apply to other federal officers handling routine duties elsewhere, the order specified.

In a response to the ruling, the Department of Homeland Security said it is “taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters.”

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said despite these threats, agents follow training and use “the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.”

The preliminary injunction was requested by activists who filed a lawsuit last month alleging the federal government was violating their constitutional rights. The case is separate from a different lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the Twin Cities on Monday seeking a court-ordered end to what it calls a “federal invasion” during Operation Metro Surge.

The Trump administration accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of ""actively organizing"" anti-ICE resistance after officials from the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) accused the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of lying about how the state is handling its illegal immigration problem.

DHS called on Walz and Frey earlier this week to honor federal immigration detainers for the more than 1,300 illegal aliens that the federal agency said the state of Minnesota had in custody, accusing officials in the state of releasing nearly 470 criminal illegal immigrants onto Minneapolis' streets. Walz's office subsequently disputed DHS's claim, calling it ""categorically false"" that the state does not honor federal immigration detainers, meant to hold criminal illegal aliens in custody after committing a crime until Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can come pick them up.

In a press release Thursday, the Minnesota DOC echoed Walz's verbiage that DHS's claims were ""categorically false,"" adding that they are ""unsupported by facts and deeply irresponsible"" as well. The Minnesota DOC also claimed that they have ""always"" coordinated with ICE agents when individuals in custody have detainers.

""DHS’s assertion that 1,360 non-U.S. citizens are in Minnesota’s state custody is inexplicable.

Further, in 2025, 84 individuals with ICE detainers were released. In each case, ICE was notified in advance and DOC staff coordinated with ICE officials to facilitate the custody transfer when requested.""

According to the Minnesota DOC, DHS did not identify which ""jurisdictions, systems, or timeframes"" were relied upon by the agency to support their numbers, and said that they did not align ""with DOC records or the reality of Minnesota's prison system.""

But the Trump administration stood behind their numbers and claims in a statement to Fox News Digital from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, arguing Walz and Frey were ""actively encouraging an organized resistance to ICE and federal law enforcement officers.""

""As DHS stated, across the state of Minnesota nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens including violent criminal illegal aliens have been RELEASED into communities. We have more than 1,360 active detainers on illegal aliens in the custody across all jurisdictions in Minnesota,"" McLaughlin said. ""We are once again calling on Governor Walz and his fellow sanctuary politicians to commit to honoring all ICE detainers.""

REPUBLICANS URGE TRUMP NOT TO INVOKE INSURRECTION ACT IN MINNEAPOLIS AMID UNREST AFTER ICE-INVOLVED SHOOTING

On the heels of a fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month involving federal ICE officers, Minneapolis Mayor Frey told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to ""get the f---- out"" of his city, while Walz similarly told the Trump administration to ""leave Minnesota alone."" Mayor Frey has also issued an executive order prohibiting federal agents from using city property to conduct operations, and a city separation ordinance was recently bolstered by local Minneapolis officials to protect illegal immigrants.

Meanwhile, in February, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued a formal opinion arguing state law prohibited state and local law enforcement from holding someone solely on an ICE civil detainer.

The danger of not properly adhering to ICE detainers reared its head in December after an illegal immigrant with a detainer in Northern Virginia was released from custody and then subsequently killed someone a day later.

Later, as Good was being pronounced dead at a local hospital, police were trying to evacuate ICE officers from the scene while angry protesters cut down crime-scene tape around the area, according to an incident report that recorded communications between emergency responders.

""ICE BEING SURROUNDED,"" one person transmitted at 11:01 a.m., about 80 minutes after the shooting, according to the report.

The transcripts surfaced hours before news that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating Minnesota officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, over an alleged conspiracy to impede immigration agents.

A source familiar with the matter confirmed reports in the Washington Post, CBS News and other outlets that the probe stems from statements made by Walz and Frey, both Democrats, about the thousands of federal agents deployed to the Minneapolis region in recent weeks. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.

Both officials along with other Minnesota Democrats have denounced the ICE operation and Good's death, and they accused Trump of intentionally fomenting chaos.

THOUSANDS OF FEDERAL AGENTS SENT TO MINNESOTA

Minnesota's most populous city has seen increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers since Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot behind the wheel of her car on January 7 by an ICE officer, Jonathan Ross.

At the time, Good was taking part in one of numerous neighborhood patrols organized by local activists to track and monitor ICE activities.

The shooting came a day after the Trump administration announced the deployment of 2,000 immigration agents to Minneapolis in what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called its largest such operation in history.

The surge in DHS personnel has since grown to nearly 3,000, dwarfing the ranks of local police officers in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

Since the ICE surge, agents have arrested both immigrants and protesters, at times smashing windows and pulling people from their cars. Some officers have found themselves surrounded by onlookers jeering and shouting at them for stopping Blacks and Latinos who turned out to be U.S. citizens.

Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has floated the idea of creating a public database of people arrested on suspicion of interfering with ICE operations or assaulting officers, saying on Fox News on Thursday their identities would then be known to their employers and neighbors.

Trump administration officials have complained about what they call the ""doxing"" of federal agents, including Ross, saying that puts officers at risk, leading them to wear masks to protect their identities.

In the case of the Good shooting, Trump and other administration officials accused her of deliberately trying to run over Ross and other agents at the scene with her car. Videos showed she turned her wheels away from the officers, and Democratic city and state officials have rejected the government's account as false.

The Trump administration has said Ross was injured during the incident - although video shows him walking around afterward - while noting he was seriously hurt months earlier in an unrelated traffic stop that resulted in him being dragged behind a vehicle.

MINNEAPOLIS ARRESTS

Trump has said the Minneapolis deployment was prompted in part by allegations of fraud among the state's large Somali American community. Trump has called Somali immigrants ""garbage"" and said they should be thrown out of the country.

The DHS said on X that 12 ""agitators"" were arrested on Thursday night for assaulting law enforcement, without providing details.

As Trump's deportation drive in Minneapolis neared the end of its second week, the Good shooting remained the only fatality associated with the surge.

Fire department records showed paramedics were on the scene four minutes after the shooting was reported, finding Good in her car unresponsive with four apparent gunshot wounds, including one to her head and two to her chest.

Emergency personnel tried to revive her, both at the scene and in the ambulance en route to the hospital. She was pronounced dead less than an hour after being shot.

Meanwhile, at the shooting scene, police were trying to prevent more violence, according to an incident report that recorded communications among first responders.

""CROWD GETTING HOSTILE,"" the incident record reads at 9:50 a.m., 12 minutes after the shooting. ""CONTACT WHO IS IN CHARGE OF FEDS AND HAVE THEM LEAVE SCENE.""

At 11:01 a.m., ICE agents were ""being surrounded,"" and protesters were throwing snowballs at them – but not at police, the report says. The agents finally left the scene by 11:20 a.m.

On Friday, at the spot where Good was shot, a makeshift memorial continued to grow and attract visitors, despite frigid temperatures and falling snow.

Residents have cordoned off the area where Good's car slammed into a light pole, while hand-painted signs call for justice and include anti-ICE slogans.

Rand Paul, to convene oversight hearings and call Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to testify, after the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Good's fatal shooting on Jan. 7 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer has sparked days of protests and heated clashes with federal officers, and it's prompted renewed scrutiny of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics.

In a letter first obtained by CBS News, Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, led by ranking member Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, called on Paul, a Kentucky senator, to use the panel's authority to hold hearings and potentially issue subpoenas to senior administration officials.

In addition to Noem and Homan, the lawmakers said ICE acting director Todd Lyons, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott, Border Patrol Chief Michael Banks and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino should be called before the committee.

The senators said the deployment of federal agents has occurred ""without appropriate coordination with state and local law enforcement."" They also accused federal officers of engaging in ""numerous operations involving excessive uses of force,"" including in the case of Good's killing.

Good sustained at least three gunshot wounds, and possibly a fourth, according to a Minneapolis Fire Department incident report obtained by CBS News Minnesota. The newly released details followed a week of protests in Minnesota that prompted President Trump to threaten invoking the Insurrection Act. The rarely used law would allow him to deploy the U.S. military to the state or federalize the National Guard.

Democrats say Good's killing is part of a broader pattern. They catalogued incidents beyond Minnesota, alleging federal agents appear to have used excessive force in firing pepper balls at peaceful protesters, detaining U.S. citizens during immigration raids — despite proof of citizenship — and deploying tear gas and pepper balls against journalists covering demonstrations.

The lawmakers also expressed concern about agents conducting operations while masked and their use of unmarked vehicles, both practices they say have fueled fear and confusion in communities.

The senators accuse DHS leadership of failing to fairly and transparently investigate such incidents. They faulted Noem for claiming publicly that ""no American citizens have been arrested or detained,"" despite lawsuits, rulings and reporting that indicate otherwise, and for stating in the immediate aftermath of Good's killing that she had committed an act of domestic terrorism.

In response to the Democrats' letter, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, ""DHS is a law enforcement agency — enforcing the rule of law passed by Congress. If members don't like the law, it is quite literally their job to change it.""

She added, ""As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, politicians are more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually removing criminals from our streets.""

Noem last testified before Congress on Dec. 11, during a contentious House hearing on immigration enforcement that ended abruptly when she left early, a move Democrats criticized as evading oversight. A subsequent Democratic effort to subpoena her testimony was blocked by Republicans.

The push for Senate hearings comes as Congress negotiates funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Lawmakers passed a three-bill package this week funding several federal agencies, but left DHS unresolved after Democrats said they would not support a funding bill without new accountability measures for ICE.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats in both chambers are demanding changes to ICE's conduct as part of the appropriations process, ahead of a Jan. 30 shutdown deadline.

The oversight demand also comes as ICE operations expand nationwide. CBS News reported Friday that the agency's detainee population has reached a record high of 73,000.

With Republicans in control of the Senate, Democrats cannot compel hearings or subpoenas on their own. But the letter places pressure on the GOP chairman at a moment when scrutiny of ICE operations, DHS leadership and federal enforcement tactics is intensifying.

ICE restraining order granted

What we know:

The order granted late Friday by U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez bans agents from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles who are not interfering with or obstructing federal agents or following them from a safe distance.

The order applies to ""all persons who do or will in the future record, observe, and/or protest Operation Metro Surge and related operations that have been ongoing… since Dec. 4, 2025.""

The backstory:

Menendez initially declined to bring an immediate end to the ICE surge in Minnesota during a court hearing two days earlier, instead ruling to fast-track arguments in the lawsuit, while demanding federal authorities submit its response by Monday, Jan. 19.

The State of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed the lawsuit and motion for a temporary restraining order in an attempt to bring an end to the ICE surge that is underway in Minnesota.

In its argument, the state cites ""harm"" brought by the surge, including the shooting of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an ICE agent a week ago, among other conflicts.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution.

Dig deeper:

The lawsuit argues that the recent surge of federal law enforcement officers that has brought at least 2,100 ICE officers and Homeland Security investigators into the state is ""unconstitutional and unlawful.""

It seeks to end the surge, while also blocking the Trump administration from moving forward any similar actions in Minnesota in the future.

The 1924 law set a cap on total immigration to just a fifth of the pre-first world war number.
The Immigration Act also established the category of “illegal alien” for the first time, as well as visa requirements.
A century later, the 1924 Immigration Act still has fans.
With the return of immigration to the United States after the abolition of racial quotas in 1965 came economic growth.","On 14 January, the Trump administration announced a stop on issuing immigrant visas for applicants from 75 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as 10 countries from eastern Europe. The Department of Homeland Security justified the decision by claiming that immigrants from these countries are at “high risk” of reliance on welfare and becoming a “public charge”.

As an immigration scholar, I was immediately struck by the falsehood of this economic justification. The vast majority of immigrants have been legally disqualified from cash welfare since 1996. Those who do qualify for benefits like Snap and Medicaid use them at much lower rates than non-immigrants. Through their taxes, immigrants are net contributors – especially undocumented immigrants who are excluded from federal benefits.

I also noted a pattern uniting the countries on the list: nearly all were also restricted through the 1924 Immigration Act’s racial quotas.

Abolished in 1965, due to the civil-rights movement’s demands for equality of all races under the law, racial quotas were at the heart of the 1924 Immigration Act, also called the Johnson-Reed Act, which for four decades restricted immigration to the United States on the basis of nation of origin.

Albert Johnson, its lead author, was a representative from Washington, and a eugenicist, who believed that “our capacity to maintain our cherished institutions stands diluted by a stream of alien blood”. Johnson, who boasted about participating in Ku Klux Klan violence against south Asians, wrote the Immigration Act to exclude anyone who was not a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.

The 1924 law set a cap on total immigration to just a fifth of the pre-first world war number. It used the 1890 census to determine annual quotas for who could come from where, allocating nearly nine out of 10 slots to people from northern and western Europe, with the remaining largely set aside for people from southern and eastern Europe. Asians were totally barred, save for a few slots for people from the Levant, and total African admissions were capped at 1,200 people each year.

The Immigration Act also established the category of “illegal alien” for the first time, as well as visa requirements. An accompanying act later that year allocated funds for the first border patrol.

Trump’s rhetoric almost a century later bears a jarring resemblance to Johnson’s. The president has also claimed that immigrants are “poisoning the nation’s blood.” He too has said that he prefers the “nice people” of Sweden, Norway and Denmark to people from “filthy, dirty, disgusting” countries like Somalia.

The Johnson and Trump policies also developed in similar ways. Just as this administration is evoking the specter of immigrants becoming a “public charge”, and instructing consular officers to test immigrant’s English through an interview, Johnson ushered through a bill in 1917, as a precursor to the 1924 Immigration Act, that excluded anyone who was a “public charge” and required a literacy test for immigrants. Both sets of policies demanded more stringent testing on immigrant health – Johnson was a proponent of sterilizing the mentally disabled.

At the time, the Johnson-Reed Act was very popular. It passed with over 80% support in both houses of Congress. And it was signed into law by Calvin Coolidge, who believed that “America must be kept American”, echoing the mantra of the Ku Klux Klan, which was a proponent of the law.

The Immigration Act achieved its goals of keeping America white and stopping migration. In the coming four decades, immigration to the United States would come to a screeching halt, dropping from 13% foreign-born in the 1920s to less than 5% in 1970. That year, the US was 87.5% white.

By contrast, today 15% of people in the US are foreign-born, and the country is 57.8% white. The concern that the United States could become majority non-white as of 2045 is likely a driving force for Project 2025’s mass deportation vision that Trump is enacting today.

Then, like now, refugees were also denied. In one harrowing example, in 1939, more than 900 Jewish passengers aboard the SS St Louis were forced to return to Europe, almost a quarter of whom later died in Nazi concentration camps. Even after the horrors of the Holocaust were fully revealed, it was not until 1948 that the United States took in Jewish refugees, and even then, just 200,000 people. Signing that bill into law, Harry Truman described himself as reluctant, denouncing the bill’s restrictions as antisemitic and xenophobic.

It is no surprise then that Adolf Hitler, who wrote about the Johnson-Reed Act in Mein Kampf, praised it, writing that the US was the “one state” that “simply excludes the immigration of certain races”.

A century later, the 1924 Immigration Act still has fans. Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s mass deportation policy as the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser, has praised Coolidge and the four decades of low immigration to the United States.

With the return of immigration to the United States after the abolition of racial quotas in 1965 came economic growth. New arrivals breathed life into US industry at all levels, injecting trillions of dollars into the economy, and filling key labor shortages. Yet, as the number of non-white people increased, pathways to admissions narrowed. The United States spent three times as much on the detention of immigrant detention as adjudicating immigrants’ claims. The idea that Trump is closing an open border belies the fact that $410bn has been spent on border securitization alone in the last two decades.

None of these facts matter. The purpose of this immigration ban, like the other travel bans this administration has passed, has nothing to do with economics. Just as the mass deportation agenda has nothing to do with immigrant criminality – which has long been a myth. The purpose of this latest immigration ban is to whiten the nation, period, just as was the purpose of the ban a century prior. This administration has said and has shown time and time again that there is “no price tag” on accomplishing this goal.

But just as this latest immigration ban has precedent in US history, so too does the resistance to it. We can learn from the civil rights movement, from the Black led multiracial coalition that insisted that the rights of all people of color were deeply connected, that they needed to be treated equally under the law. We can recognize too that the work of that movement continues, that the white supremacy it fought is enduring, and that we need to organize and protest, and fight for a system that once and for all refuses enduring racist reasoning, and recognizes the humanity of all.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/922364ae9aa59ffc69c7c349cf9c2083fd680312/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=64ea0438b87986d4491a0cbca5176d27",N,,2026-01-17 10:58:47.357403

ICE agents would flood Portland and Lewiston as soon as Tuesday to conduct “forceful entry” operations, according to one tip sent to the Portland Press Herald that cited internal communications in the state Department of Health and Human Services. Our cities were potentially about to become the next Minneapolis, or Chicago.

The suggested raids have not yet materialized, but Democratic leaders such as Gov. Janet Mills, Portland Mayor Mark Dion and Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline began issuing statements Wednesday on how they were preparing for operations to begin in the near future. They urged residents to know their rights and asked protesters to remain peaceful.

No one appeared to know the exact origin of the tips, with Mills saying she made an unsuccessful attempt to confirm any plans with federal officials and Dion saying he spoke to someone at the “congressional level” who indicated ICE is planning to send agents to Portland. The federal government has not shared more details.

But all week, Maine was stuck in a state of fear and paranoia. Neighbors in online groups discussed potential sightings of ICE agents at apartment complexes in the Portland area and an arrest of an immigrant in Biddeford. A caller contacted the Press Herald newsroom on Thursday to claim ICE agents were in Portland at Waynflete School and Reiche Elementary School, but that also turned out to not be the case — at least not that our reporters on the scene could see.

The uncertainty coincided with Trump threatening to send the military to quash anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis after a federal agent killed a woman there last week.

It also came as the Trump administration shared its intent to end the Temporary Protected Status humanitarian program for Somali immigrants in the U.S. amid fraud investigations tied to Somalis in Minnesota and Maine.

The unease felt by immigrant communities that have settled in Maine’s two largest cities has manifested itself in different ways.

A parent at Reiche Community School in Portland’s West End shared how she drove her neighbors’ kids to school Monday morning because their parents, who speak Spanish, were scared to stand with their children at the bus stop or walk them to class. A Lewiston property manager told the Bangor Daily News how undocumented parents are receiving forms to designate temporary guardians for their kids in case they are arrested.

Restaurants and companies from Portland to Bath described making sure employees with immigrant backgrounds had their legal paperwork in order. A volunteer with the Maine ICE Watch Hotline said it has seen a surge in calls over the past week.

The presence of ICE in Maine is not new, but what was different about the latest reports is how the looming surge in Portland or Lewiston would purportedly be larger than past ones in the state. ICE reported a spike in Maine apprehensions in the past year, with 230 people detained between January and mid-October, per the Deportation Data Project.

The data indicated 20% of those ICE detainees in Maine had a criminal conviction and 35% had no criminal record, while 43% had pending criminal charges.

Ifraax Saciid-Ciise, founder of IFKA Community Services, a Lewiston-based organization that supports immigrant women, was among those who said immigrants and U.S.-born citizens alike are afraid the color of their skin, their accents and their choice to wear hijabs could make them targets of ICE agents.

“I’ve spoken to a lot of public officials, and they are saying there is not much they can do to impede ICE, that they have the right to be here and follow their federal orders,” Saciid-Ciise said. “It feels like a total lack of support.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/POY-PROTESTS_12.jpg?w=780,N,,2026-01-17 13:57:49.513660

One district court held that the law used to deport Khalil is likely unconstitutionally vague.","The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on Thursday reversed a district court’s decision that released Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention.

The court held that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) stripped the US District for the District of New Jersey of subject-matter jurisdiction because the INA requires deportation challenges be made by filing a petition for review of a final order of removal with a federal appeals court, not a district court.

The Third Circuit held that the statute serves to provide “one bite at the apple” and that Khalil needed to first exhaust his direct appeal before seeking habeas relief. The court stated:

Each of the legal questions Khalil raises in his petition can be decided later, on a [petition for review]. He challenges a broad array of alleged governmental misconduct under the First and Fifth Amendments, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) … addressing any of those claims would require deciding whether removing Khalil would be unlawful—the very issue decided through the [petition for review] process. To be sure, the immigration judge’s order of removal is not yet final; the Board has not affirmed her ruling and has held the parties’ briefing deadlines in abeyance pending this opinion. But if the Board ultimately affirms, Khalil can get meaningful review.

In other words, because Khalil is raising legal questions that a petition for review court can meaningfully review later on, the INA bars him from attacking his removal and detention in a habeas petition. The court ultimately did not decide any of the key constitutional or statutory issues presented in Khalil’s case, specifically whether his removal over campus activism would be unconstitutional.

Mahmoud Khalil, an Algerian-Syrian-born US permanent resident and activist, has been targeted by Donald Trump’s administration for his alleged affiliations with Hamas and anti-semitism.

However, the path to full funding remains uncertain as partisan tensions flare over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, particularly involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an issue expected to require further negotiations.

Earlier this week, the House approved the National Security-State and Financial Services appropriations bill by a 341-79 vote.

Tech details in the funding package

The $180 billion funding package includes $5 million for the Technology Modernization Fund, to remain available until expended. The provision comes after the fund expired last month for the first time since its creation in 2017, freezing nearly $200 million for federal technology projects.

Lawmakers also agreed to $1.4 million for the General Services Administration’s Office of Technology Policy and Initiatives.

The agreement also largely rejects major spending cuts proposed in the White House’s FY 2026 budget request, instead making modest reductions across multiple agencies.

The package trims funding for the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and NASA. NSF would see nearly a 4% reduction, rejecting a proposed cut of about 57%. NASA would receive about $24.43 billion, a nearly 2% decrease from current spending, while lawmakers rejected proposals to cut its science budget by nearly half and terminate dozens of missions.

The Energy Department’s Office of Science would receive a $160 million increase, about 2%, instead of a more than $1 billion reduction proposed by the administration. Funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology would rise to roughly $1.8 billion, including $55 million for artificial intelligence research and expanded work on AI standards, quantum information science, and cybersecurity.

The legislation also limits unilateral workforce and organizational changes by federal agencies. It would bar agencies from reprogramming funds to create or eliminate programs, relocate offices, or reduce staffing or funding for a program by more than 5% without congressional approval.",https://meritalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1783076981-min.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 14:57:44.270985

Lunas Campos' death is the second migrant death at Camp East Montana.","Rochester, N.Y. (WHAM) — The death of a Henrietta man in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody is likely to be investigated as a homicide, according to a Washington Post report.

Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died Jan. 3 at Camp East Montana, an ICE detention facility just outside El Paso, Texas.

ICE said Lunas Campos ""became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm"" earlier that day and placed in segregation.

While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance. Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services. Lunas was pronounced deceased by EMS.

The Washington Post reported an El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner employee said Lunas Campos' death is likely to be classified as a homicide, pending the results of a toxicology report.

In a recording Lunas Campos’s daughter shared with The Post, the employee said a doctor “is listing the preliminary cause of death as asphyxia due to neck and chest compression,” which means Lunas Campos did not get enough oxygen because of pressure on his neck and chest. A fellow detainee says he witnessed Lunas Campos being choked to death by guards at an ICE detention center in Texas on Jan. 3.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson provided a statement to 13WHAM Friday, saying Lunas Campos attempted to take his own life, and security staff intervened to save him.

Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life. During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness. Medical staff was immediately called and responded. After repeated attempts to resuscitate him, EMTs declared him deceased on the scene.

ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody. This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming. ICE investigates the circumstances of all deaths in custody.

ICE said Lunas Campos, a Cuban citizen, entered the U.S. in 1996 and was convicted of several crimes between 1998 and 2009. The list includes a 2003 conviction in Rochester for sexual contact with a child under age 11 that led to a one-year jail sentence and required him to register as a sex offender.

Lunas Campos’ adult daughter told the Associated Press the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.

“My father was not a child molester,” Kary Lunas, 25, told the AP. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”

AP says Lunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.

Immigration authorities arrested Lunas Campos during a planned enforcement operation in Rochester July 14, according to ICE, before he was transferred Sept. 6 to Camp East Montana and remained in custody pending removal proceedings.

An immigration judge ordered Lunas Campos to be removed from the U.S. in 2005, according to ICE, but he wasn't removed because the government couldn't obtain travel documents.

Jeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, told AP the day after he died, the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened. Pagan-Lopez, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results.

Pagan-Lopez said she was also told the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated. Pagan-Lopez declined and told 13WHAM on Friday that she is seeking help from family and friends to raise money to ship his body home.

Lunas Campos' death is the second migrant death at Camp East Montana.

911 caller: Good was shot ‘point blank’ Minneapolis authorities released police and fire dispatch logs and transcripts of 911 calls related to the fatal shooting of Good.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Justice Department is investigating whether Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have impeded federal immigration enforcement through public statements they have made, two people familiar with the matter said Friday.

The investigation, which both Walz and Frey said was a bullying tactic meant to threaten political opposition, focused on potential violation of a conspiracy statute, the people said.

The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a pending investigation by name.

CBS News first reported the investigation.

The investigation comes during a weekslong immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and St. Paul that the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest recent immigration enforcement operation, resulting in more than 2,500 arrests.

The operation has become more confrontational since the fatal shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7, with agents pulling people from cars and homes and frequently being confronted by angry bystanders demanding they leave. State and local officials have repeatedly told protesters to remain peaceful.

In response to reports of the investigation, Walz said in a statement: “Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly. Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”

U.S. senators Kelly, from Arizona, and Slotkin, from Michigan, are under investigation from the President Donald Trump administration after appearing with other Democratic lawmakers in a video urging members of the military to resist “illegal orders.” The administration has also launched a criminal investigation of Powell, a first for a sitting federal reserve chair.

Walz’s office said it has not received any notice of an investigation.

Frey described the investigation as an attempt to intimidate him for “standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our streets.”

The U.S. attorney’s office in Minneapolis did not immediately comment.

In a post on the social media platform X following reports of the investigation, Attorney General Pam Bondi said: “A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.” She did not specifically mention the investigation.

State calls for peaceful protests

With more protests expected in the Twin Cities this weekend, state authorities urged demonstrators to avoid confrontation.

“While peaceful expression is protected, any actions that harm people, destroy property or jeopardize public safety will not be tolerated,” said Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

His comments came after Trump backed off a bit from his threat a day earlier to invoke an 1807 law, the Insurrection Act, to send troops to suppress demonstrations.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it,” Trump told reporters outside the White House.

A U.S. judge in Minnesota ruled on Friday that the federal officers working in the Minneapolis-area enforcement operation can’t detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who aren’t obstructing authorities, including when they’re observing agents.

The case was filed before Good’s shooting on behalf of six Minnesota activists represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota.

Government attorneys had argued that the officers have been acting within their legal authority to enforce immigration laws and protect themselves. But the ACLU has said government officers are violating the constitutional rights of Twin Cities residents.

Detention whiplash

A Liberian man who has been shuttled in and out of custody since immigration agents broke down his door with a battering ram was released again Friday, hours after a routine check-in with authorities led to his second arrest.

The dramatic initial arrest of Garrison Gibson last weekend was captured on video. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan ruled the arrest unlawful Thursday and freed him, but Gibson was detained again Friday when he appeared at an immigration office.

A few hours later, Gibson was free again, attorney Marc Prokosch said.

Gibson, 37, who fled the civil war in his West African home country as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed. He has remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, Prokosch said, and complied with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.

In his Thursday order, the judge agreed that officials violated regulations by not giving Gibson enough notice that his supervision status had been revoked. Prokosch said he was told by ICE that they are “now going through their proper channels” to revoke the order.

911 caller: Good was shot ‘point blank’

Minneapolis authorities released police and fire dispatch logs and transcripts of 911 calls related to the fatal shooting of Good. Firefighters found what appeared to be two gunshot wounds in her right chest, one in her left forearm and a possible gunshot wound on the left side of her head, records show.

“They shot her, like, cause she wouldn’t open her car door,” a caller said. “Point blank range in her car.”

Good, 37, was at the wheel of her Honda Pilot, which was partially blocking a street. Video showed an officer approached the SUV, demanded that she open the door and grabbed the handle.

Good began to pull forward and turned the vehicle’s wheel to the right. Another ICE officer, Jonathan Ross, pulled his gun and fired at close range, jumping back as the SUV moved past him. DHS claims the agent shot Good in self-defense.

To me, at a certain point, a mass mobilization becomes something qualitatively new.” History shows how mass protests can grow into mass strikes.","Minnesota appears to be in gear for a mass uprising. Unions, community organizations, faith leaders, and small businesses there are calling for a statewide day of “no work (except for emergency services), no school, and no shopping” on January 23.

Festering grievances swelled into a national outcry on January 7, after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed poet and mother of three Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis while she and her wife were observing federal agents swarming her neighborhood.

A week later, another federal agent shot a Latino immigrant from Venezuela in the leg. ICE agents have sprayed chemical agents in protesters’ eyes. On Wednesday night, they detonated a tear gas canister underneath the car of a family just trying to get home from basketball practice; the baby, strapped in his car seat, was knocked unconscious.

Trump’s regime has ramped up racist attacks targeting Somali and Latino communities —battering down doors, raiding small businesses and forcing them to shutter, trailing school buses, dropping tear gas outside schools, circling hospitals. He has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military to Minneapolis.

Under siege, Minnesotans are leaning on organizations at work and in their neighborhoods to end the terror.

“We are not going to shop. We are not going to work. We are not going to school on Friday, January 23. For some people they call that a strike,” said JaNaé Bates Imari of Camphor Memorial United Methodist Church at a press conference on Tuesday. “For many of us, this is our right to refusal until something changes.”

UNIONS STEP UP

Among the unions endorsing the call are Service Employees Local 26, UNITE HERE Local 17, International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 13, Communications Workers Local 7250, the St. Paul Federation of Educators Local 28, Minneapolis Federation of Educators (AFT Local 59), the Transit Union (ATU) Local 1005, the Committee of Interns and Residents (SEIU), and the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.

“Our labor federations are encouraging everyone to participate on January 23rd,” said Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minneapolis federation. “It’s time for every single Minnesotan who loves this state and the notion of truth and freedom to raise their voices and deepen their solidarity for our neighbors and co-workers living under this federal occupation.”

Other endorsers include Faith in Minnesota, Tending the Soil, United Renters for Justice, Unidos Minnesota, Communities Against Police Brutality, Indivisible Twin Cities, Women’s March Minnesota, the worker center Centro de Trabajadores Unidos en la Lucha, and Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee. In all, 90 organizations, big and small, have endorsed the call.

Under the banner “ICE Out of MN: Day of Truth and Freedom,” they are calling for ICE to leave the state, for the officer who killed Good to be held legally accountable, for no additional federal funding for ICE, and for businesses to sever any economic ties with the federal agency.

Three thousand ICE agents have swarmed the Minneapolis area in recent weeks, and they’ve become more aggressive, emboldened by the Trump administration’s offer of immunity.

Workers are facing them on the job. Letter carriers organized a rally in December to kick ICE agents off two postal parking lots in South Minneapolis. ATU Metro Transit workers are calling on ICE to stop interfering with bus operations after a violent arrest at a bus stop on January 10 and the detention of a Somali-American Metro Transit worker last December.

“They’re walking onto Metro Transit buses,” said bus driver Ryan Timlin, a steward in ATU Local 1005. “It’s getting to knocking down doors. They’re just doing whatever they can to haul people off. They call this a democratic society here in the United States—it doesn’t feel like it in Minneapolis. It’s a nightmare. The garage I work at in South Minneapolis has a massive East African population. Our co-workers are walking around with passports, especially the Somali community, which Trump is really going after. They’re U.S. citizens!”

He and his co-workers got the local to pass a resolution saying members should not cooperate with ICE—for instance by letting them onto trains and buses—and establishing a rapid-response network. At a January 14 press conference, Local 1005 President David Stiggers called ICE’s repression “a throwback to the darkest times of human history, 1940s Germany.”

ICE OUT OF MN

Nat Anderson-Lippert, organizing director for the Minneapolis Federation of Educators, says the Minneapolis teachers have drawn inspiration from the Chicago Teachers Union’s sanctuary schools model, which has brought parents and teachers together to deepen school-community organizing. “The level of infrastructure and organizing is so impressive and humbling,” he said.

“The attack on immigrants is not new, but the intensity we are seeing is just extreme, and so many more people are stepping up right now to meet the moment,” said Jason Rodney, an assistant special education teacher at Anishinabe Academy in Minneapolis Public Schools.

In last November’s contract fight, MFE won stronger language from the district to refuse ICE on school grounds unless the agent can show a judicial warrant, including data privacy protections and mental health support for staff. School workers’ jobs are also protected should they be detained or lose their legal status, putting them on the job recall list.

The organizing includes mutual aid, which can mean grocery runs, rent support, and setting up carpools. The union also won the right for families scared for their safety to do virtual learning, and the school has hosted know-your-rights trainings.

Much of it boils down to a foundation of trust built over time, including during the George Floyd uprising. “More people know their neighbors since 2020 than they did before that, and that has absolutely helped us respond more quickly, building neighborhood response networks and mutual aid support right on our blocks,” Rodney said.

Under the pressures of the moment, he said the union has tried to be a steadying force. “We’re in a hundred Signal loops and it can get draining to follow things we aren’t going to take action on,” he said. So teachers are talking to their co-workers and deciding where to focus. “This is a crisis,” he said, but “I think we’re going to leave this stronger. We’re going to get ICE out.”

Trump has used a fraud scandal as a pretext to racially profile Somali U.S. citizens and threaten to denaturalize them. But the repression has sparked brave defiance in some Somali-American workers, like Uber driver Ahmed Bin Hassan, who defied federal agents at an airport parking lot in a video that circulated on social media. “They couldn’t hear my voice when they knocked on my window, but they could see my color,” Bin Hassan told The Intercept. “I knew if these people are going to take me out here today, it’s going to happen. So I’m just going to be me.”

A DECADE OF ORGANIZING

The momentum is growing from mass protests, like the one in downtown Minneapolis on January 10 that drew 10,000. But the bold demands also build on at least a decade of organizing.

In 2020, half a million Americans turned out to Black Lives Matter protests for racial justice following the murder of George Floyd, not far from where ICE killed Renee Good.

In 2022, MFE struck to raise wages for the lowest-paid educators, education support professionals, who were mostly people of color, while the higher-paid teachers were mostly white. The BLM uprising had helped build solidarity between these groups and highlight the racial justice dimension of their contract fight.

It also seeded networks of resistance, which have been reactivated now as Roosevelt High School has been engulfed in a warzone; ICE agents have gassed students and teachers, and the school has emerged as a key site of student walkouts. Marcia Howard, now president of MFE, taught English at Roosevelt when Floyd was killed feet away from her front door. She took a leave of absence to lead in that struggle, turning George Floyd Square into a memorial and protest hub.

CWA Local 7250 President Kieran Knutson says the police murders of Jamar Clark in North Minneapolis and Philando Castile in a suburb of St. Paul also fueled resistance networks and raised consciousness. Now Trump’s attacks on immigrants have opened up tough conversations inside his local.

“If we’re going to discuss something that’s controversial, we’re going to put it all on the table,” said Knutson. We’re gonna have a discussion about it at the membership level, and we’re going to move forward with what the majority believes is right.”

The conversations reflect experiences that members are having in their own neighborhoods. When Knutson was handing out flyers about ICE, two union women told him they were already part of the immigrant defense network, and showed him their ICE alert whistles.

“We fight like hell on all issues of wages, benefits, and discipline,” said Knutson. “And that gives us some credibility to talk about things more broadly. So we talk about the philosophy that an injury to one is an injury to all. I tell people that’s my religion.”

Last December, ICE abducted two CWA Local 7304 members from Laos at the electric-bus manufacturer New Flyer in St. Cloud, Minnesota. They had worked at New Flyer for more than 20 years.

GROUNDWORK FOR DISRUPTION

Since 2011, a constellation of forces in Minnesota has been building power by bringing together workers, tenants, and community members to contest for power and transform the economy state-wide.

They’ve organized joint weeks of action, strategized together about how their corporate foes are linked, and begun lining up contract expirations. All this helps lay the groundwork for what may be possible next week.

“Over the last two decades in Minnesota, our labor, faith and community groups have built relationships that allowed us to take on more strategic campaigns together,” said SEIU Local 26 President Greg Nammacher. “We’ve taken on the corporations who run our state to address the racial and economic inequalities they have caused, and won big things.

“Now our communities are now under attack directly from the federal government. And we are going to do everything in our power to defend the workers and people who honor that call.”

GET ON OFFENSE

To go on offense, you also need backup. The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation is backing an eviction moratorium, because many workers are afraid to report to work lest they risk being kidnapped by ICE.

“We don’t need to be adding to our houseless population,” said Stacie Balkaran, a spokesperson for the federation. Through its nonprofit arm Working Partnerships, the federation has also funded a network of mutual aid groups. These networks have helped keep people fed after federal attacks to strip the state of SNAP funding, and they are coordinating aid for groceries and rides to and from work.

The federation has established a legal fund to support illegally detained workers, aiming to raise $150,000. (You can donate here.) According to Balkaran, these funds will go to any worker regardless of whether they are in a union or not.

In preparation for the January 23 day of action, the Minnesota AFL-CIO will dispatch union peacekeepers, “so that we can actually keep us safe… and know that they are safe in exercising their First Amendment rights,” said Balkaran.

NO WORK, SCHOOL, SHOPPING

Although unions have endorsed the calls for Minnesotans to refuse work, school, and shopping on January 23, no union has agreed to strike yet.

“We have not voted on a strike, but our union is calling on people to support this call,” said Knutson. “People can say, ‘This is not a real general strike.’ This is a mass mobilization. To me, at a certain point, a mass mobilization becomes something qualitatively new.”

History shows how mass protests can grow into mass strikes. The 1934 San Francisco general strike began after longshore workers and their supporters shut down the city’s commercial district in a mass funeral procession, following the killing of two strikers and beatings of thousands.

“The funeral march made the general strike, until then at best a threat, all but inevitable,” writes historian Nelson Lichtenstein in his forthcoming book Why Labor Unions Matter, because seeing 40,000 longshore workers and their supporters bring the city’s commercial district to a halt gave the city’s working class a surge of confidence in its own power. Six days later, with backing from the San Francisco labor council, 150,000 workers stopped working.

Unions can advance democracy against authoritarian governments, Lichtenstein writes, but to do so, the unions “have to transcend themselves,” going beyond representing just members to become social movements that can reach for “a vast new set of energies and aspirations.”

That moment may have arrived. “Our actions now will determine what kind of country we will have for a generation,” said Nammacher of SEIU Local 26.

Could the mobilization expand beyond Minnesota soon? “May Day Strong stands firmly in support of our affiliates in Minneapolis who are doing tremendous organizing to stand up a day of no school, no work, and no shopping next Friday,” said Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jackson Potter, speaking for a national coalition of unions and community groups that has been organizing days of action nationwide. “The way things are going, we will have no choice but to emulate this fearless example as a nation on May 1st.”",https://labornotes.org/sites/default/files/main/articles/image%20%2837%29.png,N,,2026-01-17 10:59:01.497482

Although officials in Portland and Lewiston have warned that enforcement could ramp up as early as next week, they have not disclosed the source of that information.

Despite the lack of public confirmation, local leaders said they believe the threat is real enough to begin preparing.

Recent national events have raised tensions, particularly in light of a deadly ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that led to mass protests and political fallout. President Trump’s response included threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act to send federal troops to the city. Against this backdrop, Maine leaders say they want to ensure the public is informed and protected.

Cumberland County District Attorney Jacqueline Sartoris had planned to join Portland Mayor Mark Dion for a press conference on Friday to address the issue, but the event was canceled due to security concerns.

In an interview with NEWS CENTER Maine, Sartoris emphasized the importance of reminding everyone—including federal agents—that they are not above state law.

""It's certainly possible that if you commit a criminal act in Maine and we have adequate evidence, you could be charged with that crime in a couple of years. It could absolutely be that the statute of limitations carries you past the length of time of this administration.""

While she says her office would be prepared to file charges if laws are broken, Sartoris clarified that her office cannot conduct investigations directly. She urged the public not to send potential evidence to the district attorney’s office, stressing that proper investigative channels must go through law enforcement.

Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce echoed that message, stating his department is ready to investigate any wrongdoing—whether by ICE agents or by members of the public.

""We’re held to a standard as law enforcement,"" Joyce said. ""If we see things that don't look good... we take information down on what's going on, whether we have body camera footage, and we look at potential charges on whether or not ICE was doing the right thing.""

However, Joyce also stressed that local law enforcement has limited authority when it comes to federal agents, particularly in the midst of active enforcement operations.

If officers are called to a scene where ICE is present, their role would likely focus on ensuring that any protests or public responses remain peaceful and safe. They do not have jurisdiction over ICE operations, and Joyce cautioned people not to interfere.

Good was taking part in one of numerous neighborhood patrols organised by local activists to track and monitor ICE activities.

On Friday, US District Judge Kate Menendez’s court injunction barred federal ​agents from retaliating against individuals engaged in peaceful, unobstructive protest ‍activity.

Officers were explicitly prohibited from arresting or detaining people protesting peacefully or engaged in orderly observations, if there was no reasonable suspicion that they had committed a crime ‍or were ⁠interfering with law enforcement.

The ruling also bans federal agents from using pepper spray, tear gas or other crowd-control munitions against peaceful demonstrators or bystanders observing and recording the immigration enforcement operations.

The US ‌Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was given 72 hours to bring its operation in Minneapolis into compliance.

The court ruling hands a victory to activists in Minneapolis, the state’s most populous ⁠city, two weeks after the Trump administration announced the deployment of 2,000 immigration agents to ​the area.

Their numbers have since grown to nearly 3,000, dwarfing the ranks of the local police. The DHS calls it the largest operation of its kind in the country’s history.

Crowds of protesters across Minneapolis have clashed with the immigration officers, opposing their efforts to target undocumented migrants, with some officers responding with violence.

Amid the escalating dispute between Trump and local state and city leaders, the president threatened on Thursday to invoke the Insurrection Act, allowing him to deploy the military to police the protests.

“If I needed it, I would use it. I don’t think there is any reason right now to use it,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the move.

The Insurrection Act allows a president to sidestep the 19th-century Posse Comitatus Act, which removes the military from regular civil law enforcement, to suppress “armed rebellion” or “domestic violence” and deploy soldiers on US soil “as he considers necessary”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016081467327-1768633254.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-17 07:57:04.230442

Katie Glueck: Hi guys!

Lisa, immigration has historically been a challenging issue for Democrats to navigate.
Katie Glueck: Are there places either of you are watching where this feels especially urgent electorally?","It’s hard to look away from the scenes in Minneapolis. A 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. A young man shouting “I’m a U.S. citizen!” as federal agents hauled him away. Protests this week after a federal agent shot and injured someone.

As tensions flare in the city, I wanted to try to make sense of the political implications — with the caveats that this is a rapidly evolving situation, and that the Trump administration and local officials are in dispute over what happened in the chaotic moments before Good was shot.

So I turned to my friends and colleagues Jenny Medina and Lisa Lerer for a Slack conversation on Friday morning about ICE, immigration politics and how both could play a role in the midterm elections. Here’s what we discussed, edited and condensed for clarity.

Katie Glueck: Hi guys! Jenny, you had a great story this week looking at how Democrats are grappling with the way to talk about ICE raids. Tell us a little about the competing pressures for Democrats.

Jennifer Medina: The vast majority of Democrats — both elected leaders and voters — believe that the Trump administration is being far too aggressive with its immigration enforcement tactics. The question for Democrats is what to do, and how to talk about it.

Some think the only way to get lasting change is by starting over and eliminating the agency, hence the renewed “Abolish ICE” calls. But plenty of others worry that embracing that message could have devastating consequences, politically and practically.

Katie Glueck: I’ve definitely heard from some moderates who are worried that “Abolish ICE” becomes the next “Defund the Police” and ends up backfiring. In Minnesota, officials are also urging protesters to demonstrate peacefully, warning that any other approach would play into President Trump’s hands.

Lisa, immigration has historically been a challenging issue for Democrats to navigate. You and I spent some time yesterday with Democratic House candidates who are running in battleground districts. What were your impressions of how they’re thinking about this?

Lisa Lerer: Democrats in purple districts are not embracing full-throated calls to eliminate ICE. Instead, they are first saying that the country needs a “secure” border. And then, they are quickly pivoting to attacking ICE’s aggressive tactics, arguing that this approach makes cities less safe. But, honestly, how intense of an issue this is electorally depends a bit on where you are running.

Katie Glueck: Are there places either of you are watching where this feels especially urgent electorally?

Lisa Lerer: Well, most of the highest-profile efforts have been focused on blue cities — Chicago, Minneapolis, Charlotte and the Research Triangle in North Carolina, and Los Angeles — so any nearby suburban swing seats for the House are certainly places where this issue could be more resonant.

Jennifer Medina: There are several competitive House districts in the Southwest that have a large number of Hispanic voters and have swung toward Trump in recent presidential elections. How those voters react to the second Trump administration could decide control of the House.

Katie Glueck: This issue could also factor into races for Senate and governor, right?

Jennifer Medina: Definitely — I’m especially curious how this all plays out in North Carolina and Georgia.

Lisa Lerer: I do wonder if the Minnesota unrest will end up being a turning point in how this issue is playing politically. I was struck by a national Quinnipiac poll this week showing that 82 percent of voters had seen video of Good being shot by the agent. And, Katie, some of the Democratic candidates we talked to this week — ones in areas that haven’t had the same level of immigration enforcement — told us they are starting to get asked about ICE for the first time.

America is definitely paying attention to this issue now.

Katie Glueck: Pat Ryan, a House Democrat in New York, told me recently that at least some Trump voters in his district thought that ICE was overreaching, AND that their affordability concerns weren’t being met.

In 2024, Republicans were effective in arguing that Democrats were more focused on culture wars than on Americans’ pocketbooks. I wonder if some Democrats try the reverse of that argument and suggest that Republicans are more focused on violent crackdowns than on affordability.

Jennifer Medina: I spoke to several Democrats this week who said that should be their precise strategy — that prices keep going up while billions of dollars are being spent on harsh immigration enforcement tactics.

Katie Glueck: Jenny, you’ve written extensively about Hispanic voters. Do we know whether some who voted for Trump in 2024 are swinging back to the Democrats now, or is it too early to say?

Jennifer Medina: Several polls suggest that some Hispanic Trump voters are having buyer’s remorse and are particularly frustrated about both the economy and deportation operations. But it isn’t necessarily the case that those voters will turn toward Democrats, particularly in the midterms. Many of those voters chose Trump out of frustration and could simply sit this year out.

Katie Glueck: How are Republicans thinking about the politics of this issue? I saw Joe Rogan, the influential right-leaning podcaster, suggesting that some of the tactics were reminiscent of the Gestapo.

Lisa Lerer: There is uneasiness in some quarters. Strategists and candidates were already bracing for a tough midterm election. A sense of chaos in the country is never good for the party in power. There’s plenty of polling showing that independents disapprove of ICE tactics.

While polling indicates that Republicans are largely sticking with Trump, some of those voters have a history of not showing up when he’s not on the ballot. That makes winning over self-described independents even more important in those purple areas.

Jennifer Medina: Some Republicans are taking a page from the White House and projecting utter confidence. But I’ve also heard from Republicans like Representative Maria Elvira Salazar, who represents Miami and is deeply concerned that her party is going far beyond what public sentiment supports. She is worried the party will erase the gains it has made with Hispanic voters.

Katie Glueck: Yes, I was struck by what Salazar said in your article — “I don’t want the Hispanic community, my community, to believe or to think that the G.O.P. doesn’t love them.” Representative Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat, recently told me that part of her party’s problem in 2024 was that some voters simply thought Democrats didn’t like them.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/newsletter-1-hmjf/newsletter-1-hmjf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:57:02.303320

The report, obtained by Fox News Digital, included an incident report from the Minneapolis Fire and Police departments, 911 call transcripts, and witness reports.

The documents were released late Thursday.

The 911 call transcripts consisted of 17 pages of calls made out of the area in the moments after Good was shot and offered a profane, splintered glimpse into eyewitness accounts.

Calls began shortly after 9:38 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 7, and according to the reports, there were ""[multiple] voices yelling [and] screaming in the background.""

At 9:50 a.m. the report indicates the crowd began to get hostile and at 9:52 a.m., more law enforcement was deployed to the scene to assist in crowd control efforts. The report also indicated later that ""agitators"" were cutting the crime scene tape established by law enforcement.

The agent who fired shots at Good was no longer on the scene as of 10:04 a.m. According to the report, the agent was transported to the ""federal building"" and police on scene requested that federal agents ""evacuate [the] scene when safe and as fast as [possible].""

At 11:01 a.m., the report indicates ICE agents were ""being surrounded"" and by 11:20 a.m. all agents left the scene.

The report also included mentions of flag burning and individuals who remained on scene that were reported throwing ice and snowballs at officers. The incident was closed at approximately 4:59 p.m. local time.

Good suffered four gunshot wounds, two to the chest, one on her left forearm and one on the left side of her head, according to the fire department report. Initial reports indicated Good had been shot three times.

DHS officials said the ICE officer fired in self-defense after Good used her Honda Pilot SUV in a way that posed a threat. DHS said video showed Good interfering with ICE officers by parking her vehicle in the roadway in an apparent attempt to block federal vehicles.

But so far, only two Pennsylvania Democrats have signed on to an effort to remove Noem from office.
Initial emails were sent before articles of impeachment were introduced this past Wednesday, and follow-ups were sent afterward.
“I would support articles of impeachment against this lawless administration.” “It’s past time to abolish ICE once and for all,” Lee added.
“I condemn this brutal murder in Minneapolis by ICE agents,” Evans wrote.","Pennsylvania’s Democratic congressional delegation is in broad agreement that investigations and accountability are needed following the aggressive tactics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minneapolis and around the country.

But at this point, they haven’t landed on a united path forward.

Last week, Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly introduced three articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has defended the confrontational actions of ICE and Border Patrol agents. Kelly’s district includes a Chicago area that saw heavy ICE deployment in the fall and the articles she submitted cite obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust and self-dealing.

Other Democrats have called for investigations, and reforms, cutting funding for immigration enforcement, or abolishing ICE altogether.

But so far, only two Pennsylvania Democrats have signed on to an effort to remove Noem from office. Rep. Summer Lee, was among the first co-sponsors on the impeachment articles, while Chris Deluzio, who represents the broader Pittsburgh area, committed to adding his name to the co-sponsors, according to a spokesperson.

More than a week ago, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, as she tried to drive away from agents.

Pa. lawmaker moves to ban warrantless civil immigration arrests near state buildings

Footage of the shooting and the moments proceeding it went viral, stoking outrage and focusing the nation’s attention on the Trump administration’s militarized deportation campaign. But views among lawmakers split largely along partisan lines over whether the agent, who walked around the car to position himself in front of it when he fired the first shot, was acting in self-defense or using force unjustifiably. The second and third shots were fired from the side of the vehicle.

The Capital-Star asked all eight Democrats in Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation how the House and Senate should respond to the shooting and the resulting unrest. Initial emails were sent before articles of impeachment were introduced this past Wednesday, and follow-ups were sent afterward.

While the Capital-Star’s questions included whether they supported impeachment, only Deluzio and Lee responded to the question directly.

“DHS agencies have demonstrated a pattern of violence against people with little to no accountability, emboldened by an administration that acts without impunity and adds fuel to the fire,” Lee said in a statement before articles of impeachment were introduced. “I would support articles of impeachment against this lawless administration.”

“It’s past time to abolish ICE once and for all,” Lee added.

“Renee Good’s killing in Minneapolis is a tragedy, and my heart goes out to her grieving family and community,” Deluzio said in a statement.” From what I’ve seen so far, it is outrageous and disturbing that the Trump Administration immediately called this a ‘domestic terrorism’ incident. We need an independent investigation — and for the Congress to bring real oversight and accountability to ICE and Secretary Noem’s failed leadership.”

Congressional Republicans have largely rallied around the federal officers and DHS’ defense of the shooting.

The Capital-Star also reached out to the nine Republican members, but only one, Rep. Dan Meuser from Luzerne County, responded. A spokesperson sent the Capital-Star a Fox News interview from shortly after the killing of Good.

“I mean, law enforcement says, ‘Hey, stop, open up your door, let me see your ID,’ and then not only do you take off, but you go right at somebody as they jump out of the way of the car, basically you’re trying to run them over,” Meuser said. “That’s not what a normal person does to anyone, let alone law enforcement.”

President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security have claimed that Good was trying to hit the officer with her vehicle, and he was acting in self defense. The administration has also called Good’s a “domestic terrorist.” Immediately following the shooting, Noem said that Good, “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.”

But Open Source Intelligence analysts at the New York Times, Bellingcat and the Washington Post all concluded that Good appeared to be driving away from the officer when he fired at her.

In the days following the shooting, protests against ICE erupted around the country, including in Pennsylvania. DHS ordered additional federal agents to Minneapolis, where daily life has been disrupted for residents, schools and businesses.

Where Pennsylvania’s other Democratic reps stand

Many of Deluzio and Lee’s Pennsylvania Democratic colleagues have stopped short of further action beyond calls for investigations and increased oversight. But, none ruled out support for impeachment.

Successfully removing Noem from office is unlikely. Impeachment would require a majority vote in the House, which Democrats don’t hold by a 218-213 margin. A two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict, which would require significant support from the Republican majority.

Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-05), who has a background in immigration advocacy, agreed to an interview with the Capital-Star. She was unequivocal in her condemnation of the shooting of Good, and ICE’s use of force across the country under the Trump administration.

“The whole enforcement push with armed and masked agents in American cities has been dangerous from the start,” Scanlon said. “There have been multiple incidents where these ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents have pulled their guns on people on American streets. There seem to be some serious questions about training, about the conditions in which they should be engaging with people, and huge questions about who it is they’re pursuing.”

Asked what she would support to rein in the agency, including impeachment, Scanlon said that effective measures would require a “Democratic majority.”

“I think we’re constantly struggling with the gap between what we should be doing and what we can be doing in the minority,” Scanlon said. The reality is Congress can’t act without a majority, and right now Congressional Republicans are too afraid of Donald Trump to do what the country needs.”

She called for investigations into the shooting and how ICE is spending its money.

Scanlon, Lee and Deluzio were also among the six of Pennsylvania’s seven Democratic representatives in the House who signed onto a letter to Noem calling for DHS “to take immediate steps to preserve evidence, bring in unbiased investigative partners like the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and ensure the officers involved comply fully with investigators.”

The letter also included specific questions for DHS, including what kind of training the officers involved in Good’s shooting received and what steps the agency is taking to prevent recurring violence against civilians.

Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-02) was the lone Pennsylvania Democrat who did not sign the petition. He did, however, call for Noem’s resignation in a post on the social media platform X.

A spokesperson for Boyle did not respond to multiple questions from the Capital-Star about what steps the congressman would support to provide a check on immigration enforcement, including impeachment, but referred to a social media post he made.

“Kristi Noem is lying,” Boyle said. “We all saw the video. She must resign. And this heinous killing must be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law.”

A spokesperson for Rep. Dwight Evans (D-03) referred the Capital-Star to a social media post.

“I condemn this brutal murder in Minneapolis by ICE agents,” Evans wrote. “There should be bipartisan outrage about this tragedy. The Republican majorities in Congress need to join with Democrats to demand reform and accountability. This violence cannot and should not be normalized.”

Democratic Reps. Madeleine Dean (D-04) and Chrissy Houlahan (D-06) did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star, but both called for investigations on social media. Houlahan also called for the firing of any official who lied about the circumstances of the shooting.

Pennsylvania Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman did not respond to the Capital-Star, but called the incident a tragedy in statements to the press last week.

U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal — the Democrat from the state of Washington who is the ranking member on a subcommittee on immigration — chaired the meeting alongside U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis and some surrounding suburbs.

It was the sixth hearing in a series focusing on federal immigration enforcement, but none have seen the response and turnout from members of Congress like this one, she said.

It followed two shootings by ICE in Minneapolis in a week's time, including the killing of Renee Good that sparked national outcry and set off protests. Jayapal and Omar were joined by all DFL members of Minnesota's Congressional delegation and 24 other House Democrats from 18 states.

""We will do everything in our power to hold the administration accountable and stop this lawlessness,"" Jayapal said.

The Trump administration has doubled down on its presence here, maintaining that federal officers are focused on arresting immigrants here illegally who are ""the worst of the worst."" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Krisi Noem told reporters at the White House on Thursday that there are ""no plans"" to pull out of Minnesota.

President Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in the state.

""It is increasingly clear that the entire purpose of these actions is to provoke chaos and fear in order to justify invoking the Insurrection Act and expand the president's ability to reign terror upon American cities who do not vote for him,"" Omar said.

Patty O'Keefe, a 36-year-old U.S. citizen who lives in Minneapolis, shared with lawmakers her experience being detained by ICE. She said she was arrested after observing ICE operations and was held in custody for more than eight hours before being released with no charges.

""About two minutes into the ride, one agent said, 'You guys got to stop obstructing us. That's why this lesbian b**** is dead,' speaking of Renee Good, which filled me with rage and sadness,"" she said. ""How could you say that?""

Officers, she said, also didn't identify themselves at the time of the arrest and they put her in ankle shackles when she arrived at the Whipple Federal Building in Fort Snelling to the detention facility.

""At the detention center, I was made to feel intimidated and as though my constitutional rights and biological needs didn't matter. After all that I was released without charges, which makes it clear to me that this is more of a campaign to spread fear and terror than it is to enforce the law,"" O'Keefe said.

The 3,000 agents and officers on the ground amounts to five times the number of Minneapolis police officers patrolling the city.

Mendota Heights Police Chief Kelly McCarthy – who was the onetime chair of the state Peace Officer Standards and Training board – said ICE's conduct in Minnesota is not how local police are trained.

Many members questioned her about some of ICE's tactics. She said their actions are eroding hard-fought efforts to rebuild relationships with communities after George Floyd's murder more than five years ago.

""We have to acknowledge that the tactics of some ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge are reducing the public's trust in local police, making the job of our cops harder and making us all less safe."" McCarthy said.

WCCO reached out to all GOP members of Minnesota's Congressional delegation. Majority Whip Tom Emmer and U.S. Rep. Brad Finstad's offices both said neither Congressmen was invited to participate.

""Minnesota Democrats in Congress had zero interest in asking questions during last week's Oversight hearing on fraud, so their sudden interest to exercise their oversight authorities is almost comical,"" Emmer said in a statement, referencing GOP state lawmakers' testimony to the House Oversight Committee last week about ongoing investigations into alleged fraud in state programs. ""Their political charade of a hearing will do nothing to help turn down the temperature in the Twin Cities. They'll come, they'll rail against law enforcement and the rule of law, and will accomplish nothing.""

A spokesperson for Finstad said he ""doesn't attend Democrat anti-police events.""

Many Democrats during the hearing criticized the influx of $170 billion to the Department of Homeland Security approved by Republicans in the so-called ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" last summer — the largest infusion of money Congress has ever allocated for federal immigration enforcement.

Some threatened not to support an additional appropriations bill for the agency as Congress again stares down a deadline for government funding at the end of the month.

""We have the power of the purse and we can demand accountability before giving a single dime more to DHS, to ICE and [Customs and Border Protection],"" Jayapal said.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/16/54ad8776-ffdc-4d97-b805-66587be88315/thumbnail/1200x630/38dc8de8c5e4eead10523cce93b82a53/5p-sot-rep-omar-hearing-wcco9m1d-00-00-0607.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:57:05.796533

It also saw the birth of the modern national security state.
Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly.
For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency.
Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them.","The Trump administration frequently uses fear as a weapon, whether stoking it, pledging to shield some populations from it, or endeavoring to inflict it on others. For example, the administration has engaged in what “border czar” Tom Homan describes as a “shock and awe” campaign that has included aggressively raiding communities around the country, shipping some migrants to dangerous prisons, and publicizing these actions through highly stylized videos and memes. The administration portrays its targets as “the worst of the worst,” as “pedophiles, armed robbers, and drug traffickers” whom law-abiding citizens should fear. The government’s own data, however, suggests otherwise. According to Reuters, “some 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation.” Citizens, too, have been swept up in raids. Entire communities thus have been placed in terror by an administration that claims to be protecting them.

The administration also has employed fear-based governing outside of the immigration context, including against the federal workforce. Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, famously said before the 2024 election that a second Trump administration should inflict “trauma” on federal career employees. He explained that when “‘bureaucrats … wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down …. We want to put them in trauma.’” Vought’s wish has come true, with thousands of federal employees chased out of their jobs through a combination of ideological targeting and large-scale gutting of agencies.

Although Donald Trump, Russell Vought, and their colleagues excel at wielding fear as a tool of governance, they did not invent the practice. In his important new book, “The Triumph of Fear: Domestic Surveillance and Political Repression from McKinley to Eisenhower,” Patrick G. Eddington explores several earlier periods in American history during which federal officials and politicians regularly stoked fear against, and instilled fear in, disfavored targets. Eddington, a senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute who has worked as a CIA analyst, focuses his book on the late 19th century to the 1950s. This era encompassed two world wars, the height of the Cold War, and domestic social and cultural upheaval. It also saw the birth of the modern national security state. Eddington draws on extensive archival research to describe and explain the many ways in which fear pervaded the government and politics of the time and was built into the national security state’s DNA.

Although Eddington navigates the era in a mostly straightforward, chronological manner, several themes and subthemes recur throughout the book. As its title suggests, the book’s overarching theme is fear. Eddington underscores this point from the outset, observing in the introduction that “the driving force” behind the developments he studies—principally the government’s “surveilling, penetrating, and actively subverting domestic political activities”—was “fear.” One aspect of that fear is that felt by “executive branch officials, members of Congress, and those on the federal bench—fear that challenges to existing political, economic, or social paradigms would alter the country in ways that would disempower those who benefitted from the status quo.” As Eddington’s subsequent chapters make clear, fear played a still more ubiquitous role in the events of the time. Politicians and officials not only felt fear themselves; they sought to make others afraid—afraid of their own government and of one another.

Beneath this overarching theme lie the details, spanning decades, of the means that powerful actors in the executive branch, in Congress, and in compliant parts of the private sector used to instill and to respond to fear. Because Eddington covers so much ground, I highlight just three such means here, by way of illustration: the growth of the federal government’s surveillance and secrecy capacities; the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ethnicity and nationality; and the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ideology.

The six decades Eddington explores were pivotal for the growth of the U.S. national security state, including the government’s capacities for surveillance and secrecy. With respect to the federal government’s surveillance activities, Eddington illuminates, among other things, the way that its growth was a product of executive initiative as well as congressional, judicial, and corporate enabling. He explains, for example, that the Treasury Department’s Secret Service Division was the dominant agent of domestic surveillance by the early 20th century, and that it went largely unchecked by Congress for years, even after the press revealed that the division had spied on members of Congress at President Theodore Roosevelt’s direction. Roosevelt had ordered the surveillance in an effort to uncover the source of an earlier media story. A subsequent spying scandal did lead Congress to adopt legislation in 1908, restricting the Secret Service Division’s activities to “defeating counterfeiting and presidential protection.” The scandal was a sensational one: The Navy had directed the division to spy on a naval officer at the urging of the mother of a woman with whom the officer allegedly had had an affair. Even after this scandal and subsequent legislation, however, the Theodore Roosevelt administration remained undeterred. It found a way around the legislative bar by creating a new organization: the Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice. It did so by using the Justice Department’s general revenue fund to employ 30 part-time agents, including many veterans of the Secret Service Division. As employees of the new bureau, these agents conducted domestic surveillance that the Secret Service Division was now barred from conducting.

Eddington traces iterations of this pattern—a mixture of executive initiative, occasional congressional pushback, and more frequent congressional cooperation or willful ignorance—throughout the decades that he chronicles. Take, for example, his coverage of the period from the outbreak of World War I in Europe through the aftermath of both the war and the Russian Revolution. In the months following the sinking of the Lusitania, the Wilson administration grew desperate to surveil suspected German agents and their sympathizers in the United States, leading Wilson to authorize a renewed domestic surveillance role for the Secret Service Division. This action “effectively violate[d] the 1908 law” limiting the division’s activity, and Eddington “found no evidence that Congress was informed” of it. Shortly after the United States entered the war, however, Congress authorized some forms of surveillance by the division—for example, to conduct investigations under the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Food and Fuel Control Act. By the end of World War I, “the [division] and [the bureau had] full-fledged domestic spying counterparts in the [Army and Navy].”

These capacities were augmented through cooperation by corporate and civil society actors. For example, the Bureau of Investigation arranged for the major telecommunications providers to transmit copies, without warrants, of “incoming and outgoing telegrams of individuals or organizations of interest to investigators.” The bureau also partnered with a private organization comprised of volunteer investigators, “the American Protective League,” whose members were known to go rogue, “masquerading as [Secret Service] agents” and “in one case ordering a Des Moines, Iowa, resident to raise the American flag over his home.” Eddington also describes how these surveillance precedents and capabilities continued to be utilized after the war’s end. In the postwar years, “the Bolshevik threat [became] the prime, but not exclusive, focus.” As I elaborate below, other targets would include Japanese Americans and critics of their internment.

Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly. Although secrecy is frequently used to bypass congressional and judicial oversight, Congress and the judiciary enabled executive secrecy in significant ways. For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency. The Espionage Act of 1917 bars a much wider range of speech, including information disclosures. Eddington stresses the Espionage Act’s importance in this regard, focusing especially on its use to punish anti-war speech and other forms of dissent throughout World War I and the Cold War. The Supreme Court also enabled broad prosecutorial discretion to punish anti-establishment but not imminently dangerous speech in a well-known line of cases beginning in 1919. The Supreme Court’s decisions in those cases, including Schenck v. United States, Debs v. United States, and Abrams v. United States, endorsed a narrow view of speakers’ First Amendment protections, particularly during wartime.

Eddington also emphasizes the significance of the state secrets privilege and the Supreme Court’s 1953 decision recognizing it in United States v. Reynolds. The privilege may be invoked by the federal government in litigation where “‘there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.’” A significant problem with the ruling, as Eddington points out, is its suggestion that in some cases judges should not require disclosure even to themselves, for in camera inspection. The danger of abuse that this creates is evidenced in the aftermath of Reynolds itself. The case originated as a tort suit brought by a group of widows whose husbands, all civilian engineers, had perished in a crash of an Air Force B-29 bomber. The Air Force successfully resisted disclosing the accident report on the basis that it contained state secrets, and the Supreme Court refused to order even in camera disclosure. Decades later, the accident report, which by then had been declassified, was obtained by the grown child of one of the passengers. She learned that the Air Force had lied so many years ago. The report contained no state secrets but instead revealed negligence on the part of the Air Force.

The scope of the surveillance and secrecy capacities that Eddington explores is breathtaking, but their greatest significance lies in their wielding by government actors as tools to target disfavored groups and ideas. Among the most notorious instances of ethnic or nationality-based targeting was that perpetrated against Japanese Americans during World War II. Eddington’s research sheds new light on the extent of the government’s surveillance of Japanese Americans before and during World War II, and on the gulf between the information it gathered and the lies it told to stoke fear against, and justify the mass internment of, this group. For example, John Franklin Carter, whom President Franklin Roosevelt had secretly commissioned to perform intelligence work for FDR directly, concluded that “98 percent of the Japanese in Hawaii were ‘loyal to the U.S., and that those who are not’” had already been identified by the Navy and the FBI. In a cover letter forwarding one of his reports to FDR, Carter wrote, chillingly and prophetically, that his investigator “‘feels that the Japanese are more in danger from the whites than the other way around.’”

Eddington also highlights the political considerations that led FDR not only to support mass internment for Japanese Americans, but to prolong it. For example, he cites a memo that FDR wrote to two officials, explaining his view that “it would be a mistake to do anything drastic or sudden” in ending internment. FDR “wanted to determine ‘how many Japanese families would be acceptable to public opinion’ for relocation back to the West Coast” and suggested distributing Japanese Americans around the United States to “avoid[] public outcry” on the West coast. As an intelligence report that Eddington quotes acknowledged, the violent public backlash that did follow Japanese Americans’ return home stemmed both from “racial hatred” and “from whites who [did] not want to resume business competition with returning Japanese.”

Surveillance was also used to target ideological dissenters, including those who criticized the federal government’s actions against Japanese Americans. As Eddington recounts, “Such was the fate of a young Army private and aspiring singer-songwriter named Pete Seeger.” Seeger, who had a Japanese American fiancée (who eventually became his wife of nearly 70 years), wrote to the California American Legion to protest its passage of a resolution calling to deport all Japanese and Japanese Americans from the United States and to bar citizenship for all Japanese descendants. The Legion forwarded Seeger’s letter to the FBI, which eventually built an intelligence file on Seeger that ran more than 1,700 pages.

Seeger’s case is just the tip of the iceberg of ideological surveillance and punishment in American history. Eddington chronicles much of this history, ranging from the Secret Service Division’s targeting of anarchists and the nascent Bureau of Investigation’s surveillance of socialists, through the Palmer Raids, Espionage Act prosecutions of socialist and other speakers, “anti-red” scares stoked by members of Congress and the executive branch, and the efforts across many presidential administrations to surveil and target participants in the civil rights movement.

Among the many striking elements in Eddington’s account of ideological targeting is the way that politicians stoked and wielded fears of socialism and communism to aggrandize themselves and to intimidate and control rival politicians. Eddington recounts, for example, that the House Select Committee on Un-American Activities had lost public and institutional support by 1944 but was revived and turned into a permanent committee after Rep. John Rankin, partnering with the American Legion, launched a public campaign to support it. The resuscitated committee went on to “do massive professional, personal, and political damage to thousands of individual Americans and domestic civil society organizations.” The prospect of committee “witch hunt[s]” also led some congressional Democrats, including Rep. Jennings Randolph, successfully to pressure President Truman to employ harsh internal loyalty measures throughout the executive branch. Eddington also gives their due to those administration members, representatives, and other high-profile figures who resisted the “anti-red” race to the bottom. Eleanor Roosevelt, for one, was a voice of conscience, writing to Truman: “I feel we have capitulated to our fear of Communism, and instead of fighting to improve Democracy, we are doing what the Soviets would do in trying to repress anything which we are afraid might not command public support.”

Eddington’s book is a rich, important contribution to our understanding of a pivotal time in American history, and of the growth of America’s national security state in particular. Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them. As he notes in his introduction, however, “The Triumph of Fear” is extraordinary in its scale and in its use of primary as well as secondary literature to illuminate its subject. And Eddington is particularly effective in his choice of stories to highlight and to connect to the book’s larger theme of fear-based governing and politics.

My one criticism of the book is that Eddington occasionally adds a conclusory statement about legality to an otherwise compelling, evidence-based description of government activity. For example, in discussing proposed legislation to criminalize certain disclosures about cryptology, Eddington states: “This was not an encroachment on the First Amendment—it was a proposal to destroy it in the name of national security.” Having written a great deal myself on the law of national security disclosures and the First Amendment, I am extremely sympathetic to Eddington’s point. It is, however, a complicated legal topic to which justice cannot be done in a single sentence. That said, my quibble is a small one because statements like the quoted one make up a tiny part of an otherwise excellent book. I mention this quibble only because the book on the whole is so strong and because its strength stems largely from its intensely research-driven approach.

Because Eddington does, admirably, let his exhaustive research do most of the talking, he does not step outside of the studied time period to explicitly draw comparisons to the current administration. But readers will do as they please, and I suspect I will not be alone in seeing parallels between some of the terrible developments that Eddington chronicles and events now taking place on a regular basis in the United States. Readers likely will see not only parallels but roots, as today’s abuses are enabled in part by the growth in the national security state that Eddington recounts. Eddington’s book would still be an important contribution even if it were not so lamentably relevant to current events. But in this moment, especially, I am grateful for Eddington’s work. The historical context that it provides enables us better to understand what it is that we are living through.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/surveillance-camera-(1).png?sfvrsn=1f2a75b9_5,N,,2026-01-17 05:58:01.496369

In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), ESA Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virg.), and U.S. Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) warned the changes would gut environmental review, strip protections from hundreds of vulnerable species, and let politics override science in listing decisions—all while the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service face unprecedented staffing and budget shortfalls thanks to the Trump administration.

“These sweeping changes would fundamentally weaken our nation's most important wildlife conservation law at a time when one million species face extinction globally,” wrote the lawmakers. “We urge the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service to withdraw these proposed rulemakings and instead work to implement the ESA as Congress intended: any regulatory changes should further the objectives of the ESA to conserve species and prevent extinction.”

The ESA has prevented more than 99 percent of listed species from going extinct and has helped hundreds move toward recovery. Section 7 consultations typically take just two weeks for informal review and two months for formal review—contrary to conventional wisdom, the ESA does not stop projects from moving forward. According to one peer-reviewed study, the ESA did not halt a single project between 2008 and 2015.

The lawmakers highlighted how the proposed rules would:

Gut Section 7 consultation requirements by letting agencies claim project impacts “would occur regardless of whether the proposed action goes forward” — a loophole that could exempt highways, pipelines, and development projects from meaningful scrutiny;

Strip protections from threatened species — by rescinding the “blanket 4(d) rule” that extends baseline protections to all threatened species, creating dangerous years-long protection gaps that resource-agencies can’t fill. The blanket 4(d) rule provides automatic protections to species such as the piping plover and the West Indian Manatee, species listed as threatened in the future would not receive those same baseline protections; and

Let politics override science by injecting cherry-picked ‘economic’ considerations into listing decisions. Congress explicitly required that listing decisions be based solely on the best available science, not on arbitrary evaluations of certain impacts or political pressures.

“With reduced staff and resources, the Services should prioritize addressing the backlog of species awaiting protection and advancing recovery efforts for those already listed, rather than redirecting attention to rewriting long-standing and effective regulations,” continued the lawmakers. “Habitat destruction and climate change are accelerating species extinction to alarming rates, and we should be working to uphold and strengthen the ESA, not weaken it.”

The letter notes that roughly 90 percent of listed species are threatened by habitat loss, making the proposed restrictions on critical habitat designation particularly damaging to recovery efforts.",https://beyer.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 13:57:27.126306

New Jersey Democrats are objecting to reported plans to build yet another immigrant detention center within the state; some of them have signed onto articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; and there may be an effort to block new funding for the Department of Homeland Security as part of the annual appropriations process. Here’s some of what New Jersey’s members of Congress did in Washington this week.

What not to warehouse

A report in the Washington Post that DHS is looking into converting warehouses in Morris County’s Roxbury Township into an immigrant detention facility has caused a significant stir.

On Wednesday, all ten Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation sent a letter to top DHS officials objecting to the reported proposal, saying that DHS needed to “immediately abandon” any plans to come to Roxbury. (Roxbury’s local GOP congressman, Tom Kean Jr., was not included on the letter and has so far declined to comment on the report.)

“Any expansion of immigrant detention in New Jersey, especially under warehouse conditions that are fundamentally inappropriate for human habitation, contradicts both the interests and values of our state,” states the letter, which was led by Reps. Rob Menendez (D-Jersey City), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing), and LaMonica McIver (D-Newark).

Roxbury local officials, too, have reacted to the report with alarm; following local protests, the all-Republican township council passed a resolution opposing the placement of a detention facility in the town.

New Jersey is already home to two operational immigrant detention facilities, one in Newark and another in Elizabeth, and plans are underway to create more detention capacity at the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst military installation.

Noem more!

After a woman was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week, calls to impeach or otherwise remove Secretary Noem have exploded among Democrats, and at least three of New Jersey’s Democratic House members are on board. Articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Rep. Robin Kelly earlier this week, with Reps. Menendez, Watson Coleman, and McIver all listed as co-sponsors.

“Every day that Secretary Noem remains in office is a day that communities across our country are unsafe and that Americans are at risk,” Menendez said. “We cannot allow this to continue. Since President Trump won’t remove Secretary Noem, I am supporting articles of impeachment.”

Plenty of other Democrats have also called for Noem to go, including for reasons beyond immigration; Reps. Frank Pallone (D-Long Branch) led a letter this week demanding that President Donald Trump remove Noem from office due to her “misguided leadership” of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a call that Rep. Herb Conaway (D-Delran) signed onto as well.

“Kristi Noem has proven herself no better suited for a leadership role, and we urge you to immediately remove her and submit qualified nominees to lead DHS and FEMA to the Senate as soon as possible,” the letter states. “The American people deserve better.”

Freezing out ICE

Government funding bills continued to wend their way through Congress this week, lessening the prospect of another government shutdown at the end of the month. But not every New Jersey Democrat is on board: Senators Kim and Booker both voted against one appropriations package in the Senate, while Reps. McIver, Watson Coleman, and Menendez opposed another in the House.

And one of the bills that has yet to make it through either chamber of Congress, funding the DHS, could prove to be a particular challenge. Some Democrats are signaling their disapproval of any measure that would give more money to the government’s controversial immigration enforcement efforts, among them Booker.

“I am not going to support a budget that gives more money to an agency right now that is out of control,” Booker said, per Pix11. “That’s not even a question for me. I will not be voting to support this budget until we start seeing some true accountability and high professional standards.”

Booker also introduced a pair of bills this week to reign in the power of ICE and the DHS: one requiring immigration enforcement officers to wear body cameras, and a second that would establish higher training standards for federal law enforcement officers. Rep. Donald Norcross (D-Camden), too, introduced a separate body camera-related bill in the House.

The failed votes will continue until morale improves

A relatively obscure bill that would have limited overtime pay for voluntary worker training programs unexpectedly failed on the House floor this week, with two of New Jersey’s Republican congressmen among those responsible.

Reps. Chris Smith (R-Manchester) and Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis) – both of whom have longstanding ties to organized labor despite their party affiliation – joined a breakaway group of six Republicans who sank the bill, and GOP leaders pulled two other labor-related bills from consideration soon afterwards. According to NJ Spotlight News, both congressmen felt that the bill would be a blow to organized labor, with Smith even brandishing a letter from the AFL-CIO to make his point.

“Once I really understood and looked at the bill, I didn’t feel comfortable,” Van Drew told NJ Spotlight after the vote. “Bottom line: People who got a certain amount in their paychecks would get less. I don’t agree with that.”

Tuesday’s vote wasn’t the first time New Jersey’s Republicans defected on a labor bill this Congress; in December, Van Drew, Smith, and Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-Westfield) all teamed up to support a Democratic-led bill restoring collective bargaining rights for federal workers.

War powerless

Last week, it looked like the GOP-controlled Senate might take the remarkable step of rebuking President Trump’s military actions in Venezuela via a war powers resolution, which would have required congressional approval for further operations. But while five Republican senators voted to advance the resolution last week, two of them returned to the Republican fold when it came up for a further vote on Wednesday, dooming it to failure.

Senators Booker and Andy Kim both strongly supported the resolution, and Booker said that Republicans “refused to do their jobs” to reassert congressional authority over acts of war.

“The Constitution is unambiguous: Congress has the power and responsibility to authorize the use of military force and declare war,” Booker said. “Congress has a duty of oversight. Congress must serve as a check, not a rubber stamp, to the President. Congressional Republicans have failed on all of these counts.”

En banc shot

A month and a half after her disqualification from service as acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey by a three-judge federal appellate panel, Alina Habba made a move this week to get the entire Third Circuit to reconsider her case.

Habba resigned from her contested office in December after the Third Circuit ruled against her, but said at the time that she would be interested in returning if the courts allowed it. Now, with its new petition to get an en banc rehearing, the Justice Department is once again gearing up to make the argument that President Trump’s unusual appointment of Habba was lawful and proper.

“The panel’s interpretation of the [Federal Vacancies Reform Act] would hobble Presidential transitions and has been routinely violated by the last four administrations without any court holding the practice unlawful,” the motion states. “Rehearing en banc is warranted.”

In the month since Habba resigned, New Jersey’s U.S. Attorney’s office has been led by a triumvirate of officials who each have jurisdiction over different divisions of the office – though the Trump administration said that arrangement, too, has come under legal challenge.

Congressman names a bill after the thing that nearly killed him

Rep. Norcross nearly died last year after a gallbladder infection progressed to sepsis, and he’s now putting forward legislation to help others like him. The SEPSIS Act – which, of course, stands for the Securing Enhanced Programs, Systems and Initiatives for Sepsis Act – would direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create a new sepsis education program and direct staff and resources to focus on the condition.

“I am here today because of the excellent doctors and nurses who saved my life, but too many families aren’t as lucky,” Norcross said. “With the SEPSIS Act, we can change that. We can save lives and reduce the devastating toll this condition has on our loved ones.”

Norcross has a bipartisan pair of New Jersey co-sponsors in Rep. Kean and Senator Kim; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) are also taking up the charge in the upper chamber.

“New Jersey has long been a leader in the fight against sepsis, and I am grateful to partner with a fellow member of our state’s delegation to bring this critical effort to the federal level,” Kean said.

Other Garden State plots

• With an especially aggressive strain of the flu sweeping the nation, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-Tenafly) put forward a set of proposals this week for states to fight back, including via his FIGHT FLU Act, which would give states more money for mobile flu vaccination centers.

“This flu season is particularly deadly, and we need more people to get their flu shots,” Gottheimer said. “Again, let me be as clear as day: Politicians should not overrule doctors. Ideology should never replace science. And when families get confused, fewer kids get vaccinated – and more kids end up in hospitals like this one.”

• Late on Tuesday, the Trump administration suddenly cut off $2 billion worth of funding for mental health and drug addiction services – then, after an outcry, reversed course just 24 hours later. Democrats reacted to the entire saga with derision and alarm.

“This series of events showcase the ineptitude of Secretary Kennedy and the overzealous nature of his team,” Rep. Watson Coleman said. “I’m working with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to put in guardrails to prevent Secretary Kennedy and the extremists in the Trump administration from ever doing this again.”

• Rep. Van Drew announced this week that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has completed its restructuring of the Atlantic City Housing Authority after taking it over last year, and said that there will be 25-40 new job opportunities at the agency.

“I have always said the residents living under the previous ACHA deserved better, and now we are finally seeing some real progress,” Van Drew said. “HUD came in, did a full overhaul, and focused on what actually matters: putting residents first. Now that work is paying off.”",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bonnie-impeachment.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:57:13.938719

Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — both Democrats — marking a striking escalation in an already volatile standoff between the state and federal government.
The deployment was followed by the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good during an ICE operation and a second shooting days later.
“This operation was never about safety, it’s a targeted political operation and Minnesota won’t stand for it,” Walz said after the lawsuit against ICE and DHS was filed.
“Mayor Frey and Governor Walz have to get their city under control,” Noem said in a DHS press release.","The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — both Democrats — marking a striking escalation in an already volatile standoff between the state and federal government.

The investigation centers on whether Walz and Frey violated federal law by allegedly conspiring to impede immigration agents during the Trump administration’s sweeping enforcement operation in the Twin Cities, sources told CBS News.

“Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly. Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” Walz said in a statement following reports of the probe. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.”

The move comes after weeks of mass Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deployments in Minneapolis and St. Paul, public protests following deadly encounters involving federal agents and repeated threats from the Trump administration to further escalate its response.

At issue is 18 U.S.C. § 372, a rarely used statute that criminalizes conspiracies to prevent federal officers from performing their duties through force, intimidation or threats. In plain terms, the administration is advancing the theory that criticism and opposition by elected officials may have crossed the line from protected political speech into criminal obstruction.

The reported probe lands amid extraordinary tensions.

Since December, the Department of Homeland Security has flooded Minneapolis with thousands of federal agents under what it calls Operation Metro Surge. The deployment was followed by the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good during an ICE operation and a second shooting days later.

The incidents ignited protests across the Twin Cities and prompted Walz to activate the National Guard to prevent further unrest.

Earlier this week, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, joined by Minneapolis and St. Paul, sued DHS and ICE, alleging the surge violates the Constitution, unlawfully commandeers state resources and targets Minnesota for political retaliation.

“This operation was never about safety, it’s a targeted political operation and Minnesota won’t stand for it,” Walz said after the lawsuit against ICE and DHS was filed.

Frey has argued that the overwhelming federal presence has made Minneapolis less safe by diverting local law enforcement resources and inflaming tensions.

“No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable,” Frey said after the second shooting involving an ICE agent. “America, this is not the path we can be on.”

The Trump administration has responded with increasingly incendiary rhetoric.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has accused Walz and Frey of encouraging criminal obstruction.

“Mayor Frey and Governor Walz have to get their city under control,” Noem said in a DHS press release. “They are encouraging impeding and assault against our law enforcement which is a federal crime, a felony.”

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche went further, framing the conflict in explicitly punitive terms.

“Walz and Frey — I’m focused on stopping YOU from your terrorism by whatever means necessary,” Blanche wrote. “This is not a threat. It’s a promise.”

The Justice Department has yet not publicly confirmed the probe and no charges have been filed against Walz or Frey.

But even at the investigatory stage, the reported probe signals a significant shift — from a policy dispute over immigration enforcement to the potential use of federal prosecutorial power against elected officials who refuse to comply.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25239775261026-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 05:57:48.574315

Ron Gochez, a teacher and member of Unión del Barrio, said volunteers who respond to the operations are dispatched around the clock.

""These operations are literally happening 24 hours a day. We get calls at 3 in the morning, 5 in the morning,"" he said.

Civil rights groups reported at least 20 immigration enforcement operations in a single day this week, including in Montebello where agents were captured on video getting out of an unmarked truck and climbing a ladder to chase construction workers on a rooftop.

Those types of scenes, activists say, have kept many families in a constant state of fear for months.

Baristas at Vida Pura, a coffee shop in East L.A., said the raids have directly impacted their families. Alexa Ibarra said her family shut down its food truck out of fear. Elias Reyes said he's taken on a second job and is worried his father - a U.S. citizen - may be targeted because of the color of his skin and line of work.

Gochez said that while the enforcement actions have been constant and intensified, so has the community response.

""Now we have thousands of people patrolling all over Southern California. Literally all the way from Riverside to Santa Barbara to San Ysidro at the border, to Lancaster,"" he said. ""They failed to take as many people as they wanted to, and we attribute that to the organized resistance.""

In East L.A., workers at Vida Pura said the raids weigh heavily on the community.

""Just knowing that people are living in fear right now, it's not fair,"" Ibarra said.

The Cherokee Nation has recently informed its citizens to be aware of a potential presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the area.

Local leaders, including the Cherokee Nation, are advising residents to exercise caution, stay informed, and know their rights when interacting with federal immigration officials.

""Every day we get phone calls from clients or potential clients or just members of the community concerned with what is going on in this country and what they are seeing on the news, on social media,"" Rivas & Associates CEO and Immigration Attorney Lorena Rivas said.

The Cherokee Nation has received calls and messages from citizens about ICE potentially operating in some manner in northeast Oklahoma. Local legal experts encourage citizens to carry identification, assert their identity respectfully, and report any concerns to trusted authorities.

""Do tell your identity and if you definitely have some lawful status here, you’re a green card holder or again a U.S Citizen express that and hopefully you have the evidence to show that you should not be detained or questioned by ICE,"" said Rivas.

Experts emphasize the importance of knowing one's rights if approached by immigration officials and recommend not fleeing when encountered by ICE. They note that federal agents must follow specific protocols.

""They are a law enforcement agency. They have their own set of rules but at the same time they have to respect the constitution rights of people, which is due process and not be subject to unlawful arrests of people without the proper warrants or the proper justification,"" said Rivas.

The Cherokee Nation is reaching out to federal contacts to determine if an ICE presence is factual and, if so, what the scope of any ICE operation is in the area. Regardless, the guidance remains the same: stay informed, know your rights, and communicate concerns with trusted authorities.

""Hopefully many of our law-abiding immigrants don’t have to encounter this situation if they do, it's good to be prepared by having a telephone number memorized who they can call, contact once they are detained. Also making preparations in case you are detained for your kids, your businesses, your home. Also, an advice try to talk to an immigration attorney now before being detained,"" advised Rivas.

The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests.","Two videos add new details to what happened before and after an immigration agent shot a man in the leg in the Hawthorne neighborhood in north Minneapolis Wednesday night.

One video, a livestream of a 911 call from inside the house, includes a woman saying that the immigration agent shot the man, who she said is her husband, as he was entering the house. The livestream also shows at least one child present in the house.

Another video, taken by a north Minneapolis resident from across the street and shared with the Reformer, shows federal agents firing numerous times into the house, breaking a second-floor window.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Reformer on Friday that the agents had fired tear gas, not live rounds.

The incident began on Interstate 94, where federal agents were trying to apprehend a man, federal law enforcement and Minneapolis police said. The man drove toward a house on the 600 block of 24th Avenue North in north Minneapolis, where he wrecked the car outside the house and ran towards the house, federal and local law enforcement said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Thursday that the man who was shot is Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, and that he “began to resist and violently assault the officer.”

“While Sosa-Celis and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,” the official federal statement said. The statement goes on to say that Sosa-Celis then began striking an officer with a shovel or broom stick.

According to the DHS statement, the officer, fearing for his life and safety, then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life,” after which the three men ran into the house.

Federal immigration agents arrested all three men, the statement said, and Sosa-Celis and the officer who shot him were at the hospital when the statement was published.

The Washington Post interviewed Sosa-Celis’s mother, Alicia Celis, who said her son told her that the man who was pursued by federal agents was actually Sosa-Celis’s friend, one of the three men arrested.

Facebook livestream of 911 call and observer video

According to Celis, Sosa-Celis opened the door to let his friend inside, and as Sosa-Celis went to close the door, an ICE officer shot him in the leg, reported the Post.

A Facebook livestream video, which appears to show the moments after the man was shot from the perspective of his wife and other people inside the house, partly lines up with Sosa-Celis’s account. The video was published by an account by the name of Lachamaka Mendoza and is timestamped to Wednesday 6:51 p.m., the exact time Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said local police started receiving 911 calls about the shooting.

The Reformer has requested records of the 911 calls made after the shooting to further verify the video.

In the video, at least five people, including one small child, are in a house while law enforcement lights flash outside. They speak on the phone in Spanish to what sounds like a 911 operator, saying that someone has been shot in the leg by “guys from ICE.”

“Please help, we have kids,” one person said.

A woman then tells the operator: “It was ICE, they were chasing my husband for like half an hour and they were trying to crash into him. He got to the house and as we were closing the door they shot him.”

Another woman adds: “Tell them that they shot the door.” It is not clear from the video whether she meant that the agents shot through the doorway or at a door.

The 911 call suggests that the agent shot at the man as he was trying to escape into the house, which would contradict the Department of Homeland Security account that the federal immigration agent fired a shot defensively.

A separate video taken by a north Minneapolis resident starts around 7:26 p.m. and shows the vantage from across 24th Avenue North.

In that video, over a dozen agents surround the house. At minute 2:55 in the video, the agents fire what DHS said was tear gas into the house, shattering the second floor window; at least three more shots are heard later.

At around 5 minutes into the video, federal agents enter the house. One observer yells that there are children in the house. Around 16 minutes into the video, a woman who appears to be wearing a pink shirt exits the house — the Facebook livestream video also included a woman with a pink shirt.

“This is something I would have never expected to see in my life,” said the man who took the video and was granted anonymity by the Reformer. “It’s still hard for me to believe that this is actually happening in my city, so close to my home.”

The BCA’s independent investigation

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency that investigates law enforcement shootings, was on the scene Wednesday night along with FBI agents to process evidence.

Also present at the scene were Minnesota State Patrol and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies, which O’Hara said were there to help control the crowd of over 100 protestors and observers who had gathered, as well as Federal Bureau of Prisons officers.

The BCA said in an X post Wednesday night that it is investigating the shooting in an independent investigation.

The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, the Trump administration said she was attempting to run over the ICE officer and kill him. But bystander footage shows a chaotic scene with the officer to the side of her car when he shoots her as she seemingly tries to flee.

All three men are from Venezuela and came to the U.S. in 2022 and 2023, according to the DHS statement. The statement describes two of the men as criminals, though the only listed offenses for Sosa-Celis are driving without a license and giving a false name to a law enforcement officer.

Minnesota court records show that a 24-year-old Julio Cesar Sosa Celis has been fined for speeding and driving without a license or proof of insurance.

Last week, an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, 37-year-old mother of three, in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protests. On Thursday, President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and send troops to Minnesota.

Following the shooting of Renee Good, ICE’s violent tactics have come under increasing scrutiny. A new investigation by ProPublica documents more than 40 cases of immigration agents using banned chokeholds and other moves that can cut off breathing.

In one case, ICE agents violently arrested an ICU nurse in California named Amanda Trebach while she was documenting ICE operations in the Los Angeles area. Two plainclothes, masked agents were filmed pinning her against the pavement as they knelt on her back. One agent put his knee on Trebach’s head for a brief moment.

EYEWITNESS 1: Filming you.

EYEWITNESS 2: Get off her head!

AMANDA TREBACH: Get off me!

EYEWITNESS 2: Get off! Your knee is on her [bleep] head!

EYEWITNESS 2: I am where I need to be: 10 feet. So…

ICE AGENT 2: Can you guys get her in the van?

AMANDA TREBACH: Sir?

EYEWITNESS 2: You OK?

AMANDA TREBACH: Yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: Amanda Trebach was then held in federal custody. After her release, she appeared on Democracy Now!

AMANDA TREBACH: They came out in a convoy. They jumped out of the vehicle. As you could see, they pinned me to the ground, and they handcuffed me. They took me into an unmarked vehicle. They did not read me my rights. They didn’t tell me where I was going. They shut the vehicle. They drove me to the other side of the noncivilian side of Terminal Island. And basically, they kidnapped me.

AMY GOODMAN: We’re joined now by ProPublica reporter Nicole Foy, her latest article headlined “We Found More Than 40 Cases of Immigration Agents Using Banned Chokeholds and Other Moves That Can Cut Off Breathing.” In October, Nicole also revealed how ICE detained more than 170 U.S. citizens.

Nicole Foy, welcome to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. Why don’t you lay out your latest findings? Talk about these potentially lethal chokeholds — which are, in fact, illegal?

NICOLE FOY: Yes. My co-worker McKenzie Funk and I, we spent of this last year documenting aggressive tactics by immigration agents. And what we found is that over the last year, immigration agents across the country have used these really dangerous and banned — by their own policy — chokehold and carotid restraints, as well as many of these also dangerous kneeling on people’s necks, kneeling on backs, like we saw with Amanda, in ways that can really restrict your breathing and your blood flow, which is one of the reasons why their own training actually highly discourages these types of arrest. But we’ve seen it across the country.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Nicole, can you talk about some of the specific examples that you document — for instance, Arnoldo Bazan, a 10th grader in Texas?

NICOLE FOY: Yes, he was — that’s a case that I think really sticks out, because he is a 16-year-old U.S. citizen, and he was really violently arrested with his father in a store in Houston. You can hear him in the video, as officers are putting him in a chokehold, screaming that he’s a minor, that he’s 16, he was going to school, that he’s a U.S. citizen. And yet he told us that that didn’t matter. The agent continued to use a chokehold on him, that, again, is banned unless there is a call for deadly force.

And when we showed videos like this one to a number of police officers, other former immigration officials and top DHS officials, they were really appalled, and they had no idea what could have prompted this level of deadly force, especially against someone like a 16-year-old U.S. citizen, who really had really difficult and dramatic injuries to deal with in the aftermath.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Now, there is a federal ban on chokeholds and similar tactics. Have any officers, from your reporting, who’ve used these tactics faced disciplinary measures?

NICOLE FOY: We’ve yet to find any evidence that they have. We asked the Department of Homeland Security if they have disciplined any officers, especially in cases where we showed them these videos and said, “Your own policy bans the use of a carotid restraint, the use of a chokehold. Have these officers been disciplined?” And they did not answer us, would not tell us if any had been disciplined for these tactics. And they stood very firmly behind their officers’ actions and said that they were acting with the utmost professionalism and even using a reasonable amount of force.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to read from your piece. “Immigration agents have put civilians’ lives at risk using more than their guns. An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck, choking him so hard … his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; [she] then appeared to pass out. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing.” That’s what you wrote. Tell us more about these cases.

NICOLE FOY: I think the case of the young father in Massachusetts is particularly disturbing, and was really disturbing for so many of the bystanders who were there witnessing it and recording it. Like you said, he refused to be separated from his young daughter, a 1-year-old, who was in the car with him in between him and his wife. Agents had come to arrest his wife, but she also didn’t want to leave her 1-year-old behind. She said that she was still breastfeeding, and she couldn’t leave the child behind. And in an effort — and we know this because we reviewed bodycam footage and bystander footage — we know that officers really wanted them, specifically this young man, Carlos, to let go, and he wouldn’t let go of his daughter or his wife.

And so, you can see in the video the moment when an agent decides to reach around from the back and press his fingers and thumb into his neck. And he appears to start having a seizure. And he shakes so violently that his young daughter, who is, of course, crying, is shaking with him.

He did end up getting to be released with his daughter, but he’s filed a lawsuit alleging not only excessive force, but also alleging that ICE officers delayed medical attention when he requested it on the scene. And so, it was — it’s really a difficult video to watch, but these arrests are playing out around the country, and often in full view of cameras and witnesses.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And this issue of ICE arresting American citizens? You mentioned there have been about 130 of them, including about a dozen elected officials. Could you talk about some of those cases, especially the case of Dulce Consuelo Díaz Morales?

NICOLE FOY: Yes. So, last year in October — and this count was only updated as of October 2025 — we had found that more than 170 U.S. citizens in total were arrested around the country by immigration agents. Around 130 of those were actually arrested after accusations of assaulting officers or during protests or because they were alleged to be obstructing ICE activities. But there were also many other U.S. citizens, like Dulce, who were arrested and detained because of the fact that immigration agents believed that they were not U.S. citizens. And this is despite evidence that was often presented to them at the time of arrest or afterwards by family members. I believe that is the case of what happened with Dulce, that she — they presented a birth certificate, and yet she was still detained for a number of days over the holidays, if I’m remembering correctly.

AMY GOODMAN: Dulce Consuelo Díaz Morales’s case first gained national attention when one of her attorneys took to the internet out of frustration with the lack of legal process and progress in the case.

VICTORA SLATTON: My name is Victoria Slatton. I’m an immigration attorney. I currently have a client who is a U.S. citizen who is in ICE custody. … They are blatantly ignoring orders from the court. They are not allowing me access to my client. And I am at a loss, and I’m incredibly angry.

AMY GOODMAN: Dulce Consuelo Díaz Morales was finally released from ICE detention earlier this month. And this is how NBC4 Washington reported on her release and reunion with her 5-year-old son.

MAURICIO CASILLAS: This is the moment when Dulce Consuelo Díaz Morales is once again able to embrace her son. The 22-year-old mother says she was overjoyed, and it was an incredibly emotional moment when she saw her son once again. She says she was detained by ICE agents on December 14th in front of her family near her home in Baltimore. She says ICE agents told her to get out of the car because she was being detained. She says she tried to explain to them that she was born here in Maryland, but she says they didn’t believe her.

AMY GOODMAN: In your ProPublica exposé, what has surprised you most, Nicole?

NICOLE FOY: I think one of the most surprising things is maybe that both — like, this is just happening around the country, and often just really in full view of cameras, whether people — whether immigration agents are arresting U.S. citizens —

AMY GOODMAN: And they’re grabbing cameras.

NICOLE FOY: And grabbing cameras. I think that is really, like, as someone who is a journalist, and so, of course, as a huge advocate of the free press — it is perfectly legal to document these activities, and yet many of the U.S. citizens who have been arrested by immigration agents believe that they were arrested because they were filming, and after they were told to stop filming.

AMY GOODMAN: And agents are usually masked. How can they be held accountable? You are documenting illegal actions.

NICOLE FOY: I think it’s really difficult. We’re, of course, seeing a number of states and other municipalities try to find some way to allow their residents to file — to file lawsuits against officers. But that’s really difficult when not only have — are these agents masked, the government is not telling us, usually, who someone is that has committed an act of excessive force or something like that. But on top of that, the institutions within ICE and DHS that are supposed to hold these officers accountable and at least conduct some type of internal review have been just completely stripped of personnel and authority.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you very much for being with us. Nicole Foy is a reporter for ProPublica covering immigration and labor. We’ll link to all your recent pieces.

Coming up, President Trump threatens to invoke the Insurrection Act and send troops to Minneapolis. We’ll talk about the significance of this and also speak with Mahmoud Khalil about a ruling that came down in court yesterday. Could it lead to his rearrest and possible deportation? Stay with us.

The US justice department is investigating two prominent Minnesota liberals over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations, an escalation of the Trump's administration's clash with Democrats.

Gov Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are facing an inquiry over comments made about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.

The investigation came as a federal judge limited what actions thousands of federal law enforcement officers could use in Minneapolis, blocking the use of pepper spray and arrests of peaceful protesters.

Protests have ramped up in the city after Renee Good, 37, was shot and killed by an ICE agent last week.

New details also came to light on Friday about Good's death. The Minneapolis woman was found by paramedics with at least three gunshot wounds and possibly a fourth to the head, according to official reports viewed by CBS.

Governor Walz responded on Friday to news of the inquiry against him by posting on X: ""Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic.

""The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.""

In a statement to the BBC, Mayor Frey said ""I will not be intimidated"".

""This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our streets,"" he said.

The BBC has reached out to the justice department about the apparent investigation.

The governor has urged Minnesotans to protest peacefully, but members of the Trump administration have accused him of inflammatory rhetoric, like describing ICE as a ""modern-day Gestapo"". Frey has demanded that immigration agents get out of Minneapolis.

The inquiry is focused on a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 372, which makes it a crime for two or more people to conspire to prevent federal officers from carrying out their official duties through ""force, intimidation or threats"", a US official told CBS.

Protests continued in Minneapolis on Friday as US District Judge Katherine Menendez blocked federal authorities from using pepper spray and other non-lethal force on those demonstrating.

The 83-page order halts the thousands of federal officers currently deployed to the city as part of immigration operations from arresting peaceful protesters.

It also blocks them from stopping or detaining those who are driving or passengers in vehicles ""where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering"".

The judge notes that a person following federal law enforcement in their vehicle ""does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop"".

Before she was killed, footage showed Good in her SUV, appearing to honk the vehicle to alert neighbours in the area of the presence of immigration authorities.

The Trump administration has said that Good was impeding federal law enforcement and tried to run the agent over before he opened fire. Local officials say Good was a legal observer who posed no danger.

Video of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is blocking traffic and parked in the middle of the street. An officer instructs her to get out of the car.

As Good turns her wheel apparently trying to drive away, her Honda Pilot SUV pulls forward with one of the agents standing near the front of the vehicle. He pulls his gun and fires.

An incident report from the Minneapolis Fire Department, which was viewed by CBS News, said when they responded to the shooting scene last week, it appeared Good had been shot twice in the chest, once in her left forearm and a fourth wound, possibly from a gunshot, was seen ""on the left side of the patient's head"".

Paramedics found Good unresponsive with an irregular pulse, and she was pronounced dead in the ambulance on the way to hospital, according to the report seen by CBS.

Footage from the scene shows the agent walking off afterwards.

But Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have told CBS the officer suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the incident. No further details have been disclosed.

The FBI is investigating the incident, although there is no federal civil rights inquiry into the agent who opened fire. Local officials and authorities say they have been shut out of the investigation.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump blasted demonstrators and local leaders on Friday.

On Truth Social, he accused protesters of being ""highly paid professionals"", adding that Walz and Frey had ""totally lost control"".

Later, the Republican president told reporters at the White House that he did not plan to invoke the Insurrection Act and send in troops to quell unrest in Minnesota, after earlier this week suggesting he might do so.

""If I needed it, I'd use it. I don't think there's any reason right now to use it,"" he said. ""It's very powerful,"" he added.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8157/live/3baf6cd0-f324-11f0-93be-b59669b0a56b.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 00:58:00.278178

The House Appropriations Committee chair, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., indicated that he was optimistic about a deal earlier this week.","Support for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement is surging in the wake of the killing of Renee Nicole Good and officers’ increasingly violent conduct in Minneapolis and across the United States. Democrats in Congress, however, are clinging to the idea that the agency, which has become the tip of the spear in President Donald Trump’s authoritarian crackdown, can be reformed instead.

On Jan. 9, ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed Good, a Minneapolis resident. Since then, multiple surveys have been published showing support nearing all-time highs for abolishing ICE.

A Civiqs poll published Monday found that 42% of respondents supported abolishing ICE, while 49% opposed, with support for abolishing the agency rising from 25% at the beginning of 2025. On Tuesday, a survey from the Economist and YouGov found that 46% of respondents support abolishing the agency, while 43% oppose doing so.

So far, however, calls to abolish ICE have gone unheard by political leadership, with only a handful of Congressional Democrats supporting the move.

It’s not clear, however, that Democrats will even use the leverage they have ahead of the Jan. 30 appropriations deadline to force reforms on the Department of Homeland Security. If Congress does not pass appropriations bills before the deadline, they risk a partial shutdown of Trump’s government, with shutdowns corresponding to which funding bills are passed. The most recent government shutdown was the longest in U.S. history.

In the Senate, members of the self-fashioned “Fight Club,” a group of Democrats aiming to challenge current leadership, have responded with reform bills aimed at reining in ICE.

“These actions have no place in our democratic republic, and we cannot allow these secret police tactics and attacks on our fundamental freedoms.”

The most drastic measure, known as the PUBLIC SAFETY Act, has been proposed by Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev. The bill would redirect some $75 billion from ICE toward local law enforcement agencies. This act would essentially revoke the $75 billion budget Congress gave ICE last year, in addition to the $10 billion that ICE had already been appropriated.

“On streets in Oregon and across the country in recent weeks, we’ve witnessed the dangerous, lawless actions of ICE and federal agents, a manifestation of Trump’s authoritarian regime,” Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told Salon. “ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good in Minnesota. In Portland and other cities, heavily armed, unidentified federal forces in unmarked vehicles are grabbing protesters off the street, even detaining U.S. citizens. These actions have no place in our democratic republic, and we cannot allow these secret police tactics and attacks on our fundamental freedoms.”

In response, Merkley is calling for the removal of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and the passage of the Preventing Authoritarian Policing Tactics on America’s Streets Act, which would force ICE to display officers’ identities and limit ICE’s crowd control functions, among other provisions. Merkley is also backing the Restoring Access for Detainees Act, proposed by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., which would require DHS to allow detainees to contact their families and legal counsel.

Similarly, in the House, Democrats have eyed changes to ICE. Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., who sits on the Committee on Homeland Security, told The Hill last week that “I think there is a pathway to accountability through the appropriations process.”

The Congressional Progressive Caucus announced Tuesday that it would oppose new funding for DHS until meaningful reforms are enacted.

“Our caucus members will oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriation bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices,” Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said at a press conference Tuesday. “We cannot and we should not continue to fund agencies that operate with impunity, that escalate violence and that undermine the very freedoms this country claims to uphold.”

Similarly, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus indicated to Politico that it would also be supporting reforms to ICE. The Democrats who favor reforms, however, have yet to consolidate around a list of demands.

Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., a House progressive, has proposed multiple bills relating to the agency. The first would end qualified federal immunity for ICE officers. The second would fully dismantle the agency, with Thanedar explaining that the U.S. was able to effectively manage immigration enforcement, a civil issue, before ICE’s creation in 2003.

“Before 2003, without ICE, various federal agencies were able to take care of business, and we can do this without ICE. But we do not need the murderers. We do not need this paramilitary organizations’ members on our street terrorizing US citizens,” Thanedar said at a press conference on Wednesday.

Some House Democrats have also banded together to present articles of impeachment for Noem, accusing her of obstruction of Congress, violation of the public trust, and self-dealing. However, these articles aren’t likely to go anywhere in the GOP-controlled House, and are even less likely to result in a conviction in the Senate.

So far, however, it’s not clear whether the appetite for major reforms for ICE, let alone discussion of eliminating the agency, has percolated into Democratic leadership in Congress.

The leader of the Democrats in the House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., laid responsibility for Good’s death at the feet of administration officials and promised a decisive response. Jeffries has separately indicated that he’s planning to speak with other members of Congress on the issue this week. However, he has yet to make demands other than for a comprehensive investigation into the killing, an investigation which the administration has made clear isn’t going to happen.

“Blood is clearly on the hands of those individuals within the administration who’ve been pushing an extreme policy that has nothing to do with immigration enforcement connected to removing violent felons from this country,” Jeffries told reporters last week.

The leader of Democrats in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has also demanded an investigation, but little else. On separate occasions, Schumer blamed the shooting first on a lack of cooperation between ICE officers and local police, and then on a lack of training for ICE agents, though these don’t appear to be new policy proposals. Notably, the killer has been working with ICE since 2015. While ICE has often been criticized for its low standards for its officers, Ross had more than enough time to receive training.

All of this is coming to a head just weeks before the Jan. 30 appropriations deadline. While there are some congressional Democrats who are poised to put up a fight, all that the party has secured so far is a delay in the vote on DHS funding. The House Appropriations Committee chair, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., indicated that he was optimistic about a deal earlier this week.

The Trump administration has repeatedly said the surge of immigration enforcement in Minnesota is the result of “sanctuary politicians who release criminal illegal aliens directly from jails onto the streets to terrorize more innocent Americans,” but Minnesota officials say the state’s prisons work directly with ICE.

Since President Donald Trump took office, Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “have released nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens back onto the streets of Minneapolis,” said U.S. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin this week, calling on the state “to stop this dangerous policy and commit to honoring the ICE arrest detainers of the more than 1,360 criminal illegal aliens in Minnesota’s custody.”

The Minnesota Department of Corrections, however, said Thursday night those numbers are “categorically false.”

Of about 8,000 people incarcerated in the state’s prisons, 207 are non-U.S. citizens, according to the DOC statement. The state’s prisons notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement when someone with a detention hold is being released from custody to coordinate a pick-up from immigration officials.

County jails and workhouses are a different matter. State law says local law enforcement cannot hold people in custody solely based on civil immigration detainer requests from ICE, according to a legal opinion last year from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.

County boards, however, can enter into such agreements with ICE, according to another advisory opinion from Ellison. Seven of Minnesota’s 87 counties have agreements with ICE. They are Cass, Crow Wing, Freeborn, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Mille Lacs and Sherburne counties, according to ICE.

Ramsey County said in 2014 that the county jail would no longer hold people on ICE detainers without a judge’s order, adopting a policy that was already in place for the Hennepin County jail. At the time, ICE directives and federal court decisions had made such holds discretionary.

In 2017, Ramsey County notified ICE they would stop housing people suspected of violating immigration rules effective Jan. 1, 2018; the sheriff’s office said they were losing money in the detentions.

“The ongoing misstatements by DHS leadership reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of how the criminal justice system operates,” DOC said in its statement. “Conflating local jail populations with state prison operations and confusing immigration enforcement authority with correctional custody misleads the public and obscures the truth.”

The DOC pointed out that Homeland Security hasn’t specified which jurisdictions or timeframes they’re using for their numbers. DHS and ICE spokespeople did not respond to Pioneer Press messages Friday.

Additionally, “DHS has not identified a single instance in which the Minnesota Department of Corrections released an individual from state prison custody in violation of an ICE detainer,” the statement said.

Last year, 84 people with ICE detainers were released from prison and DOC staff notified ICE in advance and coordinated with ICE officials to facilitate the custody transfer when requested.

Many on DHS’s ‘worst of worst’ list weren’t in state prison

According to Homeland Security, their operation targets “criminal illegal aliens” with prior convictions for serious crimes such as sexual assault, domestic violence and gang affiliation, as well as individuals with final deportation orders.

Although DHS has not released a complete list of those arrested, the agency has said in several news releases they’ve included “pedophiles, rapists and violent thugs” who were “allowed to roam Minnesota’s streets thanks to sanctuary policies.”

DHS has highlighted some of the people they’ve arrested, calling them “the worst of the worst” and listing their charges or convictions; however, in most cases, where those took place are not included. The names do not include dates of births, making independent verification by the Pioneer Press through Minnesota and federal court records systems unreliable.

Minnesota’s Department of Corrections operates state prisons, not local jails. Many people who DHS recently listed as the “worst of the worst” were never in DOC custody and instead held in county jails, were under ICE-only custody or were in other states’ correctional systems, according to DOC.

A Homeland Security news release Wednesday highlighted the case of German Adriano Llangari Inga, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador charged in a drunken driving crash that killed 31-year-old Victoria Eileen Harwell in north Minneapolis on Aug. 3, 2024.

According to DHS, the Hennepin County jail refused to honor two ICE detainers: first after his arrest and again after he was charged with criminal vehicular homicide.

Court records show that Llangari Inga, 36, was charged on May 2, 2025, after testing on his blood-alcohol content was complete, and arrested eight days later. Three days after his arrest, he was released from the Hennepin County jail after posting a $100,000 bond, despite, according to ICE, a second detainer placed on him.

ICE arrested Llangari Inga on May 16, 2025.

“Victoria Eileen Harwell’s killer NEVER should have been RELEASED from Minnesota jails,” DHS’s McLaughlin said in this week’s news release.

White House, governor at odds

Minnesota law requires DOC to notify ICE when a person in prison is not a U.S. citizen. “DOC fully complies with this requirement and goes further by honoring all detainers as a matter of policy, even though state law does not require detainer compliance,” DOC said in its statement. “ICE alone determines whether to place a detainer and is responsible for arranging pick-up.”

The White House said in a Friday statement that “Minnesota’s ‘leaders’ have chosen defiance over partnership. Instead of working with the Trump Administration to uphold the law and protect public safety, the state’s Democrat politicians have repeatedly boasted of their so-called ‘sanctuary’ status, encouraged resistance, and smeared ICE officers.”

But Walz’s office said the Minnesota legislature “has not passed legislation making Minnesota a sanctuary state, and the governor has not signed any such legislation into law. The fact is, Minnesota cooperates with federal immigration authorities in a number of ways.”

“The federal government seems to suggest that Minnesota’s reluctance to divert its own resources to implement federal policy somehow frustrates the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws,” the governor’s office statement said.

“That is simply not the case. It is ridiculous to suggest that Minnesota — a state that is over 1,500 miles away from the Southern border, and a thousand miles from lawmakers in Washington, D.C. who decide and implement border policy — is somehow responsible for a failure of immigration enforcement,” the statement continued.

The White House, meanwhile, said Friday that a “toxic combination of ‘sanctuary’ policies and anti-ICE rhetoric” is endangering federal officers and inciting violence.

“Make no mistake: the responsibility for the enhanced enforcement operations in Minnesota — and the tension and violence — lies squarely with these officials who refuse to partner with the Trump Administration and instead put their Radical Left agenda over public safety and the rule of law,” the White House statement said.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/STP-Z-ICESTPAUL-0117-01.jpg?w=1024&h=706,N,,2026-01-17 00:58:03.773292

During the hold on the deportation agreement between the U.S. and Venezuela, hundreds of Venezuelans were deported to Mexico.","A plane carrying deported immigrants landed in Venezuela on Friday — the first removals from the United States since the Trump administration captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

The six-hour flight departed from the Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix and landed in Simón Bolívar International Airport, according to U.S. watchdog group Human Rights First, a flight monitor of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and journalists in Caracas. Eastern Air Express, which carries out a significant number of deportations for ICE, was the carrier. Local media reported that the manifesto listed 231 people but that 199 passengers had arrived. It also published photos of the plane arriving on the tarmac.

The flight appears to be the first U.S. deportation flight in over a month to Venezuela. The last one that advocates, experts and journalists tracked was on Dec. 10. Two days later, the Venezuelan government announced the U.S. had unilaterally suspended flights amid escalating tensions. Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to a request for comment from the Miami Herald about who was deported and how many people were on the flight.

Friday’s flight raises questions about how negotiations between Caracas and Washington will affect future deportations. President Donald Trump has made Venezuelans a principal target of his aggressive mass deportation efforts. He stripped deportation protections for more than a half-million Venezuelans who had Temporary Protected Status, leaving them vulnerable to being sent back to Venezuela, where millions have fled political repression and extreme poverty.

Between February and December 2025, the government sent 14,310 deportees to Venezuela on 76 flights, according to watchdog group Human Rights First.

During the hold on the deportation agreement between the U.S. and Venezuela, hundreds of Venezuelans were deported to Mexico. The Herald reported that deported and detained Venezuelans, as well as their families, said immigration agents had offered to send them to countries like Honduras, Colombia, Nicaragua and Ecuador, as well as Uganda, an East African nation with no shared language or cultural ties to Venezuela.

A day after meeting Trump in Washington, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado told reporters that the Venezuelan government has used migration from the South American country as a bargaining chip. When asked about the first deportation flight of Venezuelans after Maduro’s capture, she said the only pathway for the millions Venezuelans to return is to “give the people certainty that we will have a democratic future.”

Venezuela has been experiencing a humanitarian crisis for more than a decade, forcing over 8 million people to flee their country amid economic collapse, political turmoil and shortage of necessities. The U.S. has become one of the primary destinations for the exodus, with over 800,00 Venezuelans living in the country, many in South Florida.

About 5.1 million people in Venezuela face hunger, according to the United Nations, and over half of the population is living in extreme poverty. There are shortages of basic supplies like gasoline and medicine, power and water outages are common, and healthcare infrastructure is inadequate. Violent crime is also common, and the government violently represses journalists and dissidents.

“That’s what we’ve always done in asking people who they are so that we know who’s in those surroundings,"" she added.

Noem was responding to a question posed by a reporter, who wanted to know why people were asked to provide proof of citizenship in Minnesota.

The news comes a little more than a week after an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good during a federal immigration enforcement raid in Minneapolis on January 7. Her death has sparked protests throughout the area and beyond.

The agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, fired his gun after Good allegedly tried to ram him and other officers with her SUV. Ross reportedly suffered internal bleeding when he was hit by her vehicle.

The Trump administration said Good was an agitator, with Vice President JD Vance saying the agent acted in self-defense.

In a separate case, a federal officer shot an illegal migrant in the leg on Wednesday night in Minnesota after being attacked with an object described as a shovel or a broom during an arrest.

DHS later identified the suspects in connection to the case as Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, a criminal illegal migrant from Venezuela, who was previously convicted for driving without a license and arrested for two counts of giving a false name to a police officer.

The other two individuals involved were identified as Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma.

In a social media post on Friday, Noem praised President Donald Trump, saying U.S. borders ""are safer than any time in our nation’s history"" thanks to his crackdown on illegal immigration.

""What President [Donald] Trump and our CBP agents and officers have been able to do in a single year is nothing short of extraordinary,"" she wrote.

""Once again, we have a record low number of encounters at the border and the 8th straight month of zero releases,"" she added. ""Month after month, we are delivering results that were once thought impossible: the most secure border in history and unmatched enforcement successes.""

Good's family released a statement earlier this week to honor her life, as well as their love for her. They also thanked the public for an outpouring of support.

""We want to thank everyone who has reached out in support of Renee and our family,"" Good's parents, Tim and Donna Ganger, along with her four siblings, said in the statement.

“To all the Republicans out there, to all the conservatives out there: You’re about to lose the midterms,” Smith said during an episode of his SiriusXM show.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is expected to send more than 2,000 agents to Minnesota as part of its immigration operations in the state.
“What we’re hearing about is chaos, chaos, chaos, and oh my lord, we don’t need to see this again,” Smith said.
“We don’t need to see this again.” He added, “That’s what you’re hearing about, and you’re hearing a president that doesn’t know how to be quiet.”","Sports commentator Stephen A. Smith warned Thursday that the Trump administration’s policies could cause Republicans to lose this year’s midterms.

“To all the Republicans out there, to all the conservatives out there: You’re about to lose the midterms,” Smith said during an episode of his SiriusXM show. “You’re going to lose, and you might lose the presidency in 2028, and it’s going to be at the fault of your president, Donald Trump.”

He claimed Trump is “blowing it,” pointing to escalating tensions over the administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota and his failure to meet campaign promises to lower the cost of living.

“He’s blowing it for himself, he’s going to blow it for the GOP, he’s going to blow it for Congress, he’s going to blow it for the Senate, and he’s likely going to blow it for the White House, all because of what I said from day 1: The man don’t know how to act,” Smith said.

He added that the president’s claim to return to the country to “normalcy” falls short amid the deployment of federal agents to the North Star State.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is expected to send more than 2,000 agents to Minnesota as part of its immigration operations in the state. Ongoing protests over the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer have led to intense clashes between federal officials and demonstrators. The demonstrations were exacerbated a week later by a second ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis.

The incidents have sparked concerns among Democrats who have called for DHS reforms.

Now more Americans are taking up the call,"Claire Wang, www.theguardian.com, claire-wang",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/16/abolish-ice-movement-renee-nicole-good,"In the summer of 2018, “abolish ICE” became a rallying cry as thousands took to the streets to protest against immigrant family separations under Trump’s first term.
“There are lessons about taking to the streets,” said Jacinta González, a leading immigrant rights organizer for more than 15 years.
But the phrase “abolish ICE” became a call to arms seemingly overnight when political strategist Sean McElwee typed it in a tweet that went viral.
The momentum behind the “abolish ICE” campaign grew so strong that a dozen legislators endorsed the cause.
“ICE losing credibility in the public’s eye, the recognition of how much power there is in showing up, all that is thanks to the work that happened under the first eruption of the ‘abolish ICE’ movement,” Prieto said.","As mass protests erupted over the past week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent killed Renee Nicole Good, thousands of Americans hoisted signs and marched to thunderous chants of “abolish ICE”.

The mantra has quickly captured the bursting anger and grief of a nation; activists and progressive lawmakers like the representative Ayanna Pressley, and even the conservative commentator Bill Kristol have embraced the demand. Shri Thanedar, a Democratic representative from Michigan, said he planned to introduce the “Abolish ICE act”, a bill that would dismantle the federal agency and its current enforcement authority. For the first time, more US adults now support eliminating ICE than those who oppose it, according to a new Economist/YouGov poll.

It wasn’t just the 7 January shooting of Good, a mother of three and US citizen, in Minneapolis, that has sparked outrage over Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. In 2025, 32 people died in ICE custody, making it the agency’s deadliest year in two decades. Worksite raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago have led to the arrest of thousands of immigrants without due process and triggered massive protests demanding that federal agents leave their communities and be held accountable for alleged human rights abuses.

To longtime immigrant rights activists, the reckoning may feel familiar.

Juan Prieto, the digital communications manager for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, said the movement today to end or rein in ICE was “so much realization” of the legwork and learnings laid down by the first iteration of “abolish ICE”. “A lot of directly impacted advocates taught American citizens how to look out for immigrants,” he said.

In the summer of 2018, “abolish ICE” became a rallying cry as thousands took to the streets to protest against immigrant family separations under Trump’s first term. Top Democrats, such as 2020 presidential hopefuls and senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand, adopted the demand. Just as quickly, though, the momentum spluttered. Party leaders and strategists declared the slogan a divisive, unpopular policy demand that would hurt Democrats’ electoral chances, and it fell from mainstream political discourse even as deportations soared under the Joe Biden presidency. Eight years later, with the country again in the throes of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns, activists at the forefront of “abolish ICE” say the campaign set in motion today’s anti-ICE resistance. The movement’s setbacks can also form a blueprint for building a stronger movement.

“There are lessons about taking to the streets,” said Jacinta González, a leading immigrant rights organizer for more than 15 years. “But this time around, we’re building community and building a vision about what having a world without ICE can look like.”

The rise of ‘abolish ICE’

The push to abolish ICE has its roots in the police and prison abolition movement that Black scholars like Angela Davis had long advocated for. But the phrase “abolish ICE” became a call to arms seemingly overnight when political strategist Sean McElwee typed it in a tweet that went viral.

“The central assumption of ICE in 2018 is that any undocumented immigrant is inherently a threat,” McElwee wrote in an article for the Nation that same year. “In that way, ICE’s tactics are philosophically aligned with racist thinkers like Richard Spencer and the writers at the white-supremacist journal VDare.”

ICE was created in 2003 as a unit of the brand-new Department of Homeland Security, in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The agency is primarily tasked with locating, detaining and forcibly removing undocumented immigrants. Securing the border and enforcing Trump’s family separation policy are functions of Customs and Border Protection, another federal agency established in 2003.

While it seemed to come out of nowhere, the movement to abolish ICE was built on many years of grassroots organizing led by undocumented immigrants. Anti-ICE organizing started practically as soon as the agency formed, but it gained momentum during the record number of deportations under Barack Obama’s administration, said Amy Gottlieb, an immigrant rights lawyer and activist with the group American Friends Service Committee.

Obama’s policy of deporting “felons, not families”, Gottlieb said, also perpetuated the enduring narrative of “good” and “bad” immigrants – the idea that some are more deserving of citizenship than others – that would drive a wedge among immigrant rights groups. “As we moved into that first Trump administration, I think there was a sense of real anger at how many people were deported,” she said.

González, the head of programs at digital rights non-profit MediaJustice and a founding organizer of the No Tech for Ice campaign, said the early Trump years pulled back the curtains on how ICE operated. “The first Trump administration was a moment when they were very unapologetic about the fact that the cruelty was the point,” said González, who was a senior campaign organizer for the Latinx rights group Mijente at the time. “We saw it as our goal to free people from those types of surveillance and detention and deportation.”

Throughout the sweltering summer months, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated and camped outside federal detention centers across the country, shutting down facilities in several cities. One woman, Patricia Okoumou, scaled the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in protest against Trump’s hardline immigration policies.

The momentum behind the “abolish ICE” campaign grew so strong that a dozen legislators endorsed the cause. In the 2018 midterm elections, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made dismantling ICE a central campaign demand in her upset victory over the representative Joe Crowley. The representative Mark Pocan introduced legislation to eliminate the agency, though it didn’t gain much traction in the House.

“I think our wins against detention centers really started to happen after that point,” said Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network and author of Unbuild Walls: Why Immigrant Justice Needs Abolition. “I think a lot of that was because new people were entering the fight, new people really understanding the role of ICE in their local communities and the sort of entanglements that existed.”

The fall

Shah said the “abolish ICE” campaign faltered after Biden took office because his administration failed to establish itself as a foil to Republicans on immigration matters.

“The movement didn’t know how to pressure the Biden administration because they didn’t signal they cared to do much about immigration,” Shah said. “People were pushing for some sort of relief, but because of the narrative around the border, Biden shied away from the issue and didn’t put forth much of a pro-immigrant stance.”

Though Biden didn’t conduct the same scale of interior enforcement as Trump did, Shah said, the focus quickly shifted away from fighting deportations to addressing the border crisis. Much of the legislation and policy changes that emerged from the “abolish ICE” movement, she said, was focused on reviewing or replacing the agency rather than shuttering it.

For some who have been fighting the agency’s deportation machine since the beginning, even “abolish ICE” doesn’t fully capture the movement’s goals, given that ridding the agency still leaves behind enforcement mechanisms that allow for the mass detention and deportation of immigrants.

“Abolishing ICE needs to be the floor, not the pinnacle,” Shah said. “Going back to a system with fewer agents and more collaboration with local police is not the solution.”

Prieto, at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, said the movement struggled against a lack of courage and “political imagination” from the Democratic party. Rather than capitalizing on the popular, unflinching demand to abolish ICE and the deportation apparatus, Prieto said, Democrats ended up capitulating to Republicans as the country moved right. Kamala Harris, who called for a restructuring of ICE ahead of her 2020 presidential bid, adopted a tough-on-immigration stance in her presidential run four years later. Last January, shortly after Trump’s inauguration, 46 House Democrats voted with Republicans for a bill that required the detention of undocumented immigrants charged with theft-related crimes.

“Democrats consistently struggle with utilizing grassroots momentum to actually create tangible change that better reflects the needs of people on the ground,” said Prieto, who was organizing with the California Immigrant Youth Justice Alliance in 2018.

The rise again

Despite the setbacks, Prieto said the 2018 “abolish ICE” campaign laid the groundwork for much of the grassroots resistance against the agency today, including “know your rights” workshops, the many rapid-response groups supporting families targeted by raids, and the growing efforts to close detention facilities across the country.

“ICE losing credibility in the public’s eye, the recognition of how much power there is in showing up, all that is thanks to the work that happened under the first eruption of the ‘abolish ICE’ movement,” Prieto said.

Mantras and chants have shaped the movements of Trump’s second term. But the slogans that mobilized the masses over the past year, such as the “No Kings” and “Hands Off” protests, were expressions engineered by national organizations, rather than organic phrases that took off on social media. Over the past week, fervent calls to abolish ICE found new life because Good’s death sparked a collective outrage reminiscent of that during the immigrant family separations.

González said explicit calls for abolition have not gained as much traction until now because the stakes – the danger of engaging in activism under this administration – are higher. But that doesn’t mean the work has stopped.

“We just witnessed someone lose her life just being a civilian present,” she said, “and you still have people showing up to do the same thing, coming together to make sure people are fed, are still going to school is astounding.”

To capitalize on the current moment of reckoning, Prieto said, the Democratic party has to engage with the demands of protesters and immigrant rights activists to abolish all systems of policing, detention and enforcement – a campaign that does not end with the dismantling of ICE.

“It’s coming to terms with the reality that we’re living in and really having the political imagination necessary to get us out,” Prieto said. “Our opposition has a vision of an authoritarian white nationalist utopia that they’re working day in and day out to accomplish. I don’t think our leaders have that level of progressive envisioning.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16773dc38d6792f2e5932e67db6559ce7aff4710/456_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a545dd063da37a1fd88446187ab8ff3",N,,2026-01-16 22:59:02.261988

The Kansas Supreme Court justices listened to arguments from both sides Friday.

Laura Kelly and Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach have clashed over taking legal action on behalf of the state.

The Kansas Supreme Court justices listened to arguments from both sides Friday.

Kelly sued Kobach over her ability to represent Kansas late last year. The political divisions between the offices has led to disagreements on when the state should sue in court or join existing lawsuits.

Kelly had asked Kobach to sue the Trump administration over the distribution of food benefits and the release of federal funds for public health and safety programs.

But Kobach refused Kelly’s requests and challenged her authority to join multistate lawsuits on the state’s behalf.

Stephen McAllister, representing Kelly, told the justices that the governor is not seeking to completely take over authority to represent the state of Kansas.

“The governor seeks a ruling from this court that her supreme executive authority includes the power to litigate to protect her executive interest,” McAllister said.

But the justices said “interests” were difficult to legally define.

McAllister said the governor can request the attorney general to take up matters on behalf of the state, but Kobach too often declines.

“If he declines, which he often does, then she has the power to hire her own counsel and proceed with litigation,” McAllister said.

Kobach disagreed with this, and argued that the governor is “dead wrong” about her executive authority.

He said he has no problem with the governor suing on behalf of her office, but she can’t sue on behalf of the people of Kansas.

“The opposing counsel said she can sue on behalf of her executive interests. What are executive interests? That's that's the whole waterfront,” Kobach said

Kobach equated the state's legal power to a set of blocks. The governor’s authority, the attorney general and others fit together.

“Ultimately, this is a question of constitutionality, which this court has already previously established,” Kobach said.

“Recent incidents involving the unlawful detention of tribal citizens from federally recognized tribal nations are deeply troubling and unacceptable.","The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians on Thursday, Jan. 15, added its voice to a growing number of Michigan tribes cautioning members about Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and how to deal with them.

At least five of Michigan's 12 federally recognized Native American tribes have now issued statements to their members cautioning them about interactions with ICE and reiterating the rights of tribal members as U.S. citizens.

""Recent legal developments and Supreme Court rulings have authorized federal agents, including ICE, to conduct brief investigative detentions — commonly referred to as 'Kavanaugh stops' — based on perceived ethnicity, language or occupation,"" the Grand Traverse Band said in an FAQ for members. ""Considering these racial profile practices that have the (consequence) of including Native Americans as a class subject to 'Kavanaugh stops,' all GTB Tribal Members are advised to understand their rights and the legal weight of their Tribal Identification in protecting you from ICE enforcement practices.""

This week, ICT, a nonprofit news group that shares stories from Indigenous communities, reported that at least five Native Americans were detained during ICE operations in Minneapolis, Minnesota, despite being U.S. citizens.

Tensions in Minneapolis, and nationwide, have grown in the wake of the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman by ICE agents in the city, and a second non-fatal shooting. Protests took place across the country on Sunday, Jan. 11, against ICE even as President Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to send in soldiers to stop protests.

In addition to the the warning by the Grand Traverse Band, the Bay Mills Indian Community, the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians also have issued warnings on Facebook to tribal members regarding ICE in recent days.

""The recent actions taken by Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) have created fear, confusion and uncertainty. One of the best ways to protect ourselves is through being well informed and prepared,"" the Little Traverse Bay Band said in a Facebook post. ""As Waganakising Odawak, we are family. As a family, we must look out for each other.""

Advice from the tribes includes carrying their tribal ID at all times, stating they are a tribal member and a U.S. citizen if approached by ICE, that remaining silent is a right, and what to do and who to call if they are detained.

Here's what Michigan tribes are telling members.

What is the Bay Mills Indian Community saying?

In the wake of the Minneapolis shooting and detentions, Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle on Jan. 13 cautioned members in a Facebook post that ICE may operate in the Upper Peninsula, and reminded tribal members they hold U.S. citizenship.

""In recent weeks, heightened tensions have emerged as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have stopped and detained tribal members and tribal descendants, raising urgent concerns about dignity, safety, and respect for Native American citizens,"" Gravelle wrote. ""Tribal citizens, including all Bay Mills Indian Community tribal citizens, are United States citizens by law — by virtue of the Snyder Act, also known as the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. ICE has no jurisdiction over U.S. citizens in matters of immigration.""

In a two-page FAQ, the Bay Mills Indian Community said all tribal citizens should ensure they have a valid and current tribal ID and enrollment card. The FAQ also advised members to be prepared to show additional documentation if asked, including such things as passport, passport card, Real ID license or immigration status paperwork.

What is the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians saying?

Sault Tribe Chairman Austin Lowes spoke out against ""recent aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities"" in a Jan. 14 press release.

“The Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians strongly condemns recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities that have created fear, confusion, and anxiety within Indigenous communities and among minority communities more broadly. Enforcement actions that rely on intimidation and racial profiling undermine public trust and place innocent people at risk,"" Lowes said in the release.

“Let me be clear: the Sault Tribe opposes any ICE activity that creates fear and anxiety in both tribal communities and larger communities as a whole. No one should feel unsafe in their neighborhood, workplace, or homeland because of how they look, the language they speak, or the country they were born in,"" Lowes said in the release. “Recent incidents involving the unlawful detention of tribal citizens from federally recognized tribal nations are deeply troubling and unacceptable.

What is the Snyder Act?

The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, also known as the Snyder Act, was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on June 2, 1924, granting full citizenship to American Indians and Alaska Native Americans, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior - Indian Affairs.

The 15th Amendment, passed in 1870, granted all U.S. citizens the right to vote regardless of race, but it wasn't until the 1924 that American Indians and Alaska Native Americans could enjoy the rights granted by the amendment, the Department of the Interior said.","https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/15/PSTC/88189399007-agent.jpg?crop=2047,1152,x0,y68&width=2047&height=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-16 22:59:31.137921

Tim Walz of Minnesota and Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and whether they had conspired to impede federal agents.","A federal judge in Minnesota imposed restrictions on the actions of immigration agents toward protesters in the state on Friday, a decision that comes after weeks of mounting tension between demonstrators and federal officers.

Judge Kate M. Menendez ordered agents not to retaliate against people “engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity,” and not to use pepper spray or other “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech. The judge also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

The ruling, which granted a preliminary injunction, stems from a lawsuit brought by activists who said agents had violated their rights. The suit was filed before an immigration agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.

Ms. Good, 37, had partially blocked a roadway where agents were working and did not follow commands to get out of her S.U.V. As she began to drive, an agent near the front of her car opened fire.

Minnesota residents have clashed with federal agents since late 2025, when the federal government began an immigration enforcement campaign that it named Operation Metro Surge. Judge Menendez’s order applies only to federal agents in Minnesota who are participating in that campaign.

Judge Menendez, who was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., clarified in her order that “the court’s injunction does nothing to prevent defendants from continuing to enforce immigration laws.” The injunction did not include explicit protections for recording of agents or other provisions sought by the plaintiffs.

In Illinois, where immigration agents amassed for several weeks last year, a federal judge issued a sweeping injunction that placed several limits on how agents could use force and interact with protesters. An appellate court later blocked that ruling, calling it too broad and too prescriptive.

Tensions have been especially high in Minnesota since the killing of Ms. Good last week and the shooting of another man, who was injured, by an agent this week. Federal officials have accused Ms. Good of trying to ram the agent who shot her with her car. Minnesota officials have disputed that notion, and a New York Times video analysis suggests that Ms. Good, a U.S. citizen, was steering away from the agent when he opened fire. In the most recent shooting, officials said that the man, whom they described as being in the country illegally, was resisting arrest and had assaulted an agent with a shovel or a broom.

In recent weeks, protesters have been gathering in small groups and in large crowds, yelling at agents to leave Minnesota. In the lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota and law firms on behalf of activists, the plaintiffs claimed that federal agents had violated their constitutional rights by using excessive force. They said agents had intimidated, harassed or arrested protesters who had not interfered with agents.

Lawyers for the Trump administration pushed back against those claims in court and have repeatedly described protesters in Minnesota as violent and unruly. They also argued against the injunction, saying that it “would place this court in the business of micromanaging D.H.S. officers’ conduct throughout Minnesota.” Federal officials have said their surge of immigration agents in Minnesota, a state led by Democrats, is necessary to crack down on illegal immigration and root out fraud in social service programs.

A separate lawsuit filed by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seeks to have a judge find the surge to be unconstitutional and order a stop to the campaign. No ruling has been reached in that case.

On Friday, the Trump administration was said to have opened a criminal investigation into Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and whether they had conspired to impede federal agents. Mr. Walz and Mr. Frey both described the inquiry as a weaponized use of law enforcement power.

“The space finishes are damaged, peeling, and antiquated,” said the memo, which added that less than two percent of the project was for Scott’s personal office.
The remaining $1.9 million project — renovations much of which were related to mold remediation, improvements to security systems and IT infrastructure, according to the memo — was allowed to proceed.
That leads other DHS agencies to have to deal with problems because of Scott, according to the officials.
They’ve done such a bang up job at the border that it’s almost not an issue anymore for the public.”","That has focused attention on the DHS division, which is a linchpin not only of Trump’s mass-deportation agenda but efforts to build the border wall and collect tariff revenue. Scott’s renovation budget has become a concern of the department’s top political leadership, who also said that Scott is not delivering results at the speed that they want, according to the three officials.

“Don’t waste our time with silly things like this when we have other priorities we want to focus on,” said one of the officials. “The last thing that should be in mind is making your office fancier.”

A fall memo that Customs and Border Protection facilities and asset management official Yvonne Medina sent to DHS’ acting chief financial officer explained the remodeling project was long overdue because the commissioner’s suite hadn’t been properly updated for 25 years. A spokesperson for the division defended the proposed renovations as part of “a routine and responsible part of managing government contracts.” Scott didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The fixer upper

Top officials working for Scott, a longtime law enforcement official who came up through the ranks of the U.S. Border Patrol, started drafting a $2.1 million request for the renovation project in September. It included a budget for $299,850 on furniture, $86,733 on “services” related to the furniture and $33,000 on “window treatments, millwork, and equipment” for the 1,100 square-foot commissioner suite, according to the memo. POLITICO obtained a copy of the memo that was approved by DHS acting CFO Holly Mehringer on Nov. 17. Much of the rest of the money was slated for renovations related to mold remediation, improvements to security systems and IT infrastructure, according to the memo.

“The space finishes are damaged, peeling, and antiquated,” said the memo, which added that less than two percent of the project was for Scott’s personal office.

That request was met with befuddlement by Noem’s team, who were surprised that such an ask was made because they felt the proposed amount of money to spend was excessive, according to the three officials granted anonymity because they’re not authorized to speak to the media. They noted that the agency’s offices in the Ronald Reagan Building complex will be turned over to the FBI for its long overdue headquarters, although there’s no timeline yet on when the FBI would start to move in.

“We were like, what? This seems totally insane,” said the second official about the proposed renovation.

In line with federal law requiring a notification for political appointee office renovations over $5,000, Mehringer notified the Senate and House homeland security appropriations subcommittees that the agency intended to “make improvements to the commissioner’s suite” and that the total project cost was $2,064,765, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. The letter was sent on Dec. 11, according to the third official. Spokespeople for the subcommittees didn’t respond to requests for comment.

“This contract began under the Biden administration and was reviewed and updated, a standard procurement practice,” the division spokesperson said in a statement. “During the standard review it was decided to proceed only with necessary, mission-critical updates. These fixes included addressing fire alarm deficiencies, mold concerns, and installing furniture needed to accommodate staff members now that they have returned to work.”

The letter noted that there had been two recent renovations as well of the commissioner’s offices. It said that DHS had notified the relevant congressional committees in June 2023 for an intention to renovate “general finishes” within the suite for a cost of $966,636 and in February 2024 notified Congress of “additional work required to improve fire protection and life safety” for a total project cost of $1,167,665.

Noem’s team and DHS general counsel’s office rejected the $137,000 portion of upgrades to Scott’s suite at the end of December, according to the three officials. The remaining $1.9 million project — renovations much of which were related to mold remediation, improvements to security systems and IT infrastructure, according to the memo — was allowed to proceed.

“Secretary Noem personally reviews and approves any contract above $100,000 to ensure every penny is spent to advance DHS’s mission of protecting the American people and safeguarding our nation,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Through this thorough review and prudent financial stewardship, she has saved the American people over $13 billion in less than a year.”

Notwithstanding those numbers, Noem has received criticism from Democrats for DHS’ purchase of two Gulfstream private planes for her and other top DHS officials, which the department defended by saying they were needed for safety and to replace a jet more than 20 years old. She also got flack for staying rent-free in a military house reserved for the Coast Guard’s top admiral, which the department also defended by saying she had been doxed and had to live in a secure location.

Earlier renovations to the agency in the Biden administration led to replacing carpets in the office and getting rid of mold in wallpaper and window frames, according to a Biden official granted anonymity to avoid angering the agency’s current leadership. The division also added in new flooring and kitchen appliances including a refrigerator and dishwasher as part of the project, according to the former official. The former official also noted that there’s been a series of renovations of different floors of the division’s space in recent years.

What it’s really about

As the Trump administration faces internal fallout from the deadly Minneapolis shooting, top DHS political leadership, including Noem and top aide Corey Lewandowski, have told people they’re frustrated that Scott is not delivering results at the speed that they want, according to the three officials. His critics say he appears to have trouble focusing on Trump’s priorities and, even though he has a couple dozen hours of meetings a week, is slow to make decisions. That leads other DHS agencies to have to deal with problems because of Scott, according to the officials.

Scott is being blamed for slow progress on construction of a wall along the border with Mexico. Builders have to contend with the Biden administration’s decision to mostly stop the work, forcing the division to restart anew with funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Finalizing contracts for the border wall “should be the focus each and every day, and it’s clearly not,” said the third official. “That’s the president’s priority, that was the president’s campaign promise and so to not prioritize that as top of the billet is pretty unacceptable.”

Scott has also rejected DHS requests on several occasions to appear on cable news defending the administration’s immigration policies, the third official said, angering colleagues in a TV-focused administration.

Scott served as the Border Patrol’s chief at the end of the first Trump administration and beginning of the Biden administration before he was forced out. His nomination, backed by groups which favor restrictions on immigration, cleared the Senate last June despite reports he was part of a private Border Patrol Facebook group where racist and misogynistic memes were shared and members joked about the deaths of migrants. He has said at the time he joined the group to monitor his workforce.

Mike Howell, president of the Oversight Project, a conservative non-profit organization that works on immigration, said Scott “has done a legendary job in securing the border.”

“This is why all the conservative border organizations pushed hard for his nomination and confirmation,” he said in an interview. “His support remains absolutely strong with those who are tracking the issue closely and behind the president’s agenda.”

The renovation plan was one of the reasons Noem moved one of her own into his agency at around the same time that Scott lost one of his top allies that diminished his influence in the administration.

Scott’s chief of staff, James Kernochan, in recent weeks moved to be deputy director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in what was seen as a loss to Scott’s juice in Trump world, according to one of the officials and another person familiar with the matter. The imbroglio over the office renovation was also among the factors that led DHS in late December to install DHS’ acting general counsel Joseph Mazzara as deputy director of Customs and Border Protection, according to two of the officials.

The two officials said DHS leadership hopes Mazzara can help Customs and Border Protection to better assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement to increase the number of deportations and develop the border wall. One of the officials said it was intentional to put the department’s top attorney in a powerful role usually occupied by a career agency official.

Kernochan and Mazzara didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In an interview, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that pushes for less immigration, said Scott has done a “pretty good job” and pointed to how border crossings have virtually stopped under his tenure.

“He’s almost kind of like the Maytag repairman in those commercials,” said Krikorian, who supported Scott’s nomination. “The Maytag repairman was the loneliest guy in town because Maytag was so reliable that he had nothing to do. It’s sort of a similar thing here. They’ve done such a bang up job at the border that it’s almost not an issue anymore for the public.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F62%2Fb4%2Ffa65d99146cd982b868f976b8c15%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2212766393,N,,2026-01-16 22:59:33.949639

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday announced the arrest of what it called the ""worst of the worst"" criminal illegal immigrants during Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota, including a man with 24 criminal convictions.

The agency blasted state and local leaders for refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

DHS said the arrests show the results of ICE enforcement operations in sanctuary jurisdictions, contrasting the agency’s actions with what it described as the refusal of Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to honor ICE detainers.

""These are the criminals Governor [Tim] Walz and Mayor [Jacob] Frey are protecting. No American wants these criminals for neighbors.""

DHS said the arrests were made as part of Operation Metro Surge, a targeted enforcement effort focused on removing criminal illegal aliens from Minnesota neighborhoods. The department said the operation prioritizes offenders with serious criminal histories, including violent crimes.

According to DHS, criminals arrested in the state during the operation include Hien Quoc Thai, a Vietnamese national who was previously convicted of murder.

Brian Anjain from the Marshall Islands has 24 criminal convictions, including assault causing bodily injury, domestic abuse, public nudity, theft, interference with official acts, public intoxication and trespassing, DHS said.

El Paso medical examiner likely to classify death as homicide, Washington Post reports

DHS claims detainee attempted suicide, resisted security staff

ACLU urges closure of criticized detention facility

WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials on Friday provided a new but incomplete account of an immigrant detainee's death in Texas after a report emerged suggesting it may have been homicide.

The Washington Post on Thursday reported, opens new tab the El Paso County medical examiner is likely to classify the death as a homicide, raising more questions about how it unfolded.

The January 3 death was one of four deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody over a 10-day period at the start of the year. Detention deaths reached a 20-year high in 2025 as President Donald Trump's administration ramped up the number of people held for alleged immigration violations.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security initially said in a January 9 press release it was investigating the death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, which occurred after he experienced ""medical distress.""

Lunas was being held in Camp East Montana, a detention site opened by the Trump administration inside Fort Bliss that has been criticized by immigrant rights advocates.

DHS did not provide a cause of death, but the Washington Post reported that the medical examiner's office planned to list the cause of death as a lack of oxygen due to pressure on the neck and chest, citing a recording of a conversation between the medical examiner's office and the detainee's daughter.

The Post also interviewed a detainee held at the Camp East Montana site who said he saw guards choking Lunas when he refused to enter solitary confinement.

In a new statement on Friday, a DHS spokesperson said Lunas, who had lived in the U.S. since 1996 and had multiple criminal convictions, attempted to take his own life while detained at the detention site.

DHS said the security staff ""immediately intervened to save his life"" but that Lunas ""violently resisted"" the security staff.

""During the ensuing struggle, [Lunas] stopped breathing and lost consciousness,"" DHS said. ""Medical staff was immediately called and responded. After repeated attempts to resuscitate him, EMTs declared him deceased on the scene.""

The DHS statement did not mention the Washington Post story. The department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment regarding the report and DHS' decision to issue a new statement on Friday.

The El Paso medical examiner's office said the autopsy was pending and declined to comment further.

In the months that follow detainee deaths, ICE typically publishes detailed individual reports, with the last such report published in September 2025.

In a December letter, the American Civil Liberties Union urged ICE and the Defense Department to close Camp East Montana, citing reports and allegations around use of force and poor living conditions.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) released operational statistics today for December 2025 under President Donald Trump’s border security policies.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership and the dedication of DHS law enforcement, America’s borders are safer than any time in our nation’s history. What President Trump and our CBP agents and officers have been able to do in a single year is nothing short of extraordinary,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. “Once again, we have a record low number of encounters at the border and the 8th straight month of zero releases. Month after month, we are delivering results that were once thought impossible: the most secure border in history and unmatched enforcement successes.”

“Our agents and officers have set a new standard for border security, achieving historic results that speak for themselves,” said CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott. “The men and women of CBP are demonstrating what’s possible through unwavering commitment and effective enforcement and will continue to ensure the safety and security of our nation’s borders every single day.”

Below is a snapshot of December’s key figures. Full monthly reporting can be viewed on CBP’s Stats and Summaries webpage.

Border Enforcement at Historic Levels

CBP recorded its lowest encounter totals ever to start a fiscal year:

91,603 total encounters nationwide in October, November, December – lower than any prior fiscal year to date. This is 25% lower than the previous low of 121,469 in FY2012.

US Border Patrol recorded the lowest number of apprehensions along the southwest border ever in the first quarter of a fiscal year (21,815 in FY2026), which was 95% lower than the first quarter average under the Biden administration.

Illegal crossings in December remained historically low:

30,698 total encounters nationwide in December — 92% below the peak of the Biden administration’s 370,883, and the lowest encounters ever for a month of December.

6,478 Border Patrol apprehensions on the southwest border in December — 96% lower than the monthly average of the Biden administration, and less than what was apprehended in 4 days in December 2024.

209 USBP apprehensions per day on the southwest border in December — 96% lower than the daily average under the Biden administration, and less than the number apprehended every 1.5 hours under the Biden administration.

Zero parole releases — compared to 7,041 released by the Border Patrol under the Biden administration along the southwest border in December 2024.

It was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor.
Lunas Campos’ adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.
The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate.
Pagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban immigrant died in a Texas immigration detention facility earlier this month during an altercation with guards, and the local medical examiner has indicated that his death will likely be classified as a homicide.

The federal government has provided a differing account surrounding the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, saying the detainee was attempting suicide and staff tried to save him.

A witness told The Associated Press that Lunas Campos died after he was handcuffed, tackled by guards and placed in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. The immigrant’s family was told by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office on Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy report said the death was a homicide resulting from asphyxia from chest and neck compression, according to a recording of the call reviewed by the AP.

The death and conflicting accounts have intensified scrutiny into the conditions of immigration jails at a time when the government has been rounding up immigrants in large numbers around the country and detaining them at facilities like the one in El Paso where Lunas Campos died.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is legally required to issue public notification of detainee deaths. Last week, it said Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old father of four and registered sex offender, had died at Camp East Montana, but made no mention of him being involved in an altercation with staff immediately before his death.

In response to questions from the AP, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, on Thursday amended its account of Lunas Campos’ death, saying he tried to kill himself.

“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”

In an interview before DHS updated its account, detainee Santos Jesús Flores, 47, from El Salvador, said he witnessed the incident through the window of his cell in the special housing unit, where detainees are held in isolation for disciplinary infractions.

“He didn’t want to enter the cell where they were going to put him,” Flores told the AP on Thursday, speaking in Spanish from a phone in the facility. “The last thing he said was that he couldn’t breathe.”

Among the first sent to Camp Montana East

Camp Montana East is a sprawling tent facility hastily constructed in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base. The AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion facility, expected to become the largest detention facility in the United States, was being built and operated by a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility.

It was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor. Emails seeking comment on Thursday from Acquisition Logistics executives received no response.

Lunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.

ICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.

New York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with an individual under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry.

Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.

Lunas Campos’ adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.

“My father was not a child molester,” said Kary Lunas, 25. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”

Conflicting accounts

On the day he died, according to ICE, Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm. He was then taken to the segregation block.

“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 release. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”

Lunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.

Flores said that account omitted key details — Lunas Campos was already handcuffed when at least five guards pinned him to the floor, and at least one squeezed his arm around the detainee’s neck.

Within about five minutes, Flores said, Lunas Campos was no longer moving.

“After he stopped breathing, they removed the handcuffs,” Flores said.

Flores is not represented by a lawyer and said he has already consented to deportation to his home country. Though he acknowledged he was taking a risk by speaking to the AP, Flores said he wanted to highlight that “in this place, guards abuse people a lot.”

He said multiple detainees in the unit witnessed the altercation, and security cameras there should have captured the events. Flores also said investigators had not interviewed him.

DHS did not respond to questions about whether Lunas Campos was handcuffed when they say he attempted suicide, or exactly how he had tried to kill himself.

“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,” McLaughlin said. “This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming.”

DHS wouldn’t say whether other agencies were investigating. The El Paso medical examiner’s office confirmed Thursday that it conducted an autopsy, but declined further comment.

A final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. When such deaths are ruled accidental or something other than homicide, they are less likely to trigger criminal investigations, while civil wrongful death lawsuits become harder to prove.

The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate. An El Paso County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on whether it was involved in an investigation.

The deaths of inmates and other detainees after officers hold them face down and put pressure on their backs and necks to restrain them have been a problem in law enforcement for decades. A 2024 AP investigation documented hundreds of deaths during police encounters in which people were restrained in a prone position. Many uttered “I can’t breathe” before suffocating, according to scores of body camera and bystander videos. Authorities often attempt to shift the blame for such deaths to preexisting medical conditions or drug use.

Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who has studied prone restraint deaths, said the preliminary autopsy ruling of homicide indicates guards’ actions caused Lunas Campos’ death, but does not mean they intended to kill. He said the medical examiner’s office could come under pressure to stop short of calling it a homicide, but will probably “stick to its guns.”

“This probably passes the ‘but for’ test. ‘But for’ the actions of the officers, he would not have died. For us, that’s generally a homicide,” he said.

‘I just want justice, and his body here’

Jeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, said the day after he died the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened.

Pagan-Lopez, who lives in Rochester, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office eventually called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results. He also told her the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated, she said.

Pagan-Lopez declined and is now seeking help from family and friends to raise the money needed to ship his body home and pay for a funeral.

After failing to get details about the circumstances surrounding his death from ICE, Pagan-Lopez said she got a call from a detainee at Camp Montana East who then put her in touch with Flores, who first told her about the altercation with guards.

Since then, she said she has repeatedly called ICE, but is no longer getting a response. Pagan-Lopez, who is a U.S. citizen, said she also twice called the FBI, where an agent took her information and then hung up.

Pagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago. She described him as an attentive father who, until his detention, had worked in a minimum-wage job at a furniture store, the only employment she said he could find due to his criminal record.

She said that in the family’s last phone call the week after Christmas, Lunas Campos talked to his kids about his expected deportation back to Cuba. He said he wanted them to visit the island, so that he could stay in their lives.

“He wasn’t a bad guy,” Pagan-Lopez said. “I just want justice, and his body here. That’s all I want.”

On Wednesday, Heber Sanchez Domínguez, a 34-year-old Mexican citizen, died while in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody at the Robert A. Deyton Detention Center in Clayton County, south of Atlanta, DHS said in a statement Friday. The cause of death is currently under investigation.

Sanchaz was in ICE custody for six days and was awaiting a hearing when he was discovered ""hanging by the neck and unresponsive in his sleeping quarters"" at about 2:05 a.m. local time, DHS said. Medical staff immediately attempted lifesaving measures and then transported him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead about one hour later.

ICE said it first encountered Sanchez on Jan. 7 after he was arrested for driving without a license, DHS said. Two days later, on Jan. 9, ICE filed a notice requiring Sanchez to appear before an immigration judge.

DHS said Sanchez entered the U.S. illegally on Dec. 22, 2023, at or near Nogales, Arizona. Border Patrol agents arrested him that same day and issued him a notice to appear. He was later released without bond.

After his Jan. 7 arrest, ICE transferred Sanchez to the Robert A. Deyton Detention Center as he awaited removal proceedings. Medical staff conducted an intake evaluation and reported no signs of distress at the time.

On Thursday, Mexico's consulate in Atlanta said it was ""closely monitoring"" the death of a Mexican citizen Wednesday at the Robert A. Deyton Detention Facility and was maintaining ""permanent communication"" with the ICE field office in Atlanta.

Mexican officials requested ""that the circumstances of the incident be clarified,"" the consulate said, adding that it was ""collaborating on the necessary procedures to ensure that the investigation is conducted promptly and transparently.""

The consulate said it planned to return the remains to Mexico as soon as possible.

ICE has been at the forefront of President Trump's mass deportation campaign.

About 73,000 people facing deportation were being held by ICE as of Thursday, according to internal DHS data obtained by CBS News. This marks the first time in the deportation agency's 23-year history that the number of ICE detainees has surpassed the 70,000 mark.

As outrage grows in response to the ICE crackdown in Minnesota, a Massachusetts state representative released a video this week echoing some of the expletive-laden rhetoric used by leaders there.

State Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven, a Democrat from Somerville, delivered a forceful renunciation of ICE in a video she posted to social media Wednesday.

“We need to get ICE the f— out of Massachusetts,” she said in the video.

Uyterhoeven’s language is reminiscent of how Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to “get the f— out of” his city in the immediate aftermath of the killing of Renee Good.

Federal officers have surged into Minneapolis this month in an operation purportedly targeted at immigration enforcement and fraud. But reports of abuse and other unlawful actions are rampant, with residents regularly documenting alleged instances of racial profiling and unnecessary force on unarmed protesters and other citizens.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration maintains that Good was a “domestic terrorist,” and that the actions of the ICE agent who shot her were justified. Videos from the shooting directly contradict the administration’s claims.

In Massachusetts, reports circulated this week of a large shipment of vehicles being delivered to an ICE facility in Burlington, raising fears about a possible escalation in and around Boston.

It is in this context that Uyterhoeven called on state leaders to take new actions that would reign in ICE.

“The Massachusetts State House needs to be doing everything it can to stop ICE from killing, abducting, detaining, and deporting our neighbors,” she said.

Speaking as protests were ongoing in Boston Common, Uyterhoeven advocated for the passage of legislation that would prevent ICE from being able to deputize local law enforcement officers to act as federal immigration agents.

Immigrant advocates have been pushing for lawmakers to pass the Safe Communities Act since 2017. The bill would limit how officials can question people about their immigration status, require that authorities require consent before a person in custody is questioned by ICE, bar officials from contacting ICE about a person’s impending release from custody, and prohibit the agreements that allow for the deputization of local officers.

Uyterhoeven went on to criticize the “surveillance state” that allows federal authorities to get personal information from residents.

“Right now, anyone can buy your geolocation data, and ICE has been doing just that,” she said.

Finally, Uyterhoeven said that Massachusetts lawmakers need to be unafraid of holding ICE agents accountable if they break the law.

“Federal agents do not have absolute immunity from state prosecution. ICE has not been held accountable, and we need to strengthen our Massachusetts state laws now,” she said.",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_turner030822METROumass248-696a80f827eb6-768x432.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 21:57:56.904282

The announcement came as part of a list of orders released from the justices’ private conference earlier in the day.

Just two days after the court issued its decision in one Fourth Amendment case, Case v. Montana, the justices agreed to take up Chatrie v. United States, another case involving the Fourth Amendment. Chatrie is a challenge to the constitutionality of “geofence warrants” – a warrant that allows law enforcement officials to obtain the identities of cell phone users who were in a particular area at a specific time.

The defendant in the case is Okello Chatrie, who was convicted of robbing a credit union outside Richmond, Virginia, at gunpoint in 2019, stealing $195,000. He was arrested as a result of information obtained from Google using a geofence warrant. When Chatrie challenged the constitutionality of the geofence warrant, a federal district judge agreed with him that the use of the warrant likely violated the Fourth Amendment. But the judge nonetheless allowed prosecutors to use the evidence that they had gathered as a result of the warrant on the ground that detectives had acted in good faith. Chatrie pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld Chatrie’s conviction. By a vote of 2-1, the majority concluded that there had not been a “search” that would trigger the Fourth Amendment because Chatrie had voluntarily provided his information to Google. The full 4th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and, in a one-sentence unsigned opinion, affirmed the three-judge panel’s ruling. Chatrie then came to the Supreme Court, which agreed on Friday to weigh in on the constitutionality of the execution of the geofence warrant.

The justices also agreed to tackle a dispute arising from one of the thousands of lawsuits filed against Monsanto over its Roundup weedkiller. The plaintiff in the case, John Durnell, contends (among other things) that Monsanto failed to warn him that Roundup causes non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A jury awarded him $1.25 million in damages.

Monsanto argues that federal law trumps Durnell’s failure-to-warn claim brought under state law, and on Friday the justices agreed to decide whether that is true for failure-to-warn claims based on labels when the Environmental Protection Agency has not required the warning.

The court also granted two other cases:

Hikma Pharmaceuticals v. Amarin Pharma, involving a lawsuit against a generic drugmaker for encouraging patent infringement.

Anderson v. Intel Corporation Investment Policy Committee, involving the standards for pleading a claim, based on the underperformance of a fund, that a fiduciary has violated the duty of prudence required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

The justices will release more orders from Friday’s conference on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. EST.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2176485427.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 22:59:53.361150

We’re representing 12 members of Congress in their lawsuit against the Trump administration for obstructing their access to immigration detention centers. Last month, a federal court ruled that the administration cannot block members’ unannounced access to ICE facilities to conduct oversight.

But over the weekend, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem quietly reinstated restrictions on congressional visits to ICE facilities. On Monday, the 12 Congressional members filed a motion asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain how this new policy is not a violation of federal law.

The Trump administration has “made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” our Executive Director Chioma Chukwu said.

We previously filed FOIA requests about troubling themes in ICE recruitment campaigns. Both DHS and ICE have been posting stylized arrest videos and recruitment ads that invoke white nationalist themes. We have also sent FOIA requests for social media strategy documents that could show who the agencies’ target audiences are and why they are using this imagery. We’ve asked for communications, budgets, and strategy documents regarding recruitment tactics.

Trump’s first-term records become FOIA eligible next week

Records from the first Trump administration will become eligible for public access on Jan. 20, five years after the end of Trump’s first term. It’s a huge opportunity to learn more about how Trump operates — but his former defense attorney is overseeing the process.

On Friday, we sent a letter calling on Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to remove himself from any role overseeing access to those records. We also filed FOIA requests on Thursday to determine how the administration plans to comply with transparency laws like the Presidential Records Act, which was enacted in the wake of the Watergate scandal to make sure no single officeholder is the owner of Presidential records.

We raised serious concerns about Blanche’s suitability as President Trump’s designated representative regarding presidential records from his first administration. Trump selected Blanche for that role in 2023, while Blanche was representing Trump in his criminal cases. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Blanche affirmed he has a “continuing duty” to Trump in terms of confidentiality and loyalty.

“Presidential records belong to the American people, period,” Chukwu said. “As records from Trump’s first administration come due, the public is entitled to know what actually happened, who designed the policies that devastated communities across the country, and how those same actors may be shaping the administration today.”

Trump’s “Chief Enforcer” allegedly using personal devices, auto-delete for official business

Ed Martin, the “chief enforcer” of Trump’s political agenda within the Justice Department, has played a key role in the Trump administration’s attacks on the president’s perceived political enemies. Martin is reportedly covering his tracks by conducting official business on personal devices and autodeleting messaging apps.

We expanded our lawsuit for records related to Martin this week. Our amended complaint details DOJ’s ongoing failure to respond to our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests seeking records involving Martin, despite credible allegations that he has been trying to hide records of his activities.

We are asking that Martin’s communications be preserved and made public so that he can be held accountable.

“The public has a right to know how Ed Martin is wielding power at the DOJ to advance Trump’s political retribution campaign,” said Chukwu.

“There used to be a general understanding of, OK, ICE agents, when they go out, they're going to have a specific person that they're looking for.","Tensions in U.S. cities, including in metro Denver, are steadily rising as President Donald Trump boosts immigration enforcement, sending agents across the country into neighborhoods and homes.

The strain has erupted in violence.

Last week, Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, was killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot into her vehicle during an encounter in Minneapolis. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent was defending himself and other officers, while leaders in the city and the state disagreed.

Immigrant rights advocates in Colorado say ICE’s excessive force is documented locally.

“Just in Colorado, we've seen ICE agents pepper-spray protestors in the face. We've seen ICE drag elderly women on the ground,” said Judith Marquez, a volunteer for the Colorado Rapid Response Network and a campaign manager for the Colorado Immigrants Rights Coalition. “We don't want to wait for another Renee Nicole Good to be murdered.”

ICE arrests have more than quadrupled since Trump took office, while average daily detention has doubled, according to the Migration Policy Institute. In Colorado, arrest rates quadrupled compared with the same period last year.

Regardless of immigration status, people in the U.S. have rights. So what do you do if you encounter an ICE agent in a tense situation?

ICE did not respond to our request for comment at the time of publication, but here’s what immigrant rights activists say.

Know your rights

The coalition encourages people to familiarize themselves with their legal rights during encounters with ICE. Things like seeing a warrant, and invoking your right to a lawyer, as well as the right to remain silent and the right to record interactions — despite what agents might say — are all emphasized during the group’s “Know Your Rights” trainings.

“Magic words to remember, like, ‘I do not consent to a search. I'm going to remain silent. I want to speak to a lawyer. Am I free to leave? Have I done something wrong?’” said Nayda Benitez, the director of organizing for the Colorado Immigrants Rights Coalition.

Protesting from observers during these encounters is well within people’s rights, said Tim Macdonald, the legal director for the ACLU of Colorado.

“People are a hundred percent within their rights to express their views peacefully without obstructing law enforcement. That is a right guaranteed by the First Amendment to our Constitution,” he said. “That includes filming officers and speaking to them and sharing their speech, letting the officers know what they think of what the officers are doing.”

He said observers and protesters need to be cautious about what could be construed as obstructing. He also advised against being in that close of proximity for safety reasons.

“What we've seen, however, is more often than not, people are not doing anything that could remotely be called obstruction. And yet agents may claim they're engaging in obstruction,” he said.

Record at a safe distance

The Colorado Immigrants Rights Coalition advises people to record interactions at a safe distance and to pull out their phones before the encounter so it’s not mistaken for a weapon.

Macdonald with the ACLU said those videos keep the record straight.

“Filming law enforcement … is so important because that documents what actually happened,” Macdonald said. “We saw that in spades with the murder of Renee Good in Minnesota.”

He also added that it may be safer for observers to exit their cars so they can’t be accused of presenting a danger to ICE.

De-escalate

In addition to a hotline for reporting ICE presence, the coalition documents stories of people who’ve been detained. Both Benitez and Marquez said many protesters and detainees have been met with violence.

“All we can do is be calm and de-escalate, but I think that what we already know is that law enforcement, including ICE, can still harm us and use lethal force,” Marquez said. “This should not, and it will not, stop us from exerting our right to peacefully protest and our right to stand up and protect our neighbors.”

If an officer is issuing an order, Macdonald said the ACLU of Colorado recommends people comply for their personal safety. If there are conflicting orders from officers, he said, people should verbally seek clarification on which orders to follow.

Understand the risk

Despite all these precautionary measures, there’s still risk involved, said Whitney Leeds, a former criminal defense attorney who practiced in Colorado and gave guidance to people interacting with ICE during Trump’s first administration.

“There's no advice that anybody could give that's going to be like, ‘Yep, just do this, and you're going to be safe.’ The safest that we can be in light of that is knowing what our rights are, calmly asserting those rights, not giving an inch,” Leeds said.

Leeds said this time around, the administration is targeting people of color more. The ACLU in Minnesota has filed a lawsuit against the federal government for racially profiling Minnesotans.

“There used to be a general understanding of, OK, ICE agents, when they go out, they're going to have a specific person that they're looking for. They might have a mugshot of that person. If they had ever had any interaction with authorities previously, they'll have their name, they might have their date of birth,” Leeds said. “At this point, this strategy is less tied to specific persons of interest and is much more tied to ‘Well, just go and find somebody.’”

Those people, and observers attempting to occupy agents’ time, are facing risks unlike those she’s seen before.

“I think the questions around the use of force that we're seeing with the recent shootings of community members by ICE agents and this overuse and abuse of force, those are, I think, pretty candidly illegal and no amount of knowing your rights is necessarily going to be able to address that larger challenge.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2026/01/ICE-IMMIGRATION-DETAINMENT-MINNESOTA-FILE-AP-202601.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 22:59:22.294101

BOSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) – The top U.S. immigration judge has told her colleagues that they are not bound by a federal court ruling that declared the Trump administration cannot place thousands of people in mandatory detention without an opportunity to ‍be released on bond.

That directive came in an email Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley sent her colleagues on Tuesday that the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts attached to a filing on Friday in Boston federal court in a lawsuit challenging the administration’s policy of denying bond hearings.

The ACLU said the email was evidence that “the government has deliberately and systematically instructed every Immigration Judge in the country not to comply ‌with final declaratory judgments.”

The civil rights group said the statement directs judges ‌to disregard court rulings by U.S. District Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, and U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston in separate class action lawsuits brought on behalf of people who were already living in the United States when they were detained. Both judges held that denying people bond hearings ​was unlawful.

“We have asked for a status conference to update the court on this troubling development — which significantly impacts the rights of our class members — and anticipate seeking additional relief to ‍protect the class,” Dan McFadden, managing attorney at the ​ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement.

At the ACLU’s request, Saris scheduled ​a Tuesday hearing.

The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, did not respond to a request for ‍comment.

Immigration judges are not part of the federal judiciary but are instead employees of the Justice Department, which is part of the Trump administration.

Under federal immigration law, “applicants for admission” to the United States are subject to mandatory detention while their cases proceed in immigration courts.

Bucking a longstanding interpretation of the law, the Trump administration in July said non-citizens already residing in the United ‍States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.

The Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a ‍decision in September that adopted the ‍administration’s interpretation.

But Sykes, whose case is a nationwide class action, in ​a ruling in December said that the administration’s interpretation was contrary to law ​and that, ⁠as a result, the board’s ruling was “no longer controlling.”

Yet Riley in ‌Tuesday’s email told her colleagues that because Sykes did not issue an injunction, the board’s decision “remains binding precedent on agency adjudicators.”

Lawyers with the ACLU said that prior to that email, the immigration court in Massachusetts had begun holding bond hearings again, consistent with Saris’ decision.

Yet the lawyers said they received multiple reports on Thursday that an immigration judge was denying detainee requests for bond hearings.

State of play: Sheahan is running in Ohio's 9th congressional district, held by Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio).

She served for just over a year as Louisiana's secretary of wildlife and fisheries before rejoining Noem as the deputy director of ICE.
Some Ohio Republicans had hoped to recruit state Senate President Rob McColley, but gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy instead tapped him as his running mate.","ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan resigned Thursday and launched a House bid for an Ohio district that is a top pickup target for Republicans.

Why it matters: The 2026 midterms could hinge on races like Ohio's 9th, and Sheahan enters a crowded Republican primary as ICE battles blowback over the shooting of Renee Good.

""President Trump deserves a Congress that stands firmly behind his agenda,"" Sheahan wrote in a resignation letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, a copy of which was obtained by Axios.

""For that reason, effective immediately, I respectfully submit this letter of resignation so that I may continue serving my country in a different capacity.""

State of play: Sheahan is running in Ohio's 9th congressional district, held by Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio).

President Trump won Kaptur's current district in the 2024 election, and mid-decade redistricting in Ohio will make it even more favorable to Republicans.

But Kaptur, 79, has proven difficult for Republicans to dislodge, having defeated GOP challengers in 2022 and 2024 despite being seen as highly vulnerable.

Driving the news: Sheahan launched a campaign website with a video touting her ICE tenure and branding herself a ""Trump conservative.""

""In less than one year at ICE, I've stopped more illegal immigration than Marcy Kaptur has in her 43 years in Washington,"" Sheahan says in the video.

The 28-year-old is a district native who attended Ohio State University and worked for the Ohio Republican Party before working as political director in Noem's South Dakota gubernatorial office.

She served for just over a year as Louisiana's secretary of wildlife and fisheries before rejoining Noem as the deputy director of ICE.

The other side: ""While Republicans from near and far will fight through a messy primary in this district they gerrymandered again just this fall, Congresswoman Kaptur is focused on delivering real results for her constituents,"" Kaptur's campaign said in a statement.

""Voters are tired of the self-dealing corruption and culture of lawlessness they've seen over the last year. They want a leader focused on affordability and real results, and Marcy Kaptur consistently works across the aisle to deliver both.""

Zoom in: Sheahan joins a primary field that includes state Rep. Josh Williams and former state Rep. Derek Merrin, who lost to Kaptur in 2024.

Some Ohio Republicans had hoped to recruit state Senate President Rob McColley, but gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy instead tapped him as his running mate.

ST. PAUL, MN — U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Integrity, Security, and Enforcement, and Ilhan Omar (MN-05) today hosted a shadow hearing titled Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s Deadly Assault on Minnesota. Twenty-seven Members of Congress attended from across the country to conduct oversight.

“Today, I hosted the the sixth hearing in my series Kidnapped and Disappeared, to continue my congressional fact-finding duties at a time of intense trauma and terror for Minnesotans who are being subjected to the lawlessness and violence of ICE and Border Patrol agents,” said Jayapal. “We heard from incredibly powerful witnesses — members of the community who are standing up for their neighbors, and even who have been detained and had their rights violated for no reason. Instead of making us safer, Trump is deliberately escalating tensions in a city where crime rates have been declining. And the tactics are only accelerating. Let me be clear: this pattern of reckless, even lethal, use of force cannot continue, and we will do everything in our power to hold this Administration accountable and stop this lawlessness.”

“I was honored to host this crucial hearing with Rep. Jayapal,” said Omar. “The Twin Cities is under attack from the Trump administration. There is no modern precedent for this level of federal overreach, violence, and lawlessness carried out in the name of immigration enforcement. I’m grateful to my congressional colleagues from all across the country who joined us to raise the alarm and learn what has been happening on the ground.”

“Every Minnesotan has the right to feel safe and welcome. The actions of the Trump administration and Kristi Noem’s DHS are an attack on our state that is making our community more dangerous. ICE and DHS agents have threatened and assaulted workers in their workplaces, families on the way to day care, and students outside their schools. These actions must end,” said Representative Betty McCollum (MN-04). “At our hearing today, we heard from Minnesotans whose lives have been impacted by the Trump administration’s actions. I thank every one of our witnesses for sharing their testimony. I also want to thank my House Democratic colleagues for traveling to Minnesota’s Fourth Congressional District to stand in solidarity against Trump and Kristi Noem’s assault on our state. The appalling conduct at ICE and DHS starts with its leadership. Kristi Noem needs to go, and ICE must cease operations in Minnesota.”

This hearing featured testimony from a slate of local elected leaders, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and Saint Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, followed by a panel of witnesses including Executive Director of the ACLU of Minnesota Deepinder Mayell, Executive Director of Unidos MN Emilia González Avalos, Executive Director of Minnesota Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MN) Jaylani Hussein, Chief of Police of Mendota Heights Police Department Kelly McCarthy, and community members Patty and Mubashir.

“Our work aims to vindicate the rights of Minnesotans who have been victimized by their own government simply for exercising their First Amendment rights, to end the false sense of impunity that fuels the worst of federal agents’ misconduct, and to ensure that Minnesotans can assemble, observe, document and criticize – without fear of retaliation,” said Deepinder Mayell, Executive Director of the ACLU of Minnesota.

“I was made to feel scared and humiliated throughout the arrest process, and at the detention center, I was made to feel intimidated and as though my constitutional rights and biological needs didn’t matter,” said Patty, a community member. “After all that, I was released without charges, which makes it clear to me that this is more of a campaign to spread fear and terror than it is to enforce the law. My neighbors and I are collateral damage to the Trump administration’s political theater — a campaign to paint Black and brown people, and ‘liberals,’ as villains to distract from an unprecedented reign of corruption and criminality at the federal level, while at the same time making it clear to all of us — even U.S. citizens — that this administration does not and will not honor the basic constitutional rights to which we are all entitled.”

“At no time did any officer ask me whether I was a citizen or if I had any immigration status,” said Mubashir, a community member. “They did not ask for any identifying information, nor did they ask about my ties to the community, how long I had lived in the Twin Cities, my family in Minnesota, or anything else about my circumstances.”

“We have to acknowledge that the tactics being used by some ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge are reducing the public’s trust in local police, making the jobs of our cops harder, and making us all less safe,” said Chief of Police of Mendota Heights Police Department Kelly McCarthy.

This was the sixth shadow hearing in this series, each of which has focused on a different aspect of immigration oversight. The others have focused on detention abuses, Trump’s assault on Chicago, families that have been torn apart, unlawful third-country deportations, and efforts to undermine due process.

The consequence of law enforcement should not be chaos and violence, which only results in making Portland less safe.” Gov.","Cumberland County District Attorney Jacqueline Sartoris canceled a news conference scheduled for Friday morning in Portland after she said the state’s court administrator cautioned against it.

Sartoris and Portland Mayor Mark Dion had scheduled a joint news conference at the Cumberland County Courthouse for 10 a.m., as city officials attempt to prepare for an expected U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation.

Several city councilors were also planning to attend, according to city officials.

Sartoris said the state court administrator’s office in Maine’s Judicial Branch “expressed concern” about providing security for both a press conference and regular court business.

“I think there is also, understandably, genuine concern about holding a fairly public conversation proximate to the Courts about this issue at this time,” Sartoris said.

Barbara Cardone, a spokesperson for the Maine Judicial Branch, said in an email Friday morning that the court administrator did not ask Sartoris to cancel the press conference, but rather asked her not to hold it in the courthouse.

“The actions of ICE can be seen as divisive and political,” Cardone said in the statement. “It is critical that the courts remain neutral on these issues. The State Court Administrator and the Chief Justice did not want anyone to mistake the District Attorney as speaking in a courthouse for the Judicial Branch.”

Cardone added that the state’s court system will “do nothing to assist or to deter ICE investigations, except that we will not allow ICE to disrupt court activities.”

Sartoris said Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce was also scheduled to join the event, which was “intended simply to be a clear statement of the need for everyone — residents and visitors alike — to follow the rule of law and Maine’s laws in the days ahead.”

Dion and other state and local leaders issued statements Wednesday about ICE operations potentially targeting Portland or Lewiston as early as next week, responding to rumors about increased enforcement that have been swirling for days. Dion said the Portland community “rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods.”

“There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents,” he said. “While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. The consequence of law enforcement should not be chaos and violence, which only results in making Portland less safe.”

Gov. Janet Mills also issued a video statement later Wednesday and said her office had not yet confirmed with federal officials whether any immigration enforcement operations are planned for Maine.

“To the federal government, I say this,” Mills said. “If your plan is to come here, to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused: Those tactics are not welcome here.”

Orange County Commissioner Nicole Wilson, who represents District 1, drove by the site Friday.","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. — Federal immigration officials are considering Orange County as the site of a new detention facility for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

ICE Senior Advisor David Venturella confirmed this with Channel 9 Investigative Reporter Ashlyn Webb after more than 30 people, including ICE officials and federal contractors, were seen leaving a site visit at a vacant warehouse off Transport Drive Friday.

Venturella says it’s “exploratory,” and ICE is in very early talks.

Several sources told 9 Investigates ahead of the site tour that ICE may be looking at this specific property.

The warehouse is located at 8660 Transport Drive in the back of an industrial park in Sunbridge and is surrounded by woods.

We found the property’s lease listing online, showing the inside of the more than 400,000 square foot warehouse. It’s marketed as a “state-of-the-art facility” with a prime location within minutes of Orlando’s major highways, right off of State Road 528, and within a 30-minute drive from Orlando International Airport.

It has 98 exterior dock doors and four drive-in bays.

The listing says “the facility’s advanced cross-dock configuration enables efficient unloading and loading of goods from inbound to outbound transportation.”

Records show the property is currently owned by Beachline Logistics Center LLC tied to Atlanta-based developers, TPA Group. We have not heard back from the developers.

“Has the contract been signed yet?,” 9 Investigates asked.

“Oh no,” Venturella replied.

“You guys are just in talks,” 9 Investigates replied.

“We’re not even close,” Venturella replied.

Venturella didn’t say how many detainees this facility could potentially hold or how soon a facility could open.

Orange County Commissioner Nicole Wilson, who represents District 1, drove by the site Friday. She says local leaders against this proposed facility may have their hands tied, but she has questions on the zoning.

“Typically, when things are zoned for this type of use, warehouse type use or loading docks and that type of activity, you’re not thinking about where the water goes, where water comes in, and what we do with the human waste,” Wilson said.

Venturella wouldn’t say whether this site would need to be rezoned or if it needed to get any conditional use permit if used as a detention facility

“Don’t know what those requirements are. But obviously, we have to factor all that in,” Venturella told 9 Investigates.

The property falls within Orlando City’s zoning. When asked about this, the city said in a statement, “The city has not received any information or rezoning requests for the specified address nor any further information.”

It’s a pattern of vehicles being used as weapons by violent agitators to attack our law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
He then drove the van directly at ICE officers, DHS officials said.
Who fired shots: Unnamed federal law enforcement officer Description: According to DHS, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” on Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022.
An officer chased him on foot and tried to arrest him, and Sosa-Celis “began to resist and violently assault” the officer, DHS said.","Federal immigration officers have shot 11 people since September as the Department of Homeland Security has ramped up deportation operations around the country. In the majority of the shootings, officers have fired into cars — a tactic that law enforcement authorities and policing experts have been trying for decades to curtail.

The vehicle shootings raise serious concerns among policing experts about the rapidly expanding deployment of DHS personnel into American communities, where officers are regularly captured on video clashing with immigrants who are in the country illegally as well as citizens who protest the arrests.

The shootings “are not one-offs,” said Jim Bueermann, the former police chief in Redlands, California, who now runs the Future Policing Institute, a research group. “This is clearly developing into a pattern and practice of how they deal with people in the enforcement of immigration laws, and to me that’s the most alarming thing we’re seeing.”

DHS says that in each case, the officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection believed their lives were in danger and that in several of the incidents, officers were injured.

“The pattern is NOT of law enforcement using deadly force. It’s a pattern of vehicles being used as weapons by violent agitators to attack our law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Dangerous criminals — whether they be illegal aliens or U.S. citizens — are assaulting law enforcement and turning their vehicles into weapons to attack law enforcement.”

The 10 shootings, detailed below, show the varied circumstances and places where ICE and CBP officers have opened fire on people while they were conducting President Donald Trump’s campaign to crack down on immigrants in the U.S. The effort has unleashed thousands of officers across the country, raiding homes and workplaces, approaching people in courthouses, immigration offices and stores, and stopping people on the street. A protest movement has grown to resist the operations, leading to confrontations.

The people who were shot include suspected criminals, immigrants who lack permanent legal status and U.S. citizens. Three died. It is not clear how many of the shootings federal authorities have fully investigated; there have been no public reports of any findings, including whether the gunfire was deemed justified or whether officers have been disciplined. In at least four cases, people shot by agents have been charged with crimes; in two of those cases, the charges were later dismissed.

Firing on cars is one common thread. In seven cases, officers said they shot because a car was moving and they believed it posed a threat.

Chris Burbank, a former police chief in Salt Lake City who has helped the Justice Department investigate agencies suspected of civil rights abuses, said it was unsettling to see repeated cases of federal immigration officers’ firing on drivers. Since at least the 1990s, he said, police departments have tried to curb such shootings by adopting new standards guiding how officers deal with motorists. The movement, he said, was largely driven by cases in which people were needlessly injured or killed because officers said they were afraid they were going to get run over.

The new guidelines have been published by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit organization that studies policing nationwide, and adopted by many police departments. They aimed to prevent officers from positioning themselves in front of or behind vehicles and sought to limit when an officer was allowed to open fire, Burbank said.

DHS has been a focus of that effort. In 2013, the Police Executive Research Forum released a report that indicated CBP officers were deliberately putting themselves in the paths of cars, “exposing themselves to additional risk and creating justification for the use of deadly force.” The group recommended teaching officers that shooting at a car is dangerous and should be avoided and to adopt policies restricting it. DHS’ current policy prohibits officers from firing at moving vehicles, unless they have “reasonable belief” that the drivers pose imminent threats of death or serious injury. Officers should consider the hazards of out-of-control cars, the policy says.

Burbank said he wondered whether officers were being trained on that policy.

Based on his experience and observations of ICE conduct in recent months, including several of the shootings, Burbank said he felt that “there is not a lot of training, not a lot of accountability going on, and you have the feeling of ‘do your jobs at all costs.’” He added, “That’s a really difficult situation to put any law enforcement in, because it takes away your ability to de-escalate.”

Homeland Security officials have forcefully defended their officers, saying they are increasingly in danger, facing a steep uptick in attacks and violent protesters. “Officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said. She said officers are also trained to use “the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations and to prioritize the safety of the public and our officers.”

DHS requires every use of force incident and any discharge of an ICE firearm to be reported and reviewed, and all shootings are examined by “an appropriate law enforcement agency,” McLaughlin said. Those investigations are then followed by an internal ICE review.

DHS has not provided updates on any internal investigations into the shootings. The FBI, which is reviewing at least some of the encounters, said it does not talk about its investigations.

DHS shootings since September 2025

Place: Franklin Park, Illinois

Date: Sept. 12, 2025

Who was shot: Silverio Villegas González was killed.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Villegas González, 38, an immigrant from Mexico living in the U.S. illegally, was pulled over by ICE officers during a vehicle stop. The officers parked their Jeep in front of Villegas González’s car, with one officer approaching the vehicle from the driver’s side and the other from the passenger’s side. Neither was wearing body cameras, but some of the initial interaction was caught on business security video: An officer appeared to reach inside the car, just as Villegas González backed up and then pulled forward. DHS said Villegas González hit and dragged one of the officers, who opened fire on the vehicle. Villegas González crashed into a nearby truck; he was taken to the hospital, where he later died. His autopsy indicated he was shot in the neck. ICE said he had a history of reckless driving.

Latest: The status of the federal investigation into the shooting is unclear.

Place: Chicago

Date: Oct. 4, 2025

Who was shot: Marimar Martinez was injured.

Who fired shots: CBP agent Charles Exum

Description: Martinez, 30, a U.S. citizen, was driving in the city’s Southwest Side when, federal officials said, she intentionally struck a vehicle belonging to three Border Patrol agents and worked with another driver to box in the agents’ car. Exum was unable to move or get out of the vehicle and fired about five shots at Martinez, federal officials said. Martinez then drove off, but paramedics found her at a nearby repair shop; she was taken to the hospital, where she was treated for gunshot wounds. She was arrested on charges of impeding law enforcement, but her lawyers said it was the federal agents who rammed her car with their vehicle. Exum bragged about the shooting in text messages to other agents, according to records presented in court. During a hearing in the case, Exum testified that “I did what I had to do to save my life.” Almost two months after the shooting, a judge dismissed the charges against Martinez after federal prosecutors agreed to drop the case. The judge also denied a request to release body camera video.

Latest: Martinez intends to file a lawsuit, according to her attorney, Christopher Parente.

Place: Los Angeles

Date: Oct. 21, 2025

Who was shot: Carlitos Ricardo Parias was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Parias, 44, a Mexican national who is known on TikTok as “Richard LA,” and who federal authorities said was living illegally in the U.S., left his southern Los Angeles home at 8:45 a.m. and was followed by federal officers executing an arrest warrant for him related to a federal immigration proceeding, federal officials said. Parias’ Toyota Camry was boxed in by three government vehicles. Federal officials said that Parias failed to comply with commands to get out of his car and submit to an arrest and that he tried to dislodge his vehicle by driving it back and forth, putting the officers in danger. Body camera video from an ICE officer showed the officer boxing in Parias’ car, then getting out and breaking open the passenger-side window. Holding a gun, the officer shouted commands for Parias to turn off the car. Amid the chaos, the officer opened fire, striking Parias in the arm. One bullet ricocheted and hit a U.S. marshal in the hand, federal officials said. Parias was charged with assault on a federal officer. Two months later, a federal judge dismissed the charge, citing constitutional violations by the government for depriving Parias of access to counsel while he was being detained and failing to meet deadlines.

Latest: Parias remains at a detention center in Adelanto, California. Federal prosecutors filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal of his criminal charge.

Place: Phoenix

Date: Oct. 29, 2025

Who was shot: Jose Garcia-Sorto was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Garcia-Sorto, whom DHS described as a Honduran in the U.S. illegally, was stopped by ICE officers around 4 a.m. along Interstate 17. DHS officials said Garcia-Sorto began to pull away when officers approached his car. An officer who was in the path of the vehicle “defensively discharged his service weapon” twice, officials added. The officer was taken to the hospital for evaluation; the extent of any injuries was unclear. DHS said that Garcia-Sorto was also treated at the hospital for a wound and was stable and that he was later released. It is unknown whether the interaction was captured on video.

Latest: Garcia-Sorto is being held at a detention center in Florence, Arizona. No criminal charges have been announced against him in the shooting.

Place: Ontario, California

Date: Oct. 30, 2025

Who was shot: Carlos Jimenez was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Jimenez, 25, a U.S. citizen, was driving a Lexus SUV near his home in Ontario when, federal officials said, he pulled up to immigration enforcement officers who were stopping another vehicle. Federal officials said that Jimenez did not initially comply with commands to leave the scene and that after he pulled forward, he backed up and accelerated toward the officers and the other vehicle. That’s when one of the officers fired their weapon, striking Jimenez in the shoulder, federal officials said. Jimenez drove from the scene and checked himself into a hospital. He was later taken into custody. It is unclear whether there is video from the incident. Federal prosecutors charged Jimenez with assault of a federal officer and said in a complaint that the officer “feared” he was going to hit them, although it did not specify whether any officers were injured. His lawyers said that he wanted to warn the officers that they were blocking a school bus stop where children would be arriving and that he did try to leave the scene. Jimenez pleaded not guilty and was released on a $10,000 bond.

Latest: A trial is scheduled for April 13.

Place: Starr County, Texas

Date: Dec. 11, 2025

Who was shot: Isaias Sanchez Barboza was killed.

Who fired shots: Unnamed CBP agent

Description: A 31-year-old Mexican national was one of several people wearing camouflage clothing spotted by Border Patrol agents on the riverbank along the U.S.-Mexico border, west of the Rio Grande City Port of Entry, CBP officials said. As the agents approached just after 4 p.m., the group scattered, with some running back toward Mexico. Agents tried to apprehend one of the men, later identified by Texas officials as Barboza, according to DHS. An agent reported he was engaged in an “active struggle” for about two minutes, and ultimately the agent opened fire at least three times. Other Border Patrol agents arrived at the scene, requested emergency medical help and performed CPR, the DHS said. Barboza was pronounced dead at a hospital, CBP officials said. It is unclear whether there is video of the encounter.

Latest: Barboza’s body was returned to Mexico, according to the Texas Rangers, which said their investigation continues.

Place: Glen Burnie, Maryland

Date: Dec. 24, 2025

Who was shot: Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Sousa-Martins, a Portuguese national who DHS said overstayed a visa that expired in 2009, was in his van when ICE officers approached him in a Baltimore suburb where they were conducting an operation. DHS officials said Sousa-Martins did not comply with their request to turn off the engine and instead rammed the van into several ICE vehicles as he tried to flee. He then drove the van directly at ICE officers, DHS officials said. The officers opened fire, striking Sousa-Martins, who was hospitalized. It is unclear whether there is video from the incident.

Latest: No criminal charges were announced against Sousa-Martins, who remains in ICE custody. The shooting is under investigation by the Anne Arundel County Police Department. Three weeks after the shooting, police contradicted DHS’ initial narrative that Sousa-Martins had a passenger in the van who was injured when the van crashed; they said the other man was already in custody in an ICE vehicle at the time. In a subsequent statement to NBC News, DHS corroborated that detail.

Place: Minneapolis

Date: Jan. 7, 2026

Who was shot: Renee Good was killed.

Who fired shots: ICE officer Jonathan Ross

Description: Good, 37, a Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen, was behind the wheel of a Honda Pilot SUV on Portland Avenue, parked perpendicular to one-way traffic as federal law enforcement vehicles were trying to get through. Ross got out of his vehicle and circled the SUV while he was recording with his cellphone. Two other officers approached Good from the driver’s side, ordering her to get out of the car, according to video from bystanders, as well as Ross’ cellphone. One officer pulled on the driver’s door handle. Good briefly reversed, then moved forward, turning the SUV’s wheels to the right, away from the officers and in the direction of traffic. At that moment, Ross, who was by then at the driver’s-side corner of the hood, fired three times, striking Good in the chest and head. Good lost control of the SUV, which accelerated down the street and crashed. She was pronounced dead soon after. A DHS official said Ross fired in self-defense and sustained internal bleeding to the torso but did not provide any more details about his injuries.

Latest: The shooting is under investigation by the FBI, which has cut out state and local authorities, although Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said she is collecting evidence on her own. Good’s family hired civil rights attorney Antonio Romanucci, who also represented the loved ones of George Floyd. Romanucci said he is dedicated to “fervently pursuing justice on behalf” of Good.

Place: Portland, Oregon

Date: Jan. 8, 2026

Who was shot: Luis David Nino Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras were injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed CBP agent

Description: Nino Moncada, 33, a Venezuelan national who authorities say had been ordered removed from the country in 2024, was driving a vehicle targeted during an enforcement operation tied to a prostitution ring of the Tren de Aragua gang, federal officials said. Nino Moncada did not comply with commands to get out the car and instead reversed and struck an unoccupied Border Patrol vehicle multiple times, according to federal officials. In response, an agent opened fire, hitting Nino Moncada and a female passenger, Zambrano-Contreras, a Venezuelan national who authorities say entered the U.S. illegally in 2023. The pair fled. Nino Moncada, who was struck in the arm, and Zambrano-Contreras, who was hit in the chest, were hospitalized and later released. The FBI said there was no body camera video of the shooting. Nino Moncada was charged with aggravated assault of a federal officer with a deadly or dangerous weapon and depredation of federal property in excess of $1,000. Zambrano-Contreras was charged with entering the U.S. illegally.

Latest: Nino Moncada, who is being held in a Multnomah County jail, has pleaded not guilty. Zambrano-Contreras remains at a detention center in Tacoma, Washington. The Oregon attorney general said he is opening an investigation into the shooting while the FBI’s investigation is ongoing.

Place: Minneapolis

Date: Jan. 14, 2026

Who was shot: Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed federal law enforcement officer

Description: According to DHS, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” on Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022. He fled in his car, crashed into a parked car and ran away, DHS said. An officer chased him on foot and tried to arrest him, and Sosa-Celis “began to resist and violently assault” the officer, DHS said. During the struggle, two people came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, DHS said. Sosa-Celis broke loose and began hitting the officer with either the shovel or a broomstick, DHS said. The officer fired, hitting Sosa-Celis in the leg. ICE officers then arrested all three of the alleged attackers. DHS said the man who was shot and the officer were taken to a hospital.

There are thousands of federal immigration agents in Minnesota, and protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown continue. Those protests grew after an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis last week. Another Department of Homeland Security officer shot a man in the leg this week during an arrest. And that has all raised questions about the training immigration officers get and the protocols they're supposed to follow. NPR's Ximena Bustillo has been looking into this, and she's with us now to tell us more. Good morning.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: So the administration has made it clear from the beginning it wants to increase deportations. It wants to do that fast. And to do that, it's going to hire a lot more immigration agents, so that invites the question of just how these people are being trained. So what are the concerns about that?

BUSTILLO: Immigration advocates have questioned how immigration officers are being trained to not just conduct arrests but also engage with U.S. citizens, and particularly protesters or observers. For example, the woman who was killed in Minneapolis, Renee Macklin Good, was a U.S. citizen. I will note the officer involved in that incident had been with the agency for several years and not a part of this larger hiring surge. But, you know, I've been looking over the ICE and Customs and Border Protection handbooks, which both provide various procedures for how and when to use force, such as discharging a firearm. But it can also depend on the situation.

MARTIN: So say more about what situations these officers are now facing in their jobs.

BUSTILLO: Officers from both agencies were already interacting with the public in various places. For example, the Department of Homeland Security often provides security at major sporting events and national events. And that's different from an immigration arrest at the border, which is different from an immigration arrest in a parking lot in the interior of the country. But for - over the past year, there has been an increase in what immigration agents call at-large arrests, which means that they're out in the community, like on a street in the interior. And we've seen other agencies, such as Border Patrol, play a bigger role in these operations. Of course, they're facing a lot of protesters and more engagement with citizens as well.

Mark Brown is a use-of-force expert who used to train ICE officers. He's now a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law. And he says ICE officers might be working in new situations under President Trump.

MARK BROWN: When you have incidents, you have to look at training. You have to look at, was this - was there a gap in the training? Is there something? You can't train for everything, but training has to adapt to what's current.

BUSTILLO: But in all these situations and in my reviews of the handbooks, there is a certain amount of discretion on what agents are allowed to do.

MARTIN: And say more about that. What do you mean by discretion?

BUSTILLO: So let's look at the fatal shooting of Renee Macklin Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. The officer, Jonathan Ross, was in front of her vehicle when she was at the wheel. The agency says that he was acting in self-defense when he shot her in her car. The law enforcement experts and officials have pointed out that officers are often told not to shoot into vehicles or step in front of them. ICE's own handbook includes this, as well. It explicitly says firearms shall not be discharged solely to disable moving vehicles. But it also gives DHS officers the right to use deadly force when there's, quote, ""reasonable belief that the subject"" poses an imminent threat.

And that second part is what this administration is really leaning into. The claim that she was a threat is disputed by local leaders and contradicted by video evidence. The shooting is also still under various investigations. And a lot of claims from the administration that it is a felony to interfere? It's not always that simple. Just because the administration thinks something's a felony doesn't mean a judge in court will agree.

MARTIN: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thanks.

BUSTILLO: Thank you.

The Democrats gave general outlines for how they intend to use legislation and the budget process to increase health care access, protect immigrants and improve public safety all within 30 days. House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) predicted the Legislature’s achievements will offer a stark contrast to the “dysfunction” in Washington, D.C.

“We will have to make hard choices as we build the state budget, because, unlike the federal government, we have to have a balanced budget every single day,” he said. “So we’ll have to make sure that we put families first and not balance those budgets on their backs, which I can assure you, we will not.”

NM Governor’s office proposes $11.3B state budget and increased spending

In addition to passing a roughly $11 billion operating budget, the Legislature will consider legislation regarding medical malpractice and other health care reforms, a ban on local government involvement in immigrant detention, public safety and road repairs.

According to the speakers and a news release the House released Friday afternoon, House Democrats are hoping to attract and retain more doctors; hold gun dealers accountable for straw purchases; protect license plate data from being shared with the federal government; and create an independent commission overseeing the Children, Youth and Families Department, among other proposals.

“We may not know all that the future holds, but we’re ready to protect our people, regardless of the immigration status, the color of their skin or the languages they speak,” said Rep. Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque). “Because all New Mexicans deserve to feel safe in their communities.”

Advocacy groups push to expand immigrant services, driver protections during session

Much of the news conference focused on the Democrats’ plans for health care amid a statewide doctor shortage that has prompted sharp criticism from Republicans and advocacy groups.

Martinez and Rep. Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe) described a medical malpractice reform bill that aims to reduce the number of malpractice lawsuits as well as protect doctors from losing their practices if they get sued.

The bill has not yet been introduced. Rep. Liz Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee, told Source New Mexico after the news conference that House lawmakers are still working with the governor’s office on the reforms, which she expects to be wrapped into one piece of legislation.

The prosecution of crimes against humanity has been central to these efforts. German courts convicted members of the regime of Bashar al-Assad as well as foreign terrorist fighters, male and female, most of them cumulatively, for membership in a terrorist organization and crimes against humanity.

Focusing on the atrocities members of ISIS committed—for example, against the Yazidis—police, prosecutors, and judges faced many challenges. Questions that had to be answered were:

How to prove the widespread and systematic attack of ISIS against Yazidis?

How to identify perpetrators – especially those who could be tried in Germany?

How to cooperate effectively with a wide variety of stakeholders?

How to prove intention of individual male or female ISIS members who committed acts of murder, torture, rape, and enslavement against Yazidis.

These questions had to be raised at every step of the way – at the beginning of building a criminal case, during the preliminary investigation against individual suspects, as well as at the trial proceedings.

Looking at the contextual elements – the widespread and systematic attack – we established the grounds for suspicion of core international crimes by witness testimony of many Yazidi witnesses in Germany who were able to name and describe higher-ranking ISIS fighters who were involved in the initial attack on the Sinjar region of Iraq in August 2014 and who were involved in the initiation of the slave trade with Yazidi women and girls. However, we faced the problem that it would be a huge challenge to bring cases to court as it was so difficult to build a case against individuals with a link to Germany.

The first trials for ISIS-crimes against Yazidis started in 2019 and 2020 against three female ISIS members. In the course of the investigation into the terrorist crimes of these three returnees, the cooperation with several NGOs, especially YAZDA, brought to light that Yazidi slaves were held captive in their households. So, we cumulatively charged these women with the crime against humanity of murder, enslavement, torture, and aiding and abetting rape.

At the time of the trials, we had established the facts for the contextual elements by collecting many witness statements of Yazidis, police reports, ISIS documents, and NGO and expert witness reports. The question was: how was the evidence going to be introduced into the court proceedings?

According to German procedural law everything of relevance for the assessment of someone’s guilt has to be part of the court hearings. As the witness statements of more than 100 Yazidi witnesses built the foundation of our general findings, we were aware that German courts might think it necessary to have many Yazidi witnesses testify about the atrocities they endured, even if they were not directly affected by the acts of the defendants. This was something we didn’t want to happen as it would have caused a lot of stress for many witnesses and the risk of re-traumatization. Ultimately, proof of ISIS’ destructive agenda toward the Yazidi religion was found through other evidence. For example, the court heard statements from police officers who carried out numerous interviews with Yazidi witnesses about the killings during the initial attack on the Sinjar region as well as the established slave trade and the cruel treatment of women and girls. Furthermore, we presented police reports about documented ISIS attacks on Yazidi villages and cultural heritage. Expert witnesses also testified on the Yazidi religion and culture and on ISIS’ structure, the terrorist attacks and crimes it committed, and the group’s propaganda and aim to establish a global caliphate.

Having established the facts for the contextual element, German courts had to examine the evidence for the individual crimes committed by the defendants. Proving this was the most important part – and the heaviest task – and it rested on the shoulders of Yazidi witnesses who had to give evidence about the incredibly cruel treatment by their enslavers.

There were challenges to questioning Yazidi witnesses in court. First of all, there was the challenging situation for the witnesses: In Germany, it is not sufficient to resort to the protocol of the interviews taken during the preliminary investigation. So, in general, witnesses have to go through the painful process of testifying in court again. They are entitled to legal representation, but still the courtroom clearly is a difficult environment to speak about the most terrible events in their lives: They have to speak in the presence of the defendant, the defense counsels, the judges, the prosecutors, and, in most cases, the public, representatives of NGOs, and journalists.

Another challenge can be the lack of specialization of German courts. During the preliminary investigation a lot of specialists are involved in the process, like police officers from war crimes units, prosecutors, and experts. German courts, on the other hand, do not only deal with core international crime cases. They also try cases of Islamic extremists, right-wing and left-wing terrorism, espionage, and weapons proliferation.

When it came to inter-cultural competence, it proved to be very helpful that some of the court chambers in Germany took the time to become familiar with the specifics of the Yazidi cases. Before the Yazidi witnesses were heard, experts explained the religious and cultural background of the Yazidis. It led to the conclusion that exact details of age and time or perceptions in chronological order are atypical and cannot always be expected from Yazidi witnesses. Instead, classifications of time are typically linked to historical events and sensations. These explanations gave the judges the opportunity to adjust their way of questioning the witnesses.

Interpretation was another issue of the criminal proceedings. It was not always easy to find interpreters who speak the “Shingali-Kurmanji” dialect of the Yazidis of Sinjar, a dialect mixing Kurdish Kurmanji with Arabic.

In the end, Yazidi witnesses proved to be survivors in the courtroom as well. One of the witnesses testified in five different cases before Higher Regional Courts, contributing to five convictions. With great patience and resilience, they managed and tolerated endless interrogations by all parties. In every case, judges concluded that the Yazidi witness statements were reliable, credible, and authentic and courts based their convictions on their testimony.

More than 20 years of investigations have demonstrated that crimes against humanity can be effectively prosecuted under the provisions of Section 7 of the German Code of Crimes Against International Law. However, every conflict is unique and every investigation inevitably starts with huge problems. Solving these problems requires clear rules, creativity, and sometimes a lot of patience. Above all, international cooperation is indispensable. I cannot think of any aspect of prosecuting crimes against humanity where it has not been of significant importance to cooperate with international partners. International cooperation is a quintessential element at every step of the way toward holding perpetrators accountable for crimes against humanity. An international convention on prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity would be a visible step toward accountability.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-9213117081.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 23:00:02.903682

BOSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The top U.S. immigration judge has told her colleagues that they are not bound by a federal court ruling that declared the Trump administration cannot place thousands ​of people in mandatory detention without an opportunity to be released on bond.

That directive came in an ‌email Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley sent her colleagues on Tuesday that the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts attached to a filing ‌on Friday in Boston federal court in a lawsuit challenging the administration's policy of denying bond hearings.

The ACLU said the email was evidence that ""the government has deliberately and systematically instructed every Immigration Judge in the country not to comply with final declaratory judgments.""

The civil rights group said the statement directs judges to disregard court rulings by U.S. District Judge Sunshine Sykes in ⁠Riverside, California, and U.S. District Judge Patti ‌Saris in Boston in separate class action lawsuits brought on behalf of people who were already living in the United States when they were detained. Both judges held that denying ‍people bond hearings was unlawful.

""We have asked for a status conference to update the court on this troubling development — which significantly impacts the rights of our class members — and anticipate seeking additional relief to protect the class,"" Dan McFadden, managing attorney at the ​ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement.

At the ACLU's request, Saris scheduled a Tuesday hearing.

The Justice Department, which oversees ‌the immigration courts, did not respond to a request for comment.

Immigration judges are not part of the federal judiciary but are instead employees of the Justice Department, which is part of the Trump administration.

Under federal immigration law, ""applicants for admission"" to the United States are subject to mandatory detention while their cases proceed in immigration courts.

Bucking a longstanding interpretation of the law, the Trump administration in July said non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those ⁠who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify ​as applicants for admission.

The Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part ​of the Justice Department, issued a decision in September that adopted the administration's interpretation.

But Sykes, whose case is a nationwide class action, in a ruling in December said that the administration's interpretation was ‍contrary to law and that, ⁠as a result, the board's ruling was ""no longer controlling.""

Yet Riley in Tuesday's email told her colleagues that because Sykes did not issue an injunction, the board's decision ""remains binding precedent on agency adjudicators.""

Lawyers with the ACLU said ⁠that prior to that email, the immigration court in Massachusetts had begun holding bond hearings again, consistent with Saris' decision.

Yet the lawyers said ‌they received multiple reports on Thursday that an immigration judge was denying detainee requests for bond ‌hearings.

President Trump has threatened to use the military to stop the protests in Minneapolis by invoking the Insurrection Act. We'll have more on what that would mean in a few minutes, but we're going to start with a report about the situation on the ground.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

On Wednesday, immigration officers shot another man, this time in the leg, which sparked unrest on the city's north side.

MARTIN: NPR's Meg Anderson is in Minneapolis and is with us now to give us the latest. Good morning, Meg.

MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: You know, looking at this from the outside, things seem pretty volatile. But thankfully, you're there. So could you just describe what you're seeing?

ANDERSON: Yeah. There are now as many as 3,000 federal immigration officers on the ground or arriving soon here in the Twin Cities. That's nearly five times the number of Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, the city is sometimes quiet until it is really, really not. And that's because the fierce resistance to this ICE surge continues to be noisy as community members are following immigration officers in their car, honking and whistling. Here's how that sounds.

(SOUNDBITE OF HONKING)

ANDERSON: And I should note the observers filming and making noise. Those peaceful acts of resistance, even though they're chaotic, are protected by the Constitution. But ICE has responded to some confrontations over the last week with a lot of aggression. Over the last five days, NPR reporters, myself included, we've seen ICE officers using tear gas, flash bangs and pepper balls to disperse crowds. But the community here, you know, it's responding in quieter ways, too.

MARTIN: Well, say more about that, if you would. How so?

ANDERSON: Yeah. So if you drive around the Twin Cities, you'll see parents and other community members standing guard outside of schools and day cares with whistles around their necks. Residents are collecting food donations and giving rides to people who are afraid to leave the house. And people are afraid to leave their homes. I spoke to one woman, an asylum-seeker with two young U.S. citizen children. She asked to only be identified by her first initial, A, because she's afraid she'll be deported if she's identified. She has not left her home in several weeks.

A: (Non-English language spoken).

ANDERSON: She said she feels like she can't see a future, a stable tomorrow for herself or her family. And these fears, being afraid to leave the house, they're not unfounded. NPR reporters have witnessed immigration officers stopping and even detaining people of color seemingly at random on the street. I should note that just yesterday, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of racial profiling against Latino and Somali people here.

MARTIN: And President Trump also threatened yesterday to use the Insurrection Act against Minnesota. Would you explain exactly what that would mean?

ANDERSON: Yeah. So first, the president has threatened to use that law many times before and hasn't. Still, in a post on Truth Social, he said he would invoke the act if state officials, quote, don't ""stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the patriots of ICE."" That law is more than 200 years old. It's controversial. Basically, it would give the president sweeping powers to deploy the military here without the state's consent. The last time it was invoked was during the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.

MARTIN: And how are local leaders responding to this?

ANDERSON: So Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he would challenge the use of the law in court. He emphasized in a statement to NPR that Minnesotans are responding peacefully. There's no reason for that law to be invoked. Senator Amy Klobuchar has said the administration is escalating the situation and not the other way around.

MARTIN: That is NPR's Meg Anderson. Meg, thank you.

ANDERSON: You're welcome.

The ruling by Judge David O. Carter of the U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Calif., appears to thwart the federal government’s efforts to comb through the election rolls in the nation’s most populous state to potentially challenge voters’ eligibility.

About two dozen states are defending themselves from similar lawsuits filed by the Trump administration, which has sought to build a national voter roll with the information.

Many of those states are governed by Democrats, who have argued that the release of sensitive information, such as driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers, would be unconstitutional and would have a chilling effect on elections.

President Trump and his allies have continued to spread false claims about voter fraud and states’ allowing noncitizens to cast ballots.

“The taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece-by-piece until there is nothing left,” Judge Carter wrote. “The case before the court is one of these cuts that imperils all Americans. The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the legislative branch, not the executive.”

In the 33-page decision, Judge Carter, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said that releasing voters’ personal information would violate a plethora of federal and state privacy laws. He said the Justice Department was seeking to use civil rights legislation to “amass and retain an unprecedented amount of confidential voter data.”

“The Constitution demands such respect, and the executive may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections it seeks to do so here,” Judge Carter wrote.

It was not immediately clear if the Trump administration planned to appeal the decision.

The White House referred questions on the ruling on Thursday to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a statement on Thursday, Shirley N. Weber, California’s secretary of state and a Democrat who was named as a defendant in the case, praised the lawsuit’s dismissal.

“As California secretary of state, I am entrusted with ensuring that California’s state election laws are enforced — including state laws that protect the privacy of Californians’ data,” Ms. Weber said. “I will continue to uphold my promise to Californians to protect our democracy, and I will continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”

A day earlier, a federal court upheld California’s new congressional maps, rejecting claims by Republicans and the Trump administration that they were unconstitutional.

“Back-to-back days now of Trump and his Administration losing to California,” the press office of Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media on Thursday.

The Democratic National Committee had filed a brief in the case that raised concerns about the release of voter data.

“This should be a five-alarm fire for Americans everywhere — it opens the door to privacy concerns and further political retribution,” Ken Martin, the D.N.C. chairman, said after Thursday’s decision.

Despite carrying all seven battleground states in the 2024 presidential election, which he won by more than two million votes, Mr. Trump has clung to unsupported claims about widespread voter fraud and clashed with political adversaries over voter lists.

In Oregon, another state that is being sued, the Justice Department’s case also appeared to be unraveling.

On Wednesday, a federal judge in that state, voicing skepticism about giving the federal government unfettered access to voter data, signaled that he was leaning toward dismissing that lawsuit, the newspaper The Oregonian reported.

In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and ESA Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virg.) warned the changes would gut environmental review, strip protections from hundreds of vulnerable species, and let politics override science in listing decisions—all while the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service face unprecedented staffing and budget shortfalls thanks to the Trump administration.

""These sweeping changes would fundamentally weaken our nation's most important wildlife conservation law at a time when one million species face extinction globally,"" wrote the lawmakers. ""We urge the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service to withdraw these proposed rulemakings and instead work to implement the ESA as Congress intended: any regulatory changes should further the objectives of the ESA to conserve species and prevent extinction.""

The ESA has prevented more than 99 percent of listed species from going extinct and has helped hundreds move toward recovery. Section 7 consultations typically take just two weeks for informal review and two months for formal review—contrary to conventional wisdom, the ESA does not stop projects from moving forward. According to one peer-reviewed study, the ESA did not halt a single project between 2008 and 2015.

The lawmakers highlighted how the proposed rules would:

Gut Section 7 consultation requirements by letting agencies claim project impacts ""would occur regardless of whether the proposed action goes forward"" — a loophole that could exempt highways, pipelines, and development projects from meaningful scrutiny;

Strip protections from threatened species by rescinding the ""blanket 4(d) rule"" that extends baseline protections to all threatened species, creating dangerous years-long protection gaps that resource-agencies can’t fill. The blanket 4(d) rule provides automatic protections to species such as the piping plover and the West Indian Manatee, species listed as threatened in the future would not receive those same baseline protections; and

Let politics override science by injecting cherry-picked 'economic considerations into listing decisions. Congress explicitly required that listing decisions be based solely on the best available science, not on arbitrary evaluations of certain impacts or political pressures.

""With reduced staff and resources, the Services should prioritize addressing the backlog of species awaiting protection and advancing recovery efforts for those already listed, rather than redirecting attention to rewriting long-standing and effective regulations,"" continued the lawmakers. ""Habitat destruction and climate change are accelerating species extinction to alarming rates, and we should be working to uphold and strengthen the ESA, not weaken it.""

ACLU says top immigration judge instructed colleagues to ignore court ruling

Federal judges have ruled Trump administration's practice of denying bond hearing is unlawful

Board of Immigration Appeals adopted administration's interpretation of law

BOSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The top U.S. immigration judge has told her colleagues that they are not bound by a federal court ruling that declared the Trump administration cannot place thousands of people in mandatory detention without an opportunity to be released on bond.

That directive came in an email Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley sent her colleagues on Tuesday that the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts attached to a filing on Friday, opens new tab in Boston federal court in a lawsuit challenging the administration's policy of denying bond hearings.

The ACLU said the email was evidence that ""the government has deliberately and systematically instructed every Immigration Judge in the country not to comply with final declaratory judgments.""

The civil rights group said the statement directs judges to disregard court rulings by U.S. District Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, and U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston in separate class action lawsuits brought on behalf of people who were already living in the United States when they were detained. Both judges held that denying people bond hearings was unlawful.

""We have asked for a status conference to update the court on this troubling development — which significantly impacts the rights of our class members — and anticipate seeking additional relief to protect the class,"" Dan McFadden, managing attorney at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement.

At the ACLU's request, Saris scheduled a Tuesday hearing.

The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, did not respond to a request for comment.

Immigration judges are not part of the federal judiciary but are instead employees of the Justice Department, which is part of the Trump administration.

Under federal immigration law, ""applicants for admission"" to the United States are subject to mandatory detention while their cases proceed in immigration courts.

Bucking a longstanding interpretation of the law, the Trump administration in July said non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.

The Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a decision in September that adopted the administration's interpretation.

But Sykes, whose case is a nationwide class action, in a ruling in December said that the administration's interpretation was contrary to law and that, as a result, the board's ruling was ""no longer controlling.""

Yet Riley in Tuesday's email told her colleagues that because Sykes did not issue an injunction, the board's decision ""remains binding precedent on agency adjudicators.""

Lawyers with the ACLU said that prior to that email, the immigration court in Massachusetts had begun holding bond hearings again, consistent with Saris' decision.

Yet the lawyers said they received multiple reports on Thursday that an immigration judge was denying detainee requests for bond hearings.

The Hope CommUnity Center said in a Friday evening statement it confirmed about 300 people had been booked into the Orange County Jail on immigration holds in the previous 48 hours alone — which would mark a steep increase compared to the roughly 70 people booked on such holds on a normal day.

“We have received multiple verifiable and credible reports that ICE and Border Patrol agents are stopping individuals in our communities, requesting documentation, and detaining people, often without a clear explanation,” said Felipe Sousa-Lazaballet, the executive director of the center and a Democratic candidate for the Florida House.

A spokesperson for the jail told the Sentinel that a total of 831 people had been booked on such holds since Jan. 1. County Commissioner Nicole Wilson said that number was a shocking total, since only about 300 people had been booked in December.

Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said he was advised by his jail chief that a significant number of the recent bookings were people who were rebooked into the jail. Under the county’s agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency can only keep a person booked there for 72 hours before transporting them to a federal facility — though the agency apparently has been taking detainees elsewhere, only to bring them back to the jail.

Rumors had swirled on social media this week that ICE had booked 200 hotel rooms for its officers throughout the region this weekend, as well as that officials were touring an east Orlando warehouse Friday for a potential new detainee processing facility.

WFTV reported that a senior ICE advisor confirmed the agency toured the facility, though no contracts have been signed. WKMG later reported that they joined ICE representatives on their tour.

Frost, D-Orlando, said in a video posted to his Facebook page Thursday that “ICE is in the community and that they have made pretty large hotel reservations in surrounding hotels as well.”

The post included a flyer informing people how they can interact with federal authorities, including to ask to see a warrant before opening the door, that you don’t need to provide your immigration status or place of birth, and to let a trusted family member know how to find important documents.

In recent days, the Central Florida area stretching west from Lakeland to east Orange appeared to be a hotspot for immigration enforcement according to People Over Papers, which documents the presence of ICE and other authorities using witness reports. One alleged sighting of four uniformed officers was reported at Disney Springs Thursday evening.

Wilson said she’s received accounts of authorities stopping people across her district in western Orange County, including a landscaping crew on Plant Street in downtown Winter Garden.

Demings said his staff had been unable to confirm if such a surge was planned for this week, but urged county residents to respond in a peaceful manner.

“Whatever response we have in this community, I would always implore our community to respond in a peaceful way,” he said.

Florida has already aggressively participated with federal authorities in immigration enforcement, requiring counties to sign agreements to cooperate with ICE and deputizing the Florida Highway Patrol and other law enforcement agencies to provide enforcement as well.

Under the so-called Operation Tidal Wave, which Gov. Ron DeSantis touted as “the largest joint immigration enforcement operation in ICE’s history,” state authorities have arrested more than 10,000 undocumented immigrants across the state.

While there is an ICE Field Office in Orlando, a processing facility could further ramp up efforts. The Washington Post reported last month that a document it obtained laid out a plan to detain immigrants in warehouses across the country, with a total capacity of 80,000. That includes a network of facilities that could hold about 1,500 a piece.

The document didn’t name Orlando as a location, though it did mention a possible facility in Jupiter, the northern coastal Palm Beach County town.

The Orlando property reportedly toured by ICE is east of Sunbridge Parkway, zoned for industrial uses and is surrounded by land that Tavistock plans to build its massive Sunbridge community with thousands of homes. Today nearly all of those thousands of acres are wooded with pines, palmettos and brush.

The warehouse park, though, is one of the few parcels not controlled by Tavistock, a spokesperson said. A real estate agent listed as marketing the 440,000 square foot warehouse for lease didn’t return a call for comment.

City officials say nobody has inquired about the property, which may require a zoning change if it truly was pursued as an immigration facility. Such usage may even require a conditional-use permit, which requires the approval of the City Council, though it’s unclear if the federal government can work around city rules.

Soto, D-Kissimmee, said his office hasn’t been informed of such a facility in Central Florida, He added he was monitoring increased ICE activity in the region.

“President Trump promised to only deport violent criminals. He has broken this promise countless times in Central Florida,” he said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t respond to emailed questions.

But Alex Lanfranconi, DeSantis’ communications director, stoked the flames Thursday by responding to an X account reporting about the warehouse’s alleged 1,500-person capacity. “This is ridiculous,” Lanfranconi wrote. “It needs to hold wayyyy more people.”

Lazaballet told the Sentinel that seeking an immigrant processing center in Orlando is plausible, since the city is also home to one of three immigration courts in Florida, with the other two located in Miami.

“Logistically speaking, it would make sense,” said Sousa-Lazaballet, also the executive director of Hope CommUnity Center.

Amid the talk of an ICE surge, local activists have looked for signs of businesses collaborating with ICE or its sister agency U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, with some groups this week targeting a pet resort in Lake Nona.

Pet Paradise Resort & Spa, which is headquartered in Jacksonville and has multiple locations around the country, took to Instagram to defend its partnership with CBP, saying the dogs they house are used at nearby airports like Orlando International. They denied housing animals brought in by ICE.

Further alarms were raised in light of rumors of ICE agents booking rooms at local hotels at a time when its presence appears to have increased.

“It does track that it feels overwhelming,” Sousa-Lazaballet said. “If they got 200 rooms, that’s in addition to the agents they already have here.”

The Sentinel reached out to area hotels this week but did not find any confirmation of increased ICE bookings. ICE did hold a recruitment event at a Tampa-area Hilton on Thursday and Friday, which drew protests.

At a press conference on Thursday at The Gathering Place Church in Orlando, the Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition and senior pastor at the church, said “we do not want to see any replication of what’s happening in Minnesota.”

Alongside other religious leaders and immigrant advocates, he called on residents to protest ICE actions peacefully and for ICE agents to give undocumented immigrants due process and respect.

“We are telling the administration that any discriminatory action on immigration that puts in danger our families, that separates families, that affects the religious liberty of our churches, the Evangelical community will raise its voice in solidarity,” Salguero said. “It’s very important for everyone to know that our commitment is rooted in non-violence.”",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tos-l-ice-nalec1150.jpg?w=1024&h=592,N,,2026-01-16 17:58:55.153959

The topline figure, coming in at $50 billion, represents a 16 percent cut compared to FY25, but that’s before subtracting select emergency funding and rescissions. And unlike last year’s continuing resolution extending funding at prior levels, lawmakers put their own stamp on the new spending bill. A host of reporting requirements and mandated briefings will ensure that key actors on Capitol Hill remain engaged with a range of development and humanitarian policy issues in the months ahead.

That said, there are plenty of lingering questions about the extent to which the vision for future international assistance—as sketched out in the bill—comes to fruition, given both the Department of State’s lean staffing and the administration’s views on impoundment and its penchant for withholding funds. Nevertheless, appropriators are voicing a desire to see continued US leadership in the provision of foreign aid and in various multilateral fora. The deal is yet to pass the Senate, but here’s a rundown of how several major accounts fared and what might come next. (You can find the link to the bill text HERE and the joint explanatory statement HERE.)

Global health gets by

Despite years of bipartisan backing and the administration’s stated commitment, the president’s budget proposed a staggering 60 percent cut to funding for global health programs. In contrast, appropriators signaled support for strong US leadership in global health, providing $9.4 billion for the primary global health account, previously split between the Department of State and USAID. That’s $5.6 billion above the administration’s request. That figure is allocated largely to familiar funding priorities, including HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, and even areas left out of the America First Global Health Strategy, such as nutrition, neglected tropical diseases, and family planning and reproductive health.

The compromise bill reaffirms Congress’s desire to keep the US engaged in major health multilaterals—save the World Health Organization—directing US contributions to the Global Fund, Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance), the World Bank-hosted Pandemic Fund, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

Despite breaking with the administration on funding levels, the measure and accompanying report lean into several components of the America First Global Health Strategy. The bill directs a new strategy to expand market access for US biomedical firms and requires a PEPFAR transition strategy that shifts toward country-led programming without sacrificing results. Appropriators also included a mandate to support research and development for breakthrough technologies targeting HIV/AIDs, malaria, and other infectious diseases, which could be read (in part) as an endorsement of the kind of partnership demonstrated by the State Department’s purchase agreement supporting the rollout of the game-changing HIV prevention drug lenacapavir through the Global Fund.

State Department officials have outlined lofty goals for the US global health portfolio as they negotiate and sign a slew of bilateral memoranda of understanding charting global health cooperation with partner countries in the years ahead. Still, lawmakers have questions about precisely how an America First global health agenda might proceed, instituting new reporting requirements on multilateral health engagement, the bilateral global health agreements, and the Global Health Bureau’s plans to launch an innovation fund.

Humanitarian spending on the horizon?

For years, the United States has been the world’s leading provider of humanitarian aid—with structures and systems that, while deeply fragmented, have been capable of responding to urgent needs across a host of contexts. But the Trump administration’s stop-work order, award terminations, and dismantling of USAID threw an enormous wrench in the gears. Humanitarian relief efforts could surely benefit from constructive reforms, and with so many protracted crises around the world, the US would be wise to revisit its response toolkit. But what we’ve witnessed over the past year is simply much less US humanitarian aid. The State Department has touted its responses in the wake of Hurricane Melissa and Typhoon Tino, and, more recently, struck a deal with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs—suggesting a level of continued commitment to humanitarian support so long as it can shape the parameters. Still, it doesn’t negate the fact that humanitarian spending fell well behind pace in FY25. The most generous interpretation may be that intent ran headlong into limited capacity.

Appropriators acquiesce to the administration’s desire for a central humanitarian account—combining the State Department’s Migration and Refugee Assistance with the International Disaster Assistance pot once managed by USAID—but would provide more than double the requested funds. The administration had hoped to channel more funding through the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance account, which the president can draw down at his discretion. With passage of the FY26 Agriculture spending bill last year, lawmakers also rejected the administration’s plans to defund a separate international food aid account that can be used to respond to humanitarian needs.

As the joint explanatory statement suggests, in requesting detailed administration plans for spending humanitarian funds, this will be a key area to watch.

The death of Development Assistance?

Provisions in the bill text and explanatory statement suggest a durable interest in continued investment in aid-supported work previously managed by USAID, with spending directives for advancing food security and agricultural development ($720 million), women’s economic empowerment ($150 million), and global education programs ($691.5 million).

In its FY26 budget, the White House sought to zero out traditional bilateral economic assistance accounts and replace them with a wildly flexible America First Opportunity Fund. Notably, the administration also rescinded billions of dollars in previously appropriated economic aid. Lawmakers seem eager for a more measured approach, rolling the two core accounts (Development Assistance and the Economic Support Fund) into a new National Security Investment Programs (NSIP) bucket meant to link traditional economic development priorities with strategic objectives. Appropriators would provide significantly more resources than the White House requested, and, of those resources, the bill specifies that at least 15 percent should be allocated to Africa, focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, and with just $575 million of the new account carved out for the administration’s America First Opportunity Fund. Democracy programs survive as a separate line item, but with a steep, roughly 40 percent haircut from FY24 and FY25 enacted levels before rescissions.

Safeguarding US shareholding at the IFIs

US engagement with and support for international financial institutions have remained a bright spot in the broader story of recent US development spending. The Trump administration has continued to make commitments and contributions to a number of international financial institutions (IFIs), and the back-to-basics agenda advocated by Treasury officials enjoys some bipartisan buy-in and has received support from other major shareholders (along with some think tank experts). The new spending bill would deliver the first payment toward the administration’s revised pledge to the replenishment of the World Bank’s International Development Association, IDA21, and the first payment for a level pledge at the last Asian Development Fund replenishment; it likewise includes the necessary authorizations for both contributions. With credit to the House Financial Services Committee, the measure also carries a sought-after, money-saving fix that exempts IDA from certain US Securities and Exchange Commission registration requirements. The concessional lending arms of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank remain vital sources of affordable finance for a number of the world’s poorest countries, where continued US leadership and financial support matter.

In addition, under the bill, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) would receive the first payment of a long-awaited capital increase, with $87.5 million teed up after authorization cleared in the continuing resolution. The bill also greenlights US participation in the IDB Invest capital increase—and while stopping short of an explicit appropriation, it provides $75 million in flexible Treasury funding that could enable the administration to make a first payment. Appropriators deflected on IMF quota reform and provided no resources for the African Development Fund, adding to US arrears at the institution. Still, the measure would keep the taps open for both the Global Environment Facility and the International Fund for Agricultural Development even without formal asks from the administration.

Big hopes and a stable budget for DFC

Both the White House and lawmakers have endorsed a bigger, bolder US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). But will resources match ambition? Appropriators would level fund the agency, with language in the explanatory statement encouraging DFC to operationalize the changes in its recent reauthorization bill. After a sluggish FY25 in which, according to recent data, DFC made just over $3 billion in new commitments, DFC enters the new year with plenty of headroom to expand and the ability to invest almost anywhere in the world (with some guardrails). The president’s budget request sought to capitalize a proposed revolving fund that would enable DFC to make better use of its direct equity authority by providing a workaround to longstanding budget scoring constraints. While appropriators didn’t deliver the $3 billion bump requested by the administration, the joint explanatory statement notes that DFC can make transfers to the new DFC Equity Investment Account, subject to congressional notification procedures.

With reauthorization complete and new funding on the horizon, the big question ahead is whether the agency can deliver on its mandate to pursue strategic deals while still generating meaningful development impact. Appropriators also hope DFC’s transparency practices improve further—reminding the agency of its statutory authority to report its transactions to the central foreign aid dashboard, foreignassistance.gov. The agency has been working with the team at the State Department that manages the site, but has struggled with how to present loans, guarantees, and insurance commitments alongside more traditional grant-based aid.

MCC rides again

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) had a tumultuous last year. It narrowly avoided the fate that befell USAID thanks to a bipartisan cadre of champions, but the agency weathered a slew of program terminations and significant workforce reductions. The new bill would provide $830 million for MCC, roughly 11 percent lower than in recent years, but nowhere near the 75 percent cut envisioned in the president’s budget request.

However, the measure would resume the unfortunate recent trend of subjecting the agency to rescissions of unspent funds. As we’ve highlighted previously, MCC’s multi-year country agreements require the agency to bank substantial sums that it spends down over time. In the wake of recent program terminations, the minibus would claw back more than $661 million—though, again, less than the administration initially sought.

And overall, things may be looking up for the little agency. In the joint explanatory statement, appropriators direct MCC’s CEO (notably, still waiting on a nominee) to notify relevant committees before terminating assistance, specifying a raft of information that must be provided in advance. Meanwhile, key administration officials appear increasingly keen to deploy MCC’s model. With greater budget certainty, a refreshed scorecard, and newly selected partners, the prospects for MCC’s data-driven, good-governance-oriented approach appear promising.

But how do we know any of this spending will achieve its objectives?

If you’ve made it this far, you’re a real one—as the kids say—so we’ll acknowledge that we’ve been struggling more than usual when it comes to talking about two of our favorite topics: evidence and evaluation. On the one hand, amid scarce resources, it seems more important than ever to ensure that US assistance delivers value for money—that is, that programs achieve their intended impact in as cost-effective a manner as possible. On the other hand, we’re acutely aware (as noted above) that in the wake of USAID’s shuttering and other federal workforce reductions, bandwidth is limited. Prior to its dismantling, USAID had taken steps to improve its use and generation of evidence, including establishing an office with precisely that remit. The State Department has historically lagged behind in this area, but in 2023 began endeavoring to make evidence more accessible and actionable—with the goal of informing better decision-making. Despite increased invocation of the importance of outcomes and results, over the last year, we’ve seen no signs (at least shared publicly) that commissioning evaluations of aid-supported programming (to understand what programming actually achieved) or facilitating greater use of rigorous evidence (to design interventions to work well from the start) is a priority for the State Department. It’s encouraging that Capitol Hill still identifies the significance of rigorous evaluation in advancing aid effectiveness (see Section 7011)—and maybe the required strategy will provide an opportunity for the State Department to set new goals that will help it move from more basic but still critical data management (and transparency), to integrating evidence into decision-making and even generating quality evidence through rigorous evaluation.",https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/corruption-and-poverty-blog-gupta.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:58:46.676954

MINNEAPOLIS

On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty troops into Minneapolis, MN, where widespread demonstrations continue against the aggressive tactics of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Gregory Svirnovskiy, Kyle Cheney, and Myah Ward report for POLITICO.

The Editorial Board of the Minnesota Star Tribune said the situation in Minneapolis feels like “a military occupation.” The city is “under siege,” the paper said, with “battalions of armed federal agents … moving through neighborhoods, transit hubs, malls and parking lots and staging near churches, mosques and schools. Strangers with guns have metastasized in spaces where daily life should be routine and safe.” The paper urged public protest and civil disobedience to remain peaceful, but wrote “The occupation of Minnesota by ICE cannot stand.”

Minneapolis police and fire departments released new records Thursday night about the killing of Renee Good including the location of gunshot wounds. The New York Times reports.

Some Minnesota school districts are offering students the option to do remote learning as fear spreads through the state’s immigrant communities. Sarah Mervosh reports for the New York Times.

Several Native Americans are being swept up by ICE in Minneapolis. “Tribal leaders and members who live in the greater Minneapolis area say Indigenous family members, friends and neighbors have been stopped, questioned, harassed and, in some cases, detained solely on the basis of their skin color or their names,” Mariana Alfaro reports for the Washington Post.

The ACLU of Minnesota is filing a class action lawsuit against the U.S. government for constitutional rights violations by federal agents. The violations include racially profiling residents, conducting illegal search and seizures, and making arrests without warrants. Stephen Swanson reports for CBS News.

ICE

The Office of the Medical Examiner in El Paso County believes that the death of a man at a Texas detention camp was homicide, according to a recording shared with the Washington Post. When ICE announced the death of Geraldo Lunas Campos on Jan. 3, it gave no cause of death. But “according to an eyewitness account and an internal ICE document reviewed by The Post,” Lunas Campos died following a struggle with detention staff. The new recording suggests he died from “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression.”

ICE relied on AI to process thousands of new applications but an error caused the agency to wrongly categorize many of the new applicants as having law enforcement experience when they’d actually had none. “A DHS spokesperson called it a ‘technological snag’ that was quickly rectified,” Julia Ainsley reports for NBC News.

The deputy director of ICE announced on Thursday that she’s stepping down to run for office in Ohio. Madison Sheahan, 28, said she would enter the Republican primary race to oppose Democratic Representative Marcy Kaptur. Reid J. Epstein and Madeleine Ngo report for the New York Times.

ICE’s principal legal adviser will replace Sheahan as the No. 2 at ICE. Charles Wall, who began his career with ICE as an assistant chief counsel in Louisiana in 2012, will become the new deputy director, Reuters reports.

Maine officials told residents on Wednesday that they were expecting federal immigration authorities to arrive in the state in the coming days. ICE agents are expected in the cities of Lewiston and Portland, according to the mayors there. Ashleigh Fields report for The Hill.

IRAN

After encouraging Iranians to take to the streets and declaring “help is on its way” on Wednesday, Trump appears to have backed off the idea of striking Iran. On Thursday, he said “very important sources on the other side” had told him the killing inside the country had stopped, surprising some of his own officials. His statement prompted speculation that the president could be attempting misdirection, similar to the lead up to U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June. Kevin Liptak, Zachary Cohen, Alayna Treene, Kristen Holmes report for CNN.

On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Trump to postpone any plans for an American military attack. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt also asked the administration to hold off on any U.S. military operation, saying it could cause wider regional conflict. Edward Wong, Tyler Pager, and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

On Thursday, Iran reopened its airspace after Trump’s comments about the killing having stopped. However, European airlines are still choosing not to fly over the country. Reuters reports.

Iran’s judiciary said it “had not issued a death sentence for Erfan Soltani, 26, a protester whose execution had been widely reported as imminent and had drawn intense international attention,” Abdi Latif Dahir and Sanam Mahoozi report for the New York Times.

The director of Israel’s Mossad spy agency is in the United States to discuss the situation in Iran. David Barnea is expected to “meet in Miami with White House envoy Steve Witkoff, who is managing the direct channel of communication between the U.S. and Iran,” Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

VENEZUELA

María Corina Machado, Venezuela’s opposition leader, met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and gave him her Nobel Peace Prize, which she won last year. After a large-scale U.S. military operation removed Venezuela’s longtime leader Nicolás Maduro from power earlier this month, Trump declined to replace him with Machado. Instead, he elevated other members of the Maduro regime into leadership positions. “It is unclear what Ms. Machado gained out of her meeting with Mr. Trump,” Max Bearak and Henrik Pryser Libell report for the New York Times.

While Machado met with Trump, CIA Director John Ratcliffe was in Caracas meeting with Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president of Venezuela. A U.S. official told the New York Times Ratcliffe’s meeting with Rodríguez was at Trump’s direction and it was meant “to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship.”

On Thursday, U.S. forces in the Caribbean seized a sixth sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration said has ties to Venezuela. The U.S. military said the ship was seized “without incident.” Konstantin Toropin and Michael Biesecker report for the AP.

The new leadership in Venezuela promised last week to release an “important number” of political prisoners, but their families say they are still waiting. The Venezuelan government claims several hundred have been released, but “Foro Penal, a leading rights organization that tracks and advocates for Venezuelan prisoners, says 79 had been released as of Wednesday night. An estimated 800 to 900 political prisoners were believed to have been incarcerated in Venezuela at the time of Maduro’s capture.” Mariana Zuñiga and Carmen Sesin report for NBC News.

The first U.S. sale of Venezuelan oil was to Vitol, “a company whose senior oil trader donated to Trump’s re-election campaign and attended a White House meeting with the president last week.” Malcolm Moore and Jamie Smyth report for the Financial Times.

GREENLAND

European troops arrived in Greenland on Thursday as Trump continued to threaten U.S. annexation of the Danish territory. “Small numbers of military personnel from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway and Sweden were arriving in the Arctic island early Thursday,” Yuliya Talmazan reports for NBC News.

Two new polls show that most Americans oppose Trump’s threats to take over Greenland. “Eighty-six percent of voters nationwide questioned in a Quinnipiac University poll said they would oppose military action to take over Greenland.” And “three-quarters of Americans questioned in a CNN poll conducted at the same time said they opposed a U.S. takeover of Greenland.” Paul Steinhauser reports for FOX News.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers were set to introduce a resolution on Thursday that would repudiate Trump’s threats to seize Greenland. The effort was led by Sens. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Don Bacon (R-NE). Joe Gould reports for POLITICO.

CHINA

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is on a landmark state visit to Beijing, where on Friday it was announced that “Canada will lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles and China will do the same for Canadian canola products.” Carney announced on X that “Canada and China are forging a new strategic partnership.” Canada’s shift in trade policy comes after Trump has repeatedly threatened Canadian sovereignty. “The tariff changes Mr. Carney announced were modest, but they signal an important break with the United States as Canada seeks to urgently diversify its trading partners and reduce its reliance on the United States,” Matina Stevis-Gridneff reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge said on Thursday that Trump Cabinet secretaries had conspired to violate the Constitution. “In remarks laced with outrage and disbelief, U.S. District Judge William Young said Donald Trump and top officials have a ‘fearful approach’ to freedom of speech that would seek to ‘exclude from participation everyone who doesn’t agree with them.’” Young was appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan.

At a different court hearing, the Trump administration admitted it had made a mistake when it deported Any Lucia López Belloza, 19, a freshman at Babson College, when she was flying home for Thanksgiving. Still, the government has not moved to drop the case, Adam Sella reports for the New York Times.

A federal appeals panel on Thursday reversed a lower court decision that released Mahmoud Khalil from an immigration jail. “In a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled that federal immigration laws require deportation challenges to be made by filing a petition for review of a final order of removal with a federal appeals court — not a lower-level district court.” The Associated Press reports.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-73086221-1-e1512768873185.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:59:28.397238

Snowballs arcing toward ranks of men armored in tactical gear. Protesters gleefully dumping water to make streets even more hazardous.

If there is a third character in the story of immigration agents versus protesters in Minnesota, it is the January weather.

This weekend, temperatures in Minneapolis are expected to plunge even lower, to around zero degrees, an Arctic blast that could hinder the Trump administration’s continuing immigration crackdown and the angry demonstrations over the death of Renee Good, 37.

Local and state officials in Minnesota are anxiously watching the forecast. In daily meetings this week, they have shared information on planned protests and gatherings, news conferences, arrests and unrest. Without exception, the weather is on the list, and though officials are reluctant to say it publicly, they are quietly hoping for a few days of brutal cold.

That could calm residents in a city whose nerves are collectively frayed, city and state leaders reason, and make it harder for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to make arrests and disrupt life in Minneapolis any further.

But bundled-up residents who have been protesting for days said that a seriously cold stretch would play only to their advantage.

“I want it to get cold,” said Chris Foreman, a military veteran who has joined protesters outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, just outside Minneapolis, for six days in a row. “People know that a lot of these ICE guys are from the South. They’re coming into a different environment and they’re not used to it.”

On Thursday, Mr. Foreman saw a man in his 60s toss a bucket of water onto the road in front of the Whipple building, where ICE vehicles zip in and out all day.

“What’s the prank you do to your friends in the winter in Minnesota? You throw a bucket of water on their stoop,” Mr. Foreman said. “We’re playing off of the joke.”

Minneapolis is unusually icy — literally — at the moment. Walking on sidewalks is treacherous, as an immigration agent in a viral video learned this week. Patches of black ice on residential streets are sending cars skidding.

Some of the ice is created by protesters: At a demonstration this week, protesters slowly drove a car outside the Whipple building with its hatch wide open, revealing several open jugs rigged to stream water into the street. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said the act could “potentially kill” federal agents by causing them to crash their vehicles.

On Friday afternoon, snow began to fall sideways, pelting pedestrians and bicyclists with big, icy, wet flakes.

Protesters who are originally from Minnesota say that they are ready with the proper winter gear. Standing outside at demonstrations, they wear woolen socks, double layers of long sleeves and tights, and sometimes ski goggles for a little extra warmth or insulated bibs from Carhartt that might look more fitting in an ice fishing shanty.

To avoid taking a nasty fall on an icy sidewalk, many Minnesotans have been wearing crampons or microspikes that strap onto the soles of their boots. At Nicollet Hardware in Minneapolis, protesters have been snapping them up from a display in the front of the store.

There is also the experience factor, a lifetime of acclimation.

“Our bodies are just ready for it,” said Jason Chavez, a City Council member who was born and raised in Minneapolis. “People here in Minnesota are strong and resilient and they know how to take on the weather. They are able to be outside for a long time.”

But Mr. Chavez said he was not rooting for a blizzard or a cold snap. If a snow emergency is declared, city rules require residents to move their cars to allow snowplows to get through, an inconvenience that would force people outside — and perhaps into the clutches of federal agents.

“At the beginning of this, I was like, ‘I hope it snows a lot,’” he said of the ICE crackdown. But now, he added, “I’m not sure if the weather hurts us or helps us.”

Outside the Whipple building on Friday, Jalyn Strain, wearing sturdy boots and a plaid scarf wrapped around her face, walked around with a jug of Dunkin’ coffee, offering it to protesters who needed to warm up. Most people politely declined.

“It’s not that cold yet,” she said, as the snow began to fall and the temperature hovered around 25 degrees. “People are used to being outside, going out and skiing. We’d be outside anyway.”

Jeremy Kalin, a former state representative and lawyer from Minneapolis who used to work outside in the cold, said it takes more than just experience to know how to endure Minnesota in January.

“You have to live through these winters to build the kind of resilience it takes to know how to stomach the cold — and how many layers of clothing go where,” he said, adding that if temperatures plunge further, the early mornings could be especially tough for ICE agents unaccustomed to the cold.

“I doubt they know what’s coming at them,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/nat-minnesota-cold-slip-qpbg/nat-minnesota-cold-slip-qpbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:59:00.528320

Subzero Arctic air headed to the Twin Cities this weekend could quell some of the tension — at least temporarily.","President Trump's threat to deploy federal troops to Minneapolis comes as the city is already in turmoil, with daily demonstrations, school disruptions, and fear running through immigrant communities and beyond amid the government's immigration crackdown.

Why it matters: The unprecedented ICE surge has the hallmarks of an occupation in some neighborhoods, as masked and heavily armed agents drive around in large SUVs, tussle with protesters and observers, and break into people's cars and houses to make arrests.

Driving the news: ""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,"" Trump posted Thursday on Truth Social.

Trump's immigration crackdown is tied in part to allegations of widespread fraud in Minnesota involving Somali residents. According to U.S. Census figures, of the more than 80,000 Somalis living in Minnesota, about 4,200 are not U.S. citizens, per PBS.

A few hours after Trump's post, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) made a ""direct appeal"" to Trump to ""turn the temperature down.""

""Stop this campaign of retribution,"" Walz said in a statement. ""This is not who we are.""

And to Minnesotans, he said: ""I know this is scary. We can — we must — speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That's what he wants.""

The latest: Tensions ratcheted up Wednesday after a confrontation in North Minneapolis, where U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said a federal agent shot a man following an attack with a snow shovel and broom.

DHS' account has not been independently verified.

That followed last week's killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother shot in her vehicle by an ICE officer, bringing global attention to the agency's actions in the city.

Zoom in: Minneapolis' Lake Street corridor — the same area that burned during the 2020 unrest over the police murder of George Floyd, and just a few blocks from where Good was killed — has been an epicenter of ICE activity.

The area's Midtown Global Market is usually a buzzy hub for immigrant-owned businesses and customers, but several vendors have closed shop with their customers afraid to leave home.

Longtime vendor Manny's Tortas is suffering a 40% decline in business, owner Manny González tells Axios. He said it's worse than 2020, and he won't last another month like this.

School districts with big Latino populations are reporting a sharp drop in attendance amid similar fears.

Minneapolis and St. Paul schools are offering remote learning for families who don't feel safe sending their kids outside.

Spanish immersion day care centers have cut their hours and asked parents to keep their kids home if possible.

What we're watching: A massive network of observers is trailing immigration agents around the Twin Cities, standing watch near immigrant businesses and alerting potential ICE targets with whistles and car horns.

These observers have recorded agents repeatedly kneeing a detainee in the face and dragging a woman from her vehicle as she said she was trying to get to a doctor's appointment, among other clips that have gone viral nationally and beyond.

By the numbers: Homeland Security says it has arrested 2,500 people in Minnesota since Nov. 29, including 13 gang members.

A Fox 9 analysis showed that 103 of those arrested are violent criminals. DHS has not said how many have been deported, charged or released.

Between the lines: While raids are happening across the Twin Cities area, life remains mostly normal in many neighborhoods and suburbs.

What's next: An abnormally warm January so far has made both immigration enforcement and protesting more tenable.

“It feels a bit like a pressure cooker over here,” Eau Claire City Council President Emily Berge said Friday in an interview with WPR’s “Wisconsin Today.”

The Trump administration has surged some 2,000 federal agents in the Twin Cities, with plans to add 1,000 more. Many of them are agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and protests have broken out over their aggressive enforcement tactics. Those protests have intensified since an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Macklin Good in her car last week. On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said an ICE agent had shot a man in the leg in an enforcement action.

In Wisconsin border communities including Hudson, many people make daily commutes to the Twin Cities for work, shopping or recreation. A Hudson resident who asked to remain anonymous over safety concerns said she has been involved in organizing to support protesters in the area. She said people all across the metro area have been making sure protesters and organizers have rides, are fed and are safe.

But the psychological effects of the unrest have been widespread. She said some of the students at the elementary school where she teaches are afraid to come to class.

“It is just the saddest thing to see tiny children who are just starting school have this kind of fear and uncertainty,” she said.

That echoes the experience of others in immigrant communities.

“Everybody is terrified,” immigration attorney Marc Christopher told “Wisconsin Today.” “They see what’s been broadcast on TV. They see the indiscriminate arrest of people. … The level of fear and anxiety in our immigrant community is off the charts.”

And Berge, who is also a Democratic candidate for Congress, said people in the Hmong community worry they will be targeted for being members of a minority group, regardless of legal status.

“Even though they’re American citizens,” she said, “they have to bring their documents with them, their passports or ID with them when they leave the house — even to walk their dog or bring their kids to school.”

In an interview with PBS Wisconsin’s “Here and Now,” GOP U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson placed the blame for the unrest squarely on Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other politicians he said were “inciting people to resist and obstruct justice.”

Local officials respond to rumors, concerns about ICE enforcement

With attention focused on Minneapolis, unfounded rumors of ICE agents staging or planning large-scale operations in Wisconsin spread widely on social media. Officials in Baldwin, Wausau and Stevens Point all told WPR that social media chatter was false.

Still, officials in many communities have felt pressure to review policies and plans should federal immigration enforcements scale up.

The Hudson School District this week sent a message to parents reiterating its visitors policy and how district officials work with law enforcement.

Superintendent Nick Ouellette said there is not a separate policy for ICE, nor any branch of law enforcement.

“We’re not taking a political side of the argument,” Ouellette said. “We’re just saying this is how we handle things.”

If a district employee is approached on school property by a federal agent requesting information about a student or the student’s family, district policy and federal law prohibit the employee from sharing any student information without a valid judicial warrant or subpoena.

This includes confirming whether a student is enrolled at the school or within the district.

The Hudson School District serves about 5,000 students. Ouellette said it does not keep records of students who are not U.S. citizens.

The federal judge handling the case, Jia Cobb, is probing whether the Trump administration has violated her court order.","WASHINGTON — The first year of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House was defined by clashes with the judiciary branch, as the president and his administration pushed forward with an aggressive immigration agenda.

In the past year, the Trump administration has aimed to drastically change immigration policy in the United States, including by stripping millions of immigrants of their legal status and attempting to redefine the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.

The moves have often run directly against the judiciary branch.

Federal judges briefly stalled the Trump administration’s plans to deploy the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, for immigration enforcement. They also blocked the invocation of an archaic wartime law to expel immigrants from the country — a move that raised concerns, all the way up to the Supreme Court, about skirting the due process rights of immigrants.

In response, the president for the last year frequently battled with federal judges, such as in June, when the Justice Department sued all judges in federal court in Maryland over a two-day pause in deportations to ensure due process rights for immigrants.

Trump also fixated on certain judges that put his policies on hold, such as the District of Columbia’s Chief Judge James Emanuel Boasberg.

Boasberg blocked the Trump administration from deporting certain immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and ordered the return of deportation flights that, despite his restraining order, still landed at a brutal prison in El Salvador.

Trump’s singling out of Boasberg in late March, and calling for his impeachment, prompted a rare rebuke from conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.

But the Supreme Court has often handed wins to the Trump administration on numerous emergency appeals. The high court allowed for deportations of immigrants to countries they have no ties to, referred to as third-country removals, and allowed the use of race in immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.

The president has found himself at odds with a range of groups in response to his harsh immigration policy.

A group of Quakers sued the Department of Homeland Security after officials removed a so-called sensitive locations policy that limited immigration enforcement in places of worship.

The Trump administration also faced backlash in its attempt to quickly deport Guatemalan children in the middle of the night, where a Trump nominated judge said the Department of Justice’s arguments for the move “crumbled like a house of cards.”

Out of the dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration, here are the five most significant court cases related to the president’s immigration policies:

Alien Enemies Act

Last March, two deportation planes carrying immigrants removed under an 18th-century wartime law were ordered to return to the U.S. by Boasberg, chief judge for the District Court for the District of Columbia.

But the planes still landed in El Salvador, and 137 Venezuelan men were sent to a brutal prison known as CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The wartime law would apply to any Venezuelan national 14 and older who was suspected of being a member of the Tren de Aragua gang.

Boasberg then spent months probing whether Trump officials defied his order to turn the planes around. Last month, he concluded that the deportations were illegal and carried out in defiance of his order.

The 137 Venezuelan men were eventually released from CECOT last summer through a prisoner exchange. Boasberg determined that even though the men are no longer imprisoned, they still need to be afforded their due process rights and he ordered the Trump administration to propose a way to afford those due process rights.

In the latest major development, last month he directed the administration to create a plan on how to do that, such as providing some form of video interview before an immigration judge.

The Trump administration has argued because of the U.S. military operations to extract Venezuela's president from the county, the situation is fluid, and they cannot provide a timeline for complying with Boasberg's order from last month.

The Justice Department’s most recent filing, from Jan. 12, objects to the court's order to facilitate remote due process hearings, and “given the current political instability in Venezuela, there is a serious risk of intentional interference with remote proceedings.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also submitted a Jan. 12 declaration to the court, saying that “introducing the matter of the disposition of the 137 class members into these discussions at this time would risk material damage to U.S. foreign policy interests in Venezuela.”

He added that the U.S. does not know where the 137 Venezuelan men are.

“Given the passage of time, the U.S. government does not know—nor does it have any way of knowing—the whereabouts of class members, including whether anyone has departed Venezuela or whether the regime subsequently took anyone back into custody,” Rubio said.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia

The wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and longtime Maryland man, cast a national spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

Abrego Garcia’s case has highlighted the Trump administration's appetite for mass deportations. The case started last March in the District Court of the District of Maryland, after Trump officials mistakenly removed Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite removal protections placed by an immigration judge in 2019 because it was likely Abrego Garcia would face violence if returned to his home country.

But in March, Abrego Garcia was placed on a plane, along with Venezuelans removed under the Alien Enemies Act, to the brutal El Salvador mega-prison known as CECOT.

Federal Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return, but the Trump administration took the issue all the way to the Supreme Court, arguing that it could not force another government to comply with the U.S.

The Supreme Court sided with Abrego Garcia, but stopped short of ordering his return.

Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. several months later to face a criminal indictment in Tennessee over allegations of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges, and another federal judge has found cause that the Justice Department brought the indictment in a vindictive move against Abrego Garcia.

Since his return, Abrego Garcia has detailed psychological and physical torture he experienced at CECOT. The Trump administration has also tried to remove him to a country to which he has no ties because of the 2019 removal protections.

Trump officials re-detained Abrego Garcia and have tried to remove him to the African nations of Eswatini, Ghana, Uganda and Liberia, despite Costa Rica’s willingness to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and his willingness to go.

For that reason, Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia’s release from an ICE facility in Pennsylvania and barred the Trump administration from re-detaining him.

She is currently overseeing Abrego Garcia’s challenge to his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal.

A Jan. 14 hearing was the most recent development in Abrego Garcia’s case.

There, Xinis briefly conferred with his lawyers and Department of Justice attorneys regarding the timing of a final order of removal for Abrego Garcia was issued — the question was whether it was in 2019 or January 2025.

The timing of the order of removal could determine whether the Trump administration can re-detain Abrego Garcia for removal. Xinis in December ordered Abrego Garcia’s release, because she determined the Trump administration was unlawfully detaining him and said ICE failed repeatedly to show a final order of removal existed.

Xinis said she plans to make a final decision in Abrego Garcia’s case by Feb. 12.

Birthright Citizenship

One of Trump’s first executive orders he signed on Inauguration Day was ending the constitutional right to birthright citizenship.

Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status. There is a small carve-out for the children born of diplomats.

If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship and it would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.

In response to Trump’s executive order, multiple lawsuits were filed and lower courts across the country have granted preliminary injunctions against the order.

One of the challenges to birthright citizenship, brought by Democratic attorneys general, made its way to the Supreme Court, but the Trump administration asked the justices to weigh in on the issue of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts, rather than the merits of birthright citizenship.

The justices decided on an order that limited nationwide injunctions, such as class action suits.

The merits of birthright citizenship are now before the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear oral arguments in February.

That birthright citizenship case is Barbara v. Trump, which stems from a case in New Hampshire. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction to bar the executive order from taking effect against a class of babies born on or after Feb. 20, 2025. Those children would have been denied citizenship under the president's executive order.

Lawmakers’ Access to ICE Facilities

As the Trump administration continues with aggressive immigration enforcement and detention, one of the few tools Democrats have, as the minority party, is oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

More than 60,000 immigrants are detained across various ICE facilities in the country, and Democrats argue they need access to conduct oversight at the facilities. Under a 2019 appropriations law, any lawmaker can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants.

But after several Democrats were denied access to ICE facilities in July, due to a policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that required seven days notice, a dozen House Democrats sued.

Last month, a federal judge granted the lawmakers' request to stay the new policy by Noem. But after Minnesota lawmakers said they were denied an oversight visit to an ICE facility following a deadly shooting by an immigration officer in Minneapolis, Democrats were back in court Jan. 14.

Noem required a seven-day notice, nearly identical to the policy that initially prompted the suit from Democrats last year.

The federal judge handling the case, Jia Cobb, is probing whether the Trump administration has violated her court order.

Democrats who sued include: Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.

Expanded Use of Expedited Removal

A pillar of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign is the expanded use of expedited removal. The Trump policy allows the removal of immigrants through the interior of the country without an appearance before an immigration judge.

In March, immigration advocacy groups sued the Trump administration over the policy, arguing it stripped due process rights of immigrants.

In August, the District Court for the District of Columbia issued a stay in the policy, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from using it. The Department of Justice appealed, and in September a panel of appellate judges denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the lower courts’ stay.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/abregogarciaaug25.JPG?h=9f66a723&itok=m-qZbdD7,N,,2026-01-16 16:59:23.372204

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officer Brian Palacios shot Keith Porter Jr. late on Dec. 31 at a Northridge apartment complex, according to a sworn declaration submitted by attorney Michelle Diaz in a custody dispute between Palacios’ girlfriend and her ex-husband, which was made public Thursday. The document alleges that Palacios is the shooter “based on information and belief,” citing records and testimony identifying him as an ICE agent who lives in the complex.

A review of court transcripts, proof of service documents and motions related to the custody battle shows Palacios is an ICE agent and confirms that he lives in a unit at the Village Pointe Apartments. The unit number reflects an apartment that is just a short distance from the location where neighbors say Porter was killed.

An attorney for Palacios claimed the child abuse allegations were unfounded and denied that he made any racist remarks. “He acted in self defense and he was being shot at that night,” said the attorney, Stacie Halpern.

No one answered the door at the apartment listed for Palacios on Friday.

Friends and advocates say Porter — a 43-year-old Compton native and father of two — was firing a gun into the air to celebrate the new year on the night of his death.

Tricia McLaughlin, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary of public affairs, initially said a suspected “active shooter” was killed following an exchange of gunfire with an off-duty ICE agent. In her statement, McLaughlin said the agent “bravely responded to an active shooter situation at his apartment complex.”

McLaughlin did not immediately address questions about the agent’s identity and the allegations against him in response to an inquiry from The Times.

Los Angeles police said no one else was injured in the incident. An LAPD spokesman declined to comment.

Jamal Tooson, an attorney for Porter’s family, said in a statement: “Should this individual be confirmed as the person responsible for Keith’s death, based on his deeply disturbing past allegations it is unimaginable that any human being with a conscience on this earth could regard him as a hero.”

A spokesperson for the L.A. County district attorney’s office declined to confirm or deny that Palacios was the off-duty agent responsible for the shooting and said the incident is under investigation by the Justice System Integrity Division, which investigates killings by law enforcement officers.

A meeting of the Los Angeles Police Commission was packed last week with angry activists and residents, many of whom called for authorities to release the ICE agent’s name. Although the names of LAPD officers involved in fatal use-of-force incidents are normally made public within weeks, there is no such rule for federal agencies.

Court records filed last year in the custody dispute repeatedly describe Palacios as an “ICE officer” and “federal law enforcement officer.” An attorney for Palacios’ girlfriend said they lived together, according to a court transcript. The woman’s home address listed in court records is the same as the address for the Village Pointe complex.

The document filed this week sought to temporarily bar Palacios’ girlfriend from seeing her daughter from her first marriage, based on the potential danger posed by the ICE agent’s alleged involvement in the shooting.

“Palacios is presently prohibited by Court Order from being in the presence of the parties’ minor children because of his abusive conduct,” read the filing from Diaz, who represents the ex-husband of Palacios’ girlfriend. “There is a very valid concern that the stress of having shot and killed another man on 12/31/2025, and the ongoing aftermath, will materially and substantially impair Mother’s mental health, and impact her ability to provide a safe and stable parenting schedule for their youngest child.”

In an email to The Times, Diaz said she did not have direct knowledge that Palacios killed Porter but had reached that conclusion based on the evidence laid out in her court filing, including his living arrangements and his employment as an ICE agent. An attorney for Palacios’ girlfriend also confirmed that they lived together and that he is an ICE agent during a February 2025 court hearing, according to court records.

Emails attached to the filing show Diaz asked her client’s ex-wife if Palacios was the shooter, and the woman referred Diaz to a criminal defense attorney.

The fatal New Year’s Eve incident follows several others in recent weeks in which ICE agents have used deadly force against U.S. citizens.

Last week, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good. President Trump and other federal officials have accused Good of obstructing immigration efforts and said she tried to hit Ross with her car, but cellphone video from the scene shows Good was trying to drive away and that Ross shot at her through the driver’s side window. The killing has drawn widespread condemnation and protests; Trump administration officials have staunchly defended the agent and accused Good of weaponizing her vehicle in “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Unlike the Minnesota incident, which was captured on multiple videos, no recordings have surfaced from the confrontation that led to Porter’s killing.

It remains unclear exactly what happened in Northridge around 10:40 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. Palacios was off duty, so there is no body camera video. None of the building’s security cameras captured the shooting either, according to a message from the property management company.

Two law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, told The Times that Porter was found in possession of a rifle. One of those officials said investigators also found evidence of two bullet impacts behind where the agent would have been standing at the time of the shooting, which would support federal authorities claims that he was fired upon by Porter. The official also said the agent identified himself as law enforcement before opening fire.

Porter’s friends and family have argued he was firing a gun in the air to celebrate the new year. Los Angeles police officials have warned people against the practice for years, and doing so is a felony. Still, Porter’s supporters contend that the agent overreacted and should have waited for the LAPD to respond.

Last year, a Los Angeles County judge barred Palacios from being around his girlfriend’s children from a previous marriage in the wake of allegations that he had whipped his biological sons with a belt, according to a transcript of a 2025 hearing.

Through an attorney, the children also accused Palacios of using homophobic slurs and making racist remarks about Black and Latino people, according to a court transcript. Palacios also referred to the children’s biological father as an “illegal alien,” according to the allegations contained in court records.

Omar Escorcia, the ex-husband of Palacios’ girlfriend, told The Times that Palacios routinely made disparaging remarks about Latinos before and after custody hearings, referring to them as “wetbacks.” Palacios’ attorney denied her client made any such comments.

Escorcia also described an alleged incident in which Palacios showed up to a youth soccer game carrying a gun, which was visible to other parents and left several people upset and concerned for their kids’ safety.

“What law enforcement officer who is mindful of gun safety, shows up to a children’s sporting event with a gun that is not holstered, but stuck in their waistband, and they’re holding a toddler?” asked Escorcia’s attorney, Diaz, according to a transcript of a 2025 court hearing. “There are all kinds of red flags here.”

Palacios also threatened Escorcia’s son with violence, according to claims made by an attorney for the minors in multiple court filings.

“If you were my son, I would punch you in the chest the same way,” he told Escorcia’s son after striking one of his own children, the child’s attorney alleged, according to a transcript of a 2025 custody hearing.

The L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services opened an investigation, according to court records, but it was not clear what the results were. A DCFS spokeswoman said she was barred from answering questions about the incident by state law.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7b7b2b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4964x2606+0+351/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa5%2Fe7%2F0ba8c48c4eaba58c9aa9aec75804%2F1536595-me-ice-agent-shooting-northridge-jja-0032.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 19:59:04.990507

As President and CEO Uzra Zeya said: “Over the past year, the authoritarian playbook the United States spent decades fighting overseas has come home to our shores, but it’s on steroids. From weaponizing government power to target perceived enemies and enrich cronies; to vilifying immigrants, LGBTQI+ people, women and girls, and communities of color; to purging nonpartisan public servants and smearing civil society; this administration is mirroring tactics long used by governments in Egypt, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, China, and India, among others.”

What sets the United States apart in this grim pantheon is not only the speed of democratic regression, but its scope. This underscores the urgency and importance of HRF’s integrated, multi-pronged response:

1) Protection Abandoned in Favor of Mass Detention and Deportation

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. asylum and refugee systems have been gravely undermined. People with pending asylum cases have been denied fair hearings, detained far from family and counsel, and in some cases disappeared to third countries. Since late November 2025, all asylum adjudications by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have been unjustifiably suspended, leaving thousands trapped in indefinite limbo. After U.S. refugee admissions reached their highest level in 30 years in 2024, the Trump administration sharply cut and restricted resettlement solely to white Afrikaners from South Africa last year—injecting racial discrimination into a historically bipartisan humanitarian program. HRF is defending resettled refugees with lawful status, including Hmong and Somali families, now being rounded up and threatened with deportation.

The administration has massively expanded detention through H.R.1, pouring over $170 billion into DHS. ICE’s detention budget has grown 265 percent—larger than the entire federal prison system—with capacity to detain up to 116,000 people daily. ICE now holds about 73,000 people, the largest detained immigrant population in its history. HRF co-led opposition to the most extreme proposals in this bill and continues to fight further funding increases.

HRF is documenting the deadly consequences. In 2025, at least 32 people died in ICE custody, with five more deaths in the first two weeks of 2026. We have exposed disappearances from custody and abusive conditions, including severe harm to children at the reopened Dilley family detention facility.

Through HRF’s ICE Flight Monitor, we documented a record 2,138 deportation flights to 79 countries, many carried out without due process. Our joint project with Refugees International—Banished by Bargain: Third Country Deportation Watch—exposed secretive deals concluded by the Trump administration with third-countries that have sent people to at least 14 countries where they face detention, torture, or refoulement. This includes transfers to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison and to maximum-security facilities in Eswatini and South Sudan, sometimes in defiance of court orders. HRF is challenging these practices in federal court, winning protection for individual clients, and working with global allies to condemn and stop these rights-violating schemes. In individual cases, HRF has blocked unlawful removals, including securing asylum for a Jewish Iranian man fleeing persecution, after the U.S. government imprisoned him for nine months tried to send him to multiple third countries.

We are also tracking widespread due process violations, including racial profiling, denial of hearings, and the wrongful detention of hundreds of U.S. citizens, among whom are Native Americans. Immigration judges have been mass terminated, further undermining the capacity and integrity of their role. At the same time, the administration has stripped over a million people of lawful status by ending TPS and humanitarian parole programs, which HRF is challenging in court, including securing an early restraining order blocking mass revocations and family separations.

2) Assaults on Democracy and the Constitution

HRF is advancing democracy protection in the United States through an integrated strategy that combines advocacy, litigation, and civic activism to counter ongoing authoritarian drift. At the core of this work is curbing militarization of U.S. cities and ICE overreach, while defending the right to dissent. We have done so by mobilizing national and local advocacy, elevating the voices of veterans to reinforce civilian control and military nonpartisanship, and pursuing strategic litigation to uphold constitutional protections, including free speech and the right to protest. At the same time, HRF is pushing for legislative reforms that protect freedom of peaceful assembly and free expression, and prevent abuse of military power. We are also developing tools to track and expose attacks on civic space, and building broad, bipartisan coalitions—across civil rights, faith, student, and veteran communities.

3) Repudiating International Law and Alliances

The Trump administration’s unfounded criticisms and attacks on democratic U.S. allies – including threats to illegally annex Greenland by force and interference in legitimate efforts in other countries to hold leaders to account – have encouraged extremists and produced turmoil in transatlantic relations and other alliances that underpin U.S. national security. Drastic funding cuts to civil society in Ukraine and elsewhere have undermined democracy and human rights in favor of kleptocrats worldwide. By flouting international law and turning against treaties and accountability institutions like the International Criminal Court, the administration is tearing down the pillars that uphold stability, peace, and prosperity.

HRF is confronting this authoritarian turn on multiple fronts—as co-counsel in litigation against third-country removals and political targeting, pressing for accountability before international bodies, and mobilizing a global defense of the Refugee Convention and human rights treaties and institutions, including an open letter signed by more than 300 organizations worldwide. We have successfully sued to keep international war crimes prosecutors on the job in spite of U.S. sanctions, and helped human rights defenders at the front lines of the war on Ukraine find alternative sources of funding following U.S. government cuts.

The Urgency of Now

The abuses documented here reflect an authoritarian project taking shape in real time. Immigrants and refugees are being used as test subjects for broader assaults on the Constitution, dissent is being criminalized, and international law is being dismantled piece by piece. HRF is standing at the front lines by defending people in court, mobilizing peaceful opposition that transcends partisan and regional divides, holding governments to account, and building broader coalitions needed to protect democracy at home and human rights around the world. The stakes could not be higher. HRF will continue to meet this moment with the urgency, independence, and resolve it demands.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/placeholder.png,N,,2026-01-16 16:58:56.637864

Here, we summarize some of the most important recent developments in immigration policy on the federal, legal, state, and local levels.

Federal

Trump Threatens to Invoke Insurrection Act in Minnesota Amid Intensified Immigration Operations

President Trump threatened on January 15 to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to ongoing protests in Minneapolis. The Trump administration announced on January 12 that it was deploying approximately 1,000 additional Customs and Border Protection officers to Minnesota, expanding federal law enforcement presence beyond the 2,000 agents and officers already sent to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has described the operation as its largest immigration enforcement action to date. The deployment follows the January 8 fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Response Team officer. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated the additional officers will ensure safe operations for federal agents and warned that individuals who engage in “violent activities against law enforcement” or obstruct operations will face consequences.

Faith communities across the Twin Cities have mobilized in response to intensified enforcement. Congregations have posted “ICE Free Zone” signs at churches and community centers. Volunteers have been blowing whistles and honking horns as alerts when enforcement operations are underway in neighborhoods. Community members are driving immigrants to work to help them avoid public transportation where enforcement actions have occurred. Several hundred people participated in a recent vigil that wound through south Minneapolis near the site where Good was killed, pausing at locations where federal agents had recently detained people. Tensions between protesters and federal agents have been heightened in recent days, with demonstrations occurring on January 14 and 15 outside federal buildings and in neighborhoods where ICE operations have taken place, leading the federal officers to deploy tear gas and other crowd control devices.

Administration Suspends Immigrant Visa Processing from 75 Countries Under Expanded Public Charge Policy

The State Department announced on January 14 that it will pause immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries beginning January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations “utilize welfare resources from American taxpayers at unacceptable levels”. The suspension affects countries including Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Haiti, Somalia, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Thailand, though the department did not disclose the specific percentage of immigrants from these nations who rely on public assistance. The pause applies only to immigrant visas for permanent residency and does not affect nonimmigrant visas for tourists, students, or business travelers, which represent the majority of visa applications.

The suspension follows the administration’s January 1 implementation of Presidential Proclamation 10998, which imposed visa restrictions on 39 countries, and represents a significant expansion of enforcement under the longstanding public charge inadmissibility provision. On November 19, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled “Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility,” outlining major changes to how immigration officials assess whether certain immigrants are likely to become a “public charge”. The proposed rule seeks to rescind the 2022 public charge regulations, which DHS argued were “overly restrictive” and prevented officers from considering all relevant factors in determining whether an applicant might rely on public benefits. The visa pause will continue indefinitely until the State Department completes a reassessment of visa processing protocols.

DHS Announces Termination of TPS for Somalia as ICE Arrests Dozens of Resettled Refugees in Minnesota

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on January 13 that it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somalia, requiring approximately 2,400 Somali nationals with TPS to leave the United States by March 17, 2026, when the designation expires. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that “country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status” and that allowing Somali nationals to remain is “contrary to our national interests”. The termination comes as DHS continues large-scale immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis, home to a significant Somali population, and as the administration has moved to end TPS for 11 countries total, affecting more than 1 million immigrants who will lose their protections by February.

Concurrently, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested dozens of resettled refugees in Minnesota, many of them Somali, and transferred them to detention facilities in Texas. The arrests followed an administration announcement that it would reexamine thousands of refugee cases through new background checks, focusing on refugees who entered legally but have not yet obtained green cards. Immigration attorneys estimate at least 100 people have been detained, including families with children and individuals who had already applied for permanent residency. The detained refugees passed extensive security screenings by the State Department, DHS, and other agencies before receiving invitations to resettle in the United States under the Refugee Admissions Program. Advocates note that while refugees are required to apply for green cards within a year of arrival, some delayed the process due to cost and bureaucratic hurdles, and historically have not faced arrest or deportation for the delay.

Administration Accelerates Installation of Migrant-Deterring Buoy Barriers in Texas

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began installing a 500-mile barrier of large floating buoys in the Rio Grande on January 7, expanding on a controversial Texas strategy that Governor Greg Abbott first deployed in 2023. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced during a January 8 visit to the Rio Grande Valley that 130 miles of the water barrier were already under contract and installation began that day. The floating barriers are part of President Trump’s “Smart Wall” strategy combining steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras, and detection technology, funded through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July 2025.

The buoys are anchored deep in the soil beneath the river to prevent people from swimming under them and include tamper devices to alert agents if someone breaches the barrier. Noem stated the barriers would deter illegal crossings and “save the lives of illegal aliens by deterring them from daring to attempt to cross through this treacherous water.” The expansion has drawn criticism from environmental activists concerned about access to nature along the Rio Grande, while Mexico previously complained that Texas’s original buoy deployment violated water treaties between the two countries. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed Texas’s existing buoys to remain in place while litigation over the Biden administration’s lawsuit against the state moves forward in a lower court.

Senate Hearing Addresses Screening Processes for Afghan Parolees Following D.C. Shooting

On January 14, the Senate Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration and the Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism held a joint hearing examining the Biden Administration’s Afghan parolee program. Inspectors General from the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), State (DoS), and Defense (DoD) testified and identified systemic weaknesses in evacuee vetting, tracking, and post-entry monitoring, noting that many audit recommendations remain open. The hearing also referenced 50 Afghan nationals already in the United States whose records indicated significant security concerns, such as latent fingerprints linked to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or suspected terrorist associations, though the government has not publicly disclosed the current status of those individuals. In addition, DHS acknowledged difficulties tracking approximately 11,700 evacuees who departed military base safe havens without formal coordination.

Despite these concerns, several committee members emphasized that criminal activity among the roughly 77,000 Afghan parolees has been very low overall and reiterated that Afghan US allies should not be punished for the actions of a single individual. The recent shooting of two National Guardsmen was discussed but remains under active investigation, limiting public comment; it was noted that the alleged shooter entered through the parole program and was later granted asylum, and displayed possible indicators of declining mental health. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) also raised allegations that more than $16 million in federal resettlement funds were directed to organizations alleged to have ties to terrorist groups and were not used for their intended purposes; those allegations remain subject to further review but were not substantively challenged during the hearing.

Legal

Minnesota and Illinois File Federal Lawsuits as Prosecutors Resign Over Response to Minneapolis Shooting

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, along with the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, filed a federal lawsuit on January 12 against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), asserting that the mass deployment of federal immigration officers violated the First and Tenth Amendments and the Administrative Procedure Act. The lawsuit claims the surge of agents has undermined public safety, strained municipal resources, and exceeded constitutional limits on federal power. Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a separate lawsuit the same day alleging dangerous tactics and unlawful use of force by ICE and Border Patrol agents. A federal judge denied Minnesota’s request for an immediate temporary restraining order during the first hearing in the case.

Separately, at least six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned on January 13 amid pressure from Justice Department leadership to investigate Renee Good’s widow for alleged ties to activist groups. These resignations followed separate resignations by four top officials in the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, including the chief, principal deputy chief, deputy chief, and acting deputy chief, after division leadership announced it would not investigate the shooting. The resignations come amid reports that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is also examining Good’s possible ties to activist groups as part of its own inquiry into the shooting.

State and Local

ICE Detains New York City Council Employee at Routine Immigration Appointment

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez, a data analyst for the New York City Council, on January 12 while he attended a routine immigration appointment in Bethpage, Long Island. City Council Speaker Julie Menin stated that Rubio Bohorquez had legal authorization to remain and work in the United States until October, cleared standard background checks for city employment, and was doing everything required of him by appearing at his scheduled appointment. The New York Legal Assistance Group filed an emergency habeas petition challenging his detention, which prevented his removal from New York State pending court review.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) disputed the city’s characterization, with spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stating that Rubio Bohorquez entered the United States on a B visa in 2017 which required him to depart by July 22, 2017, had no legal right to remain in the country, was not authorized to work, and had a prior arrest for assault. Representative Dan Goldman (D-NY) countered that the employee had Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and subsequently obtained work authorization, calling DHS’s statement “a bald-faced lie”. City officials stated the employee provided documentation showing he was authorized under TPS and extended his work authorization even after President Trump terminated TPS for Venezuelans.

Much overlooked in the ongoing debate over immigration is the Trump administration’s termination of many different types of temporary protections and statuses. With hundreds of thousands of people losing protections and work authorization throughout 2025, addressing and clarifying these populations is important to understanding the risks faced by these once-protected individuals who no longer are able to legally work and may now face deportation.

In a time when mass deportation efforts threaten large numbers of noncitizens with arrest, detention, and removal, it is increasingly common for political actors to refer to those with temporary statuses as undocumented or “illegal.”[1] Given this circumstance, it is important to clarify that these hundreds of thousands of people have been legally admitted to the United States, and/or have been lawfully permitted to reside in the United States on a temporary basis across multiple administrations.

Recent actions by the Trump administration to end various temporary protections have impacted these group’s lawful presence and exposed these individuals to arrest, detention, and removal. Accordingly, this paper seeks to highlight some of these temporary statuses and discuss how immigrants are impacted when their previously lawful presence has been terminated.

What would qualify as “illegal” immigration?

Whether a noncitizen is referred to as “illegal,” “undocumented,” “unauthorized,” “lacking status,” or another term, this category of individuals without legal authorization continues to be a flashpoint in the immigration debate. While there is currently no single definition of “illegal” in this context, the term generally refers to either 1) individuals who entered the U.S. without authorization or 2) individuals who entered lawfully,[2] but no longer have lawful status.

Historically, most of the individuals in the second category have overstayed a visa. More recently, hundreds of thousands of individuals have found themselves in this second category after obtaining temporary presence that was later terminated by the current administration.

Humanitarian Parole

Humanitarian parole is a temporary and discretionary immigration designation, not to be confused with “parole” in the criminal law context, and is provided under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Humanitarian parole refers to the temporary and discretionary admission of a non-U.S. national into the United States for a limited period of stay. Under the INA, “the Secretary of Homeland Security can use their discretion to parole any noncitizen applying for admission into the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” Grants of humanitarian parole are assessed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on a case-by-case basis. Humanitarian parole is granted for a limited period of time, typically not longer than one year, but the period can be anywhere from 24 hours up to two years. Parole is often used for witnesses in court cases and for emergency evacuation situations because it is discretionary and provides the flexibility needed in an urgent situation.

The Biden administration used humanitarian parole expansively, often in novel and controversial ways. In response to conflicts overseas, the administration admitted tens of thousands of Afghans, as well as Ukrainians, the latter under the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) parole program. The Biden administration also extensively used parole to help ease influxes and processing strains along the U.S. southern border, reducing the number of people coming to the southern border in an irregular manner through various programs like the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) parole program, the Keeping Families Together program, and temporarily admitting asylum seekers and others who utilized CBP One, a mobile app developed to enhance border processing and expedite entry.

In 2025, however, under the second Trump administration, many of these programs were either ended, allowed to lapse, or repurposed. For example, the CBP One app has been rebranded and is now used to help facilitate self-deportation. While humanitarian parole remains in place for discretionary use by the Trump administration, the tool has been used sparingly.

Although the Biden administration’s expansive use of humanitarian parole has at times been controversial, the result of its widespread use and subsequent termination is that hundreds of thousands of people who were temporarily paroled into the U.S. now find themselves without its protections. They are now out of status and at risk of arrest, detention, and deportation.

Temporary Protected Status

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a legal and temporary immigration status that was created in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990 (INA). Under the law, the DHS Secretary is empowered to grant TPS to populations of foreign-born individuals who are unable to safely return to their home countries, due to situations such as military conflicts or national disasters. TPS is granted for six, twelve, or eighteen-month renewable periods, with DHS regularly reviewing country conditions to determine whether to extend or terminate a particular TPS grant based on current country conditions. If an extension is granted, it is done so at least 60 days before the expiration date. The extension decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of country conditions, and TPS is restricted to those who arrived before a “required arrival date.” This means that TPS holders must be physically present in the United States at the time of the TPS grant. Those who arrive in the U.S. after this date are not covered by the TPS grant.

It is important to note that TPS is available to individuals who meet its qualifications, regardless of their prior immigration status. That is, TPS protections apply to covered foreign nationals currently in the U.S. regardless of whether they were lawfully present, overstayed a visa, or entered unlawfully in the first place. However, TPS protection is only temporary – it is not a pathway to legal status or citizenship in the U.S. Longtime TPS holders are not able to adjust to lawful permanent resident status under the terms of TPS, regardless of how long they have resided in the U.S.

TPS can be extended indefinitely, and TPS protections for some populations have been in place for more than two decades. In 2025 and in the beginning of 2026, the Trump administration has regularly terminated or declined to renew TPS for countries including Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Honduras, Haiti, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Burma, and Somali. Some of these TPS terminations have been challenged in court and litigation remains pending as of early 2026. It is expected that most, if not all, of the remaining active TPS grants will be terminated or allowed to lapse by the Trump administration. Nationals from terminated countries represent hundreds of thousands of individuals, some of whom have been in the United States for decades, and who have now lost, or will shortly lose, their legal status – making them targets for arrest, detention, and deportation.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a temporary protection from removal based on the legal concept of deferred action. DACA was first established in 2012 by the Obama administration. It provides work authorization and protection from deportation to certain Dreamers, young people brought to the United States as children, who entered the U.S. before their 16th birthday and have lived in the U.S. since June 15, 2007. DACA must be renewed every two years. DACA does not provide a pathway to permanent lawful status or citizenship.

Since its creation, DACA has faced several legal challenges. Texas and other states litigated against DACA and blocked its expansion, and the first Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to rescind the program, although it was successful in preventing new applicants from being considered for DACA protections. In 2022, in an attempt to fortify DACA, the Biden administration issued a new DACA rule which replaced the 2012 DACA policy. The 2012 DACA policy was subsequently found to be unlawful in litigation. The 2022 DACA rule was also challenged in court and is still being litigated. In 2025, the 5th Circuit issued a decision finding DACA’s protections from deportations to be a lawful application of prosecutorial discretion but providing DACA recipients with accompanying work authorization was inconsistent with federal law. DACA remains largely in place, with courts currently only looking to terminate work authorization for residents of Texas. The case is now back in federal district court, which is expected to issue a ruling on the future of the program.

The second Trump administration has yet to take action to terminate DACA, but the pending litigation has only added to the uncertainty DACA recipients face.

Refugee Protections

As reflected in the Refugee Act of 1980, a refugee is a person outside the country of his or her nationality, who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An individual who receives refugee status is granted permission to permanently resettle in the United States, including a pathway to LPR status and citizenship.

Refugees are lawfully admitted into the U.S. under a formal process involving extensive screening and vetting. The Department of State preliminarily approves a refugee application and then the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency within DHS, makes the final refugee status determination. Refugee status is a temporary status but, unlike many of the other statuses described above, it can lead to permanent status. A refugee is required to wait for one year but is then obligated to apply for LPR status. Refugee status is an indefinite status, so it is not automatically terminated if a refugee does not apply for LPR status. In rare cases of fraud or material misrepresentation during the application process, refugee status can be challenged in a formal proceeding that follows due process. These legal limitations in revoking refugee status have significant implications for the entire process USCIS has announced regarding the re-review of refugees who have already been resettled in the US.

In 2025, the Trump administration scaled back refugee protections. In November, USCIS issued an internal memo calling for the individual review of all the refugees who arrived between January 20, 2021, and February 20, 2025, and halted all processing of green card applications for refugees who entered during the same period. Such actions will have detrimental impacts on the refugee populations in the U.S. and could result in the removal of status for some refugees.

Asylum Seekers

Asylum seekers have garnered significant attention due to the multiple border influxes going back to 2013. Because hundreds of thousands of individuals seeking asylum have been encountered at the border, this status is most commonly part of discussions about border security and unlawful entry.

While most immigration-related offenses are civil offenses, federal law makes unlawful entry and reentry criminal offenses. Violations of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1325 and 1326 carry criminal penalties. Section 1325, enacted in 1929, makes it a misdemeanor for noncitizens to enter into the U.S. at unauthorized places or time, by evading examination, or entering by making false claims. Section 1326, enacted in 1952, makes unlawful reentry a felony, outlawing the practice of attempting to return and reenter the U.S. after being denied, removed, or deported. Violators of these laws risk fines and imprisonment, with § 1326 violations carrying higher penalties. For more than a decade, these two statutory violations have been among the most commonly-prosecuted federal crimes, carrying criminal penalties in addition to negative immigration consequences.

However, the criminal prohibition against unlawful entry and reentry bump up against the statutory right to seek asylum, created through treaty and enshrined in federal law by Congress. An asylee seeks to secure protection from persecution from inside the United States or at a U.S. border. An asylee is an individual who meets the same definition as a refugee – as detailed above.

Under the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution for reason of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion have a right to seek protection from the U.S. government by applying for asylum within one year of their arrival-with limited exemptions. As the statute notes, they may seek protection “whether or not at a designated port of arrival . . . irrespective of such alien’s status.” Under the statute, “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States” may apply for asylum and can do so either at ports of entry, between ports of entry, or after having arrived inside the U.S. Successful asylum seekers become asylees, who can pursue LPR status after one year of physical presence in the U.S. and eventual citizenship.

Under federal law, those eligible for asylum are permitted to remain in the United States to pursue their claims and can receive an employment authorization document (EAD) after 180 days. If denied asylum, work authorization terminates at the time the EAD expired or 60 days after the denial of the asylum application – whichever is later.

In tension with this framework, the Trump administration has placed significant restrictions on individuals seeking asylum at ports of entry and, more recently, halted processing of affirmative asylum claims. These actions, alongside other actions that limit access to humanitarian relief and reduce the validity period of work authorizations, will have a negative impact on current and future asylum seekers.

Relevant to this discussion of lawfulness and status, the intersection of sections 1325, 1326 and 1158 lay out the complex set of protections for those seeking asylum after an otherwise unlawful entry or reentry. In short, while longstanding federal criminal prohibitions exist for irregular entry or reentry into the United States, federal law also allows those fleeing persecution to seek asylum regardless of their status or method of entry. And federal law provides that asylum seekers can remain in the United States to pursue their claims and seek work authorization. As the Trump administration takes steps to limit access to asylum and the duration of work authorizations, the temporary protections afforded to asylum seekers become increasingly relevant to this conversation.

Conclusion

Although they all too often get mischaracterized in the debate over “illegal immigration,” temporary protections and statuses related to humanitarian parole, TPS, DACA, refugees, and asylum afford lawful presence and protections to those who possess them.

Given this context, it is important to consider the role of these temporary protections and statuses and recognize that hundreds of thousands of people have only recently seen, or may soon see, their lawful presence terminated due to current Trump administration policy changes. In many instances, strong policy considerations exist for affording these protections in the first place and removing them without careful consideration leads to significant harm, especially for those now faced with arrest or deportation. Going forward it is essential that policymakers share a common understanding of these concepts in order to finally advance the permanent legislative reforms needed to fix our broken immigration system.

Wax told the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday that the district court improperly relied on Penn’s characterization of “hotly disputed facts” in disciplinary reports about her controversial statements concerning race and defined retaliation too narrowly when it dismissed her claims.

Wax, who is white, sued the university in January 2025, alleging Penn violated her tenure rights in October 2024 when it suspended her from teaching for one year with half pay following an investigation into public statements she made about minority groups that many deemed racist.

Senior U.S. District Judge Timothy Savage in Philadelphia dismissed the case in August, calling her racial bias claims “implausible.”

A Penn spokesperson declined to comment on Wax’ appeal. Wax, who has denied allegations of racism, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. She has previously defended her right to hold unpopular opinions about race and referred to herself as a ""casualty in the culture wars.”

Wax's attorney, Jason Torchinsky of law firm Holtzman Vogel, said he and his client hope the Third Circuit ""see the law the same way we do.""

A social welfare law and policy scholar who has taught at UPenn’s law school since 2001, Wax has clashed for years with administrators. Students and faculty first called for her firing in 2017, after she co-authored a newspaper opinion piece arguing that Anglo-Protestant cultural norms are superior.

The law school in 2018 banned Wax from teaching required first-year courses after she said on a podcast that she had never seen a Black law student graduate in the top quarter of his or her class, and rarely in the top half.

In 2022, Wax wrote a blog post saying the United States is “better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration” as long as most Asians vote for Democrats. UPenn law dean Ted Ruger asked the university’s faculty senate to impose a “major sanction” against her for her statements.

Wax said in her brief to the appeals court that Penn employs a ""race-based double standard"" in disciplinary procedures and academic freedom protections, arguing that she was punished more harshly while the university overlooked similar conduct by racial minorities.

She separately sued the university a second time in Pennsylvania state court in November, alleging the university violated her academic freedom when it sanctioned her over controversial statements about race. That case is on hold pending her federal appeal.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has grown its network of private industry partners since the start of the second Trump administration to support its agents as they storm into cities and detain people they suspect of being undocumented immigrants.

Last year, the ICE agency obligated more money than ever to private contractors, and this year it’s on pace to easily top last year’s record. More than 600 companies have been working with Trump’s ICE, including businesses in nearly every state.

Using USAspending.gov data, Sludge created an interactive map that shows every company in the U.S. that has either entered into a new contract with ICE during the second Trump administration or has been awarded new obligations under an existing contract. Click on the map for details including amounts and contract service descriptions.

Since President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025, ICE has approved contract obligations totaling $5.2 billion. While most of ICE’s contracting dollars go to large prison and technology companies, the agency's network of private-sector partners extends across the country and spans a wide range of industries. Nearly every state is home to ICE contractors, including companies with million dollar-plus contracts that operate out of unexpected locations like suburban neighborhoods or rural areas.

Almost two-thirds of ICE’s spending obligations so far under Trump’s second term have gone to just seven companies. The top recipient has been ​​Albuquerque-based CSI Aviation, ICE’s main contractor for deportation flights, which has received more than $1.2 billion in contract obligations. CSI Aviation, which hosted a rally for Trump days before the 2024 election, has seen its ICE revenue soar since the start of last year—around a 10x increase compared with May, before the passage of the Trump-GOP reconciliation bill.

GEO Group, the largest private prison operator in the country, has received $683.4 million worth of contract obligations since Trump reentered the White House, and another prison company CoreCivic has received $269 million. The companies’ stock prices rose last year under a $45 billion plan in the Trump-signed ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)"" to expand ICE’s detention facilities, and their CEOs cheered their soaring revenue from ICE in August earnings calls. Each contractor bestowed $500,000 to the Trump–Vance inaugural in December 2024 (the former via its PAC), with their executives giving millions of dollars more last cycle to Trump campaign groups.

The Richmond, Virginia-based company Acquisition Logistics has seen a staggering rise in obligated ICE revenue under Trump: nearly $600 million so far. Last year, the small company, which had little record of operating immigration detention centers, won a $1.2 billion Army contract to build what it touted as the largest immigration detention complex in the nation near El Paso, Texas. Owned by a retired Navy flight officer, the company had previously never received a contract award above $16 million.

Three more companies have been awarded nine-figure amounts in ICE contract obligations since the start of last year: Bethesda-based telecommunications company Tribalco ($206 million); Virginia-headquartered conglomerate Akima ($181.7 million), which runs the Guantánamo Bay detention center; and Virginia-based defense contractor MVM, Inc. ($135 million).

Palantir, the MAGA-aligned software and analytics contractor, has received payments from ICE toward $81 million in contract obligations since Trump’s inauguration. Internal ICE materials seen by 404 Media reveal that Palantir is building an app being used by ICE agents, named ELITE, that locates targets on a map-like interface, drawing in data from sources like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Palantir’s overall government contract obligations, including from the Army, Air Force, and other federal departments, jumped to $1 billion last year. Palantir CEO Alex Karp gave $1 million to both the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and the inauguration, and the company reportedly donated to the president’s White House ballroom project. One of the company’s projects with the Army, the Project Maven AI tool, was expanded last year to a ceiling of $1.3 billion through 2029.

Some brand-name companies are keeping up contracts with ICE as the agency has tackled, tased, and shot American citizens and immigrants in what civil rights groups including the ACLU argue is a violation of due process. The New York City-based consulting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP has been given more than $48.8 million in obligated payments from ICE under Trump for services including logistical and administrative support. Dell’s government contracting arm has raked in ICE payments toward more than $25.2 million in contracts for licensing of Microsoft’s “business intelligence” platform Power BI. Media company Thomson Reuters has been awarded $7.5 million for subscription services to law enforcement databases.

The options for Democrats on Homeland Security are all rather bleak.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is halfway home in approving government funding for the current budget year that began Oct. 1 after the Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed a three-bill package.

Now comes the hard part. Lawmakers still must negotiate a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security amid soaring tensions on Capitol Hill after the shooting of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.

Lawmakers are working to complete passage of all 12 annual spending bills before Jan. 30, the deadline set in a funding patch that ended a 43-day government shutdown in November. With the Senate’s action on Thursday, six of those bills have now passed through both chambers of Congress. The measure before the Senate passed by a broadly bipartisan vote of 82-15. It now goes to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.

That recent success would greatly reduce the impact of a shutdown, in the unlikely event that there is one at the end of January, since lawmakers have now provided full-year funding for such agencies as the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Interior and Justice.

Lawmakers from both parties are determined to prevent another lapse in funding for the remaining agencies. The House’s approval of a separate two-bill package this week nudges them closer to getting all 12 done in the next two weeks.

“Our goal, Mr. President is to get all of these bills signed into law. No continuing resolutions that lock in previous priorities and don’t reflect today’s realities,” said Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “No more disastrous government shutdowns that are totally unnecessary and so harmful.”

ICE shooting inflames debate on funding

The biggest hurdle ahead is the funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. The plan was to bring that bill before the House this week, but Rep. Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the decision was made to pull the bill and “buy some time” as lawmakers respond to the Minneapolis shooting.

Democrats are seeking what Rep. Rosa DeLauro called “guardrails” that would come with funding for ICE.

“We can’t deal with the lawlessness and terrorizing of communities,” said DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. “We’re going back and forth with offers, and that’s where we are.”

Trump’s deportation crackdown, focused on cities in Democratic-leaning states, has incensed many House Democrats who demand a strong legislative response. Last week, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good in a shooting that federal officials said was an act of self-defense but that the mayor described as reckless and unnecessary.

Some 70 Democrats have signed onto an effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Others are seeking specific changes to how the agency operates, such as requiring ICE agents to wear body cameras.

“There are a variety of different things that can be done that we have put on the table and will continue to put on the table to get ICE under control so that they are actually conducting themselves like every other law enforcement agency in the country, as opposed to operating as if they’re above the law, somehow thinking they’ve got absolute immunity,” said Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus, which includes nearly 100 Democratic members, formally announced opposition to any funding to immigration enforcement agencies within the Department of Homeland Security “unless there are meaningful and significant reforms to immigration enforcement practices.”

Looking for a solution

Cole said any changes to the Homeland Security funding bill would need sign-on from the White House. He said one possible answer would be to let Democrats have a separate vote on the Homeland Security bill. If passed, it would then be combined with some other spending bills for transmittal to the Senate. Republicans used a similar procedural tactic to get a previous spending package over the finish line in the House.

The options for Democrats on Homeland Security are all rather bleak. If Congress passes a continuing resolution to fund the agency at current levels, that gives the Trump administration more discretion to spend the money as it wants.

Meanwhile, any vote to eliminate funding for ICE won’t stop massive sums from flowing to the agency because Trump’s tax cut and border security bill, passed last summer, injects roughly $170 billion into immigration enforcement over the next four years.

Also, any vote to eliminate funding could put some Democrats in tough reelection battles in a difficult position this fall as Republicans accuse them of insufficiently supporting law enforcement.

• Dismantled or sharply reduced civil rights offices across federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education.","One year after Donald Trump’s second inauguration, a pattern emerges. Across dozens of executive orders, agency memos, funding decisions and enforcement changes, the administration has weakened federal civil rights law and the foundations of the country’s racially inclusive democracy.

From the start, the U.S. was not built to include everyone equally. The Constitution protected and promoted slavery. Most states limited voting to white men. Congress restricted naturalized citizenship to “free white persons.” These choices were not accidents. They shaped who could belong and who could exercise political power, and they entrenched a racial political majority that lasted for generations.

That began to change in the 1960s. After decades of protest and pressure, Congress enacted laws that prohibited discrimination in employment, education, voting, immigration and housing.

Federal agencies were charged with enforcing those laws, collecting data to identify discrimination and conditioning public funds on compliance. These choices reshaped U.S. demographics and institutions, with the current Congress “the most racially and ethnically diverse in history,” according to the Pew Research Center. The laws did not eliminate racial inequality, but they made exclusion easier to see and harder to defend.

The first year of the second Trump administration marks a sharp reversal.

Cumulative retreat

Rather than repealing civil rights statutes outright, the administration has focused on disabling the mechanisms that make those laws work.

Drawing on over two decades of teaching and writing about civil rights and my experience directing a GW Law project on inclusive democracy, I believe this pattern reflects not isolated administrative actions but a cumulative retreat from the federal government’s role as an enforcer of civil rights law.

Over the past year, the president and his administration have taken a series of connected actions:

• On its first day in office, announced the end of all federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, including diversity officers, equity plans and related grants and contracts.

• Shut down or sharply cut funding for federal programs aimed at reducing inequality, including offices focused on minority health, minority-owned businesses, fair federal contracting, environmental justice and closing the digital divide in broadband.

• Warned schools that diversity programs could jeopardize their federal funding, opened investigations into colleges offering scholarships to students protected under DACA – the Obama-era policy providing deportation protection for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children – and signaled that colleges risk losing federal student aid if their accrediting agencies consider diversity.

• Revoked security clearances and access to federal buildings for employees at law firms with diversity policies. The FCC investigated media companies for promoting diversity and threatened to block mergers by companies with similar programs, leading several companies to drop their initiatives.

• Issued a government-wide memo labeling common best practices in hiring, admissions and other selection and evaluation processes – such as compiling diverse applicant pools, valuing cultural competence, considering first-generation or low-income status and seeking geographic and demographic representation – as potentially legally suspect. The memo warned that federal funding could be cut to schools, employers and state and local governments using such practices. Federal prosecutors reportedly investigated federal contractors that consider diversity, characterizing such initiatives as fraud.

• Weakened enforcement against discrimination by ordering agencies to stop using disparate impact analysis. That kind of analysis identifies disparities in outcomes, assesses whether they are justified by legitimate objectives, and intervenes when they are not. The Department of Justice, the EEOC, the National Credit Union Administration and other agencies complied and dropped disparate impact analysis. Because algorithmic systems typically operate without explicit intent, eliminating disparate impact analysis reduces federal agencies’ ability to detect and address discriminatory outcomes produced by increasingly automated government and private-sector decision-making.

• Rescinded an executive order that barred discrimination by federal contractors, required steps to ensure nondiscriminatory hiring and employment, and subjected contractors to federal compliance reviews and record-keeping. This weakened a key mechanism used since 1965 to detect and remedy workplace discrimination.

• Eliminated data used to track inequality, including rolling back guidance encouraging schools to collect data on racial disparities in discipline and special education. The administration also removed data used to identify racial disparities in environmental harms.

• Dismantled or sharply reduced civil rights offices across federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education. About three-quarters of lawyers in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division left.

• Pressured the Smithsonian to remove exhibits about racial injustice, restored Confederate monuments and military base names, and barred schools and teacher training programs from including material the administration labeled divisive, such as unconscious bias.

• Declared English the nation’s only official language, repealed a requirement that federal agencies provide meaningful access to government programs and services for people with limited English proficiency, and prompted the General Services Admininistration and the departments of Justice, Education and other agencies to scale back language-assistance requirements and services.

• Attempted to limit birthright citizenship guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and adopted practices that treat ethnicity and non-English accents as legitimate reasons for immigration stops.

The pattern is hard to miss

Taken together, these shifts have practical consequences.

When agencies stop collecting data on racial disparities, discrimination becomes harder to detect. When disparate impact analysis is abandoned, unfair practices with no legitimate purpose go unchallenged. When diversity programs are chilled through investigations and funding threats, institutions respond by narrowing opportunity. When history and language are recast as threats to unity, truth and freedom of speech and thought are suppressed and undermined.

Administration officials argue that these steps are needed to prevent discrimination against white people, promote unity, ensure “colorblind equality” and comply with a Supreme Court decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions. But that ruling did not ban awareness of racial inequality, or neutral policies aimed at reducing it. Many of the administration’s actions rely on broad claims of illegality without providing specific violations.

The selective nature of enforcement is also telling.

Books about racism and civil rights were removed from military libraries, while books praising Nazi ideas or claiming racial intelligence differences were left untouched. The administration suspended admissions of refugees – over 90% of whom have been from Africa, Asia and Latin America in recent years – but then reopened the refugee program for white South Africans.

One year in, the pattern is hard to miss.

The administration is not simply applying neutral rules. It is dismantling the systems that once helped the U.S. move toward a more open and equal democracy. It is replacing them with policies that selectively narrow access to economic, cultural and educational participation.

The result is not simply a change in policy, but a fundamental shift in the trajectory of American democracy.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/712890/original/file-20260116-56-n2sjl5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C55%2C2239%2C1119&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:33.394058

Dozens of members of Congress gathered in Minnesota to hear on-the-ground testimony and bear witness to how federal agents have menaced Minnesotans in recent weeks, especially Somalis and Latinos. But they also learned of how immigration agents’ actions have hardened Minnesotans’ resolve to fight for their constitutional rights.

Immigration raids are resulting in injuries, idling vehicles left in the streets, abandoned dogs wandering through neighborhoods and destruction of property, testifiers said. Agents are also scanning the streets for Minnesotans of color and asking for their papers.

“People are walking around on the street with their passports. That’s not American. That’s the furthest thing from it,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told the federal lawmakers. “Please take back to your respective constituencies and your colleagues the message of, if you love your own community, do not let this happen in ours.”

Friday’s hearing was not a formal hearing, but the sixth in a series conducted by U.S. House Democrats to highlight the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. The committee also invited both Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. No Republicans attended.

Newly elected St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Laos, told the committee that advisors recommended she carry her passport in case she gets stopped by federal agents. Her’s parents, who are U.S. citizens, are afraid to leave their homes for fear that their “neighbors would tell (federal agents) that that house was an Asian house.”

Trump has used fraud in Minnesota’s public programs to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community and justify sending 3,000 immigration agents to the state.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Minnesota, said many Somali Minnesotans are afraid to send their children to school, and elders are carrying immigration documents to their mosque.

“Do your job. Stand up for the Constitution of the American people. Our lives depend on it,” Hussein said.

Emilia Gonzalez Avalos, executive director of Unidos Minnesota, said the immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota have caused many to distrust the federal government.

“People should not have to worry that an encounter with a masked, armed federal agent could cost them their lives. This is not about whether immigration law exists. This is about how power is exercised,” Gonzalez Avalos said.

A lawsuit filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union alleges immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens. Minnesota and the Twin Cities are also suing the Trump administration to stop the immigration surge.

U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu of California encouraged Minnesotans to keep documenting the unlawful actions of federal agents and noted that the statute of limitations for violations of federal law is five years.

“While this administration may not hold anyone accountable, I guarantee you a future administration will,” Lieu said. “All of us are here today to let the people in Minnesota know that you are not alone, that the Constitution protects you and you are on the right side of history.”

In D.C., Congress is rushing to pass annual appropriations by the end of January to avoid another government shutdown.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan hinted that House Democrats may use the actions of federal agents in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, as leverage in the upcoming budget battle.

“We have passed policies to tell them not to do ICE actions in front of schools, health centers, funerals … but we still have violations,” Tlaib said. “When Speaker (Mike) Johnson says ICE is doing what it was created to do, remember this when the funding comes up next week.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ilhan--scaled-e1768590794467-2048x1331.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:42.340471

Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly.
For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency.
Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them.","The Trump administration frequently uses fear as a weapon, whether stoking it, pledging to shield some populations from it, or endeavoring to inflict it on others. For example, the administration has engaged in what “border czar” Tom Homan describes as a “shock and awe” campaign that has included aggressively raiding communities around the country, shipping some migrants to dangerous prisons, and publicizing these actions through highly stylized videos and memes. The administration portrays its targets as “the worst of the worst,” as “pedophiles, armed robbers, and drug traffickers” whom law-abiding citizens should fear. The government’s own data, however, suggests otherwise. According to Reuters, “some 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation.” Citizens, too, have been swept up in raids. Entire communities thus have been placed in terror by an administration that claims to be protecting them.

The administration also has employed fear-based governing outside of the immigration context, including against the federal workforce. Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, famously said before the 2024 election that a second Trump administration should inflict “trauma” on federal career employees. He explained that when “‘bureaucrats … wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down …. We want to put them in trauma.’” Vought’s wish has come true, with thousands of federal employees chased out of their jobs through a combination of ideological targeting and large-scale gutting of agencies.

Although Donald Trump, Russell Vought, and their colleagues excel at wielding fear as a tool of governance, they did not invent the practice. In his important new book, “The Triumph of Fear: Domestic Surveillance and Political Repression from McKinley to Eisenhower,” Patrick G. Eddington explores several earlier periods in American history during which federal officials and politicians regularly stoked fear against, and instilled fear in, disfavored targets. Eddington, a senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute who has worked as a CIA analyst, focuses his book on the late 19th century to the 1950s. This era encompassed two world wars, the height of the Cold War, and domestic social and cultural upheaval. It also saw the birth of the modern national security state. Eddington draws on extensive archival research to describe and explain the many ways in which fear pervaded the government and politics of the time and was built into the national security state’s DNA.

Although Eddington navigates the era in a mostly straightforward, chronological manner, several themes and subthemes recur throughout the book. As its title suggests, the book’s overarching theme is fear. Eddington underscores this point from the outset, observing in the introduction that “the driving force” behind the developments he studies—principally the government’s “surveilling, penetrating, and actively subverting domestic political activities”—was “fear.” One aspect of that fear is that felt by “executive branch officials, members of Congress, and those on the federal bench—fear that challenges to existing political, economic, or social paradigms would alter the country in ways that would disempower those who benefitted from the status quo.” As Eddington’s subsequent chapters make clear, fear played a still more ubiquitous role in the events of the time. Politicians and officials not only felt fear themselves; they sought to make others afraid—afraid of their own government and of one another.

Beneath this overarching theme lie the details, spanning decades, of the means that powerful actors in the executive branch, in Congress, and in compliant parts of the private sector used to instill and to respond to fear. Because Eddington covers so much ground, I highlight just three such means here, by way of illustration: the growth of the federal government’s surveillance and secrecy capacities; the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ethnicity and nationality; and the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ideology.

The six decades Eddington explores were pivotal for the growth of the U.S. national security state, including the government’s capacities for surveillance and secrecy. With respect to the federal government’s surveillance activities, Eddington illuminates, among other things, the way that its growth was a product of executive initiative as well as congressional, judicial, and corporate enabling. He explains, for example, that the Treasury Department’s Secret Service Division was the dominant agent of domestic surveillance by the early 20th century, and that it went largely unchecked by Congress for years, even after the press revealed that the division had spied on members of Congress at President Theodore Roosevelt’s direction. Roosevelt had ordered the surveillance in an effort to uncover the source of an earlier media story. A subsequent spying scandal did lead Congress to adopt legislation in 1908, restricting the Secret Service Division’s activities to “defeating counterfeiting and presidential protection.” The scandal was a sensational one: The Navy had directed the division to spy on a naval officer at the urging of the mother of a woman with whom the officer allegedly had had an affair. Even after this scandal and subsequent legislation, however, the Theodore Roosevelt administration remained undeterred. It found a way around the legislative bar by creating a new organization: the Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice. It did so by using the Justice Department’s general revenue fund to employ 30 part-time agents, including many veterans of the Secret Service Division. As employees of the new bureau, these agents conducted domestic surveillance that the Secret Service Division was now barred from conducting.

Eddington traces iterations of this pattern—a mixture of executive initiative, occasional congressional pushback, and more frequent congressional cooperation or willful ignorance—throughout the decades that he chronicles. Take, for example, his coverage of the period from the outbreak of World War I in Europe through the aftermath of both the war and the Russian Revolution. In the months following the sinking of the Lusitania, the Wilson administration grew desperate to surveil suspected German agents and their sympathizers in the United States, leading Wilson to authorize a renewed domestic surveillance role for the Secret Service Division. This action “effectively violate[d] the 1908 law” limiting the division’s activity, and Eddington “found no evidence that Congress was informed” of it. Shortly after the United States entered the war, however, Congress authorized some forms of surveillance by the division—for example, to conduct investigations under the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Food and Fuel Control Act. By the end of World War I, “the [division] and [the bureau had] full-fledged domestic spying counterparts in the [Army and Navy].”

These capacities were augmented through cooperation by corporate and civil society actors. For example, the Bureau of Investigation arranged for the major telecommunications providers to transmit copies, without warrants, of “incoming and outgoing telegrams of individuals or organizations of interest to investigators.” The bureau also partnered with a private organization comprised of volunteer investigators, “the American Protective League,” whose members were known to go rogue, “masquerading as [Secret Service] agents” and “in one case ordering a Des Moines, Iowa, resident to raise the American flag over his home.” Eddington also describes how these surveillance precedents and capabilities continued to be utilized after the war’s end. In the postwar years, “the Bolshevik threat [became] the prime, but not exclusive, focus.” As I elaborate below, other targets would include Japanese Americans and critics of their internment.

Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly. Although secrecy is frequently used to bypass congressional and judicial oversight, Congress and the judiciary enabled executive secrecy in significant ways. For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency. The Espionage Act of 1917 bars a much wider range of speech, including information disclosures. Eddington stresses the Espionage Act’s importance in this regard, focusing especially on its use to punish anti-war speech and other forms of dissent throughout World War I and the Cold War. The Supreme Court also enabled broad prosecutorial discretion to punish anti-establishment but not imminently dangerous speech in a well-known line of cases beginning in 1919. The Supreme Court’s decisions in those cases, including Schenck v. United States, Debs v. United States, and Abrams v. United States, endorsed a narrow view of speakers’ First Amendment protections, particularly during wartime.

Eddington also emphasizes the significance of the state secrets privilege and the Supreme Court’s 1953 decision recognizing it in United States v. Reynolds. The privilege may be invoked by the federal government in litigation where “‘there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.’” A significant problem with the ruling, as Eddington points out, is its suggestion that in some cases judges should not require disclosure even to themselves, for in camera inspection. The danger of abuse that this creates is evidenced in the aftermath of Reynolds itself. The case originated as a tort suit brought by a group of widows whose husbands, all civilian engineers, had perished in a crash of an Air Force B-29 bomber. The Air Force successfully resisted disclosing the accident report on the basis that it contained state secrets, and the Supreme Court refused to order even in camera disclosure. Decades later, the accident report, which by then had been declassified, was obtained by the grown child of one of the passengers. She learned that the Air Force had lied so many years ago. The report contained no state secrets but instead revealed negligence on the part of the Air Force.

The scope of the surveillance and secrecy capacities that Eddington explores is breathtaking, but their greatest significance lies in their wielding by government actors as tools to target disfavored groups and ideas. Among the most notorious instances of ethnic or nationality-based targeting was that perpetrated against Japanese Americans during World War II. Eddington’s research sheds new light on the extent of the government’s surveillance of Japanese Americans before and during World War II, and on the gulf between the information it gathered and the lies it told to stoke fear against, and justify the mass internment of, this group. For example, John Franklin Carter, whom President Franklin Roosevelt had secretly commissioned to perform intelligence work for FDR directly, concluded that “98 percent of the Japanese in Hawaii were ‘loyal to the U.S., and that those who are not’” had already been identified by the Navy and the FBI. In a cover letter forwarding one of his reports to FDR, Carter wrote, chillingly and prophetically, that his investigator “‘feels that the Japanese are more in danger from the whites than the other way around.’”

Eddington also highlights the political considerations that led FDR not only to support mass internment for Japanese Americans, but to prolong it. For example, he cites a memo that FDR wrote to two officials, explaining his view that “it would be a mistake to do anything drastic or sudden” in ending internment. FDR “wanted to determine ‘how many Japanese families would be acceptable to public opinion’ for relocation back to the West Coast” and suggested distributing Japanese Americans around the United States to “avoid[] public outcry” on the West coast. As an intelligence report that Eddington quotes acknowledged, the violent public backlash that did follow Japanese Americans’ return home stemmed both from “racial hatred” and “from whites who [did] not want to resume business competition with returning Japanese.”

Surveillance was also used to target ideological dissenters, including those who criticized the federal government’s actions against Japanese Americans. As Eddington recounts, “Such was the fate of a young Army private and aspiring singer-songwriter named Pete Seeger.” Seeger, who had a Japanese American fiancée (who eventually became his wife of nearly 70 years), wrote to the California American Legion to protest its passage of a resolution calling to deport all Japanese and Japanese Americans from the United States and to bar citizenship for all Japanese descendants. The Legion forwarded Seeger’s letter to the FBI, which eventually built an intelligence file on Seeger that ran more than 1,700 pages.

Seeger’s case is just the tip of the iceberg of ideological surveillance and punishment in American history. Eddington chronicles much of this history, ranging from the Secret Service Division’s targeting of anarchists and the nascent Bureau of Investigation’s surveillance of socialists, through the Palmer Raids, Espionage Act prosecutions of socialist and other speakers, “anti-red” scares stoked by members of Congress and the executive branch, and the efforts across many presidential administrations to surveil and target participants in the civil rights movement.

Among the many striking elements in Eddington’s account of ideological targeting is the way that politicians stoked and wielded fears of socialism and communism to aggrandize themselves and to intimidate and control rival politicians. Eddington recounts, for example, that the House Select Committee on Un-American Activities had lost public and institutional support by 1944 but was revived and turned into a permanent committee after Rep. John Rankin, partnering with the American Legion, launched a public campaign to support it. The resuscitated committee went on to “do massive professional, personal, and political damage to thousands of individual Americans and domestic civil society organizations.” The prospect of committee “witch hunt[s]” also led some congressional Democrats, including Rep. Jennings Randolph, successfully to pressure President Truman to employ harsh internal loyalty measures throughout the executive branch. Eddington also gives their due to those administration members, representatives, and other high-profile figures who resisted the “anti-red” race to the bottom. Eleanor Roosevelt, for one, was a voice of conscience, writing to Truman: “I feel we have capitulated to our fear of Communism, and instead of fighting to improve Democracy, we are doing what the Soviets would do in trying to repress anything which we are afraid might not command public support.”

Eddington’s book is a rich, important contribution to our understanding of a pivotal time in American history, and of the growth of America’s national security state in particular. Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them. As he notes in his introduction, however, “The Triumph of Fear” is extraordinary in its scale and in its use of primary as well as secondary literature to illuminate its subject. And Eddington is particularly effective in his choice of stories to highlight and to connect to the book’s larger theme of fear-based governing and politics.

My one criticism of the book is that Eddington occasionally adds a conclusory statement about legality to an otherwise compelling, evidence-based description of government activity. For example, in discussing proposed legislation to criminalize certain disclosures about cryptology, Eddington states: “This was not an encroachment on the First Amendment—it was a proposal to destroy it in the name of national security.” Having written a great deal myself on the law of national security disclosures and the First Amendment, I am extremely sympathetic to Eddington’s point. It is, however, a complicated legal topic to which justice cannot be done in a single sentence. That said, my quibble is a small one because statements like the quoted one make up a tiny part of an otherwise excellent book. I mention this quibble only because the book on the whole is so strong and because its strength stems largely from its intensely research-driven approach.

Because Eddington does, admirably, let his exhaustive research do most of the talking, he does not step outside of the studied time period to explicitly draw comparisons to the current administration. But readers will do as they please, and I suspect I will not be alone in seeing parallels between some of the terrible developments that Eddington chronicles and events now taking place on a regular basis in the United States. Readers likely will see not only parallels but roots, as today’s abuses are enabled in part by the growth in the national security state that Eddington recounts. Eddington’s book would still be an important contribution even if it were not so lamentably relevant to current events. But in this moment, especially, I am grateful for Eddington’s work. The historical context that it provides enables us better to understand what it is that we are living through.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/surveillance-camera-(1).png?sfvrsn=1f2a75b9_5,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:45.944466

The “ICE Out of Virginia” protest, organized by Party for Socialism and Liberation-Virginia, Indivisible RVA and 50501 Virginia, lasted over an hour and halted traffic on Broad Street.

“We are here today to make a loud stand against ICE and this regime that has not represented us, has used our tax dollars to rip our neighbors away from us, has murdered our neighbors in front of us,” said Reed Baldwin of the PSLVA as he addressed the crowd gathered in the pouring rain at Walker Plaza.

The local protest was one of roughly 500 organized nationwide as part of the “ICE Out for Good” weekend, with demonstrations in nearly 1,200 cities and towns after the shooting, according to national organizers.

Trump administration officials have said the shooting was an act of self-defense after Good allegedly tried to hit the agent with her vehicle. Multiple videos contradict that account.

Residents, organizers and speakers from several Richmond groups joined national criticism of the fatal shooting and the Trump administration’s explanation of the incident. They also raised concerns about ICE’s treatment of immigrants.

“They tell us that the immigrants are the problem, that they’re criminals, that Black and brown people are the problem, that trans people, that transkids are the problem,” said Richmond Defensa organizer Violeta Vega. “They tell those lies to our face every day to justify this violence, to justify this terror.”

Demonstrators also criticized decades of increased federal spending on immigration enforcement and border patrol, saying needs such as housing, health care and education have been overlooked.

Speakers encouraged protesters to prepare for a general strike and to organize in defense of themselves and their communities. They also urged people to call on local and state officials to end operations connected to ICE and to reconsider Richmond’s use of Flock Safety cameras, which some activists criticized as surveillance tools.

“The majority of the progress that has been made, it’s been made by, every single day, ordinary working-class citizens,” Te’Shaun Cleckley said. “So, honest to god, I think it’s up to us.”

In a statement, Mayor Danny Avula reiterated that the city and Richmond Police Department do not coordinate with ICE on deportations. He did not say whether the city’s contract with Flock Safety cameras would be ended, instead stressing that the department uses the technology with transparency and for public safety.

Organizers said they plan a peace vigil outside the Virginia War Memorial on Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday and a walkout on Tuesday in response to Good’s fatal shooting and federal immigration policies they oppose.",https://epmgaa.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2026/01/15/No_ICE_march_1.2026_JTH_RFP-16.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 15:58:35.310371

One lawmaker warned the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to preserve records for an investigation into the administration’s deadly use of force.

The dozens of leaders staged an “accountability” hearing at the state capitol in St Paul into Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) actions as demonstrations continued to spread in the city and elsewhere, along with sporadic clashes with federal officers nine days after Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The US president has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to justify sending in troops to quell the protests, which have remained largely peaceful despite the occasional skirmishes and continued arrests.

The gathered lawmakers and officials on Friday labeled their special panel hearing “Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s deadly assault on Minnesota”.

Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who has been singled out for vitriolic and racist public attacks by Trump, decried aggressive treatment of residents, including US citizens, and their vehicles by federal agents and officers.

“Dozens of US citizens have been taken into custody and released hours later. We have yet to see charges materialize, because in nearly all instances, no federal charges are possible,” Omar said, adding that others were taken from their own vehicles.

“Abandoned cars with broken windows have become a normal sight of daily life in the Twin Cities,” she said, referring to the adjacent cities of Minneapolis and St Paul.

As ICE raids and traffic stops have increased, families are being torn apart.

Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, was present and has spoken out against the FBI shutting state and local investigators out of the examination of Good’s killing. And Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, attended, having told ICE to leave and citing the federal government’s aggressive approach as making the city less safe.

From further afield, the Washington state congresswoman Pramila Jayapal attended and chaired Friday’s panel. Jayapal sits on several House committees dealing with immigration and the constitution and she is the senior whip of the Democratic caucus and chair emerita of the progressive caucus.

“The Trump administration has targeted and terrorized people of all immigration statuses, including US citizens, violating constitutional rights and court orders, destroying our existing immigration system and eroding all of our rights,” she said.

Quoting a Minnesota Star Tribune editorial suggesting that the state was “under siege”, she added: “Battalions of armed federal agents are moving through neighborhoods, transit hubs, malls and parking lots and staging near churches, mosques and schools. Strangers with guns have metastasized in spaces where daily life should be routine and safe. It feels like a military occupation.”

Kaohly Her, the mayor of St Paul, was pointed. “We are ground zero for Trump’s war on America, a war on our democracy, on our freedoms, on our rights as Americans,” she said.

Scrutiny of ICE operations has increased in the wake of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Good as she attempted to drive away from ICE agents last Wednesday while they ordered her out of the car and tried to open the door. She was not armed and addressed officers calmly, but the White House quickly called her a domestic terrorist.

Protests have escalated over her killing, and the exclusion of state investigators from an FBI inquiry. Polling released by the American Civil Liberties Union on Friday showed that 71% of voters supported an independent investigation into the shooting, and 84% said people had the constitutional right to observe and document ICE activity in public.

ICE agents, meanwhile, have continued to engage in violent confrontations with residents, protesters and those being sought as allegedly undocumented or otherwise in violation of immigration law. Many of the more violent encounters have been caught on video and posted to social media.

The Minnesota congresswoman Betty McCollum condemned “Trump’s abuse of power”.

“High school students have been thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed on their own school grounds, and it’s happening right here, right now,” she said.

“The actions of these agents, which are totally unprofessional and illegal, create great harm and fear. Secretary Noem, you better be preserving your documents unaltered, because you are going to be held to testify and you will be subpoenaed.”

Jayapal called for ICE to cease its surges.

She said: “This pattern of reckless, even lethal use of force cannot continue, and we will do everything in our power to hold the administration accountable and stop this lawlessness.

“What is happening in Minnesota is a pattern that is dangerous to every single person in America, because if they can erode the rights of some, they can do it to you. No one is safe.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7037090a3b78f8d083558f5614c9731c65f6676/471_0_4713_3771/master/4713.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c8f3ba3b001cb08e89b7ea92b5e8d8f",N,,2026-01-16 13:58:27.586390

According to KPD, the Hays County Sheriff’s Office (HSCO) got a call from ICE requesting “ambulance assistance for an individual being detained by federal authorities” at about 7:45 a.m. KXAN reached out to HSCO, and it said it did not assist with this incident.

KXAN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for more clarity on the detainee’s condition and will update this story if a response is given.

KPD said it was notified of the request and responded to the 19000 block of I-35 Frontage Road in Kyle to support emergency medical services (EMS).

The department said EMS took the detainee and ICE personnel.

The post also notes the department and the city of Kyle were “not involved with this operation or any other ICE operations,” and that they were not made aware of any operations prior to the dispatch request.

Hays County Judge Ruben Becerra said the county wasn’t notified of ICE operations prior to this incident.

“Historically, when federal agents come into our jurisdiction, we have a courtesy call communication with local officials so that we understand what’s going on in our communities,” Becerra said. “When we reach out consistently for information [Homeland Security] do not give us anything back except for a generic response.”

Myles Martin, an organizer with Mano Amiga Action, an advocacy group that supports immigrants and marginalized families in Hays and Caldwell counties, said recent events are heightening fears.

Martin pointed to cases like the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of 37-year-old Minnesota woman Renee Nicole Macklin Good by an ICE deportation officer in Minneapolis as examples fueling those safety concerns.

Amid a massive expansion in immigration detention in 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) dramatically reduced the number of facility inspection reports by the agency’s Office of Detention Oversight (ODO), one of its key tools for tracking detention conditions. There was a 36.25% decline in ICE detention facility inspection reports published in 2025 compared to the previous year, according to an analysis of data pulled from the agency’s facility inspections website. These inspections assess whether facilities meet a range of detention standards, including those that shape fundamental health and safety conditions for the people being imprisoned there, including whether detention facilities are providing adequate health care, monitoring and effectively preventing suicide, providing quality food, and maintaining habitable shelter.

A Father’s Quest for Justice Finds Resolution After 13 Years

Craig Stingley had no legal training, no big-name lawyer or civil rights advocate by his side. Yet for 13 years, he refused to accept that the judicial system would hold no one responsible for the killing of his 16-year-old son, Corey. The quest for justice dominated his life. He gathered police reports, witness statements and other evidence in the Dec. 14, 2012, fatal incident inside a Milwaukee-area convenience store. The youth had tried to shoplift $12 worth of flavored malt beverages at the shop before abandoning the items and turning to leave. That’s when three men wrestled him to the ground to hold him for the police. The medical examiner determined that he died of a brain injury from asphyxiation after a “violent struggle with multiple individuals.” The manner of death: homicide.

“It is not about esoteric issues of international law. It is about real people, real stories and a real group of human beings. The Rohingya of Myanmar. They have been targeted for destruction,” Dawda Jallow told ICJ judges. The Gambia brought the case accusing Myanmar of breaching the 1948 Genocide Convention during a crackdown in 2017. Legal experts are watching closely as it could give clues for how the court will handle similar accusations against Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, in a case brought to the ICJ by South Africa.

A DHS official told NBC News earlier this week said that Ross suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the fatal shooting incident.
First responders removed Good from the scene on the suburban street in Minneapolis.
ICE officers left the scene at 11:20 a.m., and the FBI arrived at 11:31 a.m.","Official reports have shed light on the moments immediately after Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis last week, and how first responders and bystanders reacted to the shooting, which has led to nationwide protests.

According to police files, fire response reports and transcripts of 911 calls released to NBC News in response to a public records request, Good was still alive when a Minneapolis Fire Emergency Medical Services team reached her.

The reports paint a vivid picture of the chaotic moments following the Jan. 7 shooting, which has become a definitive moment in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“Every use of force incident and any discharge of an ICE firearm must be properly reported and reviewed by the agency in accordance with agency policy, procedure, and guidelines,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to NBC News. “All shootings are initially reviewed by the appropriate federal, state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency principally charged with first response to the incident.”

McLaughlin added that “following a review of the incident by the appropriate investigative agency, ICE will conduct an independent review of the critical incident.”

The fire response report states that during the incident, Good had “apparent gunshots” to her chest, forearm and face, and was “unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity.”

Footage from the incident, including cellphone video taken by Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot Good, shows her at the wheel of her Honda SUV interacting with ICE officers before the shooting.

In the footage, cars can be heard honking, sirens wail and protesters are blowing whistles. Ross is seen walking around the front of the car to face Good. “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” Good is heard telling Ross. Another officer near the SUV tells Good to get out of the car.

In the footage, Ross turns to face the front of the SUV as Good’s wife, Becca Good, appears to say, “Drive.” Good turns the steering wheel to her right, away from the officer, as she begins to drive.

In Ross’ cellphone footage, he can then be heard shouting what sounds like “whoa” and firing. Multiple shots can be heard in the video. The view of his phone camera jerks around, points up to the sky and captures a glimpse of his masked face before it levels out and shows the SUV accelerating down the street.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the officer was acting in self-defense and accused Good of being a “domestic terrorist,” without citing evidence. The FBI is investigating the shooting.

Good, 37, was an American citizen and a mother of three.

Noem said that Ross was treated in a hospital for injuries he sustained in the incident and was released soon after. The emergency services logs say he was first taken to a federal building. A DHS official told NBC News earlier this week said that Ross suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the fatal shooting incident.

The officer walked away from the scene unassisted.

First responders removed Good from the scene on the suburban street in Minneapolis. More than 3,000 federal agents are carrying out ongoing operations in the city, federal government figures say, to root out local corruption and arrest people suspected of serious crimes or immigration breaches.

Eyewitness video shows paramedics treating Good on the sidewalk and carrying her away on a stretcher as people on both sides of the road look on.

Medics applied a tourniquet and gave her CPR before she was taken to a local hospital by ambulance, the fire report said. Hospital staff stopped resuscitation efforts at 10:30 a.m, just under an hour after the shooting.

The first 911 calls were received at 9:38 a.m. CT and the agent who fired the fatal shots left the scene at 10:04 a.m., the police report shows.

The 911 call logs include one caller who told dispatchers: “They just shot a lady. Point blank range in her car…. She’s f------ dead.”

Another caller said, “I had to walk away because I have young kids, and ICE is everywhere over there.”

An unidentified 911 caller said, “ICE fired two shots through her windshield into the driver. She tried to drive away but crashed into the nearest vehicle that was parked.”

In one 911 call, which apparently came from a Homeland Security officer who identified himself only as “Philip” and said, “Requesting EMS assistance and local law enforcement.”

“We had officers stuck in a vehicle, and we had agitators on the scene,” Philip continued. The dispatcher asked him for a description of the shooter, but he said: “No, I don’t have any of that stuff, we’re just trying to get assistance (INAUDIBLE).”

Large parts of the 911 call logs have been redacted and blacked out, with the hidden portions labeled “Law Enforcement.”

The police report also noted that “agitators” were cutting crime tape, slashing tires, throwing snow and ice “at federal agents but not at MPD” officers at various points. Border Patrol deployed pepper spray about 20 minutes after the shooting, the police report said.

Bovino ‘not credible’ during recorded testimony

What we know:

The FOX 9 Investigators reviewed hours of depositions, body camera footage and court filings which involve Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino’s conduct and leadership during Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago last fall.

As part of a civil lawsuit filed against DHS, Bovino was questioned under oath during which Judge Sara Ellis described him as ""not credible.""

""Bovino appeared evasive over the three days of his deposition, either providing ‘cute’ responses… or outright lying,"" Judge Ellis said in her written ruling in November.

DHS did not respond to requests for an interview or questions about Bovino.

Who is Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bavino?

The backstory:

Bovino gained notoriety last year when the Trump administration launched its immigration enforcement operations in major cities last year, including Los Angeles and Chicago.

He has since been seen on the ground in Minnesota as the federal government deploys thousands of immigration agents in the state.

Last week, Bovino stood alongside Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as she defended the ICE agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Bovino: ‘All uses of force have been more than exemplary’

Dig deeper:

Videos from Chicago show Bovino deploying tear gas at a crowd of protesters in Chicago despite being told by one of his own agents that it wasn’t necessary.

""If you need to deploy gas, deploy [expletive] gas,"" Bovino said in the video.

During recorded depositions a month later, Bovino admitted that he ""did not give a warning"" prior to deploying tear gas canisters toward the public.

Yet, Bovino insisted during his testimony that ""all uses of force have been more than exemplary.""

Judge Ellis also found Bovino was ""outright lying"" at times during his depositions, including when he was questioned about a video that shows Bovino clearly using physical force against a protester.

Bovino repeatedly denied tackling the man to the ground despite the video showing otherwise.

Bovino 'lied multiple times' about why he deployed tear gas

Why you should care:

On another occasion, the judge found Bovino ""lied multiple times"" about why he deployed tear gas on a crowd in Chicago in October, indicating at first that he was hit in the head by a rock. That claim was echoed by DHS in a social media post.

However, during the three days of testimony, Bovino gave conflicting accounts of why he deployed tear gas.

At one point, Bovino acknowledged that a rock ""did not hit me in the head, but it did almost hit me."" On the final day of testimony, Bovino said he ""was mistaken"" and that he deployed tear gas canisters before a rock was thrown at him.

Yet to be seen: Will an appeals court ruling hold any more sway over the administration than the lower court’s?","In a case affecting hundreds of immigrants held at one of the largest detention centers in the country, a Washington state federal judge expressed frustration with Tacoma Immigration Court’s refusal to abide by a September ruling holding many detained people are entitled to bond hearings and ordered notice be given to them of their rights.

Since the September judgment, more than 100 detained immigrants — “left with no other recourse” — have filed habeas corpus petitions in federal court seeking bond hearings, said U.S. District Court Judge Tiffany Cartwright in her Wednesday ruling. Many more, particularly those without lawyers, may remain detained because they don’t know about the September order and how they can use it to petition U.S. District Court.

A habeas petition alleges someone is being unlawfully imprisoned or, in this case, detained for days, months or years in jail-like conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. Within the 1,575-bed facility (soon to have 1,635 beds) sits an immigration court for those detained there.

This week’s ruling is the latest development in a class-action case that raises separation-of-power questions and tests the ability of courts to limit federal actions under President Donald Trump. In one corner sits a U.S. District Court, which belongs to the independent judicial branch of government. In another, sits an immigration court, part of the executive branch and subject to the authority of the U.S. Department of Justice.

Immigration judges can be fired at will, as demonstrated by dozens of firings last year, including one in Seattle.

The class-action suit involving the Tacoma Immigration Court arose over a practice, beginning in 2022, of denying bond hearings to many immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally, or in legalese “without inspection.” Bonds, like bail in criminal court, allow an individual to remain free while a case is pending.

Espousing a novel legal theory, some of the court’s judges — including now interim U.S. Attorney for Western Washington Neil Floyd — have said such immigrants are subject to mandatory detention under a section of immigration law dealing with “applicants for admission” to the U.S. Immigrants who crossed the border unlawfully at any time in the past still count as applicants for admission, even if they have lived in the U.S. for decades, the Tacoma immigration judges held.

The Trump administration turned that theory into national policy with a Department of Homeland Security memo last July, followed by a September ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals. The board also belongs to the executive branch.

Cartwright in September ruled that the novel legal theory contradicts long-standing practice and common understanding of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Hundreds of other federal courts have ruled similarly, including a California court whose November ruling applies nationally.

Yet, Tacoma’s immigration judges have continued to say they lack jurisdiction to issue bonds in these cases, though sometimes they have stipulated “alternative” bonds they would set if they could.

Floyd, who may not keep his job in the U.S. attorney’s office long due to a seeming move by federal judges to oust him, told The Seattle Times last fall that Cartwright’s September ruling is a nonbinding “advisory opinion.” He pointed out that the so-called “declaratory” ruling does not directly order the government to do something — prohibited in certain class-action immigration cases — but states what the law is as the judge sees it

Cartwright called the notion of her previous ruling as merely advisory flat-out wrong. Quoting case law, she wrote this week: “A declaratory judgment is a real judgment, not just a bit of friendly advice.”

And a Congressional law allows a court to take steps to facilitate compliance, according to Matt Adams of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a nonprofit legal advocacy group representing plaintiffs in the class-action suit. As Tacoma’s immigration judges failed to change their stance, the nonprofit made several requests to Cartwright, most of which she granted this week.

She ordered that, within five days of arriving at the Northwest ICE Processing Center, immigrants charged as inadmissible to the U.S. be provided with a notice informing them they may have a right to a bond hearing because of the class-action ruling.

The notice explains that those who could be helped by the ruling include immigrants who were not apprehended upon arrival in the U.S., are not subject to mandatory detention because of certain criminal charges or convictions and are not in expedited removal proceedings that bypass judges.

The notice also says that because the Department of Homeland Security and the Tacoma Immigration Court are not following a federal judge’s ruling, those affected will likely have to file a habeas petition. For help, it refers people to the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

Cartwright additionally ordered the federal government to provide the nonprofit group with a weekly list of people who received the notice, along with their ICE arrest reports.

Adams said the new order would allow his organization to help more people but called it a stopgap measure that is not likely to change the Tacoma Immigration Court’s practice of denying bond hearings. “I think they’ve already dug in their heels, and at this point, they are going to continue to defy the law,” he said.

He added he’s heard reports of immigration courts around the country denying bond hearings despite the national ruling out of California.

The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which lies within the Department of Justice to oversee immigration courts around the country, said it does not comment on litigation-related matters.

The Trump administration has appealed Cartwright’s initial ruling on bond hearings to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 4.

In his lengthy September order, Young ruled the government’s arrest and removal of international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views violated their free speech rights.
He said Noem and Rubio misused their office’s “sweeping powers” to “strike fear” into noncitizens to curb their protected political speech.
“The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the President of the United States have a fearful view of freedom,” Young said.
“A view that defines the freedom here in the United States by who’s excluded.","A Boston federal judge said he was struck by a “breathtaking” conspiracy involving Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to violate international students’ free speech rights as the court outlined a remedy.

Concluding in his view “one of the most important cases” ever heard in the court, Judge William G. Young railed against the cabinet secretaries’ participation in the government’s efforts to target non-citizen students and scholars for their protected pro-Palestine or anti-Israel speech.

“The big problem in this is: It’s that the cabinet secretaries and ostensibly the president of the United States are not honoring the First Amendment,” Young said, extending his review of his findings to the White House.

Young declined to hit the government with a broad injunction, but he said he would issue an order that would give noncitizen members of the academic groups that sued the government a “conclusive presumption” that any change to their immigration status was in retaliation for being involved in the litigation.

The government could overcome that presumption by providing evidence that it had appropriate reason to adjust the immigration status of the person who was a member of the American Association of University Professors or the Middle East Studies Association when it sued in March, the judge said.

In his lengthy September order, Young ruled the government’s arrest and removal of international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views violated their free speech rights. He said Noem and Rubio misused their office’s “sweeping powers” to “strike fear” into noncitizens to curb their protected political speech.

Young indicated he had no interest in an injunction that would have him indefinitely police the government’s conduct and is barred by the US Supreme Court’s limits on universal injunctions from applying the ruling beyond the parties here.

He told Department of Justice lawyer Paul Stone that the proposed order largely aligned with the government’s request for “care and restraint” in ordering any remedy. But the court’s inventive solution didn’t prove sufficient.

Stone said federal immigration law stands as a bar to such an order, which would trample on the system of administrative immigration courts that Congress put in place to adjudicate removals. The Department of Justice lawyer said the government’s position is no remedy should be entered.

Young sharply retorted: “The Secretary of Homeland Security in concert with the Secretary of State, approved by the President of the United States to violate the Constitutional rights of these people and you’re telling me there is no remedy? I respectfully disagree.”

He said the burden the order would put on the government was designed specifically because the “cabinet secretaries have failed in their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution.”

Young, in his 47th year on the bench, opined on what caused the government to end up running an “unconstitutional conspiracy to pick off” noncitizen academics to chill their political speech.

“The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the President of the United States have a fearful view of freedom,” Young said. “A view that defines the freedom here in the United States by who’s excluded. It seems obvious from this record, these high officials for one thing are seeking to exclude everyone. It’s erroneous.”

The judge said he expects to issue the remedies ruling on Jan. 22.

Gavin Newsom said he does not support abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a week after a federal agent fatally shot a woman in Minnesota, sparking mass protests and reigniting a national debate about how to rein in the agency.

“I disagree,” Newsom told conservative pundit Ben Shapiro on a Thursday episode of the “This Is Gavin Newsom” podcast. Shapiro asked if Newsom agreed with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who earlier this week tied the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies to a massive budget increase for ICE: “I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this…You get screwed over to pay a bunch of thugs in the street that are shooting mothers in the face.”

Last week, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good as she drove away from an anti-ICE demonstration in Minneapolis. Federal officials defended the shooting, claiming without evidence that Good was a “domestic terrorist” and had tried to “ram” Ross with her car.

Multiple eyewitnesses, videos, and local and state officials disputed that, and residents have protested as federal agents have continued to pour into the liberal city, conducting traffic stops, detaining people and shooting an additional person after Ross shot and killed Good.

The shooting has sparked questions about whether lawmakers should make it easier to sue ICE agents after they kill someone. Six federal prosecutors resigned after the U.S. Department of Justice directed them to investigate Good’s widow. President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would let him use military troops to quell protests.

In July, Congress passed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” which allocated ICE an extra $75 billion in funding to escalate deportation efforts while cutting federal funds for states that went towards public benefits like health care and food assistance.

Democrats plotting a political comeback in the November midterms have tried to capitalize on the public’s growing negative perception of ICE while avoiding the pitfalls of the unsuccessful “Defund the Police” movement that ignited in 2020 following the death of George Floyd.

Newsom, who has teased a potential run for president in 2028, told Shapiro he supports “comprehensive immigration reform,” but did not offer more specifics, a vague stance he has maintained throughout his political career.

As mayor of San Francisco, Newsom required police to report undocumented children charged with violent crimes to ICE. He later said in 2018 it was a regrettable compromise to protect San Francisco’s sanctuary city status following a high-profile shooting in which Edwin Ramos, an undocumented Salvadoran gang member, shot and killed a family of three after mistaking them for rival gang members.

Newsom says he supports California’s sanctuary status

Newsom told Shapiro he supports maintaining California’s sanctuary status, which means the state does not cooperate with investigations into undocumented residents.

The movement dates back to the 1980s, when cities like Berkeley welcomed Central American asylees fleeing civil wars in countries like El Salvador, where the U.S. supported a military dictatorship.

Newsom cited research showing sanctuary cities are not more violent than non-sanctuary cities: “I think it’s important to establish, because it’s not well established, sanctuary jurisdictions have lower crime rates than non-sanctuary jurisdictions. So this notion that it somehow increases crime is also, I think, contradicted on the basis of the facts.

”He also boasted to Shapiro that California cooperates with ICE to prosecute “dangerous criminals,” and that he has vetoed “multiple” legislative efforts to further limit state cooperation with the agency.

“When it comes to the issues of violent criminals, when it comes to felons, people that are being released from the largest state system in the United States of America, California cooperates,” Newsom said.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/hpzud5/picture308136835/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/PARAMOUNT-3-LA%20(1).jpg,N,,2026-01-16 13:58:57.390610

According to a Minneapolis fire department incident report obtained by the Guardian, along with police records and 911 transcripts, paramedics arrived at the scene at about 9.42am on 7 January and found Good “unresponsive” in the driver’s seat of her car, “with blood on her face and torso”.

The report states that paramedics removed Good from the car and reported that she was “unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity”.

According to the report, paramedics identified two “apparent gunshot wounds” to the right side of her chest, another apparent gunshot wound “to the patient’s left forearm”, and a “possible gunshot wound with protruding tissue on the left side of the patient’s head”. The report also notes that she had “dilated pupils” and blood “discharging” from her left ear.

According to the report, responders moved Good down the block “for a more workable scene, better access for ambulances, and separation from an escalating scene involving law enforcement and bystanders”.

Paramedics began performing chest compressions and applied a tourniquet to Good’s left arm before transporting her to a nearby hospital. The report states that CPR was continued during transport.

Upon arrival at the hospital, the report states that paramedics continued chest compressions while hospital staff “assumed airway and ventilation responsibilities”. According to the report, “resuscitative efforts were discontinued at approximately 10.30am”.

The Guardian also obtained transcripts of multiple 911 calls related to the shooting. Records show that the first call to 911 came in at about 9.38am on 7 January, roughly one minute after the shots were fired.

In one call, a caller told the dispatcher that there were “a bunch of ICE agents on 33rd and Portland, they just shot a lady point-blank range in her car”.

When asked if the woman had been shot, the caller responded: “She’s fuckin’ dead. They fuckin’ shot her.”

Later in the call, the same caller said: “There’s 15 ICE agents and they shot her, like, ’cause she wouldn’t open her car door.”

Another caller reported witnessing “fired shots into a car” and told the dispatcher that “ICE fired shots into her windshield.”

Asked whether anyone had been hit, the caller, who told the dispatcher that they were now across the street, responded: “Yes, bleeding.”

Describing the incident, the caller said: “I saw an ICE officer fired two shots through her windshield into the driver. She tried to drive away but crashed into the nearest vehicle that was parked.

“I saw blood all over the driver, then the partner who was trying to provide assistance,” the caller said.

The dispatcher responded that help was on the way.

A separate 911 call appears to have come from someone who said they were calling on behalf of federal officers at the scene, requesting assistance from EMS and local police.

“We had officers stuck in a vehicle and we had agitators on scene,” the caller said, adding that there had been “shots fired by our locals”.

The caller said that they did not have a description of the shooter, and they were “just trying to get assistance”.

When asked by the operator where they were getting the information from, the caller said it was “from our local joint operation command center”, adding that “the officers on scene are relaying to us to get in contact with you guys”.

The dispatcher told the caller that “we have help on the way”.

The documents viewed by the Guardian also include communications among law enforcement and emergency personnel.

At 9.47am local time, a message read: “NEED CROWD CONTROL AND AREA BLOCKED OFF.”

Three minutes later another message stated, “CROWD NEEDS TO BE MOVED BACK,” followed seconds later by: “CROWD GETTING HOSTILE.”

At 10.04am, roughly 15 minutes after the shooting, messages stated that the “AGENT THAT FIRED IS NO LONGER ON THE SCENE” and “HAS BEEN TRANSPORTED TO FEDERAL BLDG”.

At 10.07am, a message read: “CONTACT WHO IS IN CHARGE OF FEDS AND HAVE THEM LEAVE SCENE.”

At 10.20am, a message described the crowd as “GETTING MORE AGITATED” and, several minutes later, the communications stated that there was a “CROWD OF 20” attempting to “SURROUND OFCRS”.

At 11:01am, the communications stated: “ICE BEING SURROUNDED.”

And then at 11.20, it stated that “ALL ICE AGENTS HAVE LEFT SCENE” and about 18 minutes later it added: “CROWD CALMED DOWN NOW THAT ICE IS GONE.”

Trump administration officials, including Donald Trump himself, have claimed that the agent who shot and killed Good, identified as Jonathan Ross, acted in self-defense, and they have accused Good of trying to “run him over”.

That account of the incident has been widely disputed by local and state leaders in Minnesota as well as by eyewitnesses. Video footage of the shooting appears to show Good’s vehicle turning away from the officer as he opened fire.

Good’s killing has sparked protests in Minneapolis and in other cities across the US. And on Thursday, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota in response to the protests against federal immigration enforcement operation, as Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, a Democrat, urged demonstrators in Minneapolis to be peaceful amid escalating tensions there.

Last week, our country bore witness to the depths of ICE’s cruelty. We saw a masked agent shoot into a vehicle that was driving away, murdering Renee Nicole Good — a mother and American citizen.

This week, here in New Jersey, a high school student in Morristown was doing his family’s laundry when he was taken by masked and armed agents. In the same ICE sweep, a Morristown father was snatched on his way to pick up food for himself and his 6 year old daughter Annabella. His daughter was found walking the streets by herself and crying looking for her father hours later. The following day, ICE agents pulled Warren residents from their cars.

New Jersey has to do more to protect our communities from a rogue immigration enforcement agency that violates people’s constitutional rights. And if we’re looking for a roadmap, we don’t have to look far.

During the first Trump administration, an immigrant rights movement blossomed in New Jersey, finding a strong partner in Governor Phil Murphy. We won 10 pro-immigrant laws in Murphy’s first four years, and we became a state where immigrants could move freely, go to college, get occupational licenses, and have access to a lawyer. Basically, anything a state could do to protect immigrants, we did it, and it made New Jersey a safe and welcoming place for all.

Now, the stakes are even higher, with an emboldened Trump administration and his paramilitary force that shows no regard for the law or basic human rights.

New Jersey is one of the most diverse states in the nation, and immigrants are an essential part of our social and economic fabric. Immigrants make up almost a third of the state’s workforce and bring in billions in tax revenue. More than four out of every ten children in the state have at least one immigrant parent. And as the murder of Renee Nicole Good showed us, immigrant or not, no one is safe when ICE comes into town.

At this moment, families all across New Jersey are feeling the pain of ICE’s attacks. Our state has the most ICE detention beds on the entire East coast, and the Department of Homeland Security is looking to expand into the military base in Fort Dix and a warehouse in Roxbury.

Over 6,000 New Jersey residents have been detained and separated from their families since Trump took office a year ago, held in filthy conditions with no access to adequate food, medical care, legal help, or hope. In 2025 alone, 32 people have died in ICE custody, including Jean Wilson Brutus, who died at Delaney Hall in Newark.

This violence, damage, and destruction will only get worse. The DHS budget will grow to $170 billion this year, which is bigger than most countries’ militaries. ICE is increasingly using AI and surveillance technology to track people through their phones and their license plates. ICE is going door-to-door in neighborhoods, pushing their way into private homes and committing blatant civil rights violations. They are arresting US citizens and immigrants alike without warrants.

ICE cannot be trusted on our streets or in our communities, and New Jersey has to step up.

In his final days as governor, Governor Murphy has the opportunity to do just that. There is a package of immigrant protection bills on the governor’s desk that would keep our communities safe and cement his legacy as a champion for fairness and opportunity for all.

The Safe Communities Act (A6308/S5036) provides guidance to sensitive locations like schools, hospitals, and libraries — creating state level model policies to protect safe access to essential services for all New Jerseyans.

The Privacy Protection Act (A6309/S5037) limits when government agencies can collect immigration status information, and restricts the Motor Vehicle Commission from sharing data with ICE — protecting the privacy of millions of New Jerseyans from federal overreach.

Finally, A6310/S5038, which limits local law enforcement from aiding and abetting ICE’s abuses, would codify and strengthen the protections Governor Murphy himself oversaw seven years ago.

As he did during the first Trump administration, Governor Murphy must once again meet the moment and sign these bills into law. Given the escalating violence at the hands of ICE — and the threats yet to come — there is no other choice.

‘No judicial warrant’

What we know:

U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Bryan found that the arrest of Liberian immigrant Garrison Gibson violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

The judge ordered Gibson's immediate release from ICE custody, as the arrest was conducted without a judicial warrant.

Gibson was arrested last weekend in his north Minneapolis home when armed federal agents used a battering ram to bust open the family’s front door. The agents had only administrative paperwork, not the required judicial warrant to breach private property.

""To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G.’s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant,"" wrote Judge Bryan in his nine-page order. ""This arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. For this independent reason, Garrison G.’s detention is unlawful, and the Court orders his immediate release.""

Arrest caught on camera

The backstory:

Cameras captured the chaotic scene as armed federal agents broke into Gibson's home.

His loved ones streamed the incident live on social media, demanding to see a judicial warrant that would have allowed the entry. But the immigration enforcement officers on scene only presented administrative paperwork.

Gibson's attorneys immediately filed a habeas petition in federal court, leading to the judge's ruling.

Under immigration supervision for 15+ years

Dig deeper:

According to court filings, Gibson is a 38-year-old Liberian citizen, who has a final immigration removal order dating back to 2009.

But he was living under immigration supervision in the United States for more than 15 years with a past drug conviction that has been cleared from his record.

His attorney says Gibson had just checked in with ICE officials approximately two weeks prior to his arrest and had another meeting on the calendar at the end of the month. In his order, Judge Bryan added that Gibson’s compliance with immigration officials included ""submitting to ankle monitoring.""

The other side:

In a statement to the FOX 9 Investigators earlier in the week, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin referred to Gibson as a ""criminal illegal alien from Liberia"" with a lengthy rap sheet that included robbery, drug possession with the intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft. She promised, ""This criminal will remain in ICE custody pending removal,""

However, in his Thursday ruling, Judge Bryan found that ""Garrison G. has no criminal record.""

Gibson released from ICE custoy

What's next:

Judge Bryan gave ICE and the Department of Homeland Security until noon on Friday to release Gibson.

His family says, Gibson had been locked up in the Freeborn County jail in Albert Lea for the last several days. The judge also ruled that Gibson’s legal team is eligible to seek attorney’s fees and costs incurred in fighting for his release under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

CBS initially published the account about officer Jonathan Ross on X, formerly Twitter. About 30 minutes later, the network followed up with another post, containing a link to an article by two correspondents that similarly cited “two US officials briefed on his medical condition”.

The report, which was not extensively covered by other news organizations, drew an immediate response on social media from critics who questioned the network’s sourcing – and whether it aligned with the Trump administration’s preferred focus.

But there was also internal skepticism at the network about the report, according to emails viewed by the Guardian. It was met with “huge internal concern” by some, one CBS News staffer said. Others viewed the conversations as standard editorial discussions.

Before the original report was published, a medical producer at the network suggested in an email to colleagues that “it would be helpful to ask what type of treatment he received”, and whether the officer received surgery or any other type of procedure.

In another email, an executive expressed skepticism about the broad nature of the medical diagnosis, and what it actually entailed. “I’m no doctor, but internal bleeding is a very broad term and can range in severity,” wrote CBS News senior vice-president David Reiter.

“A bruise is internal bleeding. But it can also be something serious,” Reiter continued. “We do know that the ICE agent walked away from the incident – we have that on camera.” (The network’s story noted that “videos from the scene showed Ross walking away after the incident”.)

The network’s top editor, Bari Weiss, expressed a high level of interest in the story on an editorial call on Wednesday morning, according to staffers who listened.

“There was big internal dissension about the ‘internal bleeding’ report here last night,” the CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said. “It was viewed as a thinly veiled, anonymous leak by [the Trump administration] to someone who’d carry it online.”

“Felt to many here like we were carrying water for the admin’s justifying of the shooting to keep our access to our sources,” said a second network staffer, who was also not authorized to comment.

In a statement, a CBS News spokesperson said the network “went through its rigorous editorial process and decided it was reportable based on the reporting, the reporters, and the sourcing”.

CBS, which labeled its story as an “exclusive”, was not totally alone on the story. The ABC News live blog published a two-paragraph update repeating the claim and citing “multiple US officials familiar with [Ross’s] medical condition” – but noting that the officials “didn’t provide more details about the medical condition”.

Other news organizations, including NBC News and the New York Times, also made brief mentions of the claim. Fox News, which published a full story, cited a confirmation from the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin – though it acknowledged that “the extent of the bleeding … was not immediately clear”.

The Guardian has not independently confirmed the report.

Since Weiss took over as editor-in-chief in early October, the network has faced accusations of favoritism toward the Trump administration. CBS has been controlled since last year by Paramount Skydance, the media conglomerate heavily bankrolled by the tech billionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a friend of the president.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2f66fbaa8db4492db4d61bc41a9a5c6975bbbab/0_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7dea27b9e854ac35a9713ababba6612",N,,2026-01-16 12:59:18.250298

Britain Rodriguez, 31, a resident of Orange County, said he was standing at the bottom of some steps with other demonstrators when federal officers above opened fire at them, hitting him in the face.

“I remember hitting the ground and feeling like my eye exploded in my head,” he said.

In a video his girlfriend shared with The Times, Rodriguez can be seen on the ground, holding his face as he screams in agony before demonstrators escorted him from the area.

“I can’t see, I got shot in the eye, I can’t see,” Rodriguez says before noticing blood on his hand. “I’m bleeding.”

Rodriguez and his girlfriend, Ale, who declined to give her last name, said the officers gave no warning before firing at them. She said she was hit in the chest with a less-lethal round but was not injured.

“That’s when I started yelling at them,” she said. “I’m like holding a sign that says, ‘Stop kidnapping my neighbors’ and a candle; I am no threat to any of [those] guys.”

She said after getting shot she heard her boyfriend screaming.

The video suggests Rodriguez was struck at the same time that 21-year-old Kaden Rummler was hit in the face. Rodriguez can be heard screaming in the background just as Rummler falls to the ground.

In a statement released by Rummler this week and read by a member of the social justice organization Dare to Struggle, which organized one of the protests that day, he said doctors found pieces of plastic and glass in his skull as well as metal in his stomach lining, and pulled a piece of plastic “the size of a nickel” from his injured eye.

Rummler said a piece of metal got lodged millimeters from his carotid artery, and doctors were unable to remove some of the shrapnel from his skull.

He said the DHS officers did not call paramedics right away and at one point pushed his face into a pool of his own blood.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, played down the injury and denied the allegations in statements to The Times this week.

“This is absurd,” she wrote. “DHS law enforcement took this rioter to the hospital for a cut and he was released that night.”

McLaughlin said “a mob of about 60 rioters threw rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement officers.” She said two officers were injured but did not say how or what their injuries were. She said two people were arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer and disorderly conduct.

“This was a highly coordinated campaign of violence where rioters wielded shields,” she said. “Make no mistake, rioting and assaulting law enforcement is not only dangerous but a crime.”

Videos of Friday’s incident shared on social media do not reflect McLaughlin’s version of events.

In Santa Ana, hundreds gathered that night to protest the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a Minnesota mother of three, and the Trump administration’s mass deportations. Some were there to speak out against police brutality in general. Protesters marched in the downtown area chanting, “ICE out of O.C.,” and held up signs that read, “No more raids, keep families together” and “Stop the deportations.”

An earlier protest started at 3 p.m. and was organized by Dare to Struggle, according to Connor Atwood, a member of the group. Atwood, who was present, said the scene turned chaotic as the protest began to wind down and the crowd dwindled.

One video shows demonstrators throwing orange traffic cones at the federal officers, who were standing guard outside the entrance to the Santa Ana federal building.

Rodriguez, his girlfriend and other demonstrators said the cones never came close to hitting the officers. They said there were no bottles or rocks thrown and they saw no one holding shields.

A spokesperson for the Santa Ana Police Department said the only physical confrontation by protesters they were aware of that night was the tossing of orange cones at the federal officers.

The video cuts to three DHS officers approaching the group before one tries to take a young person — identified by friends as Skye Jones — into custody, prompting at least three demonstrators to try to intervene. As one officer struggles to apprehend Jones, two others fire less-lethal rounds at the crowd, hitting one woman in the leg and Rummler in the face.

The video shows Rummler dropping to the ground, holding his face as the crowd retreats. An officer then drags him by the hood of his jacket. Rummler appears to be choking, grasping at the jacket around his neck as blood pours from his left eye.

The clash outside of the federal building is part of a number of controversial confrontations that sparked nationwide protests and raised concerns about the use of violence by federal immigration agents.

Santa Ana Mayor Pro Tem Benjamin Vazquez said he was troubled by what took place outside of the federal building on Jan. 9 and called the federal officers’ actions “deplorable.”

“Shooting any kind of projectile into somebody’s face could lead to death,” he said.

Vazquez said it appears the agents did not try to de-escalate the situation or attempt to go inside the building where it would have been safer.

“The building is a fortress, it’s got thick concrete walls,” he said. “It’s clearly built to take on a simple signs, water bottles, even rubber cones.”

“There was no need for them to come out of the building,” he added. “The violence doesn’t match the protests.”

Sitting on his living room couch this week, Rodriguez said doctors told him the projectile that hit him in his eye damaged his iris, cornea and lens. He developed a cataract too.

On a small table, sealed in a Ziploc bag, were pieces of the projectile he suspects he may have been hit with. The pieces appear to be part of a round plastic pellet that was filled with a pinkish powder.

Rodriguez doesn’t know how much of his vision, if any, he’ll be able to get back. He said doctors told him he’ll require surgery to remove the cataract before they can determine that. He said he’s been unable to work or drive.

Rodriguez works at an after-school program in Orange County and supervises third graders. He said he drives a school van to drop students at their homes or stops, but now he may not be able to do that.

The injury has altered his life as a working artist, making it difficult to read, write and paint. He said distinguishing some colors on the palette has been challenging.

“The first day when I tried to paint was frustrating,” he said. “ “I couldn’t distinguish between brown and purple for a little bit.”

Rodriguez said he’s gone through a mix of emotions since the shooting. He hopes he’ll get to thank the man who provided medical care to him before his girlfriend drove him to the hospital. He feels sad that Rummler lost vision in his left eye too. And he said he’s angry that people are being harmed and that their constitutional rights are being violated by federal authorities.

“All of America should be outraged right now, you know, we should all be very upset at minimum,” he said. “Because as far as I’m concerned, I was doing something legitimate and for a legitimate reason, you know, like a civilian was murdered by somebody who seemingly cannot get prosecuted and more than likely won’t get prosecuted, which is why I was out there.

“When I heal up, I’m gonna be back out there, protesting against this, because this makes me sick. This is not the country that I want to live in.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d5f2c5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1586x833+0+241/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F74%2Fbb7ee68645d18d488f104409868a%2F1537835-me-santa-ana-protester-shot-in-face-ajs-04.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:57.485024

On Thursday, Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, the leader of the Gathering Place, an Evangelical Latino congregation in Orlando, said he’s also hearing from his members and other Chaplains that there’s a heavier presence of ICF in communities, along with arrests.

“Detentions have risen,” he said. “(Chaplains) have said, many of those people are immigrants.”

Salguero was joined by a room full of faith leaders from Central Florida, advocating for the safety of immigrants in their communities.

“We call for due process. The human and civil rights of immigrants should be respected. We believe in their human and civil rights. They should do all things with due process,” he said.

The impact of more ICE arrests can best be seen at the Orange County Corrections Department. According to a new report, the average daily population of inmates arrested by ICE without any other local charge, or arrested by another agency, increased by 930% from Dec. 2024 to the end of 2025.

Arrests have increased recently as well, with a 33% increase from November to December.

“They are not criminals. They have not committed a crime other than they got entangled in a very broken immigration system, and they are coming in and being booked into Orange County jail,” said District 1 Commissioner Nicole Wilson, who was present at the Thursday press conference.

Commissioner Wilson noted the uptick in arrests and also repeat bookings made.

“These repeat bookings occur when an inmate is held for 72 hours, transferred to ICE custody, and subsequently returned, because they get to restart that 72-hour hold. So we're essentially being used as a detention facility,” she said.

On Thursday, Democratic Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost posted on social media about reports of increased ICE activity in parts of Orange County, urging residents to remember their rights.

“We’ve also received reports of heavy ice activity at certain hotels in the area, as well,” Frost said. “They have made pretty large hotel reservations in surrounding hotels, as well.”

Central Florida Public Media has not independently verified those claims.

During the gathering on Thursday, Salguero stated that his church has provided information in both English and Spanish on how to respond if there is an immigration action in a sensitive location. He is also advocating for peaceful protests against current ICE policies.

“We do not want to see any replication of what's happened in Minnesota and Chicago and elsewhere,” he said. “For pastors, life is sacred. That means the life of immigrants. The life of law enforcement, but also the quality of life of our community.”

Pastor Sarah Robinson leads the Audubon Park Covenant Church and joined Rev. Salguero and other leaders on Thursday.

“Stepping up and saying loud and clear and definitively, ‘we evangelicals, we see what's going on, and it's not okay.’ That's a really big deal,” she said.

Salguero acknowledged that there is a narrative painted around Evangelicals, suggesting they approve of ICE operations.

DOES THE LAW ALLOW PEOPLE TO SUE ICE AGENTS?

U.S. law makes it very difficult to sue federal agents as individuals. But victims can sue the federal government for compensation when its employees cause financial or bodily injury in the course of their work.

This is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, an exception to a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity which usually shields the federal government from lawsuits.

In a FTCA case, a plaintiff typically alleges a government employee acted negligently or wrongfully.

The statute might apply, for example, if an ICE agent damaged vehicles during an enforcement action. The statute would also allow family members of someone killed by ICE to seek compensation for wrongful death.

Several FTCA cases in the last year have drawn attention to the relatively obscure statute, which allows suits by citizens and non-citizens.

Jessie Fuentes, an elected official in Chicago who was handcuffed by ICE agents last year, recently used the FTCA to seek $100,000 in damages over the incident. That claim is pending.

Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist detained by ICE, and a Venezuelan man sent by U.S. authorities to a Salvadoran megaprison also have brought FTCA claims.

WHAT HURDLES DO THESE CASES FACE?

While the FTCA opens a rare avenue for a lawsuit against the federal government, these claims face limits and obstacles, and legal experts generally consider the law a weak mechanism for addressing government officials' misconduct.

Plaintiffs cannot seek punitive damages and do not have the right to a jury trial. Awards are also capped by the laws of the state where the wrongdoing occurred.

So, compensation can often be much lower than in traditional civil liability cases.

Additionally, the government cannot be held liable for discretionary judgments made by federal employees.

That means the government can defeat a claim by showing federal workers had to make judgment calls rather than follow standard procedures.

The government can also win by convincing a judge that the employee's actions were reasonable. In Good's case, the government would likely argue that the ICE agent who killed her acted in self-defense.

CAN FEDERAL AGENTS BE SUED INDIVIDUALLY?

Federal agents can only be sued individually in very limited circumstances when they violate the U.S. Constitution, and even then, such suits rarely succeed.

In a landmark 1971 case, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Brooklyn man to sue federal agents who searched his home without a warrant.

The court said the man's right to sue the agents for money damages was implied in the U.S. Constitution, even though there was no specific law passed by Congress authorizing such a claim.

That ruling created a type of lawsuit known as a Bivens action, in which federal employees who violate the U.S. Constitution can be sued in their personal capacity and forced to pay monetary damages.

But U.S. courts only recognize Bivens actions in very limited contexts, and in 2022, prohibited such claims against federal border agents conducting immigration enforcement.

Those more recent rulings have made it nearly impossible to sue federal officers like ICE agents in their individual capacity.

WHAT ABOUT CRIMINAL LIABILITY?

The bar against criminal prosecution of federal law enforcement officers such as ICE agents is very high and indictments are rare.

State-level prosecutors can file criminal charges against federal agents under certain circumstances. They would have to show that a federal agent's actions were outside the scope of their official duties, objectively unreasonable or clearly unlawful.

Portland resident Lucian Curtis voiced concern about what he’s heard and seen from immigration enforcement actions in other states.
“If there are folks that have been identified [as] being here illegally, I do fully support federal immigration authorities enforcing the law,” added Harrington.
In Lewiston, Sheline urged residents and local businesses to understand their rights and prepare for possible encounters with ICE.
“…there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon.","PORTLAND, Maine — Reactions are mounting across Maine after the mayors of the state’s two largest cities said federal immigration enforcement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could soon increase.

Portland Mayor Mark Dion and Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline announced that ICE may soon expand its presence in their communities, but federal officials and local law enforcement have not confirmed those reports.

The uncertainty has divided opinions among residents and public officials, with some expressing deep concern and others saying they are less worried about what an increased ICE presence might mean for Maine.

Portland resident Lucian Curtis voiced concern about what he’s heard and seen from immigration enforcement actions in other states.

“I think it’s very concerning,” Curtis told NEWS CENTER Maine. ""That sort of presence that they’re trying to muster seems to be at no actual benefit to our community and our economy,” Curtis said.

Not everyone shares those concerns. Republican State Senator Matt Harrington (R‑York) said Maine’s situation is not likely to mirror high‑profile enforcement seen in other states.

“I think we have a lot fewer people,” Harrington said, suggesting that the number of undocumented individuals in Maine is much lower than in other parts of the country.

“If there are folks that have been identified [as] being here illegally, I do fully support federal immigration authorities enforcing the law,” added Harrington.

“…Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods,” Dion’s statement read.

In Lewiston, Sheline urged residents and local businesses to understand their rights and prepare for possible encounters with ICE.

“…there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon. I urge residents and businesses to know their rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops them…” Sheline wrote.

The mayors’ announcements came the day after President Donald Trump referenced Maine’s Somali population in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, saying fraud is “going on in Maine, too.”

They’re questioning why NARCAN, which is used for opioid overdoses, was administered to Parady La when he was experiencing withdrawal symptoms.","Michael La, 34, has “a lot of memories” from the summers he spent as a child with his uncle, Parady La, who died Jan. 9 while in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.

“He was like a father figure to me,” Michael said of his uncle. “My parents split up at a really early age of my life. I was a baby, so I didn’t get to see my two parents together, and my dad really wasn’t in my life, right? So [Parady] was the one that connected me to that side of my family.”

Parady La would drive two hours to Michael’s home in Allentown and bring him back to Philadelphia during Michael’s summer vacation. There, Michael recalled that his uncle would give him and other kids money for ice cream when the Mister Softee truck came by.

“He always put himself aside and looked out for his family,” Michael said.

Michael and Parady La’s other family members, friends and loved ones are mourning his loss and celebrating his life at a memorial service in Upper Darby on Friday, even as they push for information about the circumstances that led to the 46-year-old’s death last week.

Michael started a GoFundMe for the family to help pay for funeral expenses and support Parady La’s 23-year-old daughter, Jazmine La. Donations will also go toward the family’s efforts to pursue legal action against ICE and Federal Detention Center Philadelphia.

What happened to Parady La?

According to Michael, on Jan. 6, Parady La asked his cousin if she needed anything from the grocery store. Hours later, family members found his car, empty, parked by the side of the road a half-mile away. Parady La called later that day and informed his family that ICE agents had pulled him over and asked for his ID, and then detained him.

Michael, who lives in Florida, said his cousin called him at 3:30 p.m. on Jan. 8 and told him Parady La was in the hospital, and was brain dead.

“One thing is huge, is that your family member, who’s been here their whole life … that he’s being sent to a country he’s never been to before,” he said. “So we’re dealing with that in 24 hours, and a little after 24 hours, we hear that he’s in the hospital, brain dead. So it’s just shocking and really confusing on top of that.”

According to a Jan. 10 statement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Parady La was “receiving treatment for severe drug withdrawal” while in detention at FDC Philadelphia. On Jan. 7, the statement reads, Parady “was found unresponsive in his cell.” The statement said that FDC officers administered CPR and several doses of NARCAN and called for medical assistance.

Parady La was admitted to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital that evening in critical condition, and pronounced dead the morning of Jan. 9, ICE officials said.

For Michael and Parady La’s family, ICE’s account “didn’t add up.”

Michael, who flew into Philadelphia hours after his uncle passed away, said his family’s understanding is that Parady La informed officers that he was going through fentanyl withdrawal soon after he was detained. They’re questioning why NARCAN, which is used for opioid overdoses, was administered to Parady La when he was experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

“As we keep fighting for information, we’re finding out that there’s like levels of information that just become locked, you know?” he said. “We’re still fighting for answers and still trying to figure out what’s going on.”

Michael said his family now has a legal team and is going to pursue legal action against FDC Philadelphia and ICE.

“This fight isn’t about deportation,” Michael said. “It’s about the care that each and every person needs when they are in custody, whether it is in ICE custody, FDC, or, you know, a different federal agency … If you bring somebody in your home, I feel like it’s your duty to make sure that they’re cared for in your home.”

Shut Down Detention Campaign, a coalition of organizations and individuals fighting to end immigrant detention, said in a press statement that Parady La’s death was “completely preventable and is a direct result of egregious medical neglect.” According to the group, “several sources” said that Parady La “told staff he was going through fentanyl withdrawal and repeatedly requested care after vomiting several times throughout January 6th.”

In its statement about Parady La’s death, ICE said it “is committed to ensuring that all those in custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.”

“Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay … At no time during detention is a detained alien denied emergency care,” the statement reads.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/parady-la-ice-death.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 13:59:40.105892

I am in the passenger seat of a stranger’s car in Minneapolis, four days after Renee Nicole Good was killed here. I’m riding with someone who was doing the same kind of work we think Good was doing when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot her. Right now, our work is much quieter. We’re driving in loose loops when a volunteer who is patrolling the streets as a pedestrian observer on the Signal call we’re listening to—a broad network of thousands of locals relaying up-to-the-moment intel on ICE activity—reports two vehicles near Karmel Mall, known locally as “Somali Mall.” Another volunteer fulfilling the role of dispatcher, also on the call, identifies them by make and model. Another observer cross-references the license plates against a running database. They’re confirmed as ICE vehicles, unmarked like they almost always are.

My guide for the day, who I’ll call C, sits up. “They’re going to come past us right here,” they say, accelerating toward the intersection.

Within seconds we spot them: two SUVs moving faster than the flow of traffic. Through their windows, I can see silhouettes of men with heavy Kevlar high on the neck, faces covered, sunglasses.

C begins calling out every turn, street, and direction the SUVs take—while laying on their car horn hard and continuously, like an alarm. The sound is constant and blunt. It could easily be mistaken for an expression of anger, but watching how others in the area—pedestrians, other drivers—react, it’s a signal: a warning to anyone within earshot that ICE is moving through the neighborhood. It turns what ICE hoped would be a discreet operation into a public event. One pedestrian we pass hears the horn, turns, and gives the ICE vehicles the finger.

The SUVs accelerate. We follow closely, C still honking, still relaying their movements. Then they turn onto a familiar street.

“This is my street,” C says. Their posture changes. They look at me. “Can you record this?”

At the next stop sign, the vehicles split. One SUV pauses, blocking our path, allowing the other to pull away, surging into the intersection, cutting ahead of an uninvolved civilian car, using it as a moving barrier. If C had chased through, we would have been hit broadside: “They have absolutely no respect for traffic laws.” That first SUV is gone.

“They sometimes travel in pairs,” C tells me. “You can’t follow both. They’ll break and try to shake anyone observing.”

The remaining ICE vehicle, a Wagoneer, continues through the block. C keeps honking, keeps calling turns. We circle again. “They’re letting me pass my house again,” they report into Signal.

Then: “They’re stopped in front of my house.”

The first thing I noticed when I got to Minneapolis last weekend was the new language. For example: The work C was doing has a name—“commuting”—a deliberately mundane term for pursuing, tailing, and deliberately irritating ICE agents moving through the city in unmarked cars.

As C scans windshields, front seats, and license plates, they tell me about a recent incident near their home. “Three blocks from my house, an unmarked vehicle with four agents in it roll up and just grab a guy off the sidewalk who was walking,” they said. “They violently shoved him into their car.” Their voice trembles as they describe the incident, one they managed to film, hoping that footage might be useful later. “They just snatched him.”

That verb—snatched—is another example of the new language. So is “abduction.” Both are meant to describe the force, speed, and chaos with which ICE is removing people from their city. People are taken before anyone nearby understands what’s happening.

It’s a mistake to think that this transformation started after Good’s killing. The ICE raids intensified in Minneapolis in early December, and the Signal network C volunteers in has been active since then. Minneapolis had already been in an ongoing battle between ICE and the local residents for months when Good was killed.

Her death also occurred just a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police in 2020, an area now dubbed George Floyd Square. The past five years taught this city what it looks like when official accounts collide with video evidence, with witness testimony, with what residents say they watched happen with their own eyes. People I met kept describing this as a reason the infrastructure exists at all: not as a guarantee of safety, but as a way to create a record.

Now, in this frozen tundra of a city, in a state best known for its enduring Midwestern niceness, residents of Minnesota are doubling down.

Since Dec. 1, growth in these networks had been steady. After Renee Good was killed, it exploded. Volunteer residents told me that up until the shooting, roughly 20 people would join every day. Now, it’s hundreds.

I came to Minneapolis to understand what it looks like when a city organizes not around a single protest or flashpoint, but around a daily pattern of federal enforcement that residents describe as their new normal. People kept telling me the same thing: The city has a new infrastructure now, mostly invisible unless you’re inside it. C offered to show me what that looks like in real time.

“When I started in early December,” C tells me, “it was not at all guaranteed to see an ICE agent during patrols.” They pause. “Now I see anywhere from one to upwards of 20 if I’m out for even an hour.”

That morning, C picked me up near the intersection where Good was shot and killed. Like George Floyd Square, the response here had been immediate and spatial. In the first days after her death, neighbors used debris to block the roads, closing the intersection in every direction. For a brief window, the intersection functioned the way so many Minneapolis corners have learned to function: part memorial, part staging ground—an assertion that something had happened here and could not simply be folded back into normal traffic patterns.

By the time I arrived on Saturday morning, the barricades were gone. Traffic had resumed. The memorial had been compressed into the parking lane of the one-way street, clustered near where Good’s SUV had crashed into a parked car. Flowers lined the curb. Candles flickered in the cold. Handwritten signs were fixed to fences and utility poles. The street felt reopened but not reset.

Nearby, a small group of friends arrived together, standing shoulder to shoulder as they took in the memorial. One of them, Kylie, told me she’s still in shock. “On our way here, we watched ICE take somebody from their home. Like 30 minutes ago. They broke her window and took her out of her house.”

That mourners could witness such actions so close to the scene of Good’s death is as useful an indication as any about how things are going in Minneapolis. By most accounts, tensions have only continued to ratchet higher. I flew home on Monday, and on Wednesday another altercation between ICE, a Venezuelan man, and two civilians attempting to prevent the agents from arresting the man resulted in ICE shooting the man they were attempting to arrest in the leg. The two civilians were reportedly “armed” with a snow shovel and a broom, and the incident is being held up as the reason Donald Trump is now floating using the Insurrection Act to enter the city. Meanwhile, Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general, told residents to continue to report possible rights violations and other incidents involving federal law enforcement. People I spoke to described the escalation as cause to organize even harder.

That effort continues to be diffuse. The way anonymity is central to how this work functions makes it hard to know specifically who Good was collaborating with when she was killed. The volunteer network is also extremely local and largely homegrown, built by neighbors organizing block by block with the families who live next door. Their stories said a lot about how someone like Good may have gotten involved.

Nick is a local father in South Minneapolis. He’s also an admin in one of the neighborhood-level Signal networks that routes ICE sightings into local response. He told me that he got involved around Dec. 1, when ICE activity in his area started to feel constant. “That was the day that it really sort of got out of hand,” he told me. That day, he said, a neighbor was taken. Then ICE returned. Then they returned again. “When they came back for a third time, we were organized. We were out there watching, whistling. … It’s been like that ever since.”

He ended up on the helm of his particular neighborhood’s efforts largely by default. “I guess I’m very online,” he told me. “I know how to do some technical stuff. So I just kind of took over as one of the admins.” His chat has become an invaluable tool for locals who want to track and observe ICE. Volunteers cross-check license plates against a database of confirmed ICE vehicles, dispatchers track ICE activity, observers patrolling on foot or in vehicles give up-to-the-moment information of ICE whereabouts. He wanted one thing understood immediately: This is not a professional operation. “It is just ordinary people that are doing this,” he said. “This isn’t fun. It’s middle-aged parents who would rather be playing with their kids at home.”

Nick also wasn’t keen on comparing this moment to how he experienced the uprising that followed the killing of George Floyd. He said the two are different in that that was a single instance, and now they see videos of inhumane treatment and police brutality dozens of times a day in their neighborhoods.

Back in the car with C, as we drive in more slow loops, they give me a tour of the city they call home, and clearly love. But in almost in the same breath, they point out places that have become markers in this new geography of enforcement.

“That fish-and-chicken spot,” they say, gesturing, “that’s where [ICE] were initially staging.”

The Signal call runs constantly in the background. The cadence of volunteers is efficient and clipped. C describes what they look for: SUVs and pickups parked in alleys; heavily tinted windows; out-of-state plates; erratic driving; the outline of tactical vests and sunglasses. It has become reflexive, they say, to glance into nearly every vehicle.

Even while so much of the action seems like it is being done car-to-car, people kept telling me the system is bigger than patrols. Volunteers are doing everything they can to keep vulnerable residents from having to be anywhere ICE might be. This means doing things like getting anyone who is trying to avoid ICE’s scrutiny rides, child care, groceries. To understand this part of the work, people told me, I should talk to Anna, who is running one such effort called Neighbors Helping Neighbors.

Anna talked the way people do when they’ve been in crisis mode for too long: fast, specific, typing into her phone without interrupting. In her telling, the last two months didn’t introduce a new fear so much as spread it—turning what many immigrant neighbors have lived with for years into a shared civic atmosphere.

Her days now revolve around a simple system: a form for volunteers, another form for neighbors asking for help. “On average, I would say a week ago we were getting three to five a day,” she said. “Last night from 3 p.m. to this morning we’ve received 51.” The requests were spreading outward into the suburbs—“Farmington … Roseville, Inver Grove Heights, Eden Prairie”—and it’s still intensifying.

When I asked where Neighbors Helping Neighbors came from, she described it as improvised and immediate: “We just started brainstorming and I literally just created a Google form and we just shared it on social media and now it has just become a thing.” It stayed informal even as it grew. “People are like, ‘Who can I Venmo?’ ” she said. “And I’m like, ‘You can Venmo me.’ ” Someone would send her a receipt, and she’d reimburse them. “I don’t know who they are,” she said. “And I’m just Venmoing them.”

She talked about it as mutual aid built in real time, held together by trust and speed, and by a kind of local reflex that Minnesota has rehearsed in smaller ways for years—neighbors pushing each other out of snowdrifts, shoveling sidewalks, checking in. “You have to know your neighbors,” she said. “You need to know their names.”

Neighbors are showing up in droves. Organizers told me their Signal chats were maxing out. Trainings are full. Food pantries were being inundated. And even after the horror of Good’s killing, the new volunteers weren’t seasoned activists, they were regular people who finally reached a point where doing nothing felt worse than the risks of doing something.

Jordan Castillo attended his first training at a church in South Minneapolis on the same day Renee Good was killed. He arrived already unsettled. He remembers murmuring “Holy shit” when he got to the packed parking lot. Inside, he estimated there were “probably about 700 people.” He stopped when he walked in. “I was like, whoa. This is a moment. Like, this is history.”

But Good’s killing isn’t the only thing pulling people in—many volunteers are coming to this work after seeing ICE in their own neighborhoods. When I met Burt Muston in a park near his home, he pointed to the local market he described as “a neighborhood staple.” Two people were taken by ICE here. The market closed afterward. “They’ve been closed ever since.” That was the tipping point for him, he said.

Muston is a large white man, and with his beard and dark sunglasses, he could be mistaken for an ICE agent himself. He saw this as an advantage. “As, like, a big white dude … other than if they want to say I’m obstructing justice, they’re not going to really fuck with me,” he told me.

That doesn’t mean he doesn’t take the risks seriously—he referenced footage where an ICE agent told an observer, “Have you not learned your lesson when we kill that lesbian bitch?” He had already made contingency plans. “I’ve actually set up, if I do get detained or something like that, people to come grab my dog to take care of,” he said. Then he waved it off: “I’ll just cross that bridge if I come to it.”

I spoke to another volunteer, who I’ll call M, in a coffee shop at 7 a.m., just before she headed to another shift as a “commuter.” Responding to ICE-watch calls has become part of her routine—she’s been doing it before work, after getting training months ago. “I’m just getting out of bed in the morning and thinking, Maybe I should wake up earlier. Maybe I should leave the house at 6 a.m. so that I can help make sure that there are eyes on the road, eyes on the bus stop or by the schools.”

But the watching goes both ways. As I sit in the car with C after the second ICE vehicle sped off, the remaining Wagoneer idles midblock—right in front of C’s house. The message C took from it was simple: “We know where you live.” C keeps the horn down and raises a middle finger toward the windshield.

Moments later, the Wagoneer accelerates away on an icy stretch, blowing through a row of intersections with stop signs. C follows cautiously, choosing to stop instead, letting the distance span. The Wagoneer disappears. C scans mirrors, side streets, cross traffic. “I think we lost them,” they say.

“I lost it at the light,” they report to the group call. “If anyone’s further east on 31st past I-35 and can get eyes on it …” No one does.",https://compote.slate.com/images/de573e37-75e0-4a11-869d-351d850bcb56.jpeg?width=1560,N,,2026-01-16 11:01:14.903461

The federal government depends on local jails for detention space, and transfers people across the country to local jails that they pay a per diem.
In Kentucky, the increasing use of local jails for immigration detention puts pressure on an already-strained system rife with crowding and other poor, dangerous conditions.","A year in to the Trump presidency, the administration’s mass deportation effort has resulted in a historic high of 68,990 immigrants locked up in detention, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is becoming increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of arrests. Despite mounting public outrage and fear, however, a growing number of local police and jails in Kentucky are entering into agreements and contracts to cooperate with ICE. And Kentucky legislators are proposing ways to further ramp up deportation efforts across the state even as ICE arrests in the state surge and the number of detainees in local jails increases.

State and local governments play a central role in implementing this mass deportation agenda, which includes financial incentives for law enforcement agencies to formally partner with ICE and for jails to rent out beds for detention. In Kentucky, 22 local law enforcement groups have already signed 287(g) agreements and 11 county jails are contracting with ICE to hold detainees. That is an increase of 8 additional law enforcement groups and 2 more county jails just in the last few months. In addition, several bills have already been filed this legislative session that would require local agencies to participate.

States and localities play a key role in administration’s anti-immigrant agenda

During the campaign the Trump administration promised to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history and remove 15 to 20 million undocumented immigrants — a number greater than the 14 million estimated to live in the U.S. The administration is reportedly pressuring ICE to arrest 3,000 immigrants a day and deport a record one million each year.

On its very first day, the administration issued 10 executive orders and proclamations that set in motion a sweeping anti-immigrant policy agenda. The major executive order on immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior, “Protecting the American People From Invasion,” included numerous policies designed to massively increase arrests and deportations, including requiring immigrants without citizenship register with the federal government or be subject to criminal prosecution.

The administration is utilizing state and local law enforcement to carry out its plan. The “Protecting the American People From Invasion” executive order directed DHS to expand 287(g) agreements with state and local law enforcement to mobilize them as partners in enforcing federal immigration law “to the maximum extent permitted by law.” In addition, ICE issued a separate set of standards in July for immigrant detention in facilities that already incarcerate people in state/local custody. These new standards reduced the number of required procedures and oversight compared to dedicated facilities, a strategy to expand immigrant detention in local jails by making it easier to enter into these agreements with ICE.

An April executive order threatened to revoke all federal funding to states and localities deemed to be “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Louisville was on the Department of Justice’s published list of so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions because of a local ordinance preventing the jail from keeping someone in custody at the request of ICE (an “ICE detainer”) for as long as 48 hours after their scheduled release; the mayor later announced a reversal of its policy and Louisville was removed from this list.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBBA), the budget megabill that passed Congress in July, also appropriated $170.7 billion to carry out this anti-immigrant agenda, in addition to $75 billion for the enforcement, surveillance and militarization of borders.

22 Kentucky law enforcement agencies have already signed 287(g) agreements with ICE, three in the first week of the new year, with an additional contract pending

Section 287(g) was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1996, authorizing ICE to give state and local law enforcement officers the authority to enforce federal immigration law. Starting with 9/11, it has been utilized during times of heightened immigration enforcement.

During the first Trump administration, the number of 287(g) agreements nationally jumped from 35 to 150. There were 135 memorandums of understanding (MOUs) on Jan. 20, 2025, which surged to 1,036 October 1 and is now up to 1,318 across 40 states as of Jan. 13, 2026. New financial incentives in the OBBBA have been in effect since October 1 for state and local law enforcement agencies that participate, heightening long-held concerns about racial profiling, violence and other human and civil rights violations in the 287(g) program.

The majority of the agreements are the Task Force Model, which empowers state or local law enforcement to make immigration arrests during routine policing and was discontinued from 2012 until January 2025 due to documented civil rights abuses. As of Sept. 2, 2025, 8,501 Task Force officers had completed training and more than 2,000 additional officers were in training.

There are two other types of 287(g) agreements:

Jail Enforcement Model – Corrections officers are deputized by the federal government to interrogate people about their immigration status.

Warrant Service Officer Model – ICE trains, certifies and authorizes state and local law enforcement officers to serve and execute administrative immigration warrants on people who are in custody in their agency’s jail.

Both the Task Force Model and Jail Enforcement Model have historically required a four-week, in-person training program, while the more-limited Warrant Service Officer Model required just eight hours of training. However, in bringing back the Task Force Model the Trump administration is only requiring a 40-hour online training course, especially concerning given this model is the most aggressive and has a history of abuses.

In Kentucky, there are now 28 287(g) contracts across 22 different agencies, 18 of which are the problematic Task Force Model:

Twelve of the agreements happened after the OBBBA became law, all but two of which were for the Task Force Model. Since we first published this analysis in October of 2025, eight new 287(g) agreements have been entered into, all of which are the Task Force Model, and an additional Task Force Model contract is pending for the McCracken County Sheriff’s Office.

Prior to the OBBBA, local law enforcement agencies partnering with ICE received limited federal funds for expenses like training and IT infrastructure. However, DHS is now fully reimbursing participating agencies for the annual salary and benefits of each trained 287(g) officer; this includes covering overtime up to 25% of their annual salary. In addition, agencies can receive quarterly “performance bonuses”— not dissimilar to a bounty — based on the “successful location” of undocumented immigrants identified by ICE and “overall assistance to further ICE’s mission to defend the homeland.” Agencies that locate 90% to 100% of ICE-identified undocumented immigrants receive $1,000 per eligible task force officer, $750 per eligible task force officer for locating 80% to 89% of ICE-identified undocumented immigrants and $500 for locating 70% to 79%.

There were nearly 2,000 ICE arrests in Kentucky in the first nine months of the new administration, and the arrest rate is increasing

On January 20, 2025 the Department of Homeland Security issued a directive rescinding the Biden administration’s “protected areas policy” that prevented immigration enforcement in places like churches, schools and hospitals. ICE arrests surged nationally following the inauguration, with 32,809 between January 20 and March 10, the equivalent of about 656 arrests per day, compared to 255 each day under the previous administration. After ICE reportedly received orders on May 20 to further intensify their efforts and started targeting workplaces and immigration court, there was a peak of around 30,000 arrests in June 2025 compared to 8,000 in June 2024. That was the highest level since at least 2020 but still far below the goal of 3,000 per day, or roughly 90,000 a month. ICE arrests were lower in July and August but then increased to more than 33,000 in September.

ICE arrest data obtained, processed and made available by the Deportation Data Project, shows that in Kentucky, between Jan. 20, 2025 and Oct. 15, 2025, there were 1,950 ICE arrests. That’s a 32% increase compared to the 1,475 arrests in 2024 during the same period.

According to an analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, the ICE arrest rate in Kentucky was 17.2 per 100,000 residents in the first four months of the Trump administration (Jan. 20 to May 20, 2025) and increased to 25.5 between May 21 and Oct. 15, 2025. During both time periods, 75% of the ICE arrests in Kentucky happened at a jail or other lockup facility and 25% occurred at workplaces, homes, courts or other non-carceral locations in the community.

As can be seen in the map below, jails are the most common location for ICE arrests in the state, especially those occurring outside of Louisville. The data also shows that for the people arrested by ICE in Kentucky between Jan. 20 and Oct. 15, 2025 the most common country of origin is Mexico (832), followed by Guatemala (568) and Honduras (197).

Efforts to drive up the number of arrests have led to the targeting of people with no criminal history (and those convicted of a criminal offense may have been for a minor charge). Immigrants with no criminal convictions are increasingly the largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE.

And ICE arrests alone don’t even capture the full scope of the situation, as illustrated by a May 29 immigration raid in Harlan that was carried out by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) despite being unrelated to drugs.

ICE detention in Kentucky is growing and the total number of people in federal custody in the state’s local jails is at a historic high.

The total number of people detained by ICE was 68,990 on Jan. 8, 2026, up from 39,703 on Jan. 12, 2024, a 74% increase. Yet these staggering numbers only reflect around two-thirds of people detained for immigration reasons as they don’t include those facing criminal prosecution in the custody of U.S. Marshals or the Bureau of Prisons.

Local jails are playing a significant role in the Trump administration’s mass arrest and deportation agenda because in 25 states they are the only facilities available for holding people arrested by ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service. The federal government depends on local jails for detention space, and transfers people across the country to local jails that they pay a per diem. In Kentucky, the increasing use of local jails for immigration detention puts pressure on an already-strained system rife with crowding and other poor, dangerous conditions.

Kentucky’s local jails have a long history of renting jail beds to the federal government because federal per-diem amounts are typically much higher than what the state pays jails to incarcerate people in Kentucky Department of Corrections (DOC) custody. Laurel County and Grayson County even vastly expanded their local jails for the specific purpose of holding more people in federal custody for this reason.

Until recently, these jails primarily held people in the federal criminal system for the U.S. Marshal’s service rather than ICE; however, there is a lot of interplay between the two agencies that is important to understand for getting a full picture of immigration detention in jails. For a person arrested by ICE who is charged with a federal immigration crime, custody is transferred to the U.S. Marshals until the criminal case is resolved, at which time ICE can arrest them again (directly from jail or prison after their case is dismissed or they serve a sentence) and then they re-enter immigration detention.

Kentucky jail data shows a marked increase in the number of people in federal custody in Kentucky jails since the beginning of 2024 — jumping from 1,963 on Jan. 23, 2025 to a historic high of 2,827 on Dec. 24, 2025 — a 44% increase.

Note that the federal custody population number includes immigrants detained by ICE and by the U.S. Marshals for a federal immigration crime (and for 49% of people booked into U.S. Marshals custody in May of 2025, immigration offenses were the reason), as well as people in U.S. Marshals custody who are not immigrants and have federal criminal charges completely unrelated to immigration.

Although it isn’t possible to parse out exactly how many people in federal custody in Kentucky jails are being detained for immigration enforcement reasons, it’s clear the upward trend that started in February is related to the intensification of immigration enforcement happening around the same time.

ICE data analyzed by Relevant Research shows dramatic growth in the number of Kentucky jails contracting with ICE for beds and in the estimated average daily population of these detainees. In 2024, just one local facility in the state, the Boone County Detention Center, had a consistent and significant population of people in ICE custody. On Jan. 21, 2025 the estimated “interval average daily population” (ADP) of ICE detainees in Kentucky jails was 120.5. By Aug. 18, 2025, there were an estimated 915.0 people in ICE custody across nine local jails. In November two additional jails — Christian and Daviess County Detention Centers — started contracting with ICE, and on Dec. 26, 2025, the estimated ADP was up to 1,176.3 across 11 local jails, seven of which consistently hold a significant number of people in ICE custody.

News reports from the Twin Cities have stated that Native Americans, who are fully U.S. citizens, had been approached by ICE agents regarding their immigration/citizenship status.
The safety and well-being of all tribal members continues to be our highest priority.
Our priority is the safety, dignity, and protection of our tribal members.
ICE agents have been observed approaching homes and businesses with administrative warrants issued by ICE, which lack the legal weight of a judicial warrant.","“How sad that indigenous people have to prove they are not illegal immigrants,” wrote Cindy Smith in response to a Facebook posting by the Lac Courte Oreilles (LCO) Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.

On Jan. 10, the LCO Tribal Governing Board issued an immediate release that it was “closely monitoring recent events that took place in Minneapolis, and around the country involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Agents.”

Just a few days before, on Wednesday, Jan. 7, a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, was shot and killed in her vehicle by an ICE agent in South Minneapolis.

Over 1,000 ICE agents were in the Twin Cities area as a major campaign that has received national attention to detain and arrest those who had reportedly violated federal immigration laws. The agents not only tracked down those without legal status to reside in the U.S., but also questioned and detained others because of their appearance, such as skin color and accent, whether or not they were legal residents or citizens. Caught up in the crackdown were at least five Native Americans who were detained, including four Oglala Sioux from South Dakota and one from the Red Lake reservation in Minnesota.

Jose Roberto “Beto” Ramirez, a Red Lake descendant, told a reporter for ICT that he was trailed by an SUV and when he parked in a grocery store parking lot, he was dragged out of his vehicle without explanation and detained for several hours. Ramirez said he felt like he had been “kidnapped”. He was subsequently released without any charges.

News reports from the Twin Cities have stated that Native Americans, who are fully U.S. citizens, had been approached by ICE agents regarding their immigration/citizenship status.

In response to Native Americans being stopped by ICE, several Wisconsin tribes issued statements voicing concern over the stops and also offering advice to their members.

“We humbly offer our sincere condolences to all those affected by these incidents,” reads the Lac Courte Oreilles release, which assured members that the Tribal Governing Board “is actively working to ensure our tribe and members are as safe as possible and is reviewing policies to implement access restrictions in areas that are non-public, employee-only, and restricted to ensure our facilities are entitled to every legal protection possible.

“In these unprecedented and uncertain times, it is essential that we remain vigilant and protect one another. We encourage everyone to stand together in solidarity to support each other spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically. The safety and well-being of all tribal members continues to be our highest priority. We will do everything in our power to protect our members, reservation, government buildings, and enterprises.”

Jon Greendeer, president of the Ho-Chunk Nation posted Wednesday, Jan. 14, “My office and social media feeds have been buzzing with concerned tribal members following the recent shooting of an American Citizen by an armed ICE official. Now with the news of alleged door-to-door campaigns, the threat literally hits home.”

Also on Jan. 14, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians posted the following: “The Tribe wants to be clear: we do not support or cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Our priority is the safety, dignity, and protection of our tribal members. We are deeply concerned by reports coming out of Minnesota involving the detention of tribal members, as well as ICE actively being reported in areas near our community. As indigenous people to this land, our identity should never be questioned, challenged, or used as a reason for detention.”

On Jan. 12, the St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians issued a statement on “opposing ICE and affirming tribal sovereignty,” which said, in part, that tribal leaders “strongly oppose the actions and presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) including the targeting of community members, the detention and separation of families, and the ongoing disregard of human rights.”

On Jan. 10, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community alerted members on Facebook that Native Americans “are being caught up in raids and detained.”

Like several of the tribal posts, the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe encourages its members to be prepared for being “stopped, detained and questioned regarding your citizenship.”

Even though tribal members are U.S. citizens, Wisconsin tribal members are being encouraged to carry their tribal, state and federal IDs and even birth certificates.

On Jan. 14, the LCO tribe said it would be issuing ID cards for enrolled members who live off the reservation in the Twin Cities at the Minneapolis American Indian Center Rotunda, and like other tribes, LCO noted that fees are being waived for the ID cards.

On Jan. 11, the Oneida Nation offered detailed guidance if members encountered ICE agents:

“Stay calm and ask for identification.”

“Always carry your Oneida ID.”

“If detained, say ‘I want to speak with an attorney.’”

“Report encounters to Oneida Police Department.”

“At home, keep the door closed and request a judicial warrant.”

Several tribes are notifying members that if the ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, the agents do not have permission to enter their home without consent.

ICE agents have been observed approaching homes and businesses with administrative warrants issued by ICE, which lack the legal weight of a judicial warrant.

Some of the tribes are advising members if ICE comes to their doors without a judicial warrant to not only not open their doors, but also report the presence of the ICE agents to tribal police.

The Ho-Chunk Nation said it will provide its members with door signs for law enforcement that “alert” officers of the “state, tribal and federal citizenship” status of the residents and communicate that “agents may not enter the property without a valid warrant.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/230714-Wisconsin-Examiner-Staff-43-2048x717.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 11:01:19.170704

Under the old district lines, Trump won Kaptur’s district by 7 percentage points, according to NBC News’ Decision Desk.","Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Madison Sheahan on Thursday resigned her post and launched a campaign for Congress in Ohio, jumping into a crowded Republican primary for a seat that became more GOP-friendly after a recent redistricting push.

In a video announcing her campaign launch, Sheahan highlighted her time at ICE and slammed Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the Ohio congresswoman whom she’s aiming to unseat.

“In less than one year at ICE, I’ve stopped more illegal immigration than Marcy Kaptur has in her 43 years in Washington,” Sheahan said in the video. “In Congress, hypocrisy, excuses and failure can earn you a lifetime job, but on my family farm that would put us out of business.”

“Ohio neighborhoods are safer, thanks to President [Donald] Trump and ICE,” Sheahan added later in her video.

Her campaign launch brings the number of Republicans running in the district’s primary — which is slated to take place on May 5 — to more than half a dozen.

The GOP primary field includes state Rep. Josh Williams and Derek Merrin, a former state lawmaker who was the GOP nominee against Kaptur in 2024.

A Kaptur campaign spokesperson said in a statement, “While Republicans from near and far will fight through a messy primary in this district they gerrymandered again just this fall, Congresswoman Kaptur is focused on delivering real results for her constituents. She’s working to lower costs for working families, protect access to affordable health care, and bring transformative investments to Northwest Ohio.”

House Republicans are heading into the election year with a slim majority, compounded by dozens of retirements on both sides of the aisle. Trump has expressed concern in recent days that the GOP could lose control of the House.

“It’s some deep psychological thing, but when you win the presidency, you don’t win the midterms,” Trump told Reuters on Wednesday. Earlier this month, the president told House Republicans in a speech that Democrats would seek to impeach him if they flip control of the chamber.

Ohio’s 9th District is one that Republicans have targeted for several cycles and has consistently been a battleground district.

In 2024, Kaptur beat Merrin in the general election by less than a percentage point while Trump carried the district by a wider margin. The congresswoman is one of a handful of Democrats currently serving in a district that the president won in 2024.

During a wave of partisan redistricting across the country last year, Republicans in Ohio redrew the 9th District’s boundaries to make the seat more favorable for the GOP. Under the old district lines, Trump won Kaptur’s district by 7 percentage points, according to NBC News’ Decision Desk. But under the new district lines, Trump would have won the seat by 11 percentage points.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the race in this year’s midterm elections a “Toss Up.”

In 2024, Trump endorsed Merrin ahead of the GOP primary in this district, helping propel him to victory in a small but competitive primary field. The president has not yet endorsed in this district ahead of this year’s primary election.

In her launch video and her resignation letter Thursday, Sheahan highlighted her work with the Trump administration and her ties to the president.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260115-madison-sheahan-mn-1045-602aa5.jpg",N,,2026-01-16 11:59:18.356411

After nearly three decades in Minnesota, Cecilia Sosa’s parents started a cleaning business together in the last few years and had “flourished”, making connections and friends, she said.
“I am not ready for them to leave,” Cecilia Sosa said.
Each time she hears or sees cars that may belong to immigration agents, she rushes outside to check who they’re after.
“I basically tell everyone here: ‘I couldn’t save my husband, but I could probably save you,’” she said.","Paulo Sosa Garcia and Ramona Cecilia Silva were heading to work in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, on Monday morning when federal immigration agents pulled them over and arrested them. By the next morning, they were detained in El Paso, Texas.

Tomas Martinez Gregorio was driving his wife, Daisy Martinez, and their six-year-old son, Jayren, to a hospital in Brooklyn Park when federal agents pulled them over and took Gregorio. Jayren never made it to his tonsillectomy appointment.

About 3,000 federal agents are either operating in Minnesota or on their way to the region – seeking to arrest immigrants in what the Trump administration said was its largest enforcement operation thus far. More than 2,400 people in Minnesota have been arrested in recent weeks – and many have been swiftly moved to detention centers out of state, or removed from the country.

Some had valid visas and a right to be in the US, according to local leaders who have been responding to constituents affected by the raids and lawyers representing immigrants. The Guardian has confirmed that several refugees with legal status have been arrested in recent days after the Trump administration said it would “re-examine thousands of refugee cases”.

Many have been arrested in their neighborhoods – at home, on their way to work, at department stores and restaurants, outside schools and places of worship.

Their families are grappling with the aftermath.

“I just want for my parents to come back home,” said Cecilia Sosa, the eldest of Sosa Garcia and Silva’s three daughters.

Sosa Garcia and Silva came to the US from Mexico in 1999, and had been in a years-long process to obtain legal residency, according to their daughter. Five days before they were detained, they had been told that their case had been approved to move forward. Now their daughters are instead working to raise funds for lawyers’ fees to get them released from detention – posting a video on TikTok saying they are “living their worst nightmare”, which includes footage of their parents’ car on the side of the road with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicles around it.

After nearly three decades in Minnesota, Cecilia Sosa’s parents started a cleaning business together in the last few years and had “flourished”, making connections and friends, she said. Their youngest daughter is 19, and they helped her with college expenses, and were caregivers for Cecilia Sosa’s grandfather, who just had a brain tumor removed.

Now the daughters have had minimal contact with their parents since 12 January. Sosa Garcia was able to call his daughters’ aunt to inform the family that he and his wife were detained. Silva sent a text message to one of her daughters telling her that she was detained and asked the family to call a lawyer. The couple are now being held separately at Camp East Montana at Fort Bliss, a massive tent facility in El Paso where human rights groups have alleged that detainees face physical abuse and unsafe conditions.

“I am not ready for them to leave,” Cecilia Sosa said. Her nine-year old son, whom her parents were helping her raise, asks frequently about them, she said: “We need them here.”

Daisy Martinez, whose husband, Tomas Martinez Gregorio, was detained on New Year’s Eve, said she has also struggled to explain to her son what happened to his stepfather. “He says every single day: ‘Can we get Tommy back?’ He tells his teacher: ‘Can you please save Tommy?’” she said.

The other night, her son told her he’d dreamed that his stepfather was back – and he was sad to wake up. “It just breaks my heart to hear a six-year-old say that they don’t want to wake up,” Martinez said.

Martinez and Gregorio had been married recently, in November. He is undocumented, from Mexico. Although Martinez is a US citizen, the couple had decided not to apply to adjust Gregorio’s immigration status during the Trump administration because they worried that an application would draw attention to him, and ICE would try to target him for deportation.

As more and more federal immigration agents deployed to the Twin Cities in December, Martinez had worried about Gregorio. Still, they hadn’t expected three cars with ICE agents to corner their vehicle as they were driving to the hospital.

Martinez tried to talk them down – but the agents, who were armed, demanded that Gregorio get out of the car. Video footage that Martinez recorded, reviewed by the Guardian, captured her pleading with them to let Gregorio go, and an agent telling her that her husband had a DUI on his record.

Later, an immigration agent told her that her husband did not in fact have a criminal record – and Daisy said she hasn’t been given a reason for why exactly her family was targeted.

When Martinez tried to chase after her husband, who was being ushered into an agent’s car, several other agents tackled her against the car and pinned her arms behind her, she said.

“And then they left,” she said.

Martinez then noticed her son shaking and screaming in the back seat. She briefly blacked out. When she came to, she called her cousin.

“We were two minutes away from the hospital,” she said. “We never made it to the surgery.”

Panicked, Martinez and her cousin tried to find Gregorio by tracking the location-sharing feature on his phone and realized he had been taken – like many immigrants arrested in the region – to the ICE facility at Fort Snelling, a former military fortification in south Minnesota. After that, he was transferred to a county jail in Sherburne county, a 40-minute drive from the couple’s home.

In the weeks since, she has been scrambling to figure out how to get her husband released – and how to parent and survive without him. He worked in the insulation industry and had made a good salary, allowing Martinez to work part-time and focus on childcare, she said.

Ever since agents tackled her, she said, an old injury on her foot has been acting up, making it difficult for her to walk or stand for long periods. That, combined with insomnia and the trauma of Gregorio’s arrest, has made it difficult for her to do her job as a part-time supervisor for a fast-food chain.

“I’m the child of an immigrant, I’m the wife of an immigrant,” she said. “My son was born in Mexico … so I’m basically the mom of an immigrant,” she said. “And [ICE] made me feel like my citizenship doesn’t matter any more. My social status doesn’t mean anything, my passport doesn’t mean anything.”

Still, she said, she tries to watch out for her friends and neighbors without citizenship. In the past few weeks, she has been making regular runs to the gas station to fill up their cars, making grocery runs for whoever needs it. Each time she hears or sees cars that may belong to immigration agents, she rushes outside to check who they’re after.

Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who illegally entered the U.S. from Venezuela in August 2022, was the target of the ICE operation when he was shot in the leg, according to DHS. He was previously convicted of driving without a license and arrested on two counts of giving a false name to a peace officer.

Officials said he was released by Minnesota authorities before ICE could lodge a detainer against him.

Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma were identified as the two men who came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the ICE agent with a snow shovel and broom handle while he was trying to arrest Sosa-Celis, according to DHS.

Before the attack, the federal agent was in the process of arresting Sosa-Celis during a routine traffic stop when the illegal immigrant crashed his vehicle into another car and fled.

The private polling suggested a rupturing of the coalition of independent, moderate and minority voters who were key parts of Trump's victory in 2024. Such voters will play a big role in determining whether Republicans keep their slim House majority in November's midterms.

If Republicans lose the House, Trump will head into his final two years in office as a lame duck who, he acknowledges, could face a third impeachment.

Zoom in: To the degree they support a more constrained approach, some advisers are playing to the president's occasional misgivings about the optics of some ICE tactics.

""I wouldn't say he's concerned about the policy,"" a top Trump adviser told Axios. ""He wants deportations. He wants mass deportations. What he doesn't want is what people are seeing. He doesn't like the way it looks. It looks bad, so he's expressed some discomfort at that.""

""... [T]here's the right way to do this. And this doesn't look like the right way to a lot of people.""

Several Republicans in Congress have expressed concern to the White House about how the raids are playing out, according to a person familiar with the discussions.

ICE's aggressive tactics are dominating the news and obscuring the White House's work on cost-of-living issues that congressional Republicans, Trump and his team see as more important.

By the numbers: The internal GOP polling that alarmed some Trump insiders was completed at the end of December, days before an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis.

60% of independent voters and 58% of undecided voters said Trump was ""too focused"" on deporting illegal immigrants, the poll viewed by Trump's team found.

33% said Trump was primarily deporting law-abiding people, as opposed to criminals.

ICE is taking a reputational hit. Two public surveys released this week — one from CNN, another from YouGov — found that most Americans said the agency was making U.S. cities less safe.

Another poll done for the Associated Press after Good's death found that just 38% of Americans now approve of Trump's immigration policies.

The big picture: ICE's tactics are drawing pushback from some prominent Trump supporters. Joe Rogan, who endorsed Trump on the eve of the 2024 election, complained on his show this week about ""militarized groups of people roaming the streets, just showing up with masks on, snatching people up.""

""Are we really going to be the Gestapo?"" he asked. ""'Where's your papers?' Is that what we've come to?""

Friction point: In its push to fulfill Trump's promise of mass deportations, ICE is not getting help from police in ""sanctuary cities"" such as Minneapolis and St. Paul, which ban local authorities from engaging in immigration enforcement.

State and local officials, including Gov. Tim Walz (D), have encouraged peaceful protests.

""You're only seeing chaotic ICE raids in blue sanctuary cities where local officials are fighting against federal law enforcement,"" Vice President Vance said Tuesday on X.

Reality check: Publicly, Trump and the White House continue to back an aggressive immigration approach.

In a Truth Social post Thursday, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota, which, among other things, could lead to him sending in National Guard troops.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are architects of the current effort, and they have Trump's support.

After the federal government took an axe to San Francisco Immigration Court in 2025, cutting its bench from 21 judges to four in a matter of months, it’s starting the new year by making that shrinkage permanent. Last week, the Department of Justice told court staff (opens in new tab) it will not renew its lease for offices and courtrooms at 100 Montgomery St. by the end of this year. The announcement was first reported by Mission Local.

The Montgomery Street facility housed 19 of the 21 judges at the start of 2025. Without it, San Francisco Immigration Court will run entirely out of its much smaller space at 630 Sansome St., where Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has offices. ICE officers routinely detain asylum seekers in the halls outside Sansome courtrooms, shuttle them a few feet down a hallway, and disappear them into a holding area. It’s a far quicker and more secretive process than the dozens of ICE detentions at the Montgomery building, which happened in public view on the street out front, leading to some of the past year’s most memorable confrontations between protesters and ICE.

In its internal announcement, the DOJ said all staff at Montgomery Street will be relocated to Concord Immigration Court this year. Several immigration law experts say that if cases are reassigned out of San Francisco, asylum seekers could be robbed of the unique bevy of services the city’s legal aid community provides.

“We‘ve been proud of ourselves as sort of like a model for the rest of the country for how to do large-scale, public-defender-style immigrant defense,” said Jordan Weiner, interim executive director at La Raza Centro Legal. “By shutting down SF immigration court, they’re doing a good job of making it harder for us.”

La Raza Centro Legal is part of the San Francisco Immigrant Legal Defense Collaborative, a group of 16 nonprofit organizations that provide legal support to people facing deportation. The collaborative ended 2025 with a flawless record in helping people detained by ICE at immigration court, winning 100% of habeas corpus cases filed in federal court to get those people released.

The city funds the coalition’s work and requires that nearly all of it take place in San Francisco. It’s unclear if San Francisco will pay for legal services at the Concord court, 25 miles away.

Concord’s court saw six of its 13 judges fired in 2025 and has a backlog of 6,000 cases.

“The judges in that court will now have to deal with a barrage of new cases on top of their already crushing caseloads,” said Shuting Chen, who was fired as anSF immigration judge in December.

What’s next

The culling of immigration judges has been one of the Trump administration’s most successful efforts to remake the federal judiciary to serve his policy objectives. In 2025, more than 125 immigration judges across the U.S. were terminated or accepted buyouts to retire early, shrinking the national judge corps by at least 15%. Courts in blue cities have fared far worse than average. In September, news leaked that the Trump administration planned to backfill the vacancies with 600 military judges. At least one of those military judges has already been fired (opens in new tab) for apparently granting asylum too frequently. In early December, the DOJ posted job openings for “deportation judges.”

The closure of Montgomery Street dashes hopes that any of the newly appointed or hired judges will restock the bench in San Francisco, which had one of the busiest immigration courts in the country.

“The court at Montgomery is an institution and, for many immigrants, the first real contact they have with the justice system in our country,” said Chen. “Its demise is an intangible loss … because the court is a symbol of the rule of law and judicial integrity and independence we’re supposed to have in this country.”

As of September, San Francisco Immigration Court had the nation’s 10th-largest backlog: 120,000 cases. For the thousands of asylum seekers whose judges have been fired, the most that they can do is refresh the DOJ website to see if their cases have been reassigned and when they might get a day in court. Many have received notice that their hearing dates have been pushed to 2029.

“There‘s a reason the Trump administration is trying to shut down the courts,” Weiner said. “Because that’s where you vindicate your rights.”

According to the DOJ’s memo, the Montgomery courts could be vacated as early as this summer, but it’s unclear when or where cases may be reassigned.

Weiner doesn’t think that will matter much in the end. “ I don’t think the administration has any plans for these cases ever to be heard,” Weiner said. “I think they’re going to keep finding ways to cut them off before they get to the final hearing.”",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_2pkhrvtcil08debgtat2vea610/-S1200x630-FPNG,N,,2026-01-16 12:00:07.215609

The changes, expected to come into force 1 March, have prompted widespread questions from readers about how the law could affect them.

The Compass spoke with HSM partner and immigration expert Alastair David to analyse some of the key nuances in the law.

We also consulted Daniel Altneu, a partner at Bedell Cristin, as well as Immigration Minister Michael Myles and Chief Officer Wesley Howell, to help break down what the law might mean for readers and their families.

The key changes and who is most impacted

One of the central changes in the bill is a significantly longer timeline before a person becomes eligible to apply for Caymanian status – 20 years for most people and 15 years for those married to a Caymanian.

Caymanian status brings with it the right to vote, the right to own businesses, and freedom from annual work-permit fees, which, in some professions, can run into tens of thousands of dollars a year. As a result, the changes carry a substantial financial and practical impact for people aspiring to status, as well as for their employers.

Other groups that are likely to feel the impact most quickly include new work-permit holders, who will not be able to change employers during the first two years of employment, and married couples, who face tighter rules around term limits and residency.

Who is covered by the old system?

Currently, the Caymanian Protection Act, while passed, is not scheduled to come into force until 1 March.

The bill includes transitional provisions. Anyone who already holds permanent residence will remain under the old system, meaning they will still become eligible to apply for Caymanian status after 15 years of residency.

“Under the earlier version of the bill, many more people would have been grandfathered in,” said David.

“Under the amended version, that protection largely applies only to people who already hold permanent residence.”

There is greater uncertainty for people who have applied for permanent residence but are still waiting for a decision on their application. If they do not get approval by the time the legislation comes into force, they will likely fall under the new provisions of the law, David believes.

“From what I can see, they will fall under the new system,” David said, noting that the law appears to treat the grant of permanent residency and the commencement date of the legislation, not the application date, as the cut-off point.

In an update published by HSM in a newsletter to clients, the firm wrote, “This amendment will adversely affect at least 600 people who are currently working pursuant to a Permission to Continue Working with pending PR applications if decisions are not given before the CPA comes into effect.”

For work-permit holders, the new job-change restrictions will apply once the act comes into force, so that provision largely impacts new arrivals to Cayman. Ultimately, the regulations will determine what exceptions apply.

Changes from the draft law

Changes to the transitional provisions in the draft act, which were approved by Parliament, have raised created uncertainty to who exactly would be ‘grandfathered’ in with respect to when they could apply for Caymanian status.

The initial draft of the law grandfathered in anyone who has a ‘certificate, permission or exemption’ – which lawyers say could have been interpreted quite broadly. The amended act passed by Parliament much more specifically references anyone who has been ‘granted the right to reside permanently’ in the Cayman Islands.

The finalised act creates a cut-off for the transitional provision to anyone who has legal permanent residence granted at the time the legislation is passed, in the view of two senior local attorneys who analysed the Act.

In simple terms, they say, if someone has a permanent-residence application in motion, that application will be treated under the old law, but a subsequent status application will fall under the new law.

Altneu, a partner at Bedell Cristin law firm, said this was an “unexpected shift” from the draft bill that would primarily impact those waiting for a decision under the permanent residence points system.

“The bill specified that these individuals would be fully grandfathered into the pre-existing pathways to the right to be Caymanian,” he said.

“Even if their applications were granted after commencement of the Caymanian Protection Act, they would have retained their eligibility to apply for the right to be Caymanian on grounds of naturalisation after at least 15 years’ legal and ordinary residence in the islands or at least five years after the receipt of their Certificate of Naturalisation or Registration. However, the act has removed that transitional protection.”

He added, “With pending Permanent Residency Points System applicants currently being scheduled for History and Culture Tests in May 2026, this change could have a meaningful impact on many individuals and families who had previously been reassured by the transitional provisions.”

Chief Officer Wesley Howell said anyone who applied before the act comes into force should still be under the old timelines – even for a future Cayman status application.

He said the transitional provisions were intended to prevent anyone from being disadvantaged.

“We’ve not sought to move the goalpost for anybody that has a legitimate expectation,” he said.

However, both lawyers say that is not what the law currently says, and if that is the intent they believe an amendment would be needed. The sought clarity could also perhaps be addressed by the forthcoming regulations.

A misconception about human rights laws

There is a common misconception that UK or international human-rights laws requires Cayman to offer citizenship after a fixed period of residence. According to David, that is not the case.

“There is no European or UK requirement that Cayman must grant citizenship after a certain period,” he said.

“Extending the timeline from 15 to 20 years is within the government’s margin of appreciation, and is likely to be lawful.”

He noted that the UK itself is currently debating extending its own timelines for long-term residency and citizenship.

Harkening back to the introduction of term limits, Howell said there is an EU provision that covers certain rights, acquired over continuous legal residency, but how that would be interpreted is unclear.

“How long is that piece of string? We don’t know,” he said. “We believe that it’s less than 10 years – that is the whole reason why term limits were introduced in the first place, because there was significant pressure in relation to the persons who had been the islands for decades without having any sort of long-term residency.”

How the changes affect married couples

For a relatively small but significant group of people, one technical change could have a major impact.

Under the existing system, married work-permit holders can benefit from whichever spouse has the longer remaining term limit. The new law reverses that position.

“This is the section that surprised me the most,” David said.

“The changes are punitive for married couples. Where spouses previously benefited from the longer remaining term limit, the new law ties both spouses to the shorter one.”

For example, a worker who might otherwise expect to remain eligible for work permits for nine years could find themselves limited to just three years if they marry a spouse who has already spent longer on the island. The spouse could still rollover or apply for permanent residence, but these are not always viable options for families.

Howell said the aim here is to prevent people racking up years of residency by default or “strategically extended their time limits by entering into marriages or civil partnerships”.

Another significant change removes provisions that previously allowed dependents of permanent residents to remain in Cayman after the death of their spouse.

“The consequence of that could be devastating,” David warned.

For instance, a stay-at-home parent and children could face legal uncertainty – or even removal – following the sudden death of the family’s main permit holder.

“The biggest potential legal challenges relate to marriage provisions and dependent rights,” he said.

The impact on spouses of Caymanians

Spouses of Caymanians will also face longer timelines.

The waiting period to apply for permanent residence increases from one year of marriage to seven years.

They will also be required to submit annual declarations to Workforce Opportunities and Residency Cayman (WORC) during that period.

The impact on people with children

There is one significant change for expatriate families. The minimum salary requirement to have a ‘dependent’ added to a work permit has increased significantly.

A minimum monthly income of $5,000 (up from $3,500) is required to include a single dependent on a work permit. Another $1,000 per month (up from $500) is required for each additional dependent.

So, a family of four, where only one parent works, would require a salary of $7,000 a month – $84,000 per year – to relocate to Cayman, compared with $4,500 a month or $54,000 annually under the previous legislation. A single mother-of-one would now need to earn at least $60,000 annually to bring her child to Cayman.

The thresholds apply for new permits, and there is potential impact for firms trying to attract talent from overseas, especially as a job or work-permit offer would clearly not include work or income for a spouse.

Where it gets complicated for people already in Cayman is on work-permit renewals. Immigration lawyers say they simply don’t know how these would be treated. But the potential scenario arises for people who have worked in Cayman for a number of years and are settled with families, that they may no longer meet the minimum salary requirements to have dependents stay with them when they apply for a new or renewed permit.

The Compass has sought clarity from government on this and are awaiting a response.

The job-hopping ban

The bill introduces a prohibition on work-permit holders changing employers during their first two years in Cayman.

The stated aim is to prevent job-hopping and clamp down on labour-brokerage schemes involving permits for jobs that do not exist.

There is a carve-out allowing workers to change jobs where they can satisfy WORC that there were “prescribed circumstances” leading to the termination of their employment, though those circumstances have not yet been set out in regulations.

“The restriction is not a complete ban,” David said.

“Its legality and fairness will depend on the exceptions written into regulations. If abused workers cannot change jobs, that would create serious problems.”

This will impact new permit holders only, so it doesn’t apply to someone who had a permit issued before the new legislation commences.

ID cards for work-permit holders

The law introduces a new fee for work-permit ID cards, though few details have been published about how the system will operate.

David raised concerns about enforcement.

“As drafted, officials could demand to see a work-permit ID card without reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed,” he said.

“From a civil liberties perspective, that is concerning.”

How the law helps Caymanians

The legislation is explicitly designed to prioritise Caymanians in the labour market. One of the main mechanisms for doing so is economic pressure.

“It will become more expensive to employ expatriates,” David said.

“That may encourage hiring Caymanians, but it will also affect industries where Caymanians are not available.”

Ultimately, he said, the success of the reforms will depend on how they are implemented.

“If, in five years’ time, Caymanians are progressing further and doing better, then that will be good for the country,” he said.

“But that outcome depends on how the law is applied.”

Myles believes it will not be meaningfully more expensive to hire from overseas. When Caymanians are not available, he says, work permits will be granted. As of now, the application fees have been subject to a small increase, but work-permit fees have not gone up.

He agrees that success is also about implementation in tandem with other reforms to improve training and education, and align scholarships with a workforce development plan.",https://caymancompass.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Immigration-reform-1920x1280-1.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 09:59:10.703029

While the panel of judges did not rule on the merits of the case, it did state that a judge in New Jersey does not have jurisdiction over it.

Federal laws require Khalil to challenge his case in immigration court first, the judges said in a 2-1 ruling. Then, he can appeal.

“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two. But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct,” judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas said in their ruling. “Because Khalil raises legal questions that a PFR (petition for review) court can meaningfully review later on, the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act) bars him from attacking his detention and removal in a habeas petition.”

Judge Arianna Freeman dissented, writing that “Khalil’s case requires us to tease these strands apart,” and that it can be decided by the district court.

“Khalil says his claims are now-or-never ones because his injuries are ongoing and his rights are ‘being violated, now,’” Freeman wrote. “But his claims raise legal questions challenging the government’s very basis for trying to remove (and thus detaining) him.”

Khalil, in a statement, said the ruling is “deeply disappointing, but it does not break our resolve.”

“The door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line, but it has not closed our commitment to Palestine and to justice and accountability,” he wrote. “I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called the ruling a “vindication of the rule of law and the simple truth that DHS has argued from the beginning: an immigration judge, not a district judge, has the authority to decide if Mr. Khalil should have been released.”

She maintained that the Trump administration “acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil” and said “DHS will work to enforce his lawful removal order.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey said the Trump administration cannot re-detain Khalil until the order officially takes effect, which will not happen while he can still appeal. This can mean having the case reviewed by all judges on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

“The Trump administration violated the Constitution by targeting Mahmoud Khalil, detaining him thousands of miles from home, and retaliating against him for his speech,” Bobby Hodgson, deputy legal director at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said. “Dissent is not grounds for detention or deportation, and we will continue to pursue all legal options to ensure Mahmoud’s rights are vindicated.”

Khalil’s cases

Immigration officials arrested Khalil, a legal resident in the U.S., last March at his apartment in Manhattan. Khalil participated in pro-Palestinian protests and campus encampments at Columbia in 2024.

The Trump administration accused the 30-year-old of being a “pro-Hamas sympathizer,” without providing evidence to support the claim.

In a two-page memo obtained by The Associated Press, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that Khalil could be expelled because of his beliefs, and accused him of antisemitic conduct and participating in disruptive protests. Khalil has denied these allegations of antisemitism, saying that he was criticizing Israel and the United States over what is happening in Gaza, and that the federal government is trying to suppress this speech.

After being detained for more than 100 days, Khalil was released in June when U.S. District Judge Michael E. Farbiarz ruled that it was likely that Rubio’s attempted deportation on foreign policy grounds would be ruled unconstitutional. In a separate order, Farbiarz declared that Khalil was neither a danger nor a flight risk.

Department of Homeland Security officials also alleged Khalil failed to disclose information on his green card application.

In September, a U.S. immigration judge denied Khalil’s motion for a waiver preventing his removal from the U.S. and ordered that he be deported to either Algeria or his native Syria.

Prosecutors have yet to charge Khalil with a crime in either case.

Deportations challenged in court

Four other student activists, Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi, Badar Khan Suri and Yunseo Chung, were similarly accused by the Trump administration of being a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests.

The New York Times reported that these students challenged their own deportations or detainments in separate, individual lawsuits. Those who were detained, the outlet wrote, were later ordered to be released.

Massachusetts Federal District Judge William G. Young ruled in September that the Trump administration chilled these students’ speech with arrests he said were aimed at striking fear to those critical of Israel.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25294548168147_AP_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 12:00:11.683150

This effort goes far beyond what Congress intended when it passed the underlying legislation,” Carter wrote.","A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit demanding California turn over its voter rolls, calling the request “unprecedented and illegal” and accusing the federal government of trying to “abridge the right of many Americans to cast their ballots.”

U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, a Clinton appointee based in Santa Ana, questioned the Justice Department’s motivations and called its lawsuit demanding voter data from California Secretary of State Shirley Weber not just an overreach into state-run elections, but a threat to American democracy.

“The centralization of this information by the federal government would have a chilling effect on voter registration which would inevitably lead to decreasing voter turnout as voters fear that their information is being used for some inappropriate or unlawful purpose,” Carter wrote. “This risk threatens the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy.”

Carter wrote that the “taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece by piece until there is nothing left,” and that the Justice Department’s lawsuit was “one of these cuts that imperils all Americans.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday.

In a video she posted to the social media platform X earlier Thursday, Assistant Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon — who heads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division — said she was proud of her office’s efforts to “clean up the voter rolls nationally,” including by suing states for their data.

“We are going to touch every single state and finish this project,” she said.

Weber, who is California’s top elections official, said in a written statement that she is “entrusted with ensuring that California’s state election laws are enforced — including state laws that protect the privacy of California’s data.”

“I will continue to uphold my promise to Californians to protect our democracy, and I will continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote,” Weber said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office called the decision another example of “Trump and his administration losing to California” — one day after another court upheld California’s congressional redistricting plan under Proposition 50, which the Trump administration also challenged in court after state voters passed it overwhelmingly in November.

The Justice Department sued Weber in September after she refused to hand over detailed voter information for some 23 million Californians, alleging that she was unlawfully preventing federal authorities from ensuring state compliance with federal voting regulations and safeguarding federal elections against fraud.

It separately sued Weber’s counterparts in various other states who also declined the department’s requests for their states’ voter rolls.

The lawsuit followed an executive order by President Trump in March that purported to require voters to provide proof of citizenship and ordered states to disregard mail ballots not received by election day. It also followed years of allegations by Trump, made without evidence, that voting in California has been hampered by widespread fraud and voting by noncitizens — part of his broader and equally unsupported claim that the 2020 presidental election was stolen from him.

In announcing the lawsuit, Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said in September that “clean voter rolls are the foundation of free and fair elections,” and that the Justice Department was going to ensure that they exist nationwide.

Weber denounced the lawsuit at the time as a “fishing expedition and pretext for partisan policy objectives,” and as “an unprecedented intrusion unsupported by law or any previous practice or policy of the U.S. Department of Justice.”

The Justice Department demanded a “current electronic copy of California’s computerized statewide voter registration list”; lists of “all duplicate registration records in Imperial, Los Angeles, Napa, Nevada, San Bernardino, Siskiyou, and Stanislaus counties”; a “list of all duplicate registrants who were removed from the statewide voter registration list”; and the dates of their removals.

It also demanded a list of all registrations that had been canceled due to voter deaths; an explanation for a recent decline in the recorded number of “inactive” voters in California; and a list of “all registrations, including date of birth, driver’s license number, and last four digits of Social Security Number, that were canceled due to non-citizenship of the registrant.”

Carter, in his ruling Thursday, took particular issue with the Justice Department’s reliance on federal civil rights laws to make its case.

“The Department of Justice seeks to use civil rights legislation which was enacted for an entirely different purpose to amass and retain an unprecedented amount of confidential voter data. This effort goes far beyond what Congress intended when it passed the underlying legislation,” Carter wrote.

Carter wrote that the legislation in question — including Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 — was passed to defend Black Americans’ voting rights in the face of “persistent voter suppression” and to “combat the effects of discriminatory and unfair registration laws that cheapened the right to vote.”

Carter found that the Justice Department provided “no explanation for why unredacted voter files for millions of Californians, an unprecedented request, was necessary” for the Justice Department to investigate the alleged problems it claims, and that the executive branch simply has no power to demand such data all at once without explanation.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0cb6ef1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3744x1966+0+265/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F50%2F7b%2F83443d6f42119729d7022bcae1d1%2F1502626-pol-me-california-democratic-convention-38-ajs.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:58:54.479496

Reuters reporting highlights the case of Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a Sierra Leonean national, who was deported to Ghana in November and detained before being sent back to her home country, illustrating the human and legal complexities of these removals.

Kuyateh’s Case

Kuyateh, 58, had fled Sierra Leone during the 1991–2002 civil war and lived in the United States for nearly 30 years. After being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July, she applied for protection against deportation, citing fears of torture linked to her father’s political opposition. Although an immigration judge granted her request, she was deported to Ghana in November, where she was held at a hotel for six days before being forcibly sent to Sierra Leone. Video footage of her being dragged to a van went viral, sparking international attention.

Third-Country Deportation Program

Kuyateh was one of more than 30 U.S. deportees sent to Ghana last year under agreements with West African countries. Of those, at least 22 were subsequently repatriated to their home countries despite protections granted in the U.S., according to legal filings and interviews with lawyers representing the migrants. Equatorial Guinea also returned at least three U.S. deportees, many of whom were at risk of persecution, torture, or human rights violations in their countries of origin.

Human rights advocates argue that this practice violates international law prohibiting refoulement, which forbids sending individuals to countries where they face serious harm. Critics contend that third countries are being used to circumvent U.S. and international protections.

U.S. and West African Government Positions

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended the removals, stating that all deportees were “illegal aliens” who had received due process. However, DHS did not address the subsequent repatriations, leaving questions about accountability. Ghana’s government said it only accepts migrants without criminal records and maintains that its actions are grounded in humanitarian principles, though some officials acknowledged that discussions with U.S. authorities included possible concessions related to visas and tariffs. Equatorial Guinea and the countries of origin largely did not respond to requests for comment.

Legal and Humanitarian Concerns

Lawyers and advocates say many deportees had valid protection claims. Some were targeted due to political beliefs, sexual orientation, or gender-based persecution. Video evidence and eyewitness accounts suggest that many were given no opportunity to contest their forced repatriation. U.S. courts have upheld the administration’s authority to deport individuals to third countries while legal challenges proceed, creating concerns over compliance with international human rights norms.

Impact on Migrants

The personal toll on deportees is significant. Kuyateh described being separated from her family in the United States and struggling to rebuild her life after being forcibly returned to Sierra Leone. Another migrant, Diadie Camara from Mauritania, described fear for his safety and the need to go into hiding after being repatriated via Equatorial Guinea and Morocco. Advocates emphasize the psychological and social hardships caused by the deportations, particularly for vulnerable populations with histories of conflict, slavery, or persecution.

Analysis

The use of third-country deportations highlights the tension between domestic immigration enforcement and international human rights obligations. From a realist perspective, the U.S. seeks to expedite removal of unauthorized migrants while minimizing direct responsibility for potential harm. However, this strategy risks undermining legal norms and creating diplomatic friction with host countries. For Ghana and Equatorial Guinea, participation may strengthen ties with the U.S. but exposes them to criticism for facilitating refoulement. The cases illustrate a broader ethical and legal dilemma: managing immigration pressures without violating international law or endangering vulnerable populations.

Home Depot faces criticism for ICE raids in store parking lots

Flock Safety's data used in immigration enforcement investigations

NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A group of Home Depot (HD.N), opens new tab investors is asking the company to review its partnership with surveillance firm Flock Safety and state how its data is used and shared with law enforcement, following reports by an independent media outlet that the vendor's data has been used in Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigations.

Home Depot locations have become hotbeds for ICE arrests, after U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller said the agency should target the home improvement chain, where migrant day laborers are known to gather.

Investors in several companies are increasingly seeking answers to how U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policies and enforcement are affecting company operations and reputation.

Zevin Asset Management, a sustainability-minded investor that owns more than $7 million in Home Depot stock, is leading a shareholder proposal with 17 co-filers asking Home Depot to evaluate and report the risks associated with sharing data with third-party surveillance vendors.

Zevin's proposal comes after a Walmart (WMT.O), opens new tab and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab shareholder asked the retailers for details on how the immigration crackdown is affecting their finances and supply chains, and as protests erupt after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by a U.S. Immigration agent in Minneapolis.

The investor group wants an ""assessment of privacy and civil rights risks, including discrimination or wrongful detention from misuse of customer data,"" according to the proposal seen by Reuters.

""Such practices may expose the Company to financial and legal risks, including potential data breaches and enforcement of evolving state privacy laws,"" shareholders said in the proposal. ""The Company already faces reputational risks stemming from frequent immigration enforcement raids occurring near its stores and heightened public concerns regarding data privacy.""

The company's annual shareholder meeting is expected in May.

Home Depot has faced criticism for ICE raids in its store parking lots, where immigrant day laborers often congregate looking for opportunities to work on construction projects. Some critics have said the company should speak out against the raids, which have prompted protests at some of its stores.

A Home Depot spokesperson said: ""We cannot legally interfere with federal enforcement agencies, including preventing them from coming into our stores and parking lots.""

Like other retailers, Home Depot collects demographic information including age, race, ethnicity and gender from companies that provide services on its behalf for fraud prevention, security and asset protection, according to its website.

The company discloses the information to ""law enforcement, public and government authorities"" that it considers ""reasonably necessary to comply with law, support investigations, and protect the rights and property.""

Home Depot also uses Flock Safety automated license-plate camera readers in its parking lots and in stores. The company does not grant access to its license-plate readers to federal law enforcement, the company spokesperson said. A report by digital publication 404 Media said ICE agents have used Flock Safety's data for immigration enforcement investigations after being sent the data by local law enforcement. Flock Safety does not have contracts with the Department of Homeland Security or its subagencies, including ICE, according to a source familiar with the matter.

The sharing of Flock Safety data by local police departments with ICE creates ""de facto federal surveillance without transparency or consent,"" the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, of which Zevin is a member, said in a letter to Home Depot's board of directors seen by Reuters.

The home improvement chain, which is not notified ahead of ICE enforcement, has advised employees to report immigration raids to the company, according to the spokesperson. The raids are recorded in a centralized database. Home Depot gives employees the option to go home, with pay, when these events occur.

Most of the resolutions, including the one at Home Depot, are nonbinding. A change by U.S. securities regulators could mean fewer such resolutions make it to corporate ballots in 2026. If this one does, the results could show the extent to which investors are worried about the financial implications of Trump's immigration policies.

The impeachment resolution was originally introduced by Congresswoman Robin Kelly (IL-02).

“Enough is enough. Under Secretary Noem, DHS, and ICE have systemically violated the rights and privacy of Americans, terrorized our cities, and obstructed Congress.

I will continue to use every tool available to hold this Administration accountable, to demand answers on behalf of the American people, and keep our communities safe,” said Congresswoman Elfreth.

The Constitution gives the U.S. House sole power of impeachment. The three articles of impeachment are:

1. Obstruction of Congress

Secretary Noem violated her constitutional oath and refused to comply with the law that prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from preventing a Member of Congress from entering a DHS facility used to detain undocumented immigrants.

There’s been documentation in which Members of Congress have tried to enter an ICE facility and were denied in Illinois, Texas, Colorado, California, New York, Virginia, and Washington.

2. Violation of Public Trust

Secretary Noem has repeatedly violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution. She’s also broken due process by directing ICE to conduct warrantless arrests and use violence against US citizens and lawful individuals.

During Secretary Noem’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, federal agents used excessive force, in some cases injuring or killing residents. Federal agents used military-style tactics to raid an apartment building in South Shore, detaining U.S. citizens for hours without warrants or reason for arrest. These dangerous actions have continued in cities across the country, including in Minneapolis, where Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed without justification.

3. Self-Dealing

Secretary Noem has misused her position for personal gain while inappropriately using $200 million taxpayer dollars to fund an ad campaign for ICE recruitment. She bypassed the normal competitive bidding process to award a contract to a firm called Strategy Group. Strategy Group was formed just days before the award and is run by the husband of senior DHS official Tricia McClaughlin, a close friend of Secretary Noem.

​​Require ICE to issue and enforce a nationwide policy prohibiting the routine use of masks by agents during civil enforcement actions.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Congressman Seth Moulton (MA-06) and Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03) sent a letter to the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee making clear that they will oppose any funding bill that expands Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) resources without strict guardrails and enforceable reforms.

In the letter to Chairman Mark Amodei (NV-02) and Ranking Member Henry Cuellar (TX-28), the lawmakers cited a growing national pattern of illegal and abusive ICE practices—underscored by the murder of Renee Good—including the use of excessive force, prolonged detention in facilities not designed to hold people, denial of medical care and legal access, and a lack of basic transparency. Congressman Moulton and Congresswoman Ansari also raised serious concerns about ICE’s use of masked agents during civil enforcement actions and numerous examples of ICE detaining U.S. citizens.

“Congress cannot keep writing blank checks to an agency that repeatedly violates the law and actively harms its own citizens,” said Congressman Moulton. “ICE has shown over and over again that it cannot be trusted to follow the law and protect the American people. Until ICE stops harming—and in some cases, killing—U.S. citizens and others in its custody, Congress should not spend another federal dollar on this agency. Our power of the purse is one of the only tools we have left to force accountability, and we need to use it.”

“ICE is a rogue agency that Donald Trump is deploying to terrorize communities,” said Congresswoman Ansari. “We must not approve any additional funding for this Trump militia force that has lost the trust, credibility, and legitimacy in the eyes of the American public. Instead, we need accountability in place for ICE’s abuses, including the assault and murder of people on city streets and in detention facilities. I urge our appropriators to hold ICE and Donald Trump accountable for their crimes.”

Congressman Moulton and Congresswoman Ansari state that they will not vote for a Homeland Security Appropriations bill that does not:

Freeze ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations funding at or below Fiscal Year 2024 enacted levels. No increases above that level should be provided without strict conditions on demonstrated compliance with detention standards, civil rights protections, and transparency requirements.

Prohibit the use of ICE field offices and processing centers for overnight or multi-day detention. Congress should require that all individuals be transferred to compliant detention facilities within a fixed number of hours, with mandatory notification to their attorney of record and an identified family member prior to transfer.

​​Require ICE to issue and enforce a nationwide policy prohibiting the routine use of masks by agents during civil enforcement actions.

Reaffirm and strengthen language guaranteeing immediate access for Members of Congress and designated staff to any DHS facility used to detain or hold individuals, without advance notice or administrative delay.

Require regular public reporting on length of stay in field offices, medical staffing levels, complaints received, and corrective actions taken, disaggregated by facility.

Require ICE to publicly report, on a quarterly basis, all instances in which United States citizens or lawful permanent residents are stopped, detained, questioned, or held by ICE. Reports should include the duration of detention, the asserted basis for the action, how citizenship or lawful status was verified, whether force or restraints were used, and whether the individual was transferred or released.

Condition the obligation or expenditure of funds for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations on the full reinstatement and independent operation of ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility and DHS oversight entities, including the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman. DHS should be required to certify to Congress that these offices are fully staffed, retain independent investigative authority, and may transmit findings directly to Congress without alteration, delay, or political interference.

“It’s a rare apology,” Mr. Pomerleau said, but he added that “an apology without a remedy is a hollow apology.”","In a federal court hearing on Tuesday in Massachusetts, the Trump administration acknowledged that it made a mistake when it deported a college student flying home for Thanksgiving.

Any Lucia López Belloza, 19, a freshman at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., was detained at an airport and deported to Honduras in late November after trying to surprise her family with a visit for the holiday.

Despite the administration’s rare admission of error, the government has not moved to drop the case, and it has generally sought maximum authority to detain and deport noncitizens.

Some wrongfully deported migrants were returned to the United States to face further litigation with little fanfare. But in several high-profile cases, such as the expulsion of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, Trump officials have dug in on attempts to carry out deportations even when immigration officials make mistakes.

Ms. López was detained by immigration authorities on Nov. 20 at Boston Logan International Airport. She was flown to Honduras two days later, despite a court order signed on Nov. 21 barring her deportation while her case was still pending.

In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Ms. López said, “I accept their apologies.” She added: “I hope that based on this apology I am able to return back to my studies and also to be home with my parents.”

Since being deported, Ms. López’s family has faced intimidation from immigration authorities. Early last month, agents in three unmarked vehicles appeared at her parents’ home in Austin, Texas. One agent rushed at her father, Francis López, but did not detain him after Mr. López fled into his house and locked the door.

In the court hearing on Tuesday, Richard G. Stearns, a U.S. District Court judge appointed by President Bill Clinton, indicated that he hoped to find a solution so Ms. López could return to the United States and continue her studies.

The Trump administration’s immigration clampdown, which has resulted in thousands of deportations, has at times gone ahead in contradiction of court orders.

In one notable case, more than 200 migrants were flown to El Salvador in March despite a court order demanding that the planes turn back. Mr. Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, was returned in June only to face further detention and deportation threats.

Todd Pomerleau, Ms. López’s lawyer, said on CNN that he appreciated that the administration admitted its mistake, and he hoped that would lead to Ms. López’s swift return.

Local leaders chime in after reports of ICE touring south Kansas City locations for possible detention center

After rumors of a possible detention center began swirling in Kansas City this week, federal agents were spotted in south Kansas City on Thursday. KMBC 9 saw Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the area of East 149th Street on Thursday morning. Jackson County Legislator Manny Abarca said on social media that he confirmed they are looking to build what he called a “mega detention facility.” Plans for these possible detention facilities were first reported in the Washington Post. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., first spoke against the possible detention sites, which he said would aim to hold 8,000 immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security reportedly awarded a $29.9 million no-bid contract to an organization to carry out the plan. The DHS has not confirmed reports of these facilities. Cleaver strongly condemned the reported plan, saying it will “degrade our society, divide our communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and stress the civility of our institutions to the point of fracture.” And he is not the only local leader who has expressed disapproval of the detention center, should it come to fruition. Mayor Quinton Lucas said his office was working to verify reports of a potential detention center but that it would work to ensure that “no such facility” comes to the Kansas City area. “I want to reaffirm our city’s commitment to being welcoming and inclusive,” Lucas said in a news release. “Kansas City has always been a place that embraces growth and opportunity, not fear and division. We believe in ensuring that all who live and visit our community feel valued and respected.” On the other hand, some local leaders seem to think that some language and actions involving recent ICE rumors have gone too far.

“Petitioner claims that he is detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1226(a) and is therefore eligible for a bond hearing. He contends that §1225(b)(2), which mandates custody of aliens detained at the border, does not apply to him.

“In this case, petitioner is mistaken. Both §1225 and §1226 are statutory provisions relating to the detention of aliens pending removal proceedings, not those, such as [petitioner Mario Alexis] Hernandez Martinez, who have already been ordered removed. Petitioner is, instead, subject to the provisions §1231, which provides for the custody of aliens with final orders of removal. That statute requires that an alien be removed within 90 days of their removal order becoming final (‘the removal period’), during which time their detention is mandatory.

It is unclear from the record why or how petitioner was released at the conclusion of his removal proceedings, or if he was ever in custody. What is clear, however, is that petitioner has been subject to a final removal order since at least July, 2023. The government concedes that his removal period has long since lapsed but that, because he is inadmissible under §1182(a)(6)(A)(i) as having been neither admitted nor paroled, he may nonetheless be detained under §1231(a)(6). The Court agrees and finds petitioner’ s detention lawful under these provisions. …

“While petitioner is correct that he is to be afforded due process, he is incorrect that his current detention contravenes that right.

(AP) — As Democrats across the country propose state law changes to restrict federal immigration officers after the shooting death of a protester in Minneapolis, Tennessee Republicans introduced a package of bills Thursday backed by the White House that would enlist the full force of the state to support President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Momentum in Democratic-led states for the measures, some of them proposed for years, is growing as legislatures return to work following the killing of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. But Republicans are pushing back, blaming protesters for impeding the enforcement of immigration laws.

Democratic bills seek to limit ICE

Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul wants New York to allow people to sue federal officers alleging violations of their constitutional rights. Another measure aims to keep immigration officers lacking judicial warrants out of schools, hospitals and houses of worship.

Oregon Democrats plan to introduce a bill to allow residents to sue federal officers for violating their Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.

New Jersey’s Democrat-led Legislature passed three bills Monday that immigrant rights groups have long pushed for, including a measure prohibiting state law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has until his last day in office Tuesday to sign or veto them.

California lawmakers are proposing to ban local and state law enforcement from taking second jobs with the Department of Homeland Security and make it a violation of state law when ICE officers make “indiscriminate” arrests around court appearances. Other measures are pending.

“Where you have government actions with no accountability, that is not true democracy,” Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco said at a news conference.

Democrats also push bills in red states

Democrats in Georgia introduced four Senate bills designed to limit immigration enforcement — a package unlikely to become law because Georgia’s conservative upper chamber is led by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a close Trump ally. Democrats said it is still important to take a stand.

“Donald Trump has unleashed brutal aggression on our families and our communities across our country,” said state Sen. Sheikh Rahman, an immigrant from Bangladesh whose district in suburban Atlanta’s Gwinnett County is home to many immigrants.

Democrats in New Hampshire have proposed numerous measures seeking to limit federal immigration enforcement, but the state’s Republican majorities passed a new law taking effect this month that bans “sanctuary cities.”

Tennessee GOP works with White House on a response

The bills Tennessee Republicans are introducing appear to require government agencies to check the legal status of all residents before they can obtain public benefits; secure licenses for teaching, nursing and other professions; and get driver’s licenses or register their cars.

They also would include verifying K-12 students’ legal status, which appears to conflict with a U.S. Supreme Court precedent. And they propose criminalizing illegal entry as a misdemeanor, a measure similar to several other states’ requirements, some of which are blocked in court.

“We’re going to do what we can to make sure that if you’re here illegally, we will have the data, we’ll have the transparency, and we’re not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you’re in jail,” House Speaker Cameron Sexton said at a news conference Thursday.

Trump administration sues to stop laws

The Trump administration has opposed any effort to blunt ICE, including suing local governments whose “sanctuary” policies limit police interactions with federal officers.

States have broad power to regulate within their borders unless the U.S. Constitution bars it, but many of these laws raise novel issues that courts will have to sort out, said Harrison Stark, senior counsel with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

“There’s not a super clear, concrete legal answer to a lot of these questions,” he said. “It’s almost guaranteed there will be federal litigation over a lot of these policies.”

That is already happening.

California in September was the first to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration officers, from covering their faces on duty. The Justice Department said its officers won’t comply and sued California, arguing that the laws threaten the safety of officers who are facing “unprecedented” harassment, doxing and violence.

The Justice Department also sued Illinois last month, challenging a law that bars federal civil arrests near courthouses, protects medical records and regulates how universities and day care centers manage information about immigration status. The Justice Department claims the law is unconstitutional and threatens federal officers’ safety.

Targeted states push back

Minnesota and Illinois, joined by their largest cities, sued the Trump administration this week. Minneapolis and Minnesota accuse the Republican administration of violating free speech rights by punishing a progressive state that favors Democrats and welcomes immigrants. Illinois and Chicago claim “Operation Midway Blitz” made residents afraid to leave their homes.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety and called the Illinois lawsuit “baseless.”

The agency statement said after the pursuit, Sosa-Celis got out of his vehicle and fought with the federal agent.

Two more illegal immigrants from Venezuela, Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma, came out of a nearby apartment, according to the agency.

All three attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, DHS said, before the agent opened fire, hitting Sosa-Celis in the leg.

The agent was taken to hospital. Sosa-Celis was also taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. All three Venezuelans were arrested.

""What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,"" said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.

She said the officer was ""ambushed and attacked"" by the men and fired a defensive shot.

On Wednesday night, clashes broke out between protesters and law enforcement in the Hawthorne area of Minneapolis, near the scene of the shooting.

City police chief Brian O'Hara said his officers were hit by fireworks, ice and snowballs.

Several vehicles belonging to the federal government were damaged in the disorder, and property was stolen from inside the vehicles, according to the FBI.

The FBI said on Thursday that it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the ""recovery of stolen government property and/or the arrest of individuals responsible for the destruction and theft of government property"".

Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has demanded ICE leave the city, said on X on Wednesday: ""No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable.""

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, made a direct appeal to the president on Thursday posting on X: ""Let's turn the temperature down.""

Walz, who has previously called ICE a ""modern-day Gestapo"", told Minnesotans: ""We cannot fan the flames of chaos.""

The Democratic governor, who ran for US vice-president alongside Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, said earlier this month he would end his bid for re-election.

The move came in the wake of a fraud scandal involving the state's welfare programmes.

Warning: This story contains descriptions of violence

The Iranian man, who arrived on Christmas Island by boat from Indonesia in 2013, was transferred by Australian authorities for processing on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.

His complaint to the UN Committee against Torture alleged he was held on Manus Island for around three years in harsh conditions and was subjected to violence, including having his throat slit by a security guard.

""The holding of the complainant in these conditions caused such harm to his physical and mental health that he became suicidal to end the suffering and engaged in self-harm,"" the UN committee's report found.

""Due to the stress, he suffers from a skin condition, psoriasis, which is disfiguring his face and body.""

The man was transferred to the Australian mainland in 2019 to undergo medical treatment, but remained in immigration detention for almost three years before being released into the community on a bridging visa in 2022.

A spokesperson for Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told the ABC it was ""Australia's consistent position that persons in regional processing countries do not engage our international obligations"".

Australia has long argued that while it funded the offshore detention facilities in Papua New Guinea, it did not have control over the Manus Island centre and day-to-day operations — a position rejected by the UN committee.

""Human rights protection and international law obligations do not disappear when detention facilities are relocated offshore,"" said Jorge Contesse, an international law professor and member of the UN Committee against Torture.

""Geography is not the test, but whether a state has placed a person in a situation where it has the power to prevent harm and fails to do so,"" Professor Contesse said in a statement.

Riots at the Manus Island detention centre in 2014 led to the death of another Iranian asylum seeker, Reza Berati.

A PNG court later jailed two staff from the facility for Mr Berati's murder.

Fellow former Manus Island detainee Boochani told the ABC it was ""paradoxical"" that the Australian government would condemn the Islamic Republic regime in Iran, including over its massacre of protesters in recent weeks, while detaining Iranian asylum seekers.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said this week that ""Australia stands with the brave people of Iran in their struggle against an oppressive regime"".

""We unequivocally condemn the Iranian regime's brutal crackdown on its own people — the killing of protesters, the use of force, and arbitrary arrests must stop,"" she said.

Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran who spent six years detained in PNG, said Australia's condemnation of Iran was a ""good step"".

Border Force reported in March 2025 there were 66 Iranians among a total of 980 people held in Australia's immigration detention centres.

Thousands more Iranians were living in the community on bridging visas with limited access to employment and essential services.

""When you keep people who escaped from a brutal regime and you put them in detention, or you leave them in the community without a proper visa, that means from the Australian government perspective — they can go back to their country,"" Boochani said.

""Iran is not a safe country … that is the reality. The Australian government should accept that and give protection to Iranian refugees.""

UN finds Australia also has responsibility for Nauru detention

The UN Committee against Torture this week directed Australian authorities to reassess the Iranian man's asylum claim, as well as provide him with ""appropriate redress, including compensation"" and rehabilitation.

Australia should ensure that ""similar violations do not occur in the future"", it added.

According to Australia's submission to the UN committee, the man remains in Australia on a bridging visa but could face transfer to detention on Nauru upon the expiry of his visa if not resettled to a third country.

A federal government spokesperson said it was ""carefully considering the views of the UN Committee against Torture in this individual complaint"".

In a similar finding to the torture committee, the UN Human Rights Committee found last week that Australia retained responsibility for the arbitrary detention of asylum seekers transferred to the Pacific nation of Nauru.

The UN refugee agency's acting director in Canberra, Karen Gulick, said that Australia's offshore detention policies stood in contrast to its position as a ""strong advocate for refugee protection"" on the international stage.

""We hope that Australia will take the opportunity of the Human Rights Committee's decisions to review its laws and domestic policies in line with its international responsibilities,"" she said.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e0db011c24f9d4b3c501dc6b5479fa82?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=160&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2026-01-16 00:58:22.121416

Late last year, Lopez Belloza questioned the Trump administration’s motives following her removal and other deportations of international students.","The Trump administration during court proceedings earlier this week apologized for deporting a student attempting to fly home for Thanksgiving break last year.

Babson College student Any Lucia Lopez Belloza was detained on Nov. 20 at Boston Logan International Airport before boarding a flight to surprise her family in Texas for the holiday.

Lopez Belloza, who entered the U.S. as a child, was sent back to Honduras days after being detained despite a ​​judge’s Nov. 21 order to keep her in Massachusetts or somewhere else in the U.S. for at least 72 hours, according to The Associated Press.

The Trump administration filed a Jan. 2 declaration notifying the court that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer failed to let officials in Port Isabel, Texas, know that Lopez Belloza’s removal needed to be canceled, the AP reported.

However, the officer admitted he believed the judge’s order did not apply once Lopez Belloza was no longer in the state.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a Tuesday hearing, “On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologize,” adding that the employee understands “he made a mistake,” according to the AP.

Sauter said the removal was the result of “an inadvertent mistake by one individual, not a willful act of violating a court order.”

Despite the controversy, the Trump administration maintained that it believes Lopez Belloza’s deportation was lawful, citing a decision from an immigration judge in 2016 ordering the removal of her and her mother. An appeal was dismissed a year later.

“I was hoping the government would show some leniency and bring her back. They violated a court order,” Lopez Belloza’s lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, said, per the AP.

Still, U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns said she was the victim of a “tragic” bureaucratic mistake.

“It might not be anybody’s fault, but she was the victim of it,” Stearns said, noting that Lopez Belloza could reenter the country after securing a student visa.

Late last year, Lopez Belloza questioned the Trump administration’s motives following her removal and other deportations of international students.

“Why is [President Trump] getting people who are living in the United States working day and night, people, people like me, who are in college, doing their dreams, having an education?” she asked in an interview with ABC News.

“It feels unfair,” Lopez Belloza told ABC. “If there was an order, then why did everything happen to me so fast, within three days?”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AP23179543029973-e1762432399547.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-16 03:57:58.084711

What we know

President Donald Trump said today on Truth Social that he would invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota politicians ""don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job.""

The Insurrection Act, a rarely used 1807 law, gives the president the authority to deploy the military domestically without prior congressional approval.

The Department of Homeland Security said a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis last night, alleging the man fled after a traffic stop and attacked the officer.

The shooting came a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in the city, sparking local and nationwide protests and vigils.

Protests have continued, with federal agents using tear gas and flash bang devices on the streets of Minneapolis. Video showed protesters launching fireworks at officers.

Around 3,000 federal agents have been sent to Minnesota in what DHS says is the biggest operation in its history. The city has about 600 police officers, Mayor Jacob Frey said.

Trump and senior government figures have said they are determined to root out ""corruption"" they have linked to the local Somali population.

Gov. Tim Walz called on the federal government to end the ""occupation"" and said agents were ""kidnapping people for no reason.""

'It feels like an invasion': Minnesotans stunned as federal officers flood their state

The federal officers arrived weeks ago. But since the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, their numbers have swelled — and people here say the weight of it all is inescapable. Federal officers are flooding the sidewalks of their neighborhoods, honks and whistles sound when they are near and, occasionally, the smell of chemical agents wafts by.

The scale, the sustained intensity and the aggression demonstrated by law enforcement deployed here appears to be greater than immigration enforcement operations that took place in other blue cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, all of which are larger than Minneapolis in land mass and population.

The officers are in unmarked cars idling on neighborhood streets. They are going door to door, residents said. They are seen inside stores and in retail parking lots, including at the Target in Richfield, south of Minneapolis, the day after Good was killed.

Residents’ videos of violent arrests are proliferating on social media, including one of a woman dragged from her car. Some videos provided to NBC News by activists show officers smashing car windows or spraying chemicals point-blank into the faces of residents.

“It feels like an invasion,” said a woman who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation. She was protesting at the Whipple federal detention facility at 7 a.m. on a frigid, 12-degree morning. The woman, a restaurant owner, said she closed her business temporarily because she was trying to protect her employees who were immigrants. “It feels very much like a Nazi Germany situation to me. It needs to stop, and people need to know what’s going on.”

Lawsuit accuses agents of racial profiling in Minneapolis

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for Minnesota against ICE on behalf of three people who say they have been racially profiled in recent weeks, the ACLU said in a statement.

“The Trump administration has been clear in its targeting of the Somali and Latino communities through Operation Metro Surge. President Trump called people from Somalia ‘garbage,’ said ‘we don’t want them in our country,’ and told them to ‘go back to where they came from,’” the statement read in part.

“Following Trump’s comments, ICE and CBP agents have indiscriminately arrested — without warrants or probable cause — Minnesotans solely because the agents perceived them to be Somali or Latino,” it said.

In an emailed statement, the Department of Homeland Security denied wrongdoing and called the allegations “disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE.”

L.A. mayor 'deeply alarmed' by reports of ICE activity in Fashion District

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she is ""deeply alarmed"" by reports of ICE activity in the city's downtown Fashion District, which was one of the first areas targeted in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown over the summer.

""This show of force by ICE is particularly troubling given the recent ICE escalation and violence in American cities, including the fatal shootings of Keith Porter Jr. by an off-duty ICE agent on New Year’s Eve here in Los Angeles and Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis,"" Bass said in a statement today. ""Equally troubling are the President’s threats of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would bring military intervention into our cities.""

She said the administration's tactics only ""sow terror"" and ""disrupt basic principles of safety.""

Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., also posted on X earlier today that his office received reports of “heavy ICE presence” and agents actively walking the area near 12th and Maple streets in the Fashion District.

'They just shot a lady': Logs show frantic response to shooting

Newly released transcripts of 911 calls and dispatch logs provide an additional look at the chaotic moments after an ICE officer shot Renee Good to death on Jan. 7 — and emergency responders’ attempts to save her.

The documents, which NBC News obtained through public records requests, begin with witnesses calling 911 to report the shooting near the corner of East 34th Street and Portland Avenue. One caller, who isn’t identified in the transcript, says that they saw an ICE officer shoot through a woman’s windshield, that she tried to drive away but crashed and that her partner ran to help. “She’s bleeding,” the caller says.

A second caller tells a dispatcher: “They just shot a lady. Point blank range in her car.” He says they shot her “cause she wouldn’t open her car door. There’s video of it, too.” The caller pleads: “Send an ambulance please.”

Dispatch logs indicate that the first 911 call was at 9:38 a.m. The logs indicate screaming in the background of that call. There’s a request for crowd control and to block off the area around the shooting.

By 9:42 a.m., the first EMS personnel arrive, from the Minneapolis Fire Department. They find the victim in the driver’s seat, unresponsive and bloody. They remove her from the car, set her on a snowbank and find apparent gunshot wounds on her chest, left arm and head. They begin trying to save her life, using chest compressions, a tourniquet, breathing devices and other techniques, and are eventually joined by paramedics from Hennepin County Medical Center.

The shooting scene grows more frenzied, with a crowd becoming “hostile,” the logs say. By 10:04, the ICE officer who fired — later identified as Jonathan Ross — has been taken to a federal building. The log says “agitators” gather on the perimeter of the scene, cutting down police tape. A call goes out for someone to have federal personnel leave the scene. The crowd grows more agitated. People try to surround federal officers.

The medics keep working on the victim in an ambulance and at the hospital until they finally stop at 10:30 a.m. Over dispatch, her name is announced: Renee Macklin Good. City Council members and the mayor arrive. Federal officers deploy pepper spray on people near the scene. People throw ice and snow at them. “Going to be overrun shortly,” says a 11:08 a.m. note in the log. Soon after, federal agents leave, the crowd calms, and the FBI arrives to start processing the scene.

Attorneys representing Renee Good's family ask federal government to preserve evidence

Attorneys for Renee Good’s family say they’ve sent a letter asking the federal government to preserve evidence for possible legal action.

The letter was to ensure “no evidence is destroyed,"" including Good’s vehicle and videos and communications sent between agents, law firm Romanucci & Blandin said in a statement today.

“We hope the federal government will comply with their legal obligations. But if they do not, the government’s failure to preserve evidence could lead to potential sanctions for non-compliance with their legal and ethical obligations,” the firm said.

The attorneys also sought to clear up “persistent false reports” and stressed that Good had no criminal or felony record.

“Renee and Becca Good were responsible community members who lived peacefully and did not engage in harmful conduct toward others, including the federal agents involved on January 7, 2026,” the team said.

About 3,000 federal agents are in the Minneapolis area

There are roughly 3,000 federal agents on the ground in the Minneapolis area making immigration arrests, a federal law enforcement official told NBC News.

They include more than 2,000 ICE officers and agents, hundreds of Border Patrol agents and some personnel from Justice Department agencies.

A Minneapolis man said his children had to be taken to the hospital after an officer reportedly threw tear gas toward his vehicle.

The man said he was traveling with his family when the incident happened.

All of the kids were in the back, and “my wife was in the front seat. I was pulling off,” he said. “I don’t know if it came from the bottom, came through the vents, but my car just filled up like it caught on fire.”

He said all six of his children, ages 6 months to 11 years old, were taken to the hospital.

“My kids can’t breathe,” he said.

Classroom changes announced

St. Paul Public Schools, with more than 30,000 students, said it would begin offering an online learning option for students who do not feel comfortable going to school. Schools will be closed next week until Thursday to prepare for those accommodations.

Minneapolis Public Schools, which has a similar enrollment, is also offering temporary remote learning. The University of Minnesota will start a new term next week with different options depending on the class.

He said he watched the protests from his house.

Ross, who has lived in the city for 40 years, said he has never seen its people quite as energized as now.

“Minneapolis has changed,” he said. “But Trump sees that, and he’s trying to take advantage of this small city.”

Suspect charged with assault after allegedly ramming truck into ICE vehicles in Dallas

Federal officials announced assault charges Thursday against a man who allegedly used a truck loaded with heavy equipment to ram into federal agents’ vehicles during an immigration arrest in Dallas last month.

Jerson Lopez-Sanchez, 28, was charged with three counts of assaulting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to a grand jury indictment filed in the U.S. Eastern District of Texas. He is not currently in custody and has yet to turn himself in, the indictment said.

Jay Combs, the U.S. Attorney for the district, told reporters that the ICE agents were clearly identified as law enforcement at the time of the incident.

“When someone runs down an ICE officer — or any federal or local law enforcement officer — those deadly weapons act as battering rams,” Combs said. “It is a violent attack and it will not be tolerated.”

Lopez-Sanchez had no known criminal background or active warrants, according to officials as of Thursday, Combs said.

The charges stem from a Dec. 1 incident in which ICE agents on patrol were asked do a “routine check” on a Chevrolet Silverado, the indictment said. Officials said five people were in the truck but Lopez-Sanchez was the owner and driver of the Silverado.

Gov. Walz makes direct appeal to Trump: 'Stop this campaign of retribution'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made a direct appeal to President Donald Trump in a Thursday post on X.

“Let’s turn the temperature down. Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are,” he wrote.

His plea came after the president warned that he would invoke the Insurrection Act if state politicians didn’t “obey the law” and “stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.” The rarely used Insurrection Act authorizes the president to deploy the military domestically without prior congressional approval.

Walz also appealed to Minnesotans.

“I know this is scary. We can — we must — speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully,” the governor said. “We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That’s what he wants.”

AG Pam Bondi says she fired 6 prosecutors after they tried to resign

Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that she fired six prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota after they attempted to resign.

“We had six prosecutors who suddenly decided they didn’t want to support the men and women in ICE,” Bondi said in a Wednesday-night interview.

It was reported that the prosecutors resigned over their concerns about the handling of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“They said, ‘We want to resign, but we want to use our annual leave up until April,’ meaning they wanted the taxpayers to pay for them to go on vacation because they decided they didn’t want to support law enforcement,” Bondi said. “So, the breaking news tonight, I fired them all.”

Trump says he will invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota politicians 'don’t obey the law'

President Donald Trump said in a post today on Truth Social that he would invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota politicians ""don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job.""

The Insurrection Act, a rarely used 1807 law, gives the president the authority to deploy the military domestically without congressional approval. Last year, Trump repeatedly floated invoking the Insurrection Act in order to federalize National Guard troops.

ICE may soon be conducting operations in Maine, mayor says

Mayor Carl Sheline said in a statement yesterday that ICE may conduct enforcement in Lewiston “soon.” He did not provide additional details in the statement about how he was made aware of the possible operation.

“I understand that this is an unsettling time for many of our residents,” he said. “Lewiston is a strong city and we care about our community and each other. Please check on your neighbors and stay safe.”

He urged residents and businesses to know their rights and prepare a “plan of action” in case ICE stops them.

Asked for comment on Sheline’s post about an operation in Lewiston, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin did not confirm the report.

“Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country,” she said. “We do not discuss future or potential operations.”

Maine Gov. Janet Mills said her administration has attempted “unsuccessfully thus far” to confirm reports that federal operations are planned in the state.

Nonetheless, her administration is preparing, she said. She said she directed Maine State Police to work with law enforcement, been in contact with city officials in Portland and Lewiston, and is coordinating with the attorney general’s office.

“If any operations take place, our goal — as always — will be to protect the safety and the rights of the people of Maine,” Mills said.

She also issued a warning to the federal government saying: “If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused — those tactics are not welcome here.”

Walz to Trump, Noem: ‘End this occupation’ as ICE raids continue

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called out the continued presence of ICE in the state, saying what is happening in the state “defies belief” and said agents were “kidnapping innocent people with no warning.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260115-minneapolis-mb-1029-610c0c.jpg",N,,2026-01-16 00:58:12.668448

A top official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is resigning from her post after less than a year to mount a Republican campaign for Congress in a northwest Ohio district that is one of the most competitive in the country.

Madison Sheahan, 28, announced her campaign for Ohio’s 9th Congressional District on Jan. 15, challenging incumbent Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who won reelection by a narrow margin in 2024. The district includes Toledo and swaths of northwest Ohio.

“In less than one year with ICE, I've stopped more illegal immigration than Marcy Kaptur has in her 43 years in Washington,” Sheahan said in a campaign launch video.

Sheahan, who called herself a “Trump conservative” in the video, graduated from Ohio State University in 2019. She was on the women’s rowing team and studied public affairs, according to her biography from ICE. She was deputy director at ICE before resigning.

Sheahan worked for former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem — now the secretary of Homeland Security, the department that includes ICE — and then as the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.

“When the call came to help President Trump clean up the dangerous immigration mess as deputy director of ICE, I answered the call,” Sheahan said in her video.

If elected, Sheahan would also be the youngest member of Congress. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida first elected in 2022, is approximately one month older than Sheahan.

Kaptur is the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress. She was first elected in 1982, but her district was drawn to be more Republican in the latest redistricting cycle.

Kaptur was one of 75 Democrats to vote alongside Republicans on a resolution expressing support for ICE in June 2025, which drew pushback from some other Democrats. Ohio’s other Democrats in Congress also supported the resolution.

""While Republicans from near and far will fight through a messy primary in this district they gerrymandered again just this fall, Congresswoman Kaptur is focused on delivering real results for her constituents,"" Kaptur's campaign said in a statement shared with The Dispatch.

""She's working to lower costs for working families, protect access to affordable health care, and bring transformative investments to Northwest Ohio. Voters are tired of the self-dealing corruption and culture of lawlessness they've seen over the last year,"" Kaptur's campaign added.

Sheahan joins a crowded Republican primary field that includes state Rep. Josh Williams, former state Rep. Derek Merrin and Air Force veteran Alea Nadeem. They will face off in the GOP primary in May.

David Gedert − also known as the drag queen Sugar Vermonte − is running as a libertarian in the district.

The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan analyst, identifies the race in OH-9 as a Democrat toss-up.

A demonstrator was hit in the face with a projectile fired by a federal officer at close range during a Southern California protest, leaving him bloodied and with serious injuries, according to video and accounts from fellow protesters and family on Tuesday.

The Friday gathering outside the federal immigration building in the city of Santa Ana was in response to the shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a federal agent, which has kicked off a wave of protests around the country.

Hundreds of people had marched in the streets in Santa Ana until a smaller group was left outside the federal building by evening, shouting expletives through megaphones about Immigration and Customs Enforcement, video showed. At one point, they burned what appeared to be an American flag on the steps of the building while shouting “Justice for Renee Good.”

The verdict was met with cheers, tears and cries of jubilation as the presiding judge announced the words that would end a seven-year legal ordeal for the humanitarians. All 24 had engaged in rescue work on the Aegean island at the height of the refugee crisis.

“It took 2,897 days for the obvious to be delivered by the justice system,” said Zacharias Kesses, the lawyer who represented six of the defendants. “Today, the three-member felony court of appeal of the North Aegean delivered a courageous judgment.”

The European parliament had described the prosecutions as “the largest case of the criminalisation of solidarity in Europe” and proceedings had been closely watched internationally.

Rights groups had spoken of a test-case moment for the treatment of humanitarians across the continent when tolerance for aid work has waned as migrant policies have hardened. Greece – a frontier state – has for years been accused of forcibly expelling migrants from its land and sea borders, with pushbacks especially prevalent in the Aegean. The centre-right government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has called the policies “strict but fair” although it has denied the expulsions.

Ahead of Thursday’s court proceedings – resuming six weeks after the criminal trial began in Mytilene – Human Rights Watch called the case a “perverse misrepresentation of life-saving humanitarian work”. It had urged Greek authorities to drop the “baseless” charges.

“The acquittals are a vindication for the defendants but are also bittersweet,” said Eva Cosse, a senior researcher in the group’s Europe and Central Asia division. “These abusive prosecutions have virtually shut down lifesaving work even as people continue to drown in the Aegean. The Greek authorities should stop criminalising solidarity, end pushbacks and prioritise saving lives.”

The defendants included Sara Mardini, the Syrian refugee immortalised in the Netflix movie The Swimmers, and Sean Binder, a German-born Irishman who, like Mardini, spent 100 days behind bars after his arraignment in 2018. At the time of their arrests they ranged in age, with most of the aid workers in their 20s and 30s but some in their early 70s.

Bonded by the same idealistic desire to help at a time when the then-bankrupt country was struggling to cope with an influx of Syrians fleeing civil war, all had volunteered with the search-and-rescue organisation, ERCI. Now dissolved, the aid group had been based in Lesbos, among the islands closest to the shores of Turkey that had fast become a magnet for refugees.

Greek police claimed the aid workers had facilitated the illegal entry of migrants by monitoring maritime radio signals and using encrypted messaging apps to gain advance notification of the location of smugglers’ boats heading from the Turkish coast.

Among the lesser charges the defendants had also faced was espionage. In January 2023, a court threw out that accusation, citing insufficient proof, with supporters hailing the dismissal as indicative of the volunteers’ innocence. Rights groups had described the charge as “farcical”.

Earlier, while giving evidence before the court, defendants had argued that what they had been involved in was legitimate human rights work of helping people on the move, and often at risk of drowning, as they endeavoured to reach safety.

Reacting to the judgment, Binder said: “The court reached the only decision it could today based on the limited legal basis of the charges and the flimsy evidence the prosecutor presented.”

Binder described the gruelling effects of lives put on hold by the prolonged criminal proceedings. First detained at the age of 24, the trainee barrister is now 31.

“It is a huge relief that I will not spend the next 20 years in a prison cell, but at the same time it is troubling that this should ever have been a possibility,” he said.

“Today it was made clear, as it should always have been, that providing life-saving humanitarian assistance is an obligation, not a crime. That using WhatsApp is normal, not evidence of criminality. That buying laundry machines for a refugee camp does not make someone a money launderer. This acquittal must set a precedent.”

Amnesty International, which had sent delegations to Lesbos to monitor the trial, said it hoped Thursday’s decision would send a “strong signal” to Greece and other European countries that “defending human rights should be protected and celebrated, not punished”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507947fc12dd88f9c9dd7fd8d63f48c7789f7d1c/313_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e96ad2a67037261a9f694a0e4d007ad",N,,2026-01-15 22:57:39.700868

During a call with reporters on Thursday, several group leaders said the Department of Homeland Security is violating human rights with raids by U.S, Customs and Enforcement agents, and immigrant detentions that they say are not properly documented.

“The government overreach and abuse of power we have seen from the Trump administration is unlawful, unacceptable and un-American, and we would note that the overreach and abusive power are harming not only our communities but also our country as a whole,” UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguia said.

“What the Latino community has experienced in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and most recently Minneapolis, feels like this administration has declared war on our community and that we are under assault by our own government. That is why this coalition is demanding Congress use its oversight and appropriations power to ensure transparency and to hold the administration accountable,” Murguia said.

UnidosUS and 73 other human rights and faith-based organizations on Thursday sent a letter to House and Senate leaders urging lawmakers to rein in abuses and restore accountability to federal immigration enforcement actions.

In the letter, they accuse the federal government of not maintaining comprehensive records on immigrant detentions and they urge lawmakers to ask “urgent questions about when and how federal officers use force.”

“A lack of public accountability and even disinformation spread by public officials about recent events appears intended to indicate that longstanding and well-established legal and constitutional rights are irrelevant in the context of immigration enforcement activities,” they wrote.

They also cite recent immigrant deaths.

The Mexican consulate in Atlanta on Thursday reported the death of a Mexican national in ICE custody near Atlanta, bringing the toll of detained deaths to five in just the first 15 days of 2026, according to immigration data tracker Austin Kocher of Syracuse University. There were a record-setting 30 deaths in ICE custody in 2025, Kocher says.

And the Washington Post reported Thursday that the El Paso County Medical Examiner is likely to classify the death of Cuban-born Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, at ICE’s “Camp East Montana” tent camp detention center in El Paso as a homicide. A detainee says he witnessed Campos being choked to death by guards, according to the Post.

Mark Morial, of the National Urban League, says this is a “state of emergency” and the country “is, quote, creeping toward totalitarianism.”

“The enforcement actions of this administration and the fact that they’re not about immigration or public safety. Millions of people in this country including U.S. citizens are being deprived of the freedom to go about their daily lives due to an unnecessary and excessive show of force,” Murguia said.

National civil rights organizations are calling on Congress to exercise its constitutional oversight authority and include enforceable guardrails in legislation and in Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations to include:

Prohibit the domestic deployment of military personnel or resources for immigration enforcement or policing, reaffirming long-standing limits on military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

Ban masked federal agents and require clear identification and body cameras; codify sensitive-location protections for schools, hospitals, courts and places of worship; suspend 287(g) agreements until independent oversight is in place; and ensure arrests and detentions are properly documented and legally authorized.

Require judicial warrants for all arrests and detentions, transparent reporting and independent investigations into deaths or wrongful detentions, access to legal counsel and family for detained individuals, and prohibitions on mass detention, dragnet surveillance, and the use of non-immigration data for enforcement purposes.

“Public Safety depends on trust and cooperation between people and institutions overreach breaks that partnership and makes every community less safe,” said Juan Proano, CEO of LULAC.

President Donald Trump's administration appealed that ruling, arguing the deportation decision should fall to an immigration judge, rather than a federal court.","A federal appeals panel on Thursday reversed a lower court decision that released former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.

The three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel is unconstitutional.

But in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.

“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two,” the panel wrote. “But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct.”

Thursday’s decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security Department spokesperson, called the ruling “a vindication of the rule of law.”

In a statement, she said the department will “work to enforce his lawful removal order” and encouraged Khalil to “self-deport now before he is arrested, deported, and never given a chance to return.”

It was not clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.

In a statement distributed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Khalil called the appeals ruling “deeply disappointing.""

“The door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line, but it has not closed our commitment to Palestine and to justice and accountability,"" he said. ""I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”

Baher Azmy, one of Khalil's lawyers, said the ruling was “contrary to rulings of other federal courts.""

“Our legal options are by no means concluded, and we will fight with every available avenue,” he said.

The ACLU said the Trump administration cannot lawfully re-detain Khalil until the order takes formal effect, which won't happen while he can still immediately appeal.

Khalil’s lawyers can request that the panel's decision be set aside and the matter reconsidered by a larger group of judges on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, or they can go to the U.S. Supreme Court.

An outspoken leader of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia, Khalil was arrested last March. He then spent three months detained in a Louisiana immigration jail, missing the birth of his first child.

Federal officials have accused Khalil of leading activities “aligned to Hamas,” though they have not presented evidence to support the claim and have not accused him of criminal conduct. They also accused Khalil, 31, of failing to disclose information on his green card application.

The government justified the arrest under a seldom-used statute that allows for the expulsion of noncitizens whose beliefs are deemed to pose a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests.

In June, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that justification would likely be declared unconstitutional and ordered Khalil released.

President Donald Trump's administration appealed that ruling, arguing the deportation decision should fall to an immigration judge, rather than a federal court.

Khalil has dismissed the allegations as “baseless and ridiculous,” framing his arrest and detention as a “direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza.”

New York City’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, said on social media Thursday that Khalil should remain free.

“Last year’s arrest of Mahmoud Khalil was more than just a chilling act of political repression, it was an attack on all of our constitutional rights,” Mamdani wrote on X. “Now, as the crackdown on pro-Palestinian free speech continues, Mahmoud is being threatened with rearrest. Mahmoud is free — and must remain free.”

Judge Arianna Freeman dissented Thursday, writing that her colleagues were holding Khalil to the wrong legal standard. Khalil, she wrote, is raising “now-or-never claims” that can be handled at the district court level, even though his immigration case isn't complete.

Both judges who ruled against Khalil, Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas, were Republican appointees. President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman to the 3rd Circuit, while Trump appointed Bibas. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, appointed Freeman.

The two-judge majority rejected Freeman's worry that their decision would leave Khalil with no remedy for unconstitutional immigration detention, even if he later can appeal.

“But our legal system routinely forces petitioners — even those with meritorious claims — to wait to raise their arguments,"" the judges wrote.

The decision comes as an appeals board in the immigration court system weighs a previous order that found Khalil could be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

His attorneys have said he faces mortal danger if forced to return to either country.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem announced Thursday via X that longtime U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attorney Charles Wall will serve as the agency’s new deputy director as enforcement operations intensify nationwide.

""Effective immediately, Charles Wall will serve as the Deputy Director of @ICEGov,"" wrote Noem. ""For the last year, Mr. Wall served as ICE’s Principal Legal Advisor, playing a key role in helping us deliver historic results in arresting and removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from American neighborhoods.""

Wall replaces Madison Sheahan, who stepped down earlier Thursday to pursue a congressional run in Ohio. Her departure left ICE leadership in transition at a moment when the agency has faced increasing resistance to enforcement efforts and heightened threats against officers in the field.

The move comes as the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement against murderers, rapists, gang members and suspected terrorists living illegally in the U.S., even as sanctuary jurisdictions and activist groups seek to block or disrupt ICE actions.

ICE officials said Wall brings more than a decade of experience inside the agency.

""Mr. Wall has served as an ICE attorney for 14 years and is a forward-leaning, strategic thinker who understands the importance of prioritizing the removal of murderers, rapists, pedophiles, gang members, and terrorists from our country,"" Noem added.

Wall most recently served as ICE’s principal legal advisor, overseeing more than 3,500 attorneys and support staff who represent the DHS in removal proceedings and provide legal counsel to senior agency leadership.

He has served at ICE since 2012, previously holding senior counsel roles in New Orleans, according to DHS.

DHS has described the appointment as part of a broader effort to ensure ICE leadership is aligned with the Trump administration’s public safety priorities.

The leadership change comes as ICE operations have drawn national attention following protests in Minneapolis after the ICE-involved fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7.

Administration officials have repeatedly emphasized that ICE’s focus remains on what they describe as the ""worst of the worst"" criminal illegal aliens, warning that local resistance and political opposition increase risks for officers carrying out enforcement duties.

“Kansas City should not take part in obstructing or appearing to obstruct legitimate state & federal law enforcement efforts,” Willett said in a text message.
A Port KC spokesperson confirmed that both buildings are owned and operated by Platform Ventures.
Port KC has very limited ability to disallow a sale of the facility,” the Port KC letter said.
Port KC, he said, is trying to get information but Platform Ventures is not returning anyone’s calls.","Following reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is considering opening a detention center in south Kansas City, the Kansas City Council passed an ordinance Thursday stating the city wouldn’t grant such a facility local permits, licensing or other approvals.

The local law enacts a five-year moratorium on approvals for non-municipal detention centers within city limits. In a statement, Mayor Quinton Lucas directly attributed the action to emerging reports regarding the potential ICE facility.

“​​We consistently hear from residents that Kansas City’s focus should be on economic development and housing, not mass detention facilities holding thousands,” Lucas said in a statement Thursday. “Our priority is building businesses, homes, and schools that strengthen and grow our community.”

The statement added that the city intends to “use all available legal tools to enforce the moratorium.”

But one city council member, Nathan Willett of the First District, cast doubts on the effort.

“Kansas City should not take part in obstructing or appearing to obstruct legitimate state & federal law enforcement efforts,” Willett said in a text message. “Upon further legal counsel, I learned the ordinance itself cannot be enforced due to The Supremacy Clause. The city would lose in court.”

Ahead of Thursday’s council vote, several Kansas City-area officials confirmed reports that ICE is considering opening a detention center in the far southern part of the city.

Among them was 6th District Councilmember Johnathan Duncan, who told The Star that the city was “looking at all tools at our disposal to slow and prevent this from happening.”

Jackson County Legislative Chair Manny Abarca said that he confirmed with Department of Homeland Security agents on site that ICE and the DHS are planning to construct a detention center in an industrial building just outside of Grandview city limits to Kansas City’s far south.

Agents allegedly told Abarca that the facility would have capacity for about 7,500 detainees, which is consistent with a Washington Post story earlier this week that listed Kansas City as a potential detention center site.

Abarca took to social media Thursday morning to condemn the proposed detention center, calling on residents and local elected officials to mobilize against its development.

“Local Electeds must step up, and engage,” Abarca wrote on X. “We cannot sit ideally by and let things happen in our community.”

ICE did not respond to an inquiry from The Star.

Questions about the building

The Port Authority of Kansas City, a local development agency that grants incentives, released a letter on Thursday that said it has been “made aware of rumors regarding an industrial building” at 4001 E. 149th St. in South Kansas City.

The building in question appears to be a warehouse and is part of the former Richards-Gebaur Air Force base, which has been turned into an industrial and business park with multiple warehouse-type buildings.

The Port KC letter says that the building, and the land it’s on, are wholly-owned and managed by Platform Ventures, a Kansas City-based real estate company.

While the Port KC letter references 4001 E. 149th St., television news footage appears to show the building across the street and listed as 14901 Botts Rd. The development contains multiple warehouse buildings, including one listed in city records as 4001 E. 149th St. and another listed as 14901 Botts Rd.

A Port KC spokesperson confirmed that both buildings are owned and operated by Platform Ventures.

Port KC’s letter says that the agency entered into a development agreement in 2022 with Platform Ventures to build multiple industrial buildings on the site and called the transformation of the area a success.

“To be clear, the building referenced was built and occupied solely as an advanced logistics and industrial facility. It is wholly owned by a private entity. Port KC has very limited ability to disallow a sale of the facility,” the Port KC letter said.

“Under no circumstances would Port KC offer any development support to a use that is not consistent with our mission to bring quality industrial and logistics jobs to the community. We will continue to monitor any proposed sale or use of the Platform Ventures facility that would change its use.”

Duncan, whose district includes the site, told The Star on Thursday afternoon that his understanding is that Platform Ventures notified Port KC that the firm was going to sell a warehouse it owns to the Honeywell national security campus across the highway.

“It’s only through leaked documents did the city find out that they were actually going to sell to DHS,” Duncan said.

Duncan said that, to his knowledge, Port KC’s calls to Platform Ventures have gone unanswered over the past 48 hours. Port KC, he said, is trying to get information but Platform Ventures is not returning anyone’s calls.

Platform Ventures’ website directed to a 404 error page on Thursday afternoon. Ryan and Terry Anderson, who are listed as co-presidents and co-founders on an archived version of the website, did not immediately respond to email or text messages.

“We should be publicly and privately shaming Platform Ventures,” Duncan said. “They are a Kansas City company that has received public dollars for years and they need to get the message that the Kansas City community does not appreciate being sold out by a local company for quick financial gain.”

ICE expanding

The Washington Post reported last week that Kansas City is one of at least seven cities across the United States where ICE plans to build detention centers with 5,000 to 10,000 beds each. The Post reported that the centers would be built in warehouses and that ICE is seeking contractors in Stafford, Va.; Hutchins, Texas; Baytown, Texas; Hammond, La.; Glendale, Az.; and Social Circle, GA, along with Kansas City.

After the report was published, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat, condemned the DHS’ plan to open in Kansas City, questioning whether the current federal administration plans to respect local zoning policies and processes. ‘

“Kansas Citians do not want this administration’s reckless, deadly, and incompetent deportation policies in our back yards,” Cleaver wrote in a Jan. 13 letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.

Rumors about planned ICE actions in Kansas City, including the use of south KC warehouse as a detention center site, have been mounting among residents and on social media all week, prompting local officials’ probes.

A video went viral earlier this week showing ICE officers arresting an unarmed man outside of the Briarwood Gardens Apartments in Grandview.

Also this week, dozens of marked ICE vehicles could be seen in a parking lot near the Worlds of Fun amusement park in North Kansas City.

Duncan previously said that a KC-area automotive company had been contracted to add decals to the vehicles but that they were not set to be used in any sort of imminent immigration enforcement operation in the city.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, along with its California chapter (CAIR-CA), today condemned the political grandstanding and scapegoating of Afghan nationals and the false and defamatory allegations made against CAIR during a recent Congressional joint subcommittee hearing, calling it part of a broader attack on American Muslims and Muslim-serving organizations, particularly those who support Palestinian human rights.

On Wednesday, Jan. 14, the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a joint subcommittee hearing to address former President Joe Biden’s Afghan Parolee Program.

The hearing included a testimony from Julie Marzouk, a fringe anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim extremist. Marzouk was a founding member of the Intelligent Advocacy Network (IAN), an apparent front group for the Israeli lobby whose primary purpose appears to be smearing critics of the Israeli government.

The organization has posted various conspiracy theories about CAIR and other critics of the Israeli government. The New York Post had to correct an article after it cited a false claim made by the IAN that CAIR-CA had raised tens of thousands of dollars for student vandals on college campuses.

Marzouk was invited by members of the subcommittee who have previously espoused Islamophobic rhetoric, including Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), whose anti-Muslim behavior CAIR has previously condemned, and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), who has participated in the harmful targeting of Texas’ Muslim population.

During the hearing, Senators Hawley and Cornyn and Marzouk repeated baseless allegations and blatant falsehoods recycled from anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim groups in an attempt to discredit CAIR, including factually inaccurate claims of misused and untraced federal funding. All three speakers demonstrated a concerning lack of understanding of grant processes and the U.S. immigration process, even going so far as to claim that CAIR’s immigration attorneys are responsible for vetting immigrants—a process that is performed by federal government officials. Their discordant arguments also referenced Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s politically motivated campaign against the Muslim-led EPIC City Project and Gov. Abbott’s and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ recent defamatory and unconstitutional designations of CAIR as a terrorist organization as “evidence.”

Prior to the hearing, CAIR sent a letter to the subcommittee chairs outlining its California chapter’s immigration work and countering the unsubstantiated allegations against the organization. Earlier this week, CAIR also sent a letter signed by more than 40 organizations in support of CAIR-CA and its service to immigrant communities.

In a statement, CAIR National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell, Esq., said:

“The legacy of Senator Joseph McCarthy is alive and well in the Senate. Several senators used this committee hearing to spread debunked conspiracy theories and fan the flames of hate against immigrants, refugees, and Americans critical of U.S. foreign policy, especially American Muslims.

“Calling in an anti-Muslim bigot and acolyte of the Israeli government to serve as a witness is bad enough. Letting such an individual spew hate without any pushback is unacceptable.

“We stand in solidarity with the Afghan American community and the Afghan refugee committee, and we applaud CAIR California for the work it has done to serve the people of California, including new Californians establishing a better life for their families.”

In a statement, CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said:

“The Joint Subcommittee Hearing was a disgraceful display of political grandstanding meant to demonize vulnerable Afghan immigrants and smear the organizations that serve them. Rather than meaningfully addressing policy or community safety, the hearing was used to disparage CAIR and our long-standing work serving immigrant and refugee communities—particularly the Afghan community—by echoing demonstrably false claims pushed by anti-Muslim and pro-Israel groups.

“These unfounded allegations are part of a larger defamation campaign targeting American Muslims by fringe anti-Muslim groups and individuals, such as Julie Marzouk, who intentionally misrepresent public documents and information to create a false narrative. These individuals have been recycling the same tired and refutable claims about CAIR and CAIR-CA and attempted to weaponize the hearing in a flailing effort to fulfill their anti-Muslim and xenophobic political agenda.

“It’s clear that our work threatens Israel-first politicians and activists who would rather Muslims remain silent and invisible in American society. CAIR-CA is proud of our partnership with the State of California in providing critical services to thousands of immigrant families, and we will not be intimidated by these transparent, politically motivated attacks.”

Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen want to redirect a portion of funding allocated for immigration enforcement as part of the GOP-backed multitrillion-dollar domestic spending and tax cut package passed last year toward local law enforcement.

Their proposal comes a day after Congressional Progressive Democrats vowed to oppose any funding for ICE after a Minnesota woman was killed by an immigration officer. The push comes amid recent polling that indicates growing support for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Nevada Democrats’ proposal also came on the same day as the centrist Searchlight Institute, founded by a staffer for the late Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, pleaded with congressional Democrats not to fall into a “trap” by allowing themselves to be accused of wanting to “defund” ICE, the Bulwark reported.

The massive spending bill signed by President Donald Trump last summer allocated $175 billion to immigration enforcement over several years. Cortez Masto and Rosen said on Wednesday they were sponsoring legislation that would reallocate $75 billion to law enforcement.

“The Trump Administration’s actions are not making our communities any safer, in fact they’re doing just the opposite,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “Instead of giving ICE $75 billion extra dollars to hire untrained ICE agents to patrol American communities, let’s invest that money where it will actually help – in hiring local police officers who are trained to fight crime in a way that earns community trust.”

Many local police agencies work with ICE to conduct enforcement. The ACLU found in the first eight months of Trump’s second term “the number of local agencies opting to act as deportation force multipliers has grown by 600 percent.”

Funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, is expected to be debated as the U.S. Senate takes up appropriations bills ahead of a Jan. 30 deadline.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that ICE funding is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.”

The Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which Rep. Steven Horsford is the only Nevada member, said this week it would oppose any federal funding going toward immigration enforcement.

Their announcement follows the death of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was killed last week by an immigration officer. Her death has sparked nationwide protests, including some in Nevada.

The Trump administration has spent the first year back in office carrying out a campaign promise for more aggressive immigration enforcement and a pledge for mass deportation.

Both Cortez Masto and Rosen noted in their announcement Wednesday that 73% of individuals held in ICE detention didn’t have a criminal conviction while less than 5% had a violent criminal conviction. They also pointed to a ProPublica analysis that found more than 170 U.S. citizens had been detained by ICE.

“The Trump Administration’s mass immigration enforcement is causing chaos and instilling fear in our communities because they are going after law-abiding immigrants and even U.S. citizens,” Rosen said in a statement.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260112_1039-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 00:58:17.169002

The Court thus concludes that Tran’s present detention exceeds Respondents’ regulatory authority.","Where a petitioner has filed an emergency motion for reconsideration, the petitioner’s present detention exceeds the respondents’ regulatory authority, so the motion should be allowed and the respondents should be ordered to release the petitioner pursuant to an order of supervision already in effect.

“… Petitioner is a sixty-nine-year-old noncitizen who entered the United States as a refugee from Vietnam around 1982, when he was about twenty-six years old. … In 2000, Tran received a final order declaring him removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). … At that time, because the United States did not have a repatriation agreement with Vietnam for people who had arrived in the United States before 1995 (‘pre-1995 arrivals’), it was not possible to obtain travel documents for Tran. … He was detained for six months following the entry of his final order of removal, then released from custody on an order of supervision in April 2001. …

“In 2020, the United States and Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Understanding (‘2020 MOU’), pursuant to which Vietnam has begun to accept removals of pre-1995 arrivals. … In September 2025, following a routine email check-in, Tran was instructed to report to ICE’s Boston Field Office. … He reported as instructed, and an ‘officer informed [him] that ICE [was] now able to deport individuals to … Vietnam.’ … The officers asked whether Tran had a passport or other travel document. … Tran did not have a travel document, but he was willing to begin paperwork to request one. … Tran completed a self-declaration form right then and ICE detained him shortly thereafter. … Tran remains in ICE detention and ICE intends to detain him until he can be removed to Vietnam. …

“Tran filed his Petition on September 11, 2025. … On November 26, 2025, Respondents filed a response in which they stated that the ‘legal issues presented in [Tran’s] Petition’ were similar to those presented in Morales v. Plymouth County Correctional Facility, No. 25-cv-12602, ECF No. 15 (D. Mass. Sept. 30, 2025), and that ‘should the Court follow [that] reasoning …, it would reach the same result here.’ … Relying on this, the Court followed its reasoning in Morales and ordered that Tran receive a bond hearing. …

“Eight days later, on December 4, 2025, Tran filed the instant emergency motion for reconsideration, … asserting that Morales was inapplicable and that he was still seeking a decision on the arguments presented in his Petition. …

“… Because the Court concludes that ICE exceeded its regulatory authority when it redetained Tran, the Court does not reach the question of whether his redetention was unlawful on constitutional grounds. …

“… When Tran was redetained, there had not been any ongoing effort to remove him. Tran was detained solely on the basis that other pre-1995 arrivals had successfully been removed, and because the government expected that, after completing the process of requesting and receiving travel documents, it would similarly be able to remove Tran. In other words, there was no individualized determination of his circumstances. …

“ICE’s analysis under §241.13(i) must be ‘individualized.’ … The only reasons that ICE had for redetaining Tran on September 11 were that (1) other pre-1995 arrivals had successfully been removed and (2) Tran had completed a self-declaration form. As noted, these two facts alone are not sufficient, in light of the factors enumerated in §241.13(f), to establish that Tran was reasonably likely to be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. …

“The Court next considers whether this action is moot or requires a different outcome in light of the further steps taken by Respondents during the three months that Tran has been detained — namely, completing his application for travel documents and presenting it to the Vietnamese government. The Court concludes that it is not. Though the government has taken further steps, the record does not yet suggest that Tran’s removal is significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future, particularly given the number of pre-1995 arrivals who are not promptly removed following the submission of a request for travel documents. The Court thus concludes that Tran’s present detention exceeds Respondents’ regulatory authority. …

Following the federal funding deal passed in mid-November 2025, Congress faces another January 30th deadline to pass the remaining appropriations bills to fully fund the government for fiscal year (FY) 2026; this includes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill.

Recent atrocities committed against both immigrants and citizens under the Trump administration have shone a light on abuses of power by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its parent agency, Customs and Border Protection (CBP). However, these abuses are hardly new. Since ICE and CBP were established in 2003, the agencies have terrorized immigrant communities, conducted unconstitutional border checkpoints, torn apart families, denied immigrants their due process rights, and subjected detained immigrants to physical, sexual, and mental abuse. The killing of Renee Good in Minnesota was the 9th ICE shooting since September 2025.

ICE also received an influx of billions in additional funding from the so-called “One Big Beautiful” bill. The bill placed no guardrails or conditional oversight on the use of this money, essentially creating a $75 billion slush fund for ICE to continue their violent attacks on communities across the country.

Call on your representatives to block any DHS appropriations bill or Continuing Resolution (CR) that maintains funding for ICE. This lawless and violent agency must be defunded and dissolved for good.

The two people who came out of the apartment are in custody, it said.

The city of Minneapolis said on X that the man shot was in the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

""We understand there is anger,"" it said. ""We ask the public to remain calm.""

The shooting took place about 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) north of where Good was killed.

Clashes in court as well

Earlier Wednesday, a judge gave the Trump administration time to respond to a request to suspend its immigration crackdown in Minnesota, while the Pentagon looked for military lawyers to join what has become a chaotic law enforcement effort in the state.

""What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,"" state Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement. U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case ""on the front burner"" and gave the U.S. Justice Department until Monday to file a response to a request for a restraining order.

The judge said these are ""grave and important matters,"" and that there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

Justice Department attorney Andrew Warden suggested the approach set by Menendez was appropriate.

The judge is also handling a separate lawsuit challenging the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officers when they encounter protesters and observers. A decision could be released this week.

During a televised speech Wednesday evening, Gov. Tim Walz described Minnesota as being in chaos, saying what's happening in the state ""defies belief.""

""Let's be very, very clear, this long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,"" he said. ""Instead, it's a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.""

Walz added that ""accountability"" will be coming through the courts.

Military lawyers may join the surge

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down. The Pentagon is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist.

CNN, citing an email circulating in the military, says Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is asking the branches to identify 40 lawyers known as judge advocate general officers or JAGs, and 25 of them will serve as special assistant U.S. attorneys in Minneapolis.

Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson appeared to confirm the CNN report by posting it on X with a comment that the military ""is proud to support"" the Justice Department.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking more details.

It's the latest step by the Trump administration to dispatch military and civilian attorneys to areas where federal immigration operations are taking place. The Pentagon last week sent 20 lawyers to Memphis, U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant said.

Mark Nevitt, an associate professor at Emory University School of Law and a former Navy JAG, said there's concern that the assignments are taking lawyers away from the military justice system.

""There are not many JAGs but there are over one million members of the military, and they all need legal support,"" he said.

An official says the agent who killed Good was injured Jonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who killed Good, suffered internal bleeding to his torso during the encounter, a Homeland Security official told The Associated Press.

The official spoke to AP on condition of anonymity in order to discuss Ross' medical condition. The official did not provide details about the severity of the injuries, and the agency did not respond to questions about the extent of the bleeding, exactly how he suffered the injury, when it was diagnosed or his medical treatment.

There are many causes of internal bleeding, and they vary in severity from bruising to significant blood loss. Video from the scene showed Ross and other officers walking without obvious difficulty after Good was shot and her Honda Pilot crashed into other vehicles.

She was killed after three ICE officers surrounded her SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from her home.

Bystander video shows one officer ordering Good to open the door and grabbing the handle. As the vehicle begins to move forward, Ross, standing in front, raises his weapon and fires at least three shots at close range. He steps back as the SUV advances and turns.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said Ross was struck by the vehicle and that Good was using her SUV as a weapon — a self-defense claim that has been deeply criticized by Minnesota officials.

Chris Madel, an attorney for Ross, declined to comment on any injuries.

'An agent of peace'

Good's family, meanwhile, has hired a law firm, Romanucci & Blandin, that represented George Floyd's family in a $27 million settlement with Minneapolis. Floyd, who was Black, died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground in the street in May 2020.

The firm said Good was following orders to move her car when she was shot. It said it would conduct its own investigation and publicly share what it learns.

""They do not want her used as a political pawn,"" the firm said, referring to Good and her family, ""but rather as an agent of peace for all.""

Students march against ICE

Waving signs reading ""Love Melts ICE"" and ""DE-ICE MN,"" hundreds of teenagers left school in St. Paul and marched in freezing temperatures to the state Capitol for a protest and rally.

The University of Minnesota, meanwhile, informed its 50,000-plus students that there could be online options for some classes when the new term starts next week. President Rebecca Cunningham noted that ""violence and protests have come to our doorstep."" The campus sits next to the main Somali neighborhood in Minneapolis.

They think so,John Domen,,,,,https://wtop.com/maryland/2026/01/can-democratic-lawmakers-curb-federal-immigration-efforts-in-maryland-they-think-so/,"While affordability and the state’s budget are the themes talked about by Democratic legislators, some of the laws they intend to quickly pass will target the efforts of federal immigration officers operating in the state of Maryland.
One bill, Senate Bill 1, which is reserved for legislation that wants to make a symbolic point, would prohibit federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while conducting normal operations.
“Anything that is not expressly outlined in the Constitution is the responsibility of the state,” Ferguson said.
“How a law enforcement entity operates in the state of Maryland is subject to Maryland state laws and constitution.” Folden expressed skepticism about that.
“They’re literally federal law enforcement officers that have a job description, and they’re enforcing the law of the land.","While affordability and the state’s budget are the themes talked about by Democratic legislators, some of the laws they intend to quickly pass will target the efforts of federal immigration officers operating in the state of Maryland.

One bill, Senate Bill 1, which is reserved for legislation that wants to make a symbolic point, would prohibit federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while conducting normal operations.

“I think all of us can sit back and imagine if you’re sitting in your car and somebody runs up to you, even as a law enforcement agent that quickly shows us a badge and has their face covered, I know I would be terrified,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson. “It’s just not how you build trust in policing.”

With a super majority in both chambers, a version of the bill is expected to pass over the objections of Republicans like Frederick County State Sen. William Folden.

“I don’t think that as a state, we’re allowed to tell the federal government — we can’t tell them what their policies are going to be,” Folden said. “Let’s be very transparent on this. If we didn’t have… activists going out and doxing these agents and their families and putting their addresses out on social media and endangering them — their well being — as well as their family. You wouldn’t have this problem.”

Folden, who spent decades with Maryland State Police, calls the bill an “irrational response” from Democrats who want to distract voters from issues of affordability, especially as it pertains to energy bills around the state.

Ferguson said under the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the state has the power to pass bills like this.

“Anything that is not expressly outlined in the Constitution is the responsibility of the state,” Ferguson said. “How a law enforcement entity operates in the state of Maryland is subject to Maryland state laws and constitution.”

Folden expressed skepticism about that.

“I don’t know that that’s accurate,” he said. “They’re literally federal law enforcement officers that have a job description, and they’re enforcing the law of the land.

Folden compared the high number of deportations under former President Barack Obama’s administration to ICE’s operations in the U.S. under President Donald Trump.

“We didn’t see this,” he said. “We didn’t see these people out there doxing federal agents.”

Ferguson did admit the issue would likely end up in the courts.

Another issue likely to be decided in a courtroom is the participation of local enforcement agencies with Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which allows local officers to help ICE identify and remove noncitizens arrested for another crime. Efforts to keep local agencies from participating in that program stalled out last year.

Ferguson and House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk say that won’t happen this time.

“Immigrants deserve to live with dignity and respect,” Peña-Melnyk said. “How can we as Americans stand by the disrespect? The abuses? People losing their lives? Racial profiling? Civil rights violation?

“It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Republican, a Democrat,” she added. “What’s right is right, what’s wrong is wrong. You don’t treat any human being that way. My God, that I believe in, loves everyone.”

Ferguson described ICE as a “paramilitary force” that was “offensive to humankind” during his comments Wednesday.

“Of course, we should enforce the law, but we don’t need to do it in a way that disrespects humanity,” Ferguson said. “So until there is a major shift, until there is a major restructuring of how that organization functions, Maryland should not be partnering and furthering an organization that does not follow Maryland values.”

But Folden touted the system and said scrapping it will only lead to more chaos.

“The process we have in place is very uniform,” Folden said. “It’s justified, as they’re already under arrest for another offense, and it’s not invasive into our communities, as far as boots on the ground going in and being disruptive. It’s only when they have another contact with law enforcement for an arrestable offense.”

He said the elimination of the program in Maryland would likely lead to the sort of efforts and encounters happening in Minnesota.

Folden also isn’t sure the state has the power to tell elected sheriffs, whose jobs exist under the state constitution, when they can and can’t engage with federal agencies. If the bill is passed into law, it’ll be a judge who makes that determination.

“They’re already lining up. They’ve already got counsel,” said Folden, about some sheriffs’ offices. “They’re lining up because everyone can see the writing on the wall. It’s about virtue signaling. It’s not about anything else except hiding their own mismanagement of funding and taxpayer dollars.”

I see a White House that is panicking and that is losing. [HONKING, SCREAMING] I think that this aggression represents political weakness. It’s an attempt to shut people up, because what they’re saying and what they’re doing is actually impeding your ability to accomplish your goals. When you actually look closely at what’s happening in Minnesota, what you see are hordes of agents, a dozen people, 20 people, trying to execute a single arrest. And that is because an organized network of observers is working to prevent escalation and prevent violence. ICE can’t do anything without being followed, and that reduces the odds that they act in dangerous and aggressive ways. Minnesotans, in other words, are standing up for their communities and pushing back against ICE and the Customs and Border Protection in a real way that is preventing them from doing their worst. But if you zoom out from Minnesota and look at the national political picture, what you see is an embattled agency. ICE has never been more unpopular than it is right now. First, majorities of Americans in a recent YouGov poll, 53 percent, said that they did not think that the shooting of Renee Nicole Good was justified. 42 percent of Americans said that they would support the elimination of ICE as an agency. Abolish ICE has very quickly gone from what some may have considered the fringes of American politics to the mainstream. And short of ending the agency, there is majority support for slashing its funding, for putting restrictions on agents, for requiring them to remove their masks and show identification. [SHOUTING] The public, broadly, is just tired of what they’re seeing and want something to be done about it. And I think the administration knows that. I think the administration knows, I think the president knows they made a mistake in the initial aftermath of Good’s killing when they condemned her as a domestic terrorist. “This was an act of domestic terrorism.” And then we see things like the Department of Justice going to investigate Good and her wife and lawyers at the D.O.J. resigning in response. And so to save face, the administration has unleashed ICE on the people of Minnesota. It’s doing the only thing it seems to know how to do, which is to escalate with its aggression, under the idea that you can just shut people up if you kick them hard enough. But what we’re clearly seeing is that this approach doesn’t cause people to retreat. It causes them to dig in, to double down, to show more resolve in the face of what is plainly tyranny. ICE is not going to be able to suppress the people of Minnesota, and the administration isn’t going to win the political battle over this.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/arts/op-jamelle-ice-minnesota-thumb/op-jamelle-ice-minnesota-thumb-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay,N,,2026-01-15 19:58:15.167799

He deployed troops to Washington, D.C. — a unique situation where the president controls the National Guard.

But ultimately, the deployments ended because of esoteric case law and round-the-clock legal preparation and wrangling, according to the Democratic attorneys general from those states.

Earlier this month, President Trump pulled hundreds of National Guard troops from California, Oregon and Illinois after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration in the Illinois case.

It was a major win for the Democratic states that had been fighting against the deployments, after troops had been federalized against the wishes of those states' governors. It required nearly constant coordination and communication between states as they worked to understand and define the archaic and rarely used legal mechanism that the Trump administration used to justify the deployments.

""We were in uncharted territories. This had never happened before,"" remembers California Attorney General Rob Bonta. ""And California was on the front lines from day one.""

In June of last year, in a bold and unprecedented move, Trump seized control of California's National Guard — against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes — and deployed more than 4,000 troops, along with the Marines, to the streets of downtown Los Angeles to protect federal immigration officers and facilities as protests broke out against them.

It was the first of what would become a pattern in the following months, as Trump deployed the National Guard to several Democratic-led cities around the country, claiming that the deployments were necessary because of violence and rampant crime — a claim that data contradicted and several local and federal judges called into question.

NPR reached out to the White House for comment on this story. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that ""if Democratic leaders had spent half as much time addressing crime, their communities would be much safer,"" reiterating that Trump is committed to safety and security.

Even before Trump's re-election, several Democratic attorneys general had been prepping for the likelihood that he would deploy the military to U.S. cities if he won a second term. It's something that he and some of his closest advisors had talked openly about on the campaign trail as an option to assist with immigration enforcement efforts.

""We had done a lot of homework for this exact issue,"" says Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield.

Once Trump deployed Guard troops to Los Angeles, the legal mechanism the administration would likely use became clearer. Deployments to California – and eventually Oregon and Illinois – were all done citing a 19th century law called 10 U.S.C. 12406, which had very little precedent around it.

The law hinges on vague terms that can be open for interpretation, like ""rebellion"" and ""invasion.""

""Since this law has been used so rarely in our history, we had very little sense of what any of these terms meant, because none of them are defined by the statute,"" says Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.

That meant that the court battles against these deployments could help define the law.

""Case law and litigation becomes a really important mechanism by which we kind of give these terms meaning,"" Mirasola says.

Bonta in California says that's one reason he and his team felt so much pressure to get their legal response right.

""Our case was first. So if we stumbled, or if there was bad precedent set, or if there was a broad, expansive view of Trump's authority and that allowed him to do what he did in L.A. and then repeat it or escalate it into more cities, there was a lot at stake,"" Bonta says.

Meanwhile, other Democratic states were watching California, hoping to learn from their legal fight.

""We were definitely in touch (with Bonta's office) right when it happened, not knowing when the hammer would drop for us,"" remembers Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul.

Bonta encouraged his team to share as much as they could with other states.

""I basically said, 'Tell them everything,'"" he said.

California reached out to other states, other states reached out to each other.

Over the course of several months, Trump threatened deployments to Baltimore and Oakland, Calif. He deployed troops to Washington, D.C. — a unique situation where the president controls the National Guard. And then, later in August and into September, Chicago and Portland, Ore. became the clear focus.

""We were on high alert,"" remembers Rayfield, of Oregon, who says he told his team that the goal was to block the deployment before troops could be on the streets of Portland, which is different from what happened in Los Angeles. ""It was a unique approach. And frankly, I don't think that was universal among all attorneys that that was the right approach, but that was the approach we were going to take in Oregon.""

The office in California went full force, sharing as much legal insight with Oregon and Illinois as possible.

The coordination came in handy in the first weekend of October, when all three states found themselves involved in lawsuits surrounding the deployments.

Rayfield remembers the attorneys and staff in his office working to file a lawsuit against the deployment in Portland within 12 hours. And it worked — by Saturday, a federal judge had issued a temporary restraining order.

""We're thinking, 'Shoot, we got a win.' And then we were able to have a little bit of a sigh of relief. But only for a few hours,"" Rayfield said.

The next morning, on Sunday, Trump said he was deploying California's National Guard — which were still federalized and under his control — to Oregon.

Bonta remembers he was out celebrating his mother's 88th birthday when he started getting calls and texts. He eventually stepped away and got on the phone with Rayfield, while both of their staffs were in near-constant communication. That evening, the same federal judge issued a second temporary restraining order, blocking any other states' National Guard from the streets of Portland as well.

At almost the exact same time, Raoul in Illinois was facing a similar situation. Trump had federalized the Illinois National Guard to deploy troops to Chicago. When that deployment hit legal roadblocks, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott offered to send troops from his state.

Raoul and his staff were also working round the clock, calling their counterparts in Oregon and California for guidance and insight.

""Fortunately, we've gotten to a point where we've got each other on speed dial,"" Raoul says. ""There's no inappropriate time to call one another, and communication had to happen that weekend, or you know, whenever.""

A few days later, a federal judge in Illinois also issued a temporary restraining order, blocking troops from the streets of Chicago.

Raoul says it was an emotional time for him and his staff; the situation and its implications felt so heavy.

""I remember, I went down and did a press availability afterwards, and I started cracking a little bit, you know, my voice. And I was like, I'm okay if some tears come down my eye, because this is some real serious s—,"" he says.

In every case, the Trump administration appealed any ruling not in their favor. In Illinois that appeal went all the way to the Supreme Court. In all three states, troops remained at the ready for months as the Trump administration waited.

And then, in the final weeks of 2025, there were two major wins for those three states.

Right before Christmas, the Supreme Court ruled against Trump, upholding the block on troops in Chicago. That ruling only applied to Illinois, but it was a decision that helped define the law, making it harder for the administration to use that same legal pathway in the future. And on New Year's Eve, Trump announced he would pull troops out of all three states, for now.

But there are still other legal mechanisms the administration could use to deploy the military in U.S. cities, including invoking the Insurrection Act, which Trump has frequently mentioned – including as recently as Thursday, in response to protests in Minneapolis against a surge of federal immigration activity.

That's one reason the democratic attorneys general say they're still busy preparing.

""This is kind of a round that we've won. We're grateful for that. But now we're ready for round two,"" says Bonta.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1b%2F63%2F4c5c5239442e8c142e72c6464000%2Fgettyimages-2219708941-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 19:58:37.178730

There's been no federal announcements from federal officials about Tucson-specific operations, but earlier this month, advocates in Phoenix warned of a spike in federal immigration enforcement efforts there.

""The actions that we’ve seen ICE take are hurting innocent people and not making us any safer,"" Romero said Tuesday in a news release. ""The City of Tucson will prioritize community safety and protect the legal and constitutional rights of every Tucsonan regardless of status.""

Romero directed city staff to create an informational website for the public to know their rights. It can be found at: http://tucne.ws/1tqm.

The page includes information on local legal services for immigration, what to do if immigration authorities come to your workplace, family preparedness plans, rights available to those who are arrested or detained and rights for those in the midst of immigration raids.

Similarly, Pima County Attorney Laura Conover asked that Tucsonans avoid ""recklessness"" during interactions with federal immigration agents.

""Here in Pima County, we expect our community members and our own local police to be safe from recklessness. And to that end, I am urging our community not to meet recklessness with more recklessness. We must be smart and fight fire, not with more fire but with water,"" Conover said Monday in a statement.

""We must move in ways that are wise and pray that keeps us all alive,"" she said.

Throughout last year, several ICE actions in Tucson have been documented.

In February, three federal agents visited longtime Tucson restaurant La Indita to verify the legal status of its employees, which the owner called an attempt at “intimidation.” In May, an undocumented migrant who has lived in Tucson for over 15 years was arrested by immigration agents outside St. Joseph’s Hospital after his wife said hospital staff extensively questioned a relative whom he was accompanying about his legal status.

In June, an undocumented man from Honduras narrowly avoided being picked up by immigration agents who posed as utility workers.

Plain-clothes immigration agents arrested Tucson physical therapist Vone Phrommany in August due to a non-violent crime he committed 35 years prior, as a teenager. Phrommany was deported to Laos, the country he fled his family at age 6 in the 1970s, after spending three months in immigration detention.

Fear of federal raids in Tucson reached its height in early December, when agents with Homeland Security Investigations arrested 46 people at multiple Taco Giro restaurants in connection to a years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations. Days later, HSI special agents served a search warrant on a Tucson trucking business on West Miracle Mile.

Conover, in her statement, asked residents to ""stay cool, calm, and collected so that you do not rush to judgement and mistake criminal investigations with warrants signed by judges with an 'ICE sweep' that has yet to occur here,"" seemingly referencing the HSI investigation.

But fears of an amped-up federal presence in cities across the nation have hit a fever pitch in the past week, following the shooting death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE officer last week.

City and county agencies ""have developed a protocol and response if the National Guard is activated by the president without being requested by the City or the State,"" this week's release said.

""Evidence from activations in other U.S. cities indicates that federalized troops may have been encouraged to engage in security, traffic, and crowd control activities in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,"" the city says. ""If deployed to Tucson, the City would observe and document such troop activities. The City is prepared to file legal challenges to any improper troop deployment or activity with authorization from Mayor and Council.""

""The Tucson Police Department does not participate in the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws but will respond for the safety of Tucson residents and to keep the peace if protests or demonstrations develop,"" the city says. ""However, federal officials do conduct operations in our city related to drugs, violent crime, human trafficking and other critical issues, and TPD may be involved in these operations.""

The city says that, in the event of a federal deployment to Tucson, a ""Joint Information Center"" or JIC will be established so that communications from the city to residents ""is unified and clear."" If such a deployment happens, the city says it will make ""accurate and timely information"" on the city's website (https://www.tucsonaz.gov), on its social media accounts, including X and Facebook, as well as news conferences live-streamed to the city's YouTube page when needed.

U.S. suspends immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries

In one of the most sweeping immigration actions of his second term, President Donald Trump ordered the Department of State to pause issuance of all new immigrant visas to applicants from 75 countries beginning 21 January 2026. According to a State Department cable reviewed by Reuters, consular officers world-wide have been instructed to deny any immigrant visa that has not yet been printed, even if it was previously approved. The administration says the affected countries—spanning Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe—have high rates of welfare usage among recent immigrants and therefore pose an unacceptable ""public-charge"" risk. (reuters.com)

Trump officials emphasize that the pause does not extend to non-immigrant categories such as B-1/B-2 visitors, H-1B professionals, F-1 students, or J-1 exchange visitors; however, business-travel groups note that the same countries often struggle with long appointment backlogs for those categories, raising concerns about ripple effects on corporate travel. The State Department says it will conduct a “top-to-bottom review” during the pause and may reinstate processing for countries that agree to improved data-sharing on applicants’ tax compliance and proof of financial self-sufficiency.

Immigration attorneys warn that the order could bar roughly 315,000 family- and employment-based immigrants over the next 12 months, disrupting U.S. hiring plans and family-reunification pipelines. Employers that rely on multinational transfer programs worry that the new scrutiny on dependents’ ability to remain off public benefits could lengthen consular reviews and raise the risk of refusals. Several U.S. universities with pipeline programs in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Brazil have already convened emergency webinars to advise affected students who planned to adjust status after graduation.

Amid this uncertainty, specialized visa-service platforms such as VisaHQ can help companies and families audit pending cases, receive real-time policy alerts, and map out alternative filing strategies. Its U.S. portal (https://www.visahq.com/united-states/) offers country-specific checklists and live support that can identify non-immigrant options or adjustment-of-status pathways while the 75-nation freeze remains in effect.

Human-rights advocates point out that the administration’s own data show immigrants use most means-tested benefits at lower per-capita rates than native-born Americans. They predict a rise in green-card applications filed inside the United States—where the public-charge test is administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rather than consular officers—in order to sidestep the freeze. USCIS, however, is already facing historic case-backlogs and fee-funding shortfalls.

For global-mobility managers, the immediate priority is to identify employees or dependents whose immigrant-visa appointments fall on or after 21 January, communicate the risk of cancellation, and, where feasible, convert filings to adjustment-of-status inside the United States. Companies with diversity-hire targets that include talent from the listed countries may need to update workforce-planning models and explore alternative work-visa strategies.

Children hurt in north Minneapolis protest

What they're saying:

The father, Shawn Jackson, told a FOX 9 reporter at the scene his children were hurt when a flash bang detonated nearby. He says the blasts were strong enough to set off his vehicle's air bags.

""Officers threw flash bangs and tear gas in my car. I got six kids in the car […] My 6-month-old can't even breathe. This was flipped over,"" Shawn said, holding up his child’s car seat. ""My car filled with tear gas, I'm trying to pull my kids from the car.""

His wife, Destiny Jackson, told FOX 9 their 6-month-old infant stopped breathing and lost consciousness. She then performed CPR on her baby while others poured milk on her other children in an effort to neutralize the tear gas.

Three of children, including the baby, were then taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. All of the children are between 6 months old and 11 years old.

Destiny says they have never gone out to protest, but this incident has given her the drive to do so.

""My kids were innocent, I was innocent, my husband was innocent, this shouldn't have happened,"" Destiny said. ""We were just trying to go home.""

North Minneapolis ICE shooting prompts protests

The backstory:

Protesters began gathering at the scene of the shooting just minutes after it happened.

A video spread on social media is believed to show the immediate, chaotic aftermath of the shooting, with the man calling 911 to say he was shot in the leg.

The package would also require someone to prove their immigration status if they want to apply for benefits, certain jobs, or buy a car.
That is strictly a role of the federal government,” Sherman Luna said.
A state review found the bill could’ve jeopardized more than $1 billion in federal education funding if enacted, as it violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
“We need educators focused on the lesson plans of the week, not on becoming ICE agents,” Sherman Luna said.","Tennessee will be the first state to pilot the White House’s immigration agenda, which focuses on increasing verification for legal residents and requiring local law enforcement to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Republican leadership in the Statehouse partnered with U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller and the Justice Department to craft the legislation.

Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, announced Thursday that the package would require local law enforcement in the state to partner with ICE under the 287(g) program, among other policies.

“Nashville is saying, ‘We’re not working with ICE. … We can’t be a sanctuary city, but we can house them here.’ So, they’re using their ability not to have to work with the federal government … (to) turn a blind eye,” Sexton said.

The package would also require someone to prove their immigration status if they want to apply for benefits, certain jobs, or buy a car.

“We’re not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you’re in jail,” Sexton said.

Some policies, like making it a crime to live in Tennessee without legal status, would not change much of life for the state’s immigrant communities, said Lisa Sherman Luna with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.

“States have no business in making laws around immigration. That is strictly a role of the federal government,” Sherman Luna said. “Immigrant families already face so many barriers in a place like Tennessee. Over the last few decades, so many laws have been passed that make life harder.”

A bill to end the right to a K-12 education for students, regardless of legal status, will be back this year, but lawmakers said they are still waiting on a green light from the federal government.

A state review found the bill could’ve jeopardized more than $1 billion in federal education funding if enacted, as it violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Given the potential loss, House leadership paused consideration of the bill after it passed the Senate last year and wrote to the U.S. Department of Education for guidance.

“That’s the biggest question remaining,” said Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixon, who sponsored the bill. “We’re still waiting on the Department of Education at the federal level to send us some guidance from them on what that looks like on funding.”

Requiring schools to verify immigration status will add a host of costs and bureaucratic red tape, Sherman Luna said.

“We need educators focused on the lesson plans of the week, not on becoming ICE agents,” Sherman Luna said.

“I am asking City Council to recognize that ICE is bad for public safety, it’s bad for business.","Hours before Woodbury city leaders would publicly shut down rumors surrounding a warehouse on Hudson Road, members of Indivisible gathered at Central Park to press for stronger, written opposition to any future Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in the city.

Indivisible, a national grassroots network with more than 1,000 local groups advocating for progressive government, hosted a press conference in the Central Park auditorium ahead of Wednesday night’s City Council meeting.

Before the press conference, Woodbury News Net spoke with Martha Winslow, who leads the St. Croix Valley district of Indivisible and has lived in St. Mary’s Point for 20 years. The organization’s mission, according to Winslow, is to “push back against the current authoritarian regime” and “propose what they want in the future” by “building a forward democracy.”

Winslow has been involved with Indivisible since 2016 and first connected with the group through political organizing while volunteering as a door knocker for a DFL House candidate. She has been retired for nearly seven years.

“This mission is not about a specific building, it’s about providing credible reporting and getting out in front of the federal government by actively addressing the issue to the City Council and asking them to issue more than a Facebook post,” Winslow said.

Winslow added that the group is seeking formal action in the form of official letters and, ultimately, a resolution preventing a detention center from being established in Woodbury. She said such a resolution was unlikely to be adopted Wednesday night but could come within the next month.

Asked how Indivisible’s message differed from recent city statements opposing a detention facility, Winslow said she believed the city’s language may have signaled to residents that attendance at Wednesday’s meeting was unnecessary. She said showing up in large numbers was intended to shift the tone of city officials’ public messaging beyond reassurance.

The press conference opened with Sen. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger, a DFL Party member representing Senate District 47, who spoke broadly about the national political climate.

“I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I gotta be honest, I don’t recognize today’s world. We are experiencing events that should never happen,” Hemmingsen-Jaeger said.

She closed her remarks by urging calm among Woodbury residents, saying, “Please remember to stay peaceful. Don’t give these bullies what they want. Be kind and look out for one another and know your rights.”

Washington County District 5 Commissioner Michelle Clasen followed, explaining that she had contacted the Washington Post reporter who published the Dec. 24 article listing Woodbury among potential ICE detention sites.

“I received word that this information that they had was more concerning, and as I listened to him speak about it, I realized that there was something that I had heard from the City Council in the past, and that was, we can’t do anything if a building or if a developer wants to come in and build,” Clasen said.

Clasen said she then reviewed Woodbury’s city code and concluded that converting a warehouse into a detention facility would require public hearings and other zoning approvals that would typically go through the city government to get approved. After sharing those findings on Facebook, she said she was told by both a city and county official to remove the post because it was giving “False hope.”

Asked by Woodbury News Net when she first heard the Hudson Road rumor, Hemmingsen-Jaeger said she initially saw it on Reddit days before the Washington Post article was published. Clasen quickly added that the Post reporter did not know the specific location. Hemmingsen-Jaeger said she was not aware of any other rumored sites but added they would “Keep an eye out.”

“I do worry that if it doesn’t work here, they’ll just move on somewhere else, and that is a concern for me too. This doesn’t belong anywhere in any community in Minnesota,” Hemmingsen-Jaeger said.

Residents Fill City Hall

A child psychiatric practitioner, a high schooler, a father of three, a military mom, a resident who has lived in Woodbury for 30 years, a resident who has lived here for one, a Woodbury Planning Commission member, a social worker, a paramedic fire fighter. All walks of life, and nineteen more, approached the City Council on Wednesday night to address their concerns about ICE in the community they call home.

Woodbury’s public forum began at 7:55 p.m. and stretched to 9:04 p.m., exceeding its originally scheduled one-hour limit. Each speaker was given three minutes. All council members were physically present except Kim Wilson, who attended virtually.

The council chamber filled quickly, with residents lining hallways to watch on mounted televisions. An overflow room downstairs met capacity with more gathered outside.

Mayor Anne Burt opened the meeting by reiterating the statement she released earlier in the week confirming that the 11435 Hudson Road location would not be used as a federal detention facility. She adjusted ground rules for the unusually large crowd and spoke about the people, businesses and city staff who make up today’s Woodbury, along with the parks and trails that define the city.

Hemmingsen-Jaeger and Rep. Ethan Cha, also a DFL Party member representing House District 47B, were the first to address the council. Hemmingsen-Jaeger shared accounts she said she has heard from Woodbury residents about ICE activity and fear in the community.

“I am asking City Council to recognize that ICE is bad for public safety, it’s bad for business. It’s bad for our neighbors, and we want them out of Woodbury,” she said.

Cha then shared his family’s history, explaining that his father served the CIA during the war in Laos and that he arrived in the United States as a refugee before becoming a naturalized citizen in the 1990s.

“I’ve served this seat for the last three years, and I will tell you something, that the impact of the ICE presence and activities that has happened in Minnesota since ICE have been here, is an infringement on the American dream,” Cha said.

“We cannot afford to have ICE in our community, and we as a community of Woodbury, are not for sale,” he added.

Cha described fear among immigrant families that they would be deported, including his mother who now avoids grocery stores and public spaces. He said the community is looking to leadership at every level and that the mental health impact is already significant.

Woodbury resident John Phillips was the first non-government speaker to address the council, identifying himself as “Strongly opposed to an ICE facility.”

“The city’s response to this threat to date has been, frankly, inadequate,” Phillips said. “ICE didn’t choose Woodbury just because we’re next to a freeway and we have a big warehouse. They chose us because they see us as weak.”

Another resident, Ryan Ecklund, who has lived in Woodbury for 10 years, described encountering ICE vehicles earlier in the week and choosing to record them, which he said was constitutionally protected. He said he was later boxed in by ICE vehicles, detained and taken to the Whipple Federal Building before being released that evening after asserting his U.S. citizenship.

“By the end of that evening, there were eight other US citizens in the one cell that I was in, again, all of them US citizens unlawfully detained. What I see happening in our community is anxiety and fear, and I think everyone here shares that sentiment,” Ecklund said.

Rocio Foncea, a Woodbury resident since 2017 who immigrated to the United States in 2007, told the council ICE activity reminded her of life under dictatorship.

“I, as well as all the immigrants, work hard. We believe in humanity and the values of this country. This is why we are here,” Foncea said.

After 29 people spoke, council members responded. Council member Jennifer Santini said “I am unsure how to navigate out of the current status quo, because we are working outside legal norms” and encouraged residents to continue speaking up.

“Mr. Eklund is the one that said it about knowing your rights, and that is something I really want you all to be armed with,” Santini said. “I do believe that change is driven by people, so I urge you to continue raising these voices.”

Council member Steve Morris followed, asking residents to look around the room.

“The community is supporting you. The community is supporting each other. And this gives me hope,” Morris said.

“We may not have the power or authority to do everything that you want, but we are here, and we will tell you the truth,” he added.

Council member Donna Stafford said she was “overwhelmed” by the turnout and “almost brought to tears.” She encouraged residents to keep speaking through “kind community gatherings.”

“I grieve with everything going on in this country right now, it’s a very, very difficult time, but we’ve been through them before, and we in our little bubble of Woodbury, we’re going to make it happen because we are good, loving, caring people,” Stafford said.

Wilson spoke last, noting she is often the “odd man out.” She said she agreed “to some aspect” of her colleagues’ viewpoints and emphasized her long-standing support of public safety at every level of government.

“I have been a long supporter of public safety, not only at the local level, but at the county level, state level, and this will also go to the federal level,” Wilson said.

As she continued, her remarks were met with loud boos.

The population of the chamber was cut in half two minutes later.

Wilson closed by saying the city would remain transparent in its actions and that the federal government is above Woodbury.",https://woodburynewsnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CityCouncil011426-e1768468940282.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 18:58:49.168371

Rep. Chu has also attended more than a dozen rallies this past year to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with constituents calling for accountability from the Trump administration.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Judy Chu (CA-28) has joined more than 70 of her House Democratic colleagues in cosponsoring articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem. Over the past year, Secretary Noem has executed Donald Trump’s violent immigration enforcement agenda that has torn families apart, undermined due process, and violated the most basic constitutional and human rights of people across the country. Last week, one of Secretary Noem’s ICE agents shot 37-year-old legal observer Renee Good in the face multiple times, killing her as she attempted to leave the scene.

“Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, ICE has descended into a lawless, violent force with zero accountability. Since day one, Secretary Noem’s ICE agents have terrorized our communities by driving around in unmarked vehicles, covering their faces, refusing to show ID, and recklessly detaining innocent people without due process. The cruelty we are witnessing is not normal, it is not justified, and it is not acceptable in a democracy,” said Rep. Chu. “In Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot an American citizen in the face three times as she attempted to leave the scene. In California, ICE agents shot an innocent protestor with a non-lethal weapon, cracked his skull, and dragged him while he was bleeding, leaving him permanently blind in one eye. Secretary Noem is responsible for this violence. She must be held accountable for obstructing Congress, violating the public trust, and using her official position for personal gain. That is why I proudly join my Democratic colleagues in cosponsoring articles of impeachment against Secretary Noem, and I call for her immediate resignation.”

Despite the Trump administration’s cruel and harmful immigration policies, Rep. Chu has continued to use every tool at her disposal to fight back, demand accountability, and advocate for her constituents and immigrant communities in Southern California and across the country.

Last month, Rep. Chu intervened and successfully secured the release of Masuma Khan, who was detained during a routine immigration check despite nearly 30 years in the U.S. and no criminal record. In October, Rep. Chu helped prevent the deportation of Barbara Gomes Marques May, a Brazilian national with no criminal record, after a judge ruled in her favor. In September, Rep. Chu also successfully advocated for the release of Rami Othmane, a Pasadena resident from Tunisia suffering from a brain tumor.

Beyond individual cases, Rep. Chu has introduced and led major legislative and oversight efforts to hold ICE accountable and strengthen protections for immigrant communities, including:

H.R. 4667, Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement (VISIBLE) Act of 2025

This legislation would increase transparency and accountability by requiring immigration enforcement officers to clearly display visible identification during public enforcement actions, prohibiting non-medical face coverings, and requiring accountability when officers violate the law.

Demanding Oversight and Protections at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center

Following the deaths of Ismael Ayala-Uribe and Gabriel Garcia-Aviles at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, both of whom died after being denied timely and adequate medical care, Reps. Chu and Dave Min (CA-47) led 43 Members of Congress in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE demanding accountability for ICE’s failure to meet basic medical standards, citing the record-high number of deaths in ICE custody that have occurred since Trump took office.

Rep. Chu has conducted multiple oversight visits to immigration detention facilities, even as federal officials have repeatedly and unlawfully attempted to block her access. During visits where she was granted entry, she witnessed deeply disturbing conditions and clear evidence of inhumane and unacceptable treatment of detainees. She will continue to conduct oversight and demand transparency, accountability, and compliance with the law.

Rep. Chu has also attended more than a dozen rallies this past year to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with constituents calling for accountability from the Trump administration.

“No one in this country should have to live in fear of their own government, all Americans and immigrant communities deserve dignity, due process, and protection under the law, and I will continue to fight back against policies that terrorize families in Southern California and across this country while demanding accountability from Donald Trump and those who carry out his agenda,” said Rep.

Notably, AGS is pending before the same three-judge panel (Judges Katzmann, Reif, and Restani) that initially decided VOS Selections.

On January 14, 2026, the CIT denied the Government’s motion in AGS to adopt certain case management procedures. As the Government explained in its motion, ​“From October 2025 to the present, over 900 cases have been commenced challenging the IEEPA tariffs,” indicating that case management procedures such as automatic stays, a plaintiffs’ steering committee, a consolidated filing and service mechanism, and a universal stipulation on reliquidation would ease the burden of mass litigation. The requested procedures largely reflected the CIT’s and parties’ experience in the mass China Section 301 tariff litigation, In Re Section 301 Cases, Ct. No. 21-00052-3JP. The CIT panel in AGS declined to adopt the Government’s proposal, although it did so ​“without prejudice,” meaning that parties may file a similar request in the future should circumstances change.

In its paperless order denying the motion, the CIT made two critical statements:

The court confirmed ​“that the Government’s stipulation regarding reliquidation applies to all current and future similarly situated plaintiffs.” This refers to an earlier December 15, 2025, order in AGS in which the CIT denied the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief in the form of suspended liquidation of entries on which IEEPA tariffs had been assessed. The court concluded there is no irreparable harm to plaintiffs if the affected entries are allowed to liquidate because ​“where jurisdiction {under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)} has attached, this court has authority to order reliquidation, and the Plaintiffs cannot claim that they would be denied a refund of tariffs paid in the event that the challenged Executive Orders are ultimately deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court.” Importantly, the Government stipulated that it will not object to the court ordering reliquidation in the future if the IEEPA tariffs are found to be unlawful, and the CIT held the Government is judicially estopped from claiming otherwise after the Supreme Court decision issues.

Key Takeaway: Setting aside whether non-litigants (i.e., U.S. importers affected by the IEEPA tariffs that do not currently have cases pending before the CIT) will have to file lawsuits in the future to preserve refund rights, the CIT is reiterating that is has the legal authority, acknowledged by the Government, to order reliquidation of entries for purposes of issuing appropriate refunds.

Notably, the CIT’s reference to ​“future similarly situated plaintiffs” indicates that the court will hold the Government’s stipulation to apply to non-litigants that may be plaintiffs in the future – meaning that companies do not need to be current plaintiffs, already having filed a legal action invoking the court’s 1581(i) jurisdiction, to be eligible for an order of reliquidation if appropriate following the Supreme Court’s decision.

The court explained that it ​“will implement additional case management procedures as may be necessary following a final, unappealable decision in V.O.S.”

Key Takeaway: There has been wide speculation as to exactly what the mechanism will look like for affected importers to obtain refunds should the Supreme Court hold any aspect of the IEEPA tariffs to be unlawful. That could vary widely, from an administrative application process designed and driven by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to a court-ordered application process, to an automatic refund mechanism, to litigation by individual importers. The path forward will likely depend on the nuances of the outcome in VOS Selections and how the Government (including CBP), current litigants, and CIT approach a solution, and if it is one that is universally applicable.

The language in the AGS court’s order is highly relevant because with it, the CIT panel is signaling its intent to craft and implement structured case management procedures at a future date, after the SCOTUS decision. While there is still significant uncertainty as to exactly what that will look like, it is now reasonable to expect the court will offer guidance and rules to thoughtfully address and manage litigation to the extent it is necessary – it will not be a ​“free for all” if the court can avoid it.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15522_2552.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:24.974313

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis on Thursday granted a motion from city and state attorneys who sought to reassign their case — which was slated to be heard by Judge Georgia Alexakis — to Ellis, given the case’s extensive similarities to another lawsuit in her courtroom brought by the Chicago Headline Club.

“Both of these cases involve many of the same issues of fact and law and they grow out of the same transaction or occurrence,” Ellis said at a hearing Thursday.

The new lawsuit includes broader claims than the Headline Club case, which largely centered on First Amendment violations by federal agents who deployed tear gas, pepper balls and other weapons against journalists and protesters during the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration enforcement operation.

The sweeping 103-page lawsuit claims that Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — who have conducted numerous aggressive raids in and around Chicago since “Midway Blitz” began in September — have acted as “occupiers” rather than law enforcement.

But the two cases do include many of the same use-of-force incidents, and Ellis on Thursday noted that she’s already spent “countless hours” holding hearings and reviewing videos and transcripts covering the same issues.

In the Chicago Headline Club case, Ellis issued an injunction that limited agents’ use of force. But that injunction was put on hold by an appeals court, and attorneys representing the plaintiffs in that case have since moved to voluntarily withdraw their lawsuit.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is named as a defendant in both lawsuits, previously slammed that injunction as an “extreme act” and labeled Ellis as an “activist judge.”

That process is not yet finalized, but the case could be withdrawn as soon as next week.

Peter Goldstone, an attorney for the federal government, argued that the two lawsuits are premised on significantly different theories, causes of action and legal bases, adding also that the cases themselves are at “diametrically opposite phases” of their litigation life cycle.

He said Thursday that state and city attorneys had not met their burden to move the case.

But Vikas Didwania, an attorney for the state of Illinois, said the two lawsuits featured significant overlap, as they both arose after federal agents “lawlessly ramapaged” through streets of Chicago.

He said that because Ellis is already intimately familiar with these incidents from “Operation Midway Blitz,” it would be a matter of improving “judicial economy” by reassigning the case to her courtroom.

Ellis agreed, over objections from the government.

“In other words,” she said, “the court is already up to speed on many of the facts and issues that will arise in the state and city case.”

Attorneys for the Chicago Headline Club did not oppose the motion to reassign the case. Ellis is expected to rule on their motion for voluntary dismissal at a Jan. 22 hearing.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:29.343562

While this raises the possibility that the tariffs could ultimately be invalidated, a business’s right to a refund would not be automatic. Businesses affected by the tariffs may therefore wish to consider steps to preserve their ability to recover import duties paid if the tariffs are struck down.

The Supreme Court Case & Related Litigation

The Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, with the Justices expressing skepticism over the legality of the tariffs. Even if the Court ultimately strikes down the tariffs, businesses may not be entitled to an automatic refund for import duties already paid.

Multiple businesses have now filed follow-on lawsuits in the Court of International Trade to protect their rights in the event the Supreme Court invalidates the IEEPA tariffs. These lawsuits follow the existing challenge in V.O.S. Selections and related challenges involving tariffs imposed on goods from countries such as India and Brazil.

How Import Duties Are Finalized

When a business imports goods into the United States, the importer pays an estimated duty on entry based on its customs declaration. Customs and Border Protection reviews and finalizes the entry, notifying the importer of record whether additional duties are owed or whether the importer is entitled to a refund. This process, known as liquidation, must generally occur within one year, although Customs and Border Protection typically seeks to liquidate duties approximately 314 days after the date of entry.

Why Liquidation Matters

If an importer protests the amount paid, it must do so within 180 days, asking Customs and Border Protection to “reliquidate” the duties. However, there are some circumstances in which a business cannot protest an entry’s liquidation, such as when Customs and Border Protection acts in a purely ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion). The risk of liquidation is the basis for recent lawsuits filed in the Court of International Trade, as companies seek to enjoin the federal government from imposing and enforcing any tariffs under the IEEPA and to recover any duties paid on the allegedly unlawful tariffs.

In recent filings, the Government has indicated that it is willing to treat similarly situated plaintiffs in similar ways, but that approach may require a proper challenge filed in court to prevent liquidation or to obtain an order requiring reliquidation.

Important Considerations for Businesses

Businesses that have paid import duties on challenged tariffs should consult with a lawyer, as even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, refunds may not be automatic, and importers may lack the ability to recover duties on already-liquidated entries if no action is taken.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15560_510.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:34.137083

Evaluating ICE protests solely as a crisis occurring within U.S. borders obscures the structural conditions that give rise to migration.
ICE protests have also brought the issue of institutional accountability back onto the agenda.","Protests directed against the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may appear, on the surface, to be a debate over immigration policy. In reality, however, they carry a far deeper political and international significance. These protests are not merely objections concerning the status of undocumented migrants. They constitute part of a broader struggle over the relationship between security and the state, human rights norms and America’s claim to global leadership. Rather than viewing these protests solely as reactions confined to U.S. domestic politics, they should also be read as symptoms reflecting the transformation of the global order.

As the second Trump administration approaches the end of its first year, it is evident that collective anxiety, fear and frustration regarding the increasingly authoritarian trajectory of Washington are intensifying.

Foundations of protests

At the core of the protests lies the question of how rights are defined. The primary dynamic here consists of allegations of human rights violations. Conditions in detention centers, the separation of children from their families and limited access to legal procedures create an explicit contradiction with the liberal norms that the U.S. itself claims to uphold. Yet criticism of ICE practices is directed not only at the severity of procedures but also at the linkage of rights to citizenship status. The exclusion of migrants from full legal processes produces a practice that effectively suspends the idea of the universality of rights.

The second fundamental dynamic is the politicization of identity. The concentration of ICE practices on specific ethnic and geographical groups transforms immigration policy from a technical security issue into a debate over social hierarchy. Inequalities based on race, ethnicity and class are reproduced through the immigration regime. Although the protesters’ reaction is directed at a specific institution, it is, in essence, a response to the state’s systematic coding of certain bodies as permanently ""suspect,” ""temporary” or ""undesirable.”

The third, and often overlooked, dimension concerns the global origins of inequality. Evaluating ICE protests solely as a crisis occurring within U.S. borders obscures the structural conditions that give rise to migration. A significant portion of migrants are on the move due to factors such as instability, economic deprivation and violence – factors that are often the product of global power relations, interventionist policies and unjust economic orders. The protests question a security-centered approach that focuses only on the final link of this chain. Viewed more deeply, it is not difficult to recognize that these protests also reflect a reaction to the U.S.’ globally interventionist and destabilizing policies. The emphasis on Venezuela and Iran by certain groups stems precisely from this perspective.

Democracy under stress

One of the most visible effects of this process is the questioning of the extent to which the expansion of state authority justified by security concerns aligns with social consent. Reactions to ICE practices are directed not only at deportation or detention itself but also at the political logic through which these practices are legitimized. The more dominant security discourse becomes in the public sphere, the stronger the perception that democratic oversight mechanisms are being weakened.

Another critical dimension for democracy is the renewed debate over freedom of expression. Anti-ICE demonstrations render visible both the boundaries of the right to protest and the state’s approach to this right. In some cases, harsh police interventions or the criminalization of protests undermine society’s sense of security while simultaneously forcing the system to reassert its legitimacy.

In this context, tensions between the federal structure and local governments acquire particular significance. ""Sanctuary city” practices have raised the question of whether immigration policy should be treated as a centralized security issue or as part of local social order. Officials in the states of Minnesota and Illinois filed two separate lawsuits in federal court against the federal government, arguing that the deployment of thousands of immigration officers in metropolitan areas violated states’ rights under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states the right to protect the health, safety and welfare of their residents. This challenge, pursued both through protest and legal channels, also reveals the flexibility and multilayered nature of American federalism. The protests serve as a reminder that this multilayered structure constitutes not a site of conflict, but a space for negotiation.

ICE protests have also brought the issue of institutional accountability back onto the agenda. Reports concerning detention centers, problems of access to judicial processes, and the lack of transparency raise serious questions regarding oversight of the executive branch. The protests remind both the legislative and judicial branches of their roles in this area, emphasizing that the separation of powers is not merely a constitutional principle but a living political practice. Moreover, the U.S. government’s failure to effectively oversee the actions of ICE agents and the arbitrariness of enforcement practices have led courts to abandon the presumption of accuracy traditionally granted to government-provided information.

Erosion of normative power

The most enduring impact of protests against ICE is observed not only in the domestic political balance of the U.S. but also in the erosion of its legitimacy at the global level. If the U.S. has long been able to exert influence beyond its military and economic capacity, this has largely stemmed from its ability to present its own values as universal norms. However, harsh practices surrounding the immigration regime and the protests they have triggered are increasingly calling this normative claim into question.

One of the fundamental pillars of U.S. foreign policy has been the relative consistency between principles defended domestically and behaviors demanded internationally. Human rights, the rule of law and individual freedoms occupy a central place in this discourse. Yet debates surrounding ICE practices reinforce the perception that the U.S. applies these principles conditionally, even within its own borders. As protests render this conditionality visible, the U.S. capacity to function as a global ""model” correspondingly weakens.

This weakening manifests not so much as a loss of power in the classical sense, but as an erosion of the ability to persuade. States are effective not only through coercive means but also to the extent that they can generate the consent of others. The international resonance of ICE protests demonstrates that U.S. criticism of other countries on migration and human rights issues is no longer perceived as convincing as it once was. Concerns are growing that regimes exhibiting authoritarian tendencies may exploit these contradictions in the U.S. to legitimize their own practices.

When the contribution of U.S. economic, political and at times military interventions to the structural conditions driving migration is recalled, harsh border policies are perceived not merely as security measures but as an evasion of responsibility. This perception quietly yet profoundly erodes the U.S. claim to regional leadership. To compensate for this erosion, Washington may feel compelled to demonstrate even greater power, potentially including the use of force.

For this reason, the ""erosion of normative power” should be treated not as a temporary image problem but as a strategic issue. ICE protests serve as a reminder to the U.S.: defending the values of the global order does not legitimize abandoning those values within one’s own borders. Otherwise, claims to leadership quietly but decisively slip away.",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2026/01/15/thumbs/800x531/421938.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 19:58:01.228497

His lawsuit alleged violations of his due process rights and the Immigration Nationality Act, and sought his immediate release from the Muscatine County Jail.
Locher ordered the Muscatine County Jail to work with ICE officials in securing Yugar-Cruz’s immediate release and, on Jan. 7, 2026, ICE officials confirmed for the court that Yugar-Cruz had been discharged from the county jail.","A federal judge has ordered the Muscatine County Jail to release an ICE detainee who had been incarcerated for almost a year after a judge ruled in his favor on an asylum request.

Court records indicate Jose Yugar-Cruz, 36, entered the United States in July 2024 after fleeing his home country of Bolivia. In court filings, Yugar-Cruz alleged that while living in Bolivia, he operated a small business and had “refused to facilitate the drug trade by police officials” who then detained him and tortured him.

In the court filings, Yugar-Cruz said he fled to Mexico, entered the United States on foot at the Arizona border, and then “sought out and surrendered” himself to federal immigration officials. He was then taken into custody and jailed, after which he applied for asylum based on the threat of persecution in Bolivia.

In December 2024, a federal immigration judge held a hearing on Yugar-Cruz’s asylum request. According to a lawsuit Yugar-Cruz filed four weeks ago against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and various Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, the judge ruled in January 2025 that the U.S. government could not send Yugar-Cruz back to Bolivia due to the ongoing threat of torture.

The judge granted Yugar-Cruz “withholding-of-removal relief” — a form of protection for individuals who face persecution if returned to their home country. It prevents the U.S. government from deporting an individual to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened.

In his lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz asserted the government never appealed the immigration judge’s ruling and so he “expected that he would soon be released from detention and allowed to start his life in the United States.”

In February 2025, however, Yugar-Cruz was still being held in the Freeborn County Adult Detention Center in Albert Lea, Minn. While there, the lawsuit claimed, he spoke to ICE officials who first indicated he’d be released in “15 days or so,” but later informed him they would continue to hold him while looking for some third-party country to which he could be deported.

The lawsuit alleged ICE officials proposed that Yugar-Cruz be deported to Argentina, Chile or Paraguay, all of which border Bolivia, but Yugar-Cruz objected, noting that Bolivians, including the police, can easily travel to those countries without a passport. Mexico was proposed as an alternative, but Yugar-Cruz expressed concern officials there would simply deport him to Bolivia.

Lawsuit cites Trump policy on deportations

On Dec. 3, 2025, Yugar-Cruz was transferred from the Albert Lea jail to the Muscatine County Jail in Iowa.

Nine days later, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney sued the Muscatine County jail administrator, as well as Noem and other Homeland Security officials, alleging they were violating federal law by continuing to detain Yugar-Cruz 11 months after the immigration judge had ruled in his favor.

As part of that lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney noted the Trump administration had adopted a practice of deporting people to third-party countries with no guarantee those individuals wouldn’t immediately be sent to their home country, where they faced persecution or torture.

A federal judge in the District of Columbia has ruled the practice amounts to a “widespread effort to evade the government’s legal obligations by doing indirectly what it cannot do directly.”

In recent months, the administration has deported at least 20 individuals to Eswatini and other African nations where they’ve reportedly been jailed indefinitely at maximum-security prisons without charges and without access to legal counsel.

None of the individuals originated from those African countries. They had been convicted of crimes in the United States, but had served their sentences and were released before being detained by ICE and then deported over the objections of human rights organizations.

Yugar-Cruz has no criminal record, according to his attorney’s court filings. His lawsuit alleged violations of his due process rights and the Immigration Nationality Act, and sought his immediate release from the Muscatine County Jail.

Recently, after the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged the federal government had been attempting, without success, to find a third-party country to accept Yugar-Cruz, District Court Judge Stephen H. Locher ruled in Yugar-Cruz’s favor.

Locher ordered the Muscatine County Jail to work with ICE officials in securing Yugar-Cruz’s immediate release and, on Jan. 7, 2026, ICE officials confirmed for the court that Yugar-Cruz had been discharged from the county jail.

His release remains subject to “reasonable conditions of supervision” by ICE, according to Locher’s order.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gavel-scales-book-_-Witthaya-Prasongsin-Getty-RF-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 16:58:35.211200

It designates high-ranking city staff as the authority to tell federal agents to leave city property, and if that doesn’t work to call the police.
The Bend Park & Recreation District updated its ICE policy in August, instructing staff to not assist or allow officers to enter buildings.
The city’s policy comes amid skyrocketing tensions between the public and federal immigration agents.
Catalina Frank, executive director of the Latino Community Association, told the Bend City City Council in a presentation last week there have been at least 16 confirmed deportations in the Central Oregon region since January 2025.","The city of Bend drafted a new policy outlining its pushback to federal immigration officers should they attempt to make arrests or stage operations on city property.

The policy, set to be adopted by the city manager’s office in the coming days, condemns what the city calls “indiscriminate and increasingly violent, and likely unlawful” civil immigration enforcement tactics taking place in Oregon and across the country. It designates high-ranking city staff as the authority to tell federal agents to leave city property, and if that doesn’t work to call the police.

The policy essentially clarifies how Bend would comply with Oregon sanctuary laws in the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Bend City Attorney Ian Leitheiser said during a Wednesday meeting of the city’s Human Rights and Equity Commission. State law prohibits local jurisdictions from participating in ICE operations, including “ investigating, detecting, apprehending, arresting, detaining or holding individuals.”

“We can’t stop an ICE agent from using a parking lot that’s available for the public to park their car, but we can stop them from using that parking lot for staging, operating, doing other things related to immigration enforcement,” Leitheiser said.

The city’s real estate director, Matt Stuart, is one of the staff who could be tasked with confronting ICE, along with the city manager or potentially a department head. Stuart said he would approach officers and “let them know what state law says, what our policy says, and if they don’t want to comply, we’ll be contacting our local law enforcement.”

Stuart says there are relatively few city properties where immigration enforcement is likely to occur, but those could include parking lots or lobbies at city hall or the public works campus.

The Bend Park & Recreation District updated its ICE policy in August, instructing staff to not assist or allow officers to enter buildings.

The city’s policy comes amid skyrocketing tensions between the public and federal immigration agents. Federal agents recently shot four people in three separate incidents in the span of a week: the killing of U.S. Citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, the shooting of two Venezuelan immigrants in Portland a day later and Wednesday’s shooting of a Venezuelan man in Minneapolis. The federal government has said officers were acting in self-defense.

The violence sparked protests across the country, including in Bend.

“With the way we are witnessing federal immigration officers terrorizing communities and not following the law, it’s important for us to be clear about what our policy is,” Kebler said in an interview on Thursday morning.

The number of people in immigration detention has hit record highs under President Donald Trump. Catalina Frank, executive director of the Latino Community Association, told the Bend City City Council in a presentation last week there have been at least 16 confirmed deportations in the Central Oregon region since January 2025. Frank described reports of “forceful tactics” from other parts of the state, including break-ins and racial profiling, while mentioning the first shooting in Minneapolis.

“The reality is that while we don’t know when these operations will reach Central Oregon, all signs indicate that they will,” Frank said.

The nonprofit asked the city for funding and support to help people who are fearful of deportations and ICE activity in Central Oregon. Frank asked Bend to join other cities across Oregon in declaring a state of emergency over heightened immigration enforcement.

Kebler said the city council will discuss the topic at its next meeting, and either declare an emergency or draft some kind of support resolution.

Agatha Ventura, a staff member at Central Oregon Community College and chair of the city’s Human Rights and Equity Commission, said she’s encouraged by the city’s commitment to sanctuary law, but also hopes for more support in the case that ICE should detain someone illegally.

“I don’t think any of us are safe at this stage,” Ventura said. “I hope our leadership is also planning for when other measures have to be taken and how people will be supported, the practical ways people can be supported in worst case scenarios.”",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2026/01/cf9aa97bf9e104eaf2d7d761f0895fa2-copy.jpg?w=640,N,,2026-01-15 16:58:39.617168

The new condition, however, compels states to adhere not only to Title IX requirements, but also to the Trump order.
The order, states argued, is inconsistent with other official HHS policies.

President Donald Trump, on the first day of his second term, issued an executive order instructing federal agencies to recognize only a person's sex assigned at birth. It disregarded the concept of gender identity as a ""false claim,"" dismissing the self-identification of any individual who does not conform to the administration's definition of sex.

The administration now says states and other entities that don't comply with that executive order will be ineligible for billions of dollars in federal grant funding allocated through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for health education in public schools, medical research and workforce development programs that train medical professionals on topics including rural health, addiction treatment and senior health.

Illinois, for example, allows its residents to change the sex on their birth certificate by signing a statement affirming their gender designation or intersex condition.

In their lawsuit, the states called the latest Trump directive ""a novel and ambiguous funding condition.""

""The Trump administration is attempting to hold billions of dollars hostage in an attempt to force states to exclude and discriminate against people who are transgender,"" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. ""Everyone deserves to live authentically, and I will continue to push back against the administration's repeated and cruel attempts to erase transgender Americans.""

Trump's order further directed federal agencies to remove all statements and policies that were inclusive of other gender identities and to take all necessary and legally permissible steps to end funding that promotes alternate definitions of sex and gender.

In their lawsuit, the states alleged the administration's purpose was ""to exclude transgender, intersex, non-binary and gender-diverse individuals and make denial of their existence official policy.""

Title IX

HHS has long required states to certify compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the landmark civil rights law passed to prevent sex discrimination in federally funded education programs, including in sports.

The new condition, however, compels states to adhere not only to Title IX requirements, but also to the Trump order. States argued HHS does not have the authority to impose new requirements on congressionally allocated spending.

""Congress has funded these programs without any requirement to exclude entities that recognize transgender, nonbinary, intersex or gender diverse individuals,"" the states wrote.

The states argued that, due to the vagueness of the order, HHS's new condition would also potentially open them up to civil and criminal liability under the False Claims Act, a federal statute that makes it illegal to knowingly present a false or fraudulent claim when applying for federal funds. Even if they wanted to comply, states said, there are not clear guidelines to do so.

The order, states argued, is inconsistent with other official HHS policies. The website for HHS's own Office for Civil Rights as of Wednesday afternoon outlined past Supreme Court decisions which established precedent for the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

""OCR will interpret Section 1557's prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex to include: (1) discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; and (2) discrimination on the basis of gender identity,"" the website states.

Compliance with the federal order would also put Illinois in violation of the state's Human Rights Act, which provides protections against gender-based discrimination in employment, housing and schools.

The states have asked the court to find the HHS policy unlawful and block its enforcement.

A pattern of threats

The administration has made a pattern of threatening to withhold funds to punish Democrat-led states like Illinois that do not fall in line with federal policies on issues from gender-affirming care to immigration protections.

Illinois joined a separate multi-state lawsuit in August seeking to block Trump's executive orders that prohibited gender-affirming care for young people, and another in December that threatened Medicaid and Medicare funding for hospitals providing the care.

It further directed federal agencies to remove all statements and policies that were inclusive of other gender identities and to take all necessary and legally permissible steps to end funding that promotes alternate definitions of sex and gender.

The order's purpose, the states alleged, ""is to exclude transgender, intersex, non-binary and gender-diverse individuals and make denial of their existence official policy.""

Raoul has won other similar suits against the Trump administration, including over a Trump order which directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to withhold federal emergency funding from Illinois over the state's immigration laws. A judge ruled in September that it was unconstitutional for federal agencies to withhold disaster relief funding simply because a state's laws differ from federal ones.

This week, the state sued the feds alleging that their aggressive immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago region is part of an ""organized bombardment"" of the state aimed at forcing capitulation on immigration policies.

The December lawsuit challenging the administration's regulations on Medicare and Medicaid put implementation of the policy on hold, at least until mid-April while the case is ongoing.

The administration has demonstrated, though, that it will not hesitate to pull funds.

Late Tuesday night, the administration cut an estimated $2 billion in funding nationwide for nonprofit groups that provide health services to people experiencing addiction, homelessness and mental health challenges.

A letter announcing the change said federal officials ""no longer believe the defunded programs align with the Trump administration's priorities,"" according to NPR.

The video in question featured six Democratic lawmakers, each of whom previously served in the military, CIA or naval intelligence.
The lawmakers had encountered an earlier round of federal interest in November, when FBI agents approached congressional security officials seeking interviews.
Four of the House members responded with a joint statement accusing Trump of deploying the bureau “as a tool to intimidate and harass” the lawmakers.","Three House Democrats confirmed on Wednesday they have been approached by federal prosecutors investigating their participation in a November video about military duty, widening the circle of legislators being targeted by the Trump administration.

Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania disclosed that the US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, had requested interviews about the 90-second video in which they said troops don’t need to comply with illegal orders.

“Donald Trump called for my arrest, prosecution, and execution – all because I said something he didn’t like,” Crow said in a statement. “Now he’s pressuring his political appointees to harass me for daring to speak up and hold him accountable. I won’t be intimidated and will keep fighting to uphold my oath to the Constitution and defend our country.”

Goodlander framed the government’s response as alarming and instructive.

“No matter the threats, I am not backing down,” she said in a video posted on X. “It is sad, telling and downright dangerous that simply stating a bedrock principle of American law caused the president, our commander in chief, to threaten violence against me, and to weaponize the Department of Justice.”

Goodlander added that she once served in the Department of Justice and she knew “that federal prosecutors have more control over the life and liberty of the American people than any other peacetime force”.

The announcements bring the number of lawmakers who have publicly confirmed contact with federal prosecutors to five, after the Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin’s revelation on Tuesday that she was under investigation. The Pentagon secretary, Pete Hegseth, formally censured the Arizona senator Mark Kelly, a retired navy captain, in January and launched administrative proceedings that could result in rank reduction and pension cuts. Kelly has responded with litigation, arguing the Pentagon’s actions violate constitutional protections.

The video in question featured six Democratic lawmakers, each of whom previously served in the military, CIA or naval intelligence. In it, they reminded service members of their duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to disobey illegal commands – a principle regularly taught in military training.

Trump said the message was “seditious” and floated the possibility of capital punishment, though he subsequently walked back the death penalty reference while insisting the lawmakers remained in serious jeopardy. Everyone in the video – which also included the Pennsylvania representative Chris Deluzio – have now been contacted by either the FBI or federal prosecutors regarding their message to service members.

“By sending the FBI and now DoJ after Rep Deluzio and the other members of Congress who stated the law in a recent video, it’s obvious that this administration is engaged in a harassment campaign against their political rivals,” Deluzio spokesperson Zoe Bluffstone said. “Congressman Deluzio won’t be intimidated and will keep doing the job he was elected to do.”

Houlahan suggested the investigation’s true motivation was stifling political speech. “The six of us are being targeted not because we said something untrue, but because we said something President Trump and Secretary Hegseth didn’t want anyone to hear,” she told NBC News in a statement.

The federal targeting represents an extraordinary use of prosecutorial power against sitting legislators for protected political speech. According to Crow’s office, Pirro’s office reached out last week seeking an interview about the video.

Government watchdog groups have condemned the investigations as authoritarian overreach. David Janovsky, acting director of the constitution project at the project on government oversight, described the prosecutions as an assault on constitutional principles. “A sitting president attempting to prosecute his political opponents just for saying something he disagrees with is a hallmark of authoritarianism,” he said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Minnesota governor Tim Walz encouraged residents to use the tools available to them to hold ICE agents accountable.
An FBI investigation into an ICE agent shooting a driver pulling away from a parking spot has been slow-walked in the past.","When Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good last Wednesday morning in Minneapolis, the 37-year-old mother became one of at least 25 people killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shooting since 2015.

In the days after Ross fired at Good multiple times from the front and side of Good’s car, visual investigations from outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post have reconstructed the event, which unfolded in a matter of seconds, combing through a series of videos that emerged from various angles. These present apparent contradictions between the narrative presented by the White House and Department of Homeland Security, which claims Ross acted in self-defense, and what actually happened.

But similar contradictions haven’t previously led to criminal indictments in ICE agent shootings. In fact, there does not appear to have ever been a criminal indictment stemming from an ICE shooting at all.

I spent four years investigating ICE shootings that occurred from 2015 to 2021, over the course of three presidential administrations. I sued ICE for the logs of all of these shootings—a lawsuit that took two years to be settled—and cross-analyzed them with media reports, lawsuits, over 40 interviews with experts, shooting victims, families, and lawyers, and 20 other Freedom of Information Act requests for law enforcement investigation reports across the United States to piece together what happened and what patterns they revealed.

Not counting the Good shooting, ICE agent shootings have involved moving vehicles at least 19 times—which are connected to at least 10 deaths and six injuries. Task forces including ICE agents have shot at least three other US citizens. They have shot in public areas with bystanders 22 times. And in at least seven cases, the person shot by an ICE officer was not the target of the enforcement action.

The Same Defense

The self-defense claim ICE, its agents, or their lawyers have made after shootings has historically been proven impossible to refute. An agent using deadly force does so justifiably when it is “objectively reasonable and necessary,” ICE spokesperson Mike Alvarez told me in an email in 2024.

“A law enforcement officer placing himself or herself in front of a motor vehicle to prevent a suspect's potential avenue of escape is a dangerous tactic and a potential violation of policy,” Mike German, a former federal law enforcement agent, tells WIRED. “But I don't think that would be likely to impact a prosecutor's evaluation of whether the officer has a reasonable fear at the time he pulled the trigger that he was in a life-threatening situation justifying deadly force.”

This reasonableness standard is what a city, state, or federal agency would assess when deciding whether to indict an agent for any criminal activity, and it’s evaluated from the perspective of a law enforcement official, not a layperson, German explains.

“Prosecutors and judges tend to be very deferential to law enforcement agents involved in shootings,” German says. “Typically, an agent's subjective belief that deadly force was necessary to protect themselves, or the safety of another person, from serious bodily harm is enough to avoid criminal charges, or conviction if charged.”

Sometimes suspects were seen to have guns, according to the ICE logs I obtained, particularly in the course of Homeland Security Investigations. But three times, ICE documented a suspect’s body, described as “hands/feet/body,” as a weapon.

And in at least a dozen cases, I uncovered evidence suggesting that the shooting victims were unarmed.

Federal agent-involved shooting investigations conducted by the Justice Department rarely result in criminal charges, and the results are rarely released publicly, German says. “The bottom line is that these shooting investigations very rarely find the agent in violation of law or policy.”

Besides self-defense, ICE agents, like all federal agents, are largely protected by qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that protects them from civil lawsuits for constitutional violations committed in the course of the duty. In recent years, two Supreme Court cases involving an immigration agent shooting and physical injury, Mesa v. Hernandez (2020) and Egbert v. Boule (2022), further cemented any private citizen’s inability to sue federal agents for harm.

The All-Clear

Determining whether criminal charges are warranted is the responsibility of a state or local law enforcement agency—most often the state attorney general’s office—and/or from a federal agency investigating, like the FBI. Both federal and municipal bodies can prosecute separately, at the same time, according to their own policies, and do not have to defer to one another.

But on Thursday, just one day after Ross shot Good, Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) “reluctantly” withdrew from the joint investigation with the FBI after the US Attorney’s Office said the FBI would be the sole investigator and would no longer grant the BCA access to the case materials, scene evidence, or investigative interviews.

The US attorney general pushing the BCA out of the joint investigation, though, doesn’t prevent the Minnesota Attorney General or the Hennepin County Attorney’s office from conducting their own homicide investigation.

In a press conference on January 9, both offices asked residents and witnesses to submit evidence in the Hennepin County Attorney evidence submission portal. The county attorney, Mary Moriarty, said the office has received hundreds of calls and emails to open an independent investigation. Across its social pages, the county attorney’s office didn’t confirm that it would do that and instead said the office “stands ready” to assist the FBI.

Meanwhile, Minnesota governor Tim Walz encouraged residents to use the tools available to them to hold ICE agents accountable. “So carry your phone with you at all times. And if you see ICE in your neighborhood, take that phone out and record,” Walz said in Wednesday’s address. “Help us create a database of the atrocities against Minnesotans—not just to establish a record for posterity but to bank evidence for future prosecution.”

The Hennepin County Attorney’s office didn’t respond to an email asking whether it plans to open an investigation.

Local agencies backing out has precedent. There have been shootings in the past that may have gone uninvestigated due to alleged confusion on jurisdiction between state and federal agencies.

In a February 2018 shooting in Dumfries, Virginia, an ICE agent who was a member of a US Marshals fugitive task force killed an unarmed man by shooting him in the back as he was fleeing arrest. The commonwealth’s attorney’s office began to investigate but stopped before it finished, saying it lacked jurisdiction over federal agents. But even though it didn’t weigh in on an indictment, the office wrote in an opinion that the federal agent enjoyed immunity from state prosecution.

Like in Minneapolis last week, the case was solely in the FBI’s hands, and the commonwealth’s attorney’s office confirmed that it gave the bureau its collected investigative material. But the FBI neither confirmed nor denied my query about whether that investigation took place.

An FBI investigation into an ICE agent shooting a driver pulling away from a parking spot has been slow-walked in the past.

In September 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee, a deportation agent shot at a man through the window of his truck twice as he pulled out of a grocery store parking lot at around 7 am local time. An ICE spokesperson told reporters the man behind the wheel drove toward the agents. But video footage obtained by a local TV station showed that the truck was parked when the ICE agents drove up and that the agent raised his hand—presumably with a gun—and chased the truck pulling away. The FBI was tasked with investigating the ICE’s agent’s allegation that the driver assaulted him. The driver, who surrendered to the FBI and was later arrested by ICE, was later released from custody.

The results of the inquiry by the FBI, the sole investigating agency in the case, were never made public.

“The problem is that these federal shooting investigations often take a long, long time and are rarely publicly reported when they conclude, so the passage of time dampens the public demand for accountability,” German, the former federal law enforcement agent says.

State and local law enforcement agencies have consistently cleared agents of wrongdoing after shootings even when they have hindered investigations, which happened three times across Arizona and California between 2015 and 2021.

In 2018 in Scottsdale, Arizona, an ICE investigator shot a man multiple times—the last bullet was fired after the man was already on the ground—and the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office found that he disregarded protocol by not remaining on the scene to give a statement. (He eventually gave one six days later.) That he fired his gun violated other protocols, and prosecutors found that his conduct could “justify further investigatory steps” but still cleared him.

In 2016 in Chula Vista, California, an ICE agent advised a colleague who killed a 22-year-old by shooting him four times within 10 seconds not to cooperate with the investigation, according to a transcript of the body-wire recording obtained by the victim’s family and published as part of a lawsuit. “Don’t worry about it,” he told him. “Remember … no statements. None of that shit.”

The lawyer who represented the family in a lawsuit that was dismissed said the agents were questioned, but the Chula Vista Police Department report did not include any details of the investigation. The agents’ lawyers did not respond to WIRED’s queries about the case.

Out of Sight

If an incident is potentially criminal, the DHS Inspector General’s Office might review it. But ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility will always investigate a shooting for policy violations, and, lacking authority to issue discipline, will make disciplinary recommendations if it deems them necessary, according to a 2023 Government Accountability Report looking into DHS use-of-force policies.

Any suggestion on disciplinary measures goes back to the agent’s supervisor, who can decide whether to administer it. And even when disciplinary action is applied, an ICE officer can appeal that decision. It can take years for discipline to actually be issued, if it ever is.

Gretta Goodwin, the author of the GAO report, found that ICE’s data collection lacked any path forward for review. In some use-of-force reviews, she said in an interview in 2023, ICE documented incidents but didn’t document whether they were in accordance with policy.

“They wrote it down, but as far as we know they did no follow up,” Goodwin said.

As for the outcome, Goodwin said she saw some disciplinary actions but didn’t learn the frequency of them.

“We did see that people were reprimanded, suspended,” she said. “I don’t know if anyone got fired.”

The GAO reviewed the DHS use-of-force practices in 2023 as part of a 2022 Executive Order on police reform for federal law enforcement bodies.

For more than a decade, ICE agents operated under an interim use-of-force policy from 2004, which the DHS Inspector General’s Office said was outdated and didn’t incorporate lessons learned since its establishment.

ICE confirmed that it had created a new use-of-firearms and use-of-force policy in 2023, which appear to be the most recent guidelines, following the executive order. But it refused to release it when I had requested it in 2024, telling me in an email that the policies had “not been published for public view.” ICE later published it with everything except the “purpose” redacted.

Like its use-of-force policies, the results of ICE’s internal investigations are not made public.

ICE did not respond to queries about whether the policy has since been updated, nor to release an unredacted version, nor to confirm the number of deaths by shootings.

Presidential Protection

Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said Good was involved in an act of “domestic terrorism,” but J. Wells Dixon, a senior attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, calls the claim “baseless” and believes that this allegation doesn’t hold any weight in an investigation or prosecution.

“The Constitution applies to and constrains the application of all state and federal criminal statutes,” Dixon tells WIRED.

Dixon is of the opinion that “Secretary Noem obviously lied when she claimed Renee Good was a ‘domestic terrorist’ in order to denigrate her and suggest—falsely—that she somehow deserved to be murdered by a masked ICE agent.”

Plans to shield ICE agents are ongoing in the Trump administration. According to recent reporting by Zeteo, President Trump had instructed officials in his administration as early as last year to protect ICE agents, including 12,000 new recruits, accused of crimes.

During a White House press briefing on January 8, Vice President JD Vance said agents have “absolute immunity,” a new term with no legal background.","https://media.wired.com/photos/696120e39c539b8af2cca8f5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/sec-ice-murderers-2254509191.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 17:58:14.247984

As a result, officials said many applicants were routed into the shorter online training program without meeting the necessary background requirements. It remains unclear how many were improperly trained or deployed before the mistake was caught.

Morning Reads

Parents Ask Supreme Court to Restore Ruling on Gender Disclosure (Mark Walsh, Education Week) — A group of California parents has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit blocked “a federal district court decision that said parents have a federal constitutional right to be informed by schools of any gender nonconformity and social transition by their children,” according to Education Week. The 9th Circuit panel said that the district court’s decision was “too ‘sweeping’ and ‘ambiguous’ and likely wrong on the merits,” and the panel “reinstated a mandate by the California Department of Education that restrains teachers and district staff members from informing parents about a child’s gender identity at school, unless the child consents.”

Louisiana Indicts Another Out-of-State Doctor Over Abortion Pills (Emily Cochrane and Pam Belluck, The New York Times)(Paywall) — As part of their broader push to limit abortion in the state, “Louisiana officials on Tuesday moved to extradite a California doctor the state indicted on a charge of providing abortion pills to a Louisiana resident,” according to The New York Times. Cases like these over abortion pill prescriptions are part of a new wave of legal battles over abortion that emerged after “the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the national right to abortion in 2022.” Legal experts expect that the court may soon need to address “whether states are required to honor one another’s abortion laws.”

‘When did I do that?’ Trump says about $2,000 tariff dividend checks (Mike Snider, USA Today) — During a recent interview with The New York Times, President Donald Trump appeared surprised to be asked about his previous comments on sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to American families, according to USA Today. Since July, Trump has repeatedly pitched sending such checks out by mid-2026, but he now says his administration would need more time than that. “I’ll be able to do $2,000 sometime. I would say toward the end of the year,” the president said. According to the interview transcript, Trump also said that he plans to impose new tariffs through “some other alternative” if the Supreme Court strikes down the current tariffs.

No, ICE Agents Do Not Have ‘Absolute Immunity’ From State Prosecution (Damon Root, Reason) — In a column for Reason, Damon Root responded to Vice President J.D. Vance’s recent claim that “the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer who shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis cannot be prosecuted for it by Minnesota officials” because, as a federal law enforcement officer engaged in federal action, he is protected by “absolute immunity.” According to Root, “the precedent is not actually so simple.” In a 1906 case called Drury v. Lewis, the court rejected “a Vance-like argument that called for shielding” officers “from any and all state prosecution,” holding that courts can review disputes “over lawful versus unlawful use of force.”

How the Supreme Court May Untangle the Tariff Knot (Dan McLaughlin, National Review)(Paywall) — In a column for the National Review, Dan McLaughlin offered some predictions about the court’s highly anticipated ruling in the tariffs case. He expects the justices to strike down the tariffs but believes “it’s very possible that the Court fractures along multiple lines in saying no.” He also think it’s “unlikely … that the Court will foreclose all future avenues for other Trump assertion of tariff powers, or that it will do much to address how unjustly paid tariffs can be recouped.”

A Closer Look: FBI v. Fazaga

Careful court watchers may recognize the case name FBI v. Fazaga. The justices heard a dispute by that name just over four years ago, which concerned the FBI and three Muslim men who lived and worshipped in Orange County, California.

The men had sued the FBI, alleging religious discrimination and other rights violations, after discovering that agents had paid an informant to gather information on them and their fellow worshippers as part of a counterterrorism operation. The federal government invoked its state-secrets privilege and moved to have the men’s religion claims dismissed, contending that allowing them to go forward would jeopardize national security.

When the Supreme Court got involved during the 2021-22 term, it was to address whether the state-secrets privilege can be trumped by a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that outlines a way for a district court to review sensitive surveillance information behind closed doors in order to assess the legality of electronic surveillance conducted under FISA without jeopardizing national security. The justices unanimously held that the provision does not displace the privilege and sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit for further proceedings.

After four years, those further proceedings have resulted in an unworkable outcome for the federal government, according to U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who on Oct. 8 filed a petition for certiorari asking the Supreme Court to reenter the dispute. While the 9th Circuit “determined that the government appropriately invoked the state-secrets privilege,” it went on to adopt “improper and wholly novel procedural requirements that essentially negate the privilege in myriad cases,” Sauer contended.

Specifically, Sauer stated that the 9th Circuit’s new ruling in FBI v. Fazaga requires district courts to review privileged information in order to evaluate the government’s claim to the state-secrets privilege. Such a requirement essentially recreates the situation the federal government previously fought to avoid, Sauer wrote, transplanting the review procedures outlined in FISA to the “state-secrets doctrine itself.”

“That decision,” Sauer continued, “threatens significant and recurring national-security harm.” He urged the justices to either grant the new petition for review and hear arguments on how courts should respond to invocation of the state-secrets privilege or vacate the 9th Circuit’s ruling and remand the case to the district court, where it may be dismissed for other reasons (namely, because the former FBI informant who provided the information about surveillance activities that fueled the Muslim men’s lawsuit has now recanted his story).

In response, the challengers have asked the court to leave the 9th Circuit’s ruling in place, contending, as they have at previous points in the case, that the government’s invocation of the state-secrets privilege is preventing them from making a case that they’re willing to make with the “ample” amount of “non-privileged information” that is now available about the challenged surveillance program. It is appropriate, the men added, for the district court to review the privileged information that the government is trying to protect in order to assess the government’s assertion that it cannot mount a defense without jeopardizing national security.

The court considered the petition in FBI v. Fazaga for the first time during the Jan. 9 conference. It is scheduled to be considered again at tomorrow’s conference.

Court finds police properly entered man’s home despite absence of a warrant

The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that police officers in Anaconda, Montana, did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they entered a man’s home without a warrant, rejecting the man’s contention that officers needed “probable cause” to enter. It was enough, Justice Elena Kagan wrote for a unanimous court, that officers believed the man needed emergency assistance.

Justices wrestle with what, exactly, New Jersey Transit is

The Supreme Court on Wednesday debated whether New Jersey’s public transit agency can be sued in state courts in New York and Pennsylvania. The New Jersey Transit Corporation argues that it is an “arm” of the state and, therefore, immune from lawsuits elsewhere, but after a little over an hour of arguments, it was not clear whether a majority of justices agreed.

I sometimes think of what would have happened if I had let that first phone call go to voicemail. The line was unstable and I could discern only half the words, but I knew immediately why she was calling. For weeks, I’d been receiving dozens of calls like hers.

In the summer of 2020, I was working as a paralegal in Austin, Texas, remotely filling out asylum applications for migrants who were trapped in a dangerous limbo. A landmark policy of the first Trump administration—euphemistically called the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” or MPP—was keeping tens of thousands of immigrants stateless and often homeless in Mexico’s border regions while their asylum cases were adjudicated in U.S. border courts. Over half lost the chance to pursue asylum because they never received notice of their court date, or they fell victim to “routine” kidnappings, assaults, or sexual violence by cartel members. All of them were desperate for legal aid.

As much as I tried to stop it, my number had been passed around the Mexican borderland all summer, and I was inundated with calls. By the time Irma, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker who’d recently been deported from the U.S. border to Mexico, first contacted me, I had a standard answer: We were at capacity. I could not help anyone. (Irma asked that her name be changed for this because she fears retaliation from the U.S. government).

But she didn’t give me the chance to turn her away. Within minutes, she told me that her son had died after Mexican immigration officials deported him to Colombia. He’d had a respiratory complication related to his diabetes, she explained, possibly triggered by coronavirus. She began to cry.

“Tell me,” she asked in Spanish, “how can I bring his ashes to me?”

I remember pausing. I knew I had to tell her I couldn’t help her—I was under direct orders not to accept clients. But somehow, I couldn’t do it. She seemed so sure, already, that I could help. Irma spoke to me like she already knew me and loved me, as though I had already been kind to her. She called me “mija”—my daughter. She seemed to hold no mistrust toward me and my halting Spanish, no shard of suspicion that I could use to create the usual distance around myself.

After that call, I convinced my supervisor to make a rare exception for Irma and provide her with limited assistance with her asylum case. For months, we talked almost every night as I helped her prepare for her scheduled asylum hearing at the U.S. border—a hearing that would be delayed over and over again as COVID-19 shut down courtrooms across the country. I never figured out how to bring her son’s ashes to her. They remained in Colombia—as did his widow and daughters, pinned between familiar horror and new violence.

But Irma kept waiting for her day in court. Over the next years, I became transfixed by her asymmetrical struggle against the U.S. immigration system. As she moved to the U.S., reunited with her family, gained legal status—got almost everything she’d wanted—and lost it again, I kept answering her calls.

More than five years later, when U.S. forces struck Caracas, Venezuela, and seized President Nicolás Maduro and his wife to face narco-trafficking charges in federal court while continuing their unprecedented attack on asylum-seekers inside the United States, I’ve found myself increasingly unable to share her faith in American justice. As I watched the havoc caused by the vagaries of the U.S. immigration system, I kept returning to the same questions. Had I helped? Could anyone help? Was there enough justice left in the U.S. immigration system—enough order, enough impartiality—for help to be possible? Or had she just traded one set of dangers for another?

When Nicolás Maduro first assumed power in 2013, Irma was working as a campesina—a small-scale rural farmer—in Venezuela. She was happy then, she told me in our early conversations, marveling daily at the process of growing living things from the earth. At first, she was optimistic about Maduro, who had been a bus driver in Caracas and who she thought would serve the “humble.”

“Maduro, I knew him as a man who knew the people’s needs, because someone who drives a bus has passengers get on every day and hears their comments and knows what people suffer because of what’s happening,” she said a few weeks ago, when we discussed the (then) impending U.S. intervention into Venezuela.

Donald Trump, she believes, was born a tyrant. Maduro became one quickly after taking power—barely a year after he became president, Irma told me, she started seeing people picked off the streets by men with machine guns. These men belonged to groups known as colectivos—government-affiliated paramilitaries who repressed political protest and dissent in exchange for the opportunity to loot the dissenters.

The colectivos were part of the “very sophisticated repressive machine” that Maduro inherited from his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, explained Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College and author of Autocracy Rising: How Venezuela Transitioned to Authoritarianism. Chávez had led a “hybrid regime” that combined elements of both autocracy and democracy, Corrales said. Despite the corruption that pervaded his administration, Chávez presided over resource redistribution and significant reductions in poverty levels. His 2001 land reform program redistributed government-owned and private land to indigent residents willing to cultivate it.

Irma was one of Chávez’s direct beneficiaries; she received a parcel of arable land which she cultivated with her brother. She never viewed Chávez as a dictator, she told me—not because he defended democracy, but because he championed the downtrodden. Chávez “loved his people, protected us campesinos, protected the poor,” she explained. On Christmas, he gave his people hallacas, a traditional Venezuelan corn-dough holiday dish.

According to Corrales, when Maduro took power, he targeted the people who’d benefited directly from government programs, especially those who also displayed opposition to the government—even if their putative opposition consisted of speaking up to demand adequate water for their town or electricity for their local hospitals.

Irma herself was one of the recipients of government largesse who started speaking up. Local government officials were stealing from the farmers and selling the produce on the black market for personal profit. So Irma banded together with other recipients of farming plots to demand an end to the looting and assert the rights given to them by Chávez’s laws.

That’s when the colectivos came to her farm. She recalls watching them punch her brother and drag him off the farm in a black truck. After the truck drove off, Irma searched for him for hours with her brother’s wife and children, as the unbearable knowledge of where they would find him grew more solid.

“We went to the morgue and there he was,” Irma said.

A few weeks later, Irma said, the colectivos returned and destroyed her farm. They punched her, tied her up, and dragged her into the truck, and left her beaten on the side of the road with a warning to end her “radicalism.”

After her attempts to hide from the colectivos proved futile, Irma decided she had to start over somewhere new. She fled, becoming one of the nearly 8 million Venezuelans who left the country during Maduro’s reign.

Irma arrived at the U.S.–Mexico border midway through the first Trump administration. She waded across the cloudy Rio Grande and searched for an immigration officer she could ask for help. She knelt in front of the first officer she saw, told him she’d fled the colectivos, and pleaded for a chance to seek asylum.

The official put her in a crowded van and detained her for three days in a freezing border cell, which immigrants often refer to as a hielera, or icebox. After she was released, she was sent to Juárez, Mexico, under Migrant Protection Protocols—the Trump policy that kept people in limbo in Mexico’s dangerous border areas while their cases made their way through U.S. courts.

Her son died en route to join her in Mexico, leaving a widow and two young daughters in Colombia. She called me days after his death, while she was still living in a shelter in the largely cartel-controlled Mexican border town of Juárez. A few months later, she would end up on the streets, eventually sheltering inside the active construction site where she worked during the day. She told me then she had faced repeated sexual assaults from a local worker who threatened to toss her body in the river if she told anyone. “Imagine,” she told me then. “A grandmother, an old woman like me, alone.”

But she refused to give up on her only chance to seek refuge from the dictatorship that had killed her brother. She kept waiting, even when COVID-19 shut down the courts and her case was delayed indefinitely. I felt sickened by every piece of news I gave her—her court date canceled, the border closed, the pandemic spreading—but her faith in the system, and in me, seemed implacable. At some point, I realized that she was waiting out Donald Trump’s presidency. Time was the last thing left that could still help her.

When Joe Biden won the 2020 U.S. presidential election, she was triumphant. Biden promised to end MPP, the program keeping her trapped in Mexico, and restore the normal pathway to asylum. “I knew he was going to win against that arrogant child,” she said to me at the time.

Shortly after Biden took office, Irma was allowed to enter the country to pursue asylum. She reunited with her daughter and grandson in Houston, obtained Temporary Protected Status—a visa afforded to citizens of countries designated by the executive as especially dangerous—and got a job at a 7-Eleven. The joy she felt then “astonished” her, she told me when I drove to Houston to meet her and her family. She dreamed of saving money to open a food truck that would sell arepas throughout Texas.

“It was so beautiful,” she told me as I worked through the alarming amounts of food she’d cooked in honor of my visit. “I just didn’t expect it.”

But when Trump returned to office four years later, Irma was stripped of her status, her work permit, her mundane everyday freedoms. It would be the second time she would live through a government turning against her, and her second time in hiding. This time, however, she had nowhere to go.

After Trump retook office in 2025, his administration, guided by a slew of anti-immigrant executive orders, relentlessly stripped the statuses that had protected vulnerable noncitizens. They rolled back humanitarian and family reunification–based parole and stripped away Temporary Protected Status for residents of some of the world’s most destabilized countries, including South Sudan, Haiti, and Venezuela.

Irma was one of the hundreds of thousands of noncitizens who became newly undocumented under Trump’s policies. She told me that a co-worker outed her at work as having lost her status, and she was fired immediately. She moved away from the vibrant immigrant communities in Houston to live with her other daughter in the more homogenous and broadly affluent Austin, where there were fewer immigrants and therefore, she reasoned, fewer raids.

But even in Austin, she couldn’t risk going to church; she settled for watching sermons streamed live. She was consumed by the idea of Immigration and Customs Enforcement picking her up at home, or when she went to get her grandson from his special school (at 3, the child was still nonverbal, which Irma attributed to the fear his mother had experienced when she fled Venezuela, already eight months pregnant). Irma feared the indefinite detentions and inhumane treatment she’d heard about. “You don’t know what they’re going to do,” she said, “because they don’t want us here.”

Her fears are not overblown. Since this summer, clients at the nonprofit legal center I work at have been starved, denied their medicine, and kept in windowless cells where the lights never turn off, where there’s no room to lie down. Spurred by a $170 billion enforcement package that tripled ICE’s detention budget and by Trump’s Day 1 orders demanding “total and efficient” enforcement against all removable immigrants, ICE officers have stormed the streets with unprecedented intensity and violence.

In blitz raids across the country, ICE agents have picked up thousands of immigrants, many of whom had legal status in the United States and the vast majority of whom had no criminal record: Over the summer, ICE averaged over 1,000 arrests per day. In 2025, 32 people died in ICE custody. Its agents have become increasingly aggressive in their encounters with citizens and noncitizens alike—protesters, legal observers, and people they’re targeting at random. These killings appear not to trouble President Trump. After an ICE agent shot Renee Nicole Good in the face, killing her, Trump called the 37-year-old mother of three an “agitator,” adding that “we’re always going to be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.”

These past few months, Irma says she’s been seeing something that she recognizes all too well: some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in society grabbed off the street and thrown in vans. And she’s living in fear of being grabbed again herself. “I don’t know when they’ll take me away,” she told me recently.

Scholars have a name for this phenomenon. Targeting the most vulnerable, political scientists have argued, is a hallmark of democracy backsliding. Corrales calls the process “victim inversion.”

“An autocracy needs to create an in-group versus an out-group,” Corrales explained. “You start with the most vulnerable precisely because they’re the easiest to go after. … Once you get your group to think in terms of in-groups versus out-groups, and that the out-groups are harming agents, repression is uncontainable.”

In Venezuela, the “out-group” consisted of anyone perceived as opposing the regime, Corrales said. In the United States, “what Trump has done is to focus on noncitizens. You see victim inversion: They’re very vulnerable, and the first thing is to turn them into harming agents.”

Maduro and Trump are both part of a global trend toward polarization and extremism, said Miguel Tinker Salas, a history professor at Pomona College who studies both modern Venezuela and the U.S.–Mexico border region. But both of these instances of democratic backsliding are “historically grounded in the particular situation” of their respective countries, he emphasized.

According to Tinker Salas, Maduro’s dictatorship sprang from Hugo Chávez’s regime, an economic crisis, and the failures of Chávez’s “cultural, social, political project.” Meanwhile, Trump rose to power in the vacuum created by “the inability of the Democrats to put forth a proposal for real change,” and the hollowing out of their commitment to equality with their embrace of neoliberalism.

Trump has used the out-group of noncitizens—conjuring the specters of dangerous internal and external enemies—to justify his startling consolidation of executive power. “In 2016, he began with the wall, … the Salvadorans, and then Mara Salvatrucha,” Tinker Salas said. “Now in 2025, targeting Venezuelans and the so-called Credenciales”—“credentialed” gang members—“it becomes the same phraseology, the same notion. … You’re trying to make immigrants the enemy from within.”

Trump relied on the same specter of an enemy within in justifying his intervention in Venezuela this month, which was ostensibly motivated by “drugs, immigration, and oil.” While many Venezuelan émigrés celebrated the ouster of Maduro, the man whose corruption had been instrumental in driving them out of their country, Irma herself was somber. She didn’t trust Maduro, but she didn’t want Trump to intervene, either. “Here, he’s made us suffer enough; imagine what he’s going to do inside my country,” she texted me over WhatsApp.

Irma is not hopeful about the future of her home country in Trump’s hands. Instead, she spends much of her time praying for Trump and his administration, including ICE agents, entreating Jesus to “soften the heart of Trump and of the people that work for him.” Even while she prays for softness, she says, she doesn’t expect it—and she hopes people will stand up and fight for the people being snatched off the street. After all, she knows firsthand how quickly democracy and rule of law can dissolve.

“I’ve lived through it—death, eviction, persecution—because I stood up to the government and refused to accept injustice. In our own country, we protested against the government, and many innocent people died. … But we can’t allow one person to destroy what belongs to all of us.”",https://compote.slate.com/images/838aee09-52a4-4430-a0fa-cef1092e2d51.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-15 16:58:52.836625

While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle.

""As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick.

""Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg.

""All three subjects ran back into the apartment and barricaded themselves inside.

""The attacked officer and subject are both in the hospital. Both attackers are in custody.

""This attack on another brave member of law enforcement took place while Minnesota’s top leaders, Governor Walz and Mayor Frey, are actively encouraging an organized resistance to ICE and federal law enforcement officers.

Eden Prairie police cannot ask about a person’s immigration status or share that information with ICE, he said.","Mayors, city managers and police chiefs from 15 Twin Cities suburbs gathered at the Eden Prairie Community Center on Wednesday to discuss the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the Twin Cities.

The closed-door meeting brought together local officials to share information about recent ICE activity in their communities and to discuss possible next steps as ICE remains active across the metropolitan area and the state, Eden Prairie Mayor Ron Case said.

Representatives from Hennepin County, including Commissioner Debbie Goettel, and the chief of staff for U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison were also in attendance.

Members of the media were not invited to the meeting, though Case spoke with Eden Prairie Local News afterward.

Case said mayors shared specific instances in which ICE agents allegedly followed residents without clear cause, including an incident in Brooklyn Park in which a Hispanic off-duty police officer was surrounded by agents while driving her personal vehicle. The officer told the agents she was a citizen and a police officer, but they did not allow her to leave until they eventually departed, Case said.

A representative from Richfield said there is growing concern about the impact ICE’s presence is having on students, with roughly one-third not attending school, Case said. Several restaurants in Richfield have also closed due to ICE activity in the city, raising concerns about lost wages and workers’ ability to pay their bills.

Officials from all cities in attendance, including Eden Prairie City Manager Rick Getschow and Police Chief Matt Sackett, encouraged U.S. citizens to call 911 if they encounter ICE and feel unsafe. While officers cannot intervene in or stop a federal arrest, they can respond, record interactions and help deescalate situations.

“Police departments across the area do not want to interfere with the job duties and the role of ICE, but the expectation is that ICE will follow the law as well,” Case said.

Eden Prairie has experienced several instances of ICE activity, but city officials are not notified in advance, Case said. Instead, the city typically learns of ICE’s presence after the fact, if someone calls 911.

Case reiterated the city’s previous statement that local police departments, including Eden Prairie’s, do not participate in federal immigration enforcement and enforce only state and local laws. Eden Prairie police cannot ask about a person’s immigration status or share that information with ICE, he said.

Case said he shared a few facts to illustrate the current situation in Minnesota during the meeting, including that there are about 100,000 undocumented immigrants in Minnesota, compared with about 2 million in Texas. Despite that difference, Texas has roughly 1,500 Border Patrol agents, while Minnesota has about 3,000 ICE agents and Border Patrol officers statewide, Case said.

“It begins to very much look like it’s not about immigration,” Case said.

Moving forward, Case said city officials plan to meet in Brooklyn Park early next week to coordinate outreach to Gov. Tim Walz, if possible. Mayors have also discussed writing letters to President Donald Trump and to Minnesota’s Republican members of Congress about what they view as the negative economic impacts of ICE’s expanded presence.

The group is also considering writing a letter to the editor of the Minnesota Star Tribune and contacting The New York Times in an effort to draw national attention to the impact ICE activity has had on suburban and smaller communities.

“People hear President Trump’s perspective, and they may hear Gov. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey’s perspectives, but they’re not hearing the perspectives of 30 suburban mayors whose residents and communities are being negatively impacted,” Case said.

Case noted that Minnesota communities have coexisted with ICE and have been aware of the agency’s presence since its creation in 2003, but said the scale and visibility of ICE activity now is unprecedented.

“This is different today — this is much different,” Case said.

Case added that oftentimes agents wear masks, making it difficult to identify them.

Several police chiefs across the metro also discussed difficulties contacting ICE leadership, Case said, noting they were told there is no central command for ICE in Minnesota.

“There’s no one you can report that behavior of ICE agents to,” Case said. “That’s the problem.”",https://www.eplocalnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mayors-Meeting-scaled-e1768434221777.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:18.721735

On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning nearly fifty years of abortion rights precedent. The decision across all opinions cited six different scholar briefs—amicus curiae submissions signed by law professors and academic experts—more than any other decision in recent memory. The opinion’s deployment of academic authority was both extensive and strategic. When challenging Roe’s treatment of common law abortion prohibitions, Alito invoked a brief from scholars of jurisprudence James Stoner and John Finnis, asserting that “’a quick child’ meant simply a ‘live’ child” under early modern understanding—a historical claim that, if accepted, would dramatically expand the temporal scope of abortion’s criminal prohibition. The opinion relied even more heavily on professional historians’ submissions to reconstruct nineteenth-century legislative intent. In a revealing methodological move, Alito cited historians’ work to demonstrate that “at least 26 of 37” states had criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy by 1868—the year the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified—thereby establishing the historical tradition against which contemporary abortion rights claims must be measured.

This intensive marshaling of academic expertise in Dobbs exemplifies a broader transformation in Supreme Court practice. The Justices increasingly turn to scholar briefs not merely for doctrinal synthesis—a traditional function of academic amici—but for empirical claims, historical reconstruction, and comparative constitutional analysis that shapes the Court’s understanding of fundamental legal questions. These submissions occupy a distinctive rhetorical space. Unlike party briefs, which advance partisan positions within adversarial constraints, scholar briefs purport to offer disinterested expertise. As Paul Collins observes, they “allow professors to make their views known to judges and provide expert knowledge and commentary from (ostensibly) neutral legal experts.” This neutrality—whether genuine or performed—confers epistemic authority that practicing attorneys cannot easily replicate. A multisignatory historians’ brief carries intellectual weight beyond its legal argumentation precisely because it appears to represent scholarly consensus rather than litigation strategy.

Yet the expanding influence of scholar briefs raises troubling questions about the relationship between academic knowledge production and judicial reasoning. Do these submissions genuinely inform constitutional interpretation, or do they merely provide scholarly imprimatur for conclusions reached through other means? When Justice Alito cites historians to demonstrate that abortion was widely criminalized in 1868, is he incorporating new historical evidence into his analysis, or mining academic briefs for convenient citations that support an outcome predetermined by his constitutional philosophy? The very features that give scholar briefs their authority—their claim to expertise, their apparent distance from litigation incentives, their aggregation of credentialed signatories—may also enable a form of motivated reasoning dressed in academic garb. Kelly Lynch acknowledges this ambiguity, noting that while “it is likely that in many cases scholars can have at least some beneficial effect on the development of the law,” the causal mechanisms remain opaque. We know that Justices cite scholar briefs with increasing frequency; we know far less about whether these citations reflect persuasion or mere justification.

This article examines an original dataset of 103 scholar briefs and over 2,300 individual scholars that contributed to these briefs cited by the Supreme Court between the 2015 and 2024 Terms to map the landscape of academic influence in contemporary constitutional adjudication. The analysis reveals which doctrinal domains attract scholarly intervention, which institutions and methodologies dominate the cited literature, and which cases generate the most intensive academic engagement. These patterns illuminate not only what kinds of expertise the Court values, but also the structural features of legal academia—institutional prestige, disciplinary boundaries, professional networks—that determine whose scholarly voices reach the Justices. More fundamentally, this empirical account sets the stage for a critical assessment of scholar briefs’ actual influence. If academic amici cluster predictably around elite institutions, if their historical claims align suspiciously well with litigants’ constitutional theories, if cases decided on originalist grounds systematically cite originalist historians while living constitutionalist opinions cite different scholars entirely, we might reasonably suspect that scholar briefs function less as genuine knowledge inputs than as rhetorical resources in an ideological struggle over constitutional meaning.

Along with contextualizing these citations, this article tracks attributes of the scholars and institutions that contributed most to the justices’ citations.

Methodology notes: The search parameters included briefs mentioning scholar(s) or professor(s) so there may be briefs that fall into the same category but were titled differently and were missed. This also only covers information specified within the briefs so while most briefs share the institution where a professor work and other details, there is no standardized information template used across briefs.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LNEg!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3093fa1b-3ffa-4bd3-b33f-ffd0eecabc9c_1247x831.jpeg",N,,2026-01-15 14:58:57.264761

And longstanding historical precedent establishes that states can bring charges against federal officials under certain circumstances.
Whether Minnesota ultimately prosecutes Ross remains to be seen, and state officials’ decisions will depend on careful legal and evidentiary analysis.
Vance claimed that Ross has “absolute immunity,” suggesting that there are no circumstances under which the state could prosecute him.
(I leave aside the legal question of whether Ross would be considered a peace officer under Minnesota law.)","On Jan. 7, a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, identified by the media as Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her car in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The FBI is investigating the shooting, but despite an initial promise of collaboration, it subsequently informed state officials that it would not work with them. As a result, Hennepin County prosecutor Mary Moriarty and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison have launched their own investigation.

State criminal investigations and prosecutions of federal officials are unusual. And criminal charges against law enforcement officials at any level present unique legal and factual challenges. But as illustrated by Minnesota’s successful prosecution of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, law enforcement officers can be held accountable for crimes they commit. And longstanding historical precedent establishes that states can bring charges against federal officials under certain circumstances.

Whether Minnesota ultimately prosecutes Ross remains to be seen, and state officials’ decisions will depend on careful legal and evidentiary analysis. Without predicting outcomes, however, it’s worth both clarifying the state of the law—especially in the face of false claims from the Trump administration—and identifying some of the key issues Minnesota prosecutors will have to consider.

First, let’s debunk claims that the state has no role to play here. The day before Moriarty and Ellison announced the state investigation, Vice-President J.D. Vance claimed that Ross has “absolute immunity,” suggesting that there are no circumstances under which the state could prosecute him. And Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem claimed that the state has “no jurisdiction,” which is why, she said, it was shut out of the investigation. More recently, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced that ICE agents “have immunity to fulfill their duties” and that “no one … can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.” In fact, Vance and Noem are completely wrong as a matter of law, and Miller’s claim holds water only insofar as ICE agents are in fact acting within their legal authority, which, as explained below, will be a central issue in any state prosecution.

The notion that Minnesota cannot investigate or prosecute a violation of its criminal laws within its borders is flatly inconsistent with our federalist system. As the Supreme Court has recently reiterated, the states and the federal government each have a sovereign interest in enforcing their own criminal laws. Sometimes that means that both a state and the federal government prosecute the same person for the same conduct, as happened with Derek Chauvin. When that happens, because of those separate sovereign interests, double jeopardy does not apply. Here, double jeopardy is not the key question (although at some point in the future a different federal administration could presumably prosecute Ross regardless of what Minnesota does). Instead, “dual sovereignty” in the present context means that the state has a legitimate interest in enforcing its laws even against federal actors.

Such cases are unusual, but they are not unprecedented. As Bryna Godar has documented, states have been bringing prosecutions against federal officials since at least the nineteenth century, including for crimes involving the use of force by law enforcement officials. These cases have involved charges of murder, attempted murder, assault, and other violent crimes, often brought against tax collectors or federal agents enforcing Prohibition. More recently, the state of Idaho brought murder charges against an FBI agent who shot and killed an unarmed woman during a lengthy stand-off known colloquially as “Ruby Ridge.” In other words, there is no question that Minnesota has jurisdiction to investigate and charge Ross with a crime and there is no automatic or absolute immunity because he is a federal officer. The administration’s claims otherwise are false.

Nonetheless, in deciding whether and how to proceed, Minnesota officials will face some challenges, from the factual investigation; to determining what, if any, charges to bring; to evaluating the defenses that Ross, as a law enforcement officer, may have—and the related likelihood that he could successfully claim what is known as “Supremacy Clause immunity,” which (contra Vance) is not absolute, but which Ross would almost certainly attempt to invoke.

As a practical evidentiary matter, if the FBI or other federal investigators do not share their investigatory files with the state, state officials have cautioned that they might determine that they do not have a sufficient evidentiary record to make a charging decision. That’s not a foregone conclusion, of course, and even if they conclude that they cannot charge Ross now, that assessment could change if a future administration is willing to share information with the state. (Minnesota has no statute of limitations “for any crime resulting in the death of the victim.”) In any event, at this time, Moriarty and Ellison are asking the public to share video and other information, and state officials are evaluating the evidence they already have. They may well conclude that they have sufficient evidence to prosecute Ross for any of a number of crimes, including various forms of murder and manslaughter and the failure to provide aid to a shooting victim.

Each of those crimes has its own set of elements, and the Minnesota prosecutors will review the evidence to see if it meets those elements. Derek Chauvin’s prosecution for killing George Floyd is a useful example. Chauvin was convicted of unintentional second degree murder, third degree murder, and second degree manslaughter. The unintentional second degree murder charge, which is comparable to what some states call felony murder, required showing that Chauvin killed Floyd while committing a separate felony, in that case a form of assault.

Third degree murder in Minnesota, of which Chauvin was also convicted, requires a showing that the defendant, “without intent to effect the death of any person, causes the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life …” In Chauvin’s case, the prosecution established those elements in part through evidence that the use-of-force training Chauvin received included instruction to avoid putting pressure on an individual’s neck, as Chauvin did to Floyd. Similarly, the second degree manslaughter charge required the prosecution to show that Chauvin “create[d] an unreasonable risk, and consciously t[ook] chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another.”

Minnesota prosecutors will also evaluate any state law arguments Ross might have. For example, Minnesota’s state law authorizes peace officers to use deadly force under some circumstances. As relevant here, peace officers can do so under that law

only if an objectively reasonable officer would believe, based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time and without the benefit of hindsight, that such force is necessary: (1) to protect the peace officer or another from death or great bodily harm, provided that the threat: (i) can be articulated with specificity; (ii) is reasonably likely to occur absent action by the law enforcement officer; and (iii) must be addressed through the use of deadly force without unreasonable delay…

I would expect Minnesota prosecutors to evaluate the evidence carefully to see if Ross might be able to establish these factors, which I’ll address further below. (I leave aside the legal question of whether Ross would be considered a peace officer under Minnesota law.) And regardless of what they conclude about prosecuting the shooting itself, they will likely separately evaluate whether Ross – and his fellow ICE officers – violated Minnesota law requiring both a person who shoots someone and any witnesses to immediately investigate and render appropriate assistance.

Should Minnesota charge him, Ross will undoubtedly claim a form of immunity generally referred to as “Supremacy Clause immunity.” Contrary to Vance’s claim and Miller’s insinuation, however, Supremacy Clause immunity is not absolute. Rather, it balances the dual sovereignty already discussed with the additional principle that states cannot supersede federal laws. That balance means that Supremacy Clause immunity is available only to federal officials who are acting reasonably and lawfully in fulfilling their duties. More specifically, as Bryna Godar explained in November, it applies only if “[t]he federal official’s actions [were] … (a) authorized by federal law and (b) ‘necessary and proper’ in fulfilling the official’s federal duties.”

The inquiry into whether Supremacy Clause immunity applies in this case will thus likely include, for example, reviews of the federal government’s use-of-force policies to determine if Ross acted outside his authority and/or acted unreasonably. Those policies, for example, state that law enforcement officials (LEOs) “should … avoid intentionally and unreasonably placing themselves in positions in which they have no alternative to using deadly force”; they permit deadly force only “when the LEO has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the LEO or to another person”; they generally prohibit the use of deadly force “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject”; and they specifically discourage LEOs from firing at “the driver of a moving vehicle.” The policies also require federal LEOs to “obtain appropriate medical care” after any use of force. If Ross violated these provisions, his immunity claim will be weaker. Likewise, the court will likely look at whether Ross used deadly force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, including whether his failure to warn Good before firing his gun was unconstitutional.

This immunity inquiry also overlaps with Minnesota’s state law authorizing peace officers to use deadly force, described above. Under all of these inquiries, questions of whether Ross acted reasonably under the circumstances will play a central role. In other words, both the state prosecutors’ charging decisions and the immunity determination will depend on questions of fact about the details of what actually happened, as well as on questions of law as to the implications of those facts. For example, did Ross believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury when he fired the first shot? If so, was that belief reasonable? Did Ross prepare to draw his gun before or after Good’s car started moving, and if not, why did he shift his cellphone from his right to his left hand? Did Good’s car touch him at any point? What about Ross’s belief as to whether he was in danger when he fired the second and third shots? On what basis did he, and his colleagues, fail to provide assistance to Good after she was shot and prevent a physician who was on the scene from helping? All of these questions go to both whether Ross has Supremacy Clause immunity and to whether he is likely to be convicted if charged and tried.

Finally, whether Supremacy Clause immunity applies will almost certainly be decided by a federal court, even though any criminal charges would first be filed in Minnesota state court. That is because federal officials are able to remove both criminal and civil cases from state court to federal court if those cases involve actions taken “under color of” their federal office. If charged, Ross would almost certainly choose to remove the case. Even in federal court, however, state criminal prosecutors would remain in charge of the prosecution, and any conviction would be a conviction under state law. And the president cannot pardon a state law crime.

In closing, Minnesota unquestionably has jurisdiction to investigate and to bring criminal charges against Ross. And Ross does not have absolute immunity, although he will certainly claim Supremacy Clause immunity if charged. We simply do not know at this point whether such a claim of immunity is likely to be successful.

Those looking for quick resolutions are likely to be disappointed. I expect that the Minnesota authorities will carefully and deliberately analyze the evidence they have access to, so it could take some time for them to decide whether to prosecute Ross. Moreover, if and when the state does bring charges, the immunity issues will be litigated first. As a result, it could take a very long time—even years—before there is a trial, much less a conviction.

Regardless of what happens in this particular case, federal immigration officers around the country should be on notice that they do not have complete impunity. They can be prosecuted and may be convicted. Lawless violence and unconstitutional actions may, sooner or later, end with a prison sentence.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/minnesota_state_capitol-_st-_paul-_minnesota-(1).jpg?sfvrsn=7d1dc82a_5,N,,2026-01-15 14:59:02.137222

During his address on Wednesday, Walz criticized the Justice Department for cutting out the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in its investigation into the deadly shooting, as well as the federal government for investigating Good and her family. He also referenced that investigation as the main reason for the resignation of several federal prosecutors, including U.S. Acting Attorney Joe Thompson.

In a statement, Minnesota Speaker of the House Lisa Demuth (R-Cold Spring), who is also a Republican candidate for governor, released a statement Wednesday criticizing Walz.

“Gov.

Our civil rights, our dignity

Por

Alex Domingos

-

Pennsylvanian has not been shielded from the Trump administration’s assault on civil liberties, epitomized by the cruel war against immigrants. Hispanic and Latine families across our commonwealth are enduring unparalleled threats while also confronting familiar obstacles that they’ve been navigating for generations.

Language barriers at the polls. Racial profiling by law enforcement. The lack of proper and equitable support in schools. These challenges are not new, but they are intensifying. Hispanic, Latine, and Black and brown immigrants are facing escalating attacks driven by disinformation campaigns designed to dehumanize entire communities and strip them of their constitutional rights.

These aren’t isolated challenges. They are daily reminders that dignity—basic human dignity—is still being negotiated in places where it should already be guaranteed.

At a time when immigrants’ rights are under attack, when fear too often replaces fairness, silence isn’t an option.

Millions of American family trees trace their roots to other lands. In Pennsylvania alone, one in six children has at least one immigrant parent. The truths and promises we hold to be self-evident in America would crumble if we ever stopped believing that immigrants aren’t worth protecting; we are them and they are us.

That’s why ACLU-PA launched “Dignity You Can’t Deny,” a campaign born to honor Hispanic Heritage Month but designed to live far beyond it. Our message is simple: celebrating Hispanic Heritage means defending civil rights.

Through this effort, we’ve elevated the conversations that matter most to Hispanic and Latine communities, such as the rights students have to an education, regardless of immigration status; how to vote without intimidation and what to do if polls do not have language resources; and how to stand firm in our humanity when policies or prejudice try to diminish it.

Because dignity isn’t a gift governments can give or take away, it’s an inherent right that belongs to every one of us.

Protecting dignity begins with understanding your rights, and helping others understand theirs. There are plenty of opportunities to help others exercise their rights. It’s also critical that we all participate in our democracy to ensure that the leaders we elect guard our rights, value our humanity and differences, and support policies that protect us so we can live freely and safely without discrimination.

Being active in our democracy starts at the ballot box — but that’s not where it ends. We can all speak out, protest, organize, and stay informed, strengthening our collective dignity so that everyone in our community is empowered to maintain their own.

As the ACLU of Pennsylvania, we are committed to educating and providing resources and opportunities for us all to join the fight to defend immigrants. Immigrants enrich our country and have the right to be here; our Constitution extends many of the protections we all cherish to all immigrants, regardless of status, recognizing that dignity should be based on personhood, not paperwork.

We’re supporting students and parents to know their rights.

We’re working in coalition to advocate for Welcoming policies in local counties and schools.

We’re urging Gov. Shapiro to end state collaboration with ICE.

We’re monitoring for and suing when there are civil liberty violations against Black and brown people being targeted, profiled, abducted, and inhumanely detained because of the Trump administration’s aggressive and unconstitutional deportation agenda.

We’re mobilizing to take action, together.

Most importantly, we’re working to flip the narrative, understanding that when dignity is honored as fundamental, our lives, families, and society become better for us all.

Biden had a -9 net approval rating at this point in his term and Trump had a -15 net approval rating at this point in his first term, according to Economist/YouGov polling.","Trump’s 40% approval rating in the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research January survey is largely consistent with his numbers throughout the first year of his second term—and are similar to his ratings in his first term, when he entered the presidency with a 42% approval rating and left office with nearly the same number.

Americans’ views of Trump’s handling of immigration—one of his signature issues—have declined sharply throughout his first year in office, however, reaching 38% in January, down from 49% in March last year.

The poll overlapped with several high-profile shootings involving ICE officers, including the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, when an ICE agent shot multiple rounds through her car window at close range in an incident captured by bystanders’ video—prompting a heated partisan debate about whether she was aiming to hit the officer with her vehicle, with some on the right breaking with Trump and his allies in denouncing the shooting as an unjustified use of force.

Trump’s approval rating increased to 40% from 36% in December, while his disapproval rating decreased from 61% to 59% in the latest AP/NORC poll of 1,203 U.S. adults conducted Jan. 8-11 (margin of error 3.9).

Despite the improvement in Trump’s overall approval rating, the poll found a plurality of respondents (45%) want the U.S. to take a less active role in solving global issues, an increase from the 33% who said the same in December.

Trump’s approval rating was also at 40% in the latest Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday and his disapproval rating was 56%, a slight improvement from last week (the poll of 1,437 registered voters was conducted Jan. 9-12 and has a margin of error of 3.1).

Trump’s 39% approval rating and 56% disapproval rating is unchanged from last week’s Economist/YouGov survey of 1,551 U.S. adults taken Jan. 2-5 (margin of error 3.3).

Trump’s approval rating dipped one point, to 46%, in the latest Morning Consult survey, consistent with his average job performance rating throughout his second term, according to the poll of 2,201 registered U.S. voters taken Jan. 2-4 (margin of error 2).

Trump’s approval rating ticked up three points, to 42%, and his disapproval rating decreased three points, to 56%, in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,248 U.S. adults taken Jan. 4-5, after the U.S. captured Maduro and his wife in a stunning raid early Saturday.

Views of Trump’s job performance improved to their highest point since October, despite only one in three Americans approving of the military operation and 72% saying they’re worried the U.S. will become too involved in Venezuela, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which has a margin of error of 3).

Trump ends the year with a 39% approval rating and 56% disapproval rating in the Economist/YouGov’s weekly poll following a downward trend since the start of his second term linked to his handling of the economy—as more than half of poll respondents, 51%, said they believe the economy is getting worse (the latest survey of 1,550 U.S. adults was conducted Dec. 26-29 and has a 3.6-point margin of error).

Trump’s -17% net approval rating compares to a -14% net approval rating after the first year of his first term and a -10% net approval rating after Biden’s first year, according to Economist/YouGov polling.

Trump had a 41% approval rating and 50% disapproval rating in an Emerson College poll of 1,000 voters taken Dec. 14-15 (margin of error 3).

The numbers are nearly the same as they were in November, when Trump also had a 41% approval rating and a 49% disapproval rating, but are a sharp turn from his 49% approval/41% disapproval rating in the group’s January poll taken at the start of his term.

Trump’s overall job performance had a 38% approval rating in the latest NPR/PBS/Marist poll of 1,440 adults conducted Dec. 8-11 (margin of error 3.2), while 54% disapprove.

His 36% approval rating on his handling of the economy is at its lowest point for both his first and second terms.

Trump had a 40% approval rating and 54% disapproval rating in a Quinnipiac University poll taken Dec. 11-15 among 1,035 registered voters (margin of error 3.9), unchanged from Trump’s October approval/disapproval rating.

Trump’s approval rating decreased from 41% to 39% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll, compared to the groups’ poll the previous week week, while his disapproval rating also increased from 57% to 59% (the poll of 1,016 respondents was taken Dec. 12-15 and has a three-point margin of error).

Approval of Trump’s handling of the economy slipped from 36% to 33% while the share of respondents who said they disapprove increased from 52% to 58%.

Trump’s 36% approval rating was unchanged from AP-NORC’s November poll in its survey of 1,146 adults conducted Dec. 4-8 (margin of error 4), but his rating on the economy dipped to 31%, a low point for both terms.

Trump’s approval rating ticked up to 41% from 38% in late November in Reuters/Ipsos’ poll, while his disapproval rating decreased from 60% to 57% (the poll of 4,434 U.S. adults was conducted Dec. 3-8 and has a two-point margin of error).

The uptick coincided with an increase in his performance on the cost of living—from 26% last month to 31% this month among all respondents, driven by a 10-point gain among Republican voters.

Trump has sought to improve voters’ views on his handling of the economy, kicking off an “affordability tour” in Pennsylvania.

The New York Times’s polling average found Trump had a 42% approval rating and 55% disapproval rating after several weeks of declining support.

The data shows voters increasingly disapprove of his handling of the economy—net approval of his economic performance has fallen across surveys—with just 26% percent of respondents believing Trump is doing a good job at managing the cost of living, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll.

Trump has also seen faltering numbers from within his own party and one-time supporters: Only 75% of Republicans approved of his handling of the economy in November, down from 82% in July, according to Marquette University polling, and his approval rating among white, college-educated men has dropped to 40% from 47% in June, according to polling from Fox News.

The Economist/YouGov’s weekly poll of 1,628 U.S. adults taken Nov. 28-Dec. 1 found Trump had a 38% approval rating and 57% disapproval rating, the seventh straight week his net approval rating was -15 or lower (the survey has a margin of error of 3.2).

In Trump’s first term, his net approval rating never dipped to or below -15 for more than three consecutive weeks, YouGov noted.

The Facebook Live stream showed more than a half dozen law enforcement agents on the sidewalk beside the city's bus station on Union Street. Multiple sources confirmed to CBS 6 that the agents were working for ICE. The video was shared hundreds of times within an hour before being removed before noon.

""I literally got the call a few moments ago, 'Yo, ICE is in Petersburg, snatching people up,'"" Petersburg businessman Ajani Sekov said.

Sekov said he immediately ran from his Washington Street shop to Union Street when he heard about the operation. He planned to intervene if he felt anyone's rights were being violated.

""We're a small, tight-knit community and we're going to stand together. I promise you. We're standing together,"" Sekov said.

The citizenship status of the individuals witnesses said were taken away during the operation is not yet clear. Petersburg police had no advance notice about the operation.

ICE conducts operation in Petersburg, Virginia

One concerned citizen, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation, drove to downtown Petersburg after seeing the video online.

""My first immediate feeling and thought was anger, it was like, doesn't make any sense,"" the person said. ""There's a few of us out here, at least just looking to get in between and keep them from harassing people who are, you know, American citizens. People don't deserve be harassed.""

Witnesses reported that the federal agents spent approximately 30 minutes on Union Street before leaving the area.

While ICE operations are not new in Virginia, sources indicated that some city leaders believed this was the first time ICE has made arrests in Petersburg in such a highly visible public location.

It's also one of the first operations since nationwide protests following the shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the hands of an ICE officer.

Neither police nor city leaders agreed to speak on camera about the ICE operation.

In June 2025, Governor Glenn Youngkin addressed ICE arrests in Virginia stating: ""We have a statewide collaboration and partnership between state police and I and ICE and FBI and DEA working to make sure that violent criminals who are here illegally are arrested.""

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that starting Feb. 1 he will deny federal funding to any states that are home to local governments resisting his administration's immigration policies, expanding on previous threats to cut off resources to the so-called sanctuary cities themselves.

Such an action could have far-reaching impacts across the U.S., potentially even in places that aren't particularly friendly to noncitizens. Two previous efforts by Trump to cut off some funding for sanctuary jurisdictions were shut down by courts.

""Starting Feb. 1, we're not making any payments to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come,"" he said. ""So we're not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities.""

Back in Washington, Trump was asked by reporters what kind of funding would be affected on Feb 1: ""You'll see,"" he said. ""It'll be significant.""

There is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

I went back to where the two smashed-up ICE vehicles were.","After Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents shot at least one person in north Minneapolis on the night of January 14, a crowd gathered and faced them down, confronting them and tearing down the yellow tape they put up around the area. Police reinforced the federal mercenaries, joining them in shooting a tremendous amount of tear gas and flash-bang grenades at demonstrators as well as at passing cars and houses in the residential district. Nonetheless, the officers lost control of the area and retreated, ceding the streets to those who had defied them.

In the process, ICE agents abandoned several vehicles in the area. Demonstrators opened up the vehicles and found identity cards, paperwork, license plates, operational plans, tactical gear, and other items. Footage of demonstrators looking through these materials was broadcast live on the internet.

This follows the atrocious murder, one week earlier, of Renee Good, perpetrated by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in the full light of day and captured on multiple videos. You can read an account of how demonstrators responded here.

Over the past month and a half, the Trump regime has sent more and more troops to the Twin Cities because they know that what happens there has implications for the whole country—and because they are losing. If the battle of Minneapolis in winter 2026 turns out the way that the battle of Portland turned out in summer 2020, it will bode ill for Trump’s ability to retain control by brute force.

It is important to note the role that local Minneapolis police played in assaulting demonstrators tonight, despite their nominally answering to a Democratic city government that has paid lip service to opposing ICE. Police across the country have played an essential role in enabling ICE to terrorize communities. Without the continuous assistance and support of local police departments, federal agencies would already have been outmaneuvered by protest movements. When Democrat politicians claim that they need to “maintain order,” they are attempting to position themselves as junior partners in the consolidation of fascism. It may be in their interests to “maintain order” as mercenaries kidnap and murder people, but it is not in ours.

We offer here an account from the protests following the shooting in North Minneapolis, sent to us anonymously.

I had two hours left at my work shift when my phone started blowing up. Several comrades didn’t know where I was and thought I might be out in the street.

“Where are you?”

“You OK????”

“Shots fired at 24th and Lyndale”

“They just shot another person”

Every rapid response group chat was talking about the same thing. All kinds of rumors were flying around. Did they shoot one person or two? Were the victims alive or dead? Somebody said ICE had shot a 12-year-old Venezuelan boy in the leg. Somebody else said the victim was hiding in his house for fear of arrest and desperately needed medical attention. I didn’t know what to believe.

It’s always like that when a new emergency is going down. In the course of the past 45 days of federal occupation, scrambling through a fog of war to find out what just happened has become a familiar sensation. Somebody sent me a livestream of a crowd running away as ICE agents shot tear gas grenades and flashbangs at them.

Time slowed to a crawl. I hurried to finish up the drudgery I was working on as fast as I could. When I felt like I could get away with it, I told my coworkers I had a family emergency and I had to leave early. I jumped in my car and ran every stop sign on the way to 24th and North Lyndale.

I ran into a crew of street medics two blocks north of the crowd. They told me about what they’d seen before I got there. ICE had snatched two kids suspected of throwing a firework at them—20 masked thugs charging up to grab the kids, only to release them half an hour later under intense pressure from the rest of the crowd. The medics warned me that they were going to get out before the cops started mass-arresting people. In their opinion, I was walking into a kettle. The air already stank of tear gas.

At 24th Street, I found a crowd of about a hundred people facing off against a skirmish line of Minneapolis Police Department pigs in riot gear. The feds had already left and handed over the situation to the local cops. Somebody was slowly beating a drum. To my right, kids stood up on an elevated front lawn, screaming “Fuck ICE!” and “Fuck 12!” down at MPD. Somebody was brandishing a tear gas canister that had been fired at them, showing it off to their friends. A TV news crew was there. They tried to talk to me. I pushed my way through the crowd to get away from the cameras. Beyond the skirmish line, a block south on Lyndale near 23rd, I heard the sound of shattering glass.

I doubled back and went around the block. I came out on the other side of the skirmish line. There was a crowd of young people on this side, too. They were smashing up two SUVs that I recognized immediately as ICE vehicles by their blacked-out windows and out-of-state plates. Guys were trading kicks at the glass. Somebody was proudly displaying a big Mexican flag. One young person jumped up on the hood and stomped her foot through the windshield. Somebody with a can of red spray-paint tagged “HANG KRISTI NOEM” on the side of the other car.

A few people pulled a locked gun safe out of the trunk of one of the cars. Somebody dumped a fingerprinting kit on the ground. Someone else was rifling through a folder of documents at a frantic pace, snapping pictures of each one with a cell phone. There was an ICE face mask in the driver-side door of the nearest SUV. Appropriately enough, there was an ice scraper on the floor of the vehicle.

Suddenly, I heard a loud bang behind me. The familiar acrid taste of tear gas filled my nostrils. I started running south with the rest of the crowd. When we got to the next intersection, however, I turned around and saw that the cops were pulling back, shooting projectiles at the crowd as they moved east on 24th. The crowd got its bearings and we turned around and ran back up to 24th. There were such huge clouds of tear gas to the east of us that I couldn’t see the cops anymore.

“This is one! This is ICE!” I heard somebody yelling excitedly. She was pointing at another silver SUV parked on 24th. I checked the plates against the database of ICE vehicles that activists keep, saw that she was correct, and instantly felt silly for doing clerical work in the middle of a riot. Someone started whacking one of the side windows with the ice scraper that had been in the previous vehicle, striking it as hard as possible. After a few swings, there was a satisfying crunch as the window gave in. People around me began kicking in these windows, too. Somebody got the driver’s side door open and threw a firecracker inside.

Some overzealous cameraman—I couldn’t tell if it was the same guy from before—muscled his way through the crowd to get a shot of the ICE vehicle receiving this treatment. “No video!” someone roared at him. “If you let him take pictures of this shit, somebody is going to jail!” A few people forcefully encouraged the cameraman to turn around and leave the area.

When the tear gas cleared, I saw that the cops were gone. It seemed too good to be true. I ran up a couple blocks to scout the perimeter. They were nowhere to be seen.

I went back to where the two smashed-up ICE vehicles were. A festive block party mood had set in. People were setting off fireworks. Somebody was trying to pry open the gun case. Someone was dancing on top of a vehicle again while someone else blasted “I Don’t Fuck With You” by Big Sean. Young folks passed around a bottle of Hennessy. A lane of traffic had opened up. Some passing motorists raised their fists out the window and shouted “FUCK ICE!”

“I’m so proud of my city,” I found myself murmuring out loud. After seven weeks of atrocities at the hands of these fascists, people were finally fighting back. I thought about the liberals who were at home wringing their hands about how we were supposedly giving the feds an excuse for a crackdown (what the fuck did they think was already happening?) and posting on Facebook about the “language of the unheard.” The newfound comrades I was partying with around the looted vehicles seemed perfectly eloquent to me.

The George Floyd uprising of 2020 was never very far away. Its specter has haunted Minneapolis throughout everything that has happened for the last month and a half. Tonight, January 14, it finally assumed corporeal form again. People will remember tonight as the opening salvo of the people’s counterattack against a fascist invasion.

When history is written the way it ought to be written, it will not be our ferocity, but rather, the moderation and long patience of the Twin Cities that will make people shake their heads in wonder.",https://cdn.crimethinc.com/assets/articles/2026/01/15/1.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 15:59:02.851258

Ward leader Jason Chavez spoke about seeing ICE questioning people based on how they looked, calling it racial profiling and noting that non-white Minnesotans have had to begin carrying passports with them to prove citizenship if stopped.

“What we are seeing in Minneapolis and this state should not be normalized,” he said.

Chavez asked Minnesotans to support their immigrant neighbors, providing mutual aid, supporting businesses and using whistles to alert people of ICE actions.

Community leaders said ICE officers were escalating the violence on the streets, not protesters, saying they were destabilizing communities and making the streets less safe.

They detailed incidents, including arrests of U.S. citizens, car accidents caused by ICE and ICE officers pushing people into traffic.

One woman described being mocked and taunted by ICE after being detained and reported that an ICE officer told her that protesters needed stop mocking them because “that’s why that lesbian b—- is dead.” She described hearing people screaming and begging in the detention center where she was held as ICE officers made small talk and joked with each other.

The woman said her friend, who was detained at the same time, was offered expedited processing for any undocumented family members if he gave up the names of undocumented people or protesters to ICE.

Minneapolis City Council President Elliot Payne said he was observing ICE operations, including one officer who was pointing his taser at people, when an officer pushed him off the sidewalk from behind.

“You have the right to observe these operations,” he said. “You have the right to keep your door shut, you have the right to demand a judicial warrant and if they do not have a judicial warrant, you do not have to open your door.”

Local leaders also announced a new, regular livestream update on the situation in Minnesota, with details to come later.

Trump comments on death of Renee Good

President Donald Trump called Renee Nicole Macklin Good‘s actions before her death “pretty tough,” seemingly backing his administration’s interpretation of the highly contested ICE shooting in Minnesota.

Good’s father, a Trump supporter, is heartbroken that the administration labeled his daughter a “domestic terrorist” within hours of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shooting her last week, according to CBS.

“I want to say to the father that I love all of our people,” Trump said in an interview published Tuesday.

Federal officials have consistently claimed Jonathan Ross was justified in shooting Macklin Good, who they say was attempting to run him over. But activists and lawmakers alike in Minnesota contend she was merely trying to leave the scene when she reversed her vehicle.

Trump acknowledged footage of her shooting death “can be viewed two ways, I guess,” but said there are “a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”

“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person,” he said. “But, you know, her actions were pretty tough.”

ICE officer who shot Renee Good had internal bleeding after: DHS

Ross suffered internal bleeding after the shooting, a Department of Homeland Security official confirmed to NewsNation on Wednesday.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has previously said Ross was hit by Macklin Good’s vehicle on Jan. 7, backing up the administration’s claims he shot her in “self-defense.”

“He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released, but he’s going to spend some time with his family,” Noem said last week.

Minnesota ICE shooting: Protests continue, prosecutors resign

Trump’s comments come on the heels of heated protests in Minneapolis, where demonstrators are admonishing the use of force in Macklin Good’s case and calling for federal immigration agents to leave the city.

On Tuesday, federal immigration agents deployed at least four rounds of flashbangs on crowds outside an ICE facility. Protests outside the newly fenced-in Henry Whipple Federal Building also escalated throughout the day.

ICE officers were seen busting a woman’s car window, pulling her out and arresting her Tuesday after she tried to drive down the street where a protest had broken out in front of a home ICE was raiding.

The woman said she was autistic and was trying to get to a doctor’s appointment.

The Trump administration officials have stressed that anyone who tries to stop or obstruct ICE officers is committing a felony.

Confrontations between residents and federal officers have become increasingly tense after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in a car eight days ago in Minneapolis, and the protests have spread to other cities. Trump's latest threat came a few hours after an immigration officer shot a Venezuelan man the government said was fleeing after agents tried to stop his vehicle in Minneapolis.

""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,"" Trump wrote on social media.

Trump, a Republican, has for weeks derided the state's Democratic leaders and called the Somali community in the area ""garbage"" who should be ""thrown out"" of the country.

He has already sent nearly 3,000 federal officers into the Minneapolis area, who have carried guns through the city's icy streets, wearing military-style camouflage gear and masks that hide their faces.

They have been met frequently by loud, often angry protests by residents, some blowing whistles or banging tambourines.

The agents have arrested both immigrants and protesters, at times smashing windows and pulling people from their cars, and have been shouted at for several episodes where they have stopped Black and Latino U.S. citizens and demanded identification.

'DISGUSTING AND INTOLERABLE'

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing Trump's immigration crackdown, said that just before Wednesday's shooting, two people attacked the federal officer with a broomstick and snow shovel as he wrestled with the Venezuelan man on the ground outside a home he had been running towards.

The officer ""fired defensive shots to defend his life,"" the DHS statement said. The DHS said the man had been allowed into the U.S. by the administration of Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, in 2022 through the government's humanitarian parole program.

The Trump administration, which has sought to revoke Biden-era immigration and asylum programs, accused him of being in the country illegally.

Reuters was not able to verify the account given by DHS.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told reporters at a late-night press conference that the FBI and Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension were gathering evidence from the scene. The man's injuries were not life-threatening and he was recovering in hospital, O'Hara said.

Speaking alongside O'Hara, Mayor Jacob Frey called the ICE surge an invasion and said he had seen ""conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable.""

""We cannot be at a place right now in America where we have two governmental entities that are literally fighting one another,"" Frey said.

TRUMP SUPPORTERS DIVIDED OVER IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

The Insurrection Act of 1807 is a law allowing the president to deploy the military or federalize soldiers in a state's National Guard to quell rebellion, an exception to laws that prohibit soldiers being used in civil or criminal law enforcement.

It has been used 30 times in U.S. history, according to New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. The Supreme Court has ruled that the president alone can determine if the act's conditions have been met.

Trump has already taken the unusual step of federalizing National Guard soldiers to help with immigration law enforcement in Democrat-run cities over the objections of state governors, including in Los Angeles last year, which a judge ruled in December was unconstitutional.

Trump's aggressive moves in Minnesota have divided his supporters: 59% of Republicans favored a policy prioritizing arrests by immigration officers even if people get hurt, while 39% said officers should focus on reducing harm to people even if it means fewer arrests, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey released on Thursday.

If Trump sends soldiers to Minnesota, he would almost certainly face legal challenges by the state. The Minnesota attorney general's office has already sued the Trump administration this week, saying the ICE surge was violating Minnesotans' rights, and on Wednesday asked U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez to issue a temporary order restraining it.

Brian Carter, a lawyer for Minnesota, told the judge that Trump's agents were engaged in a ""pattern of unlawful, violent conduct,"" including racial profiling and forced entry into residents' homes without warrants.

""They are foisting this crisis onto us,"" Carter said.

In a social media post on Thursday morning, Trump said incorrectly that the judge had ""declined to block"" the ICE surge.

In the hearing, Judge Menendez ordered the Trump administration to respond by Monday to Minnesota's complaints, saying she would rule after that, calling the issues raised by Minnesota's lawsuit ""enormously important.""

""They deal with the very fundamental relationships between the government and the state and municipalities,"" she said.

More than 150 tech workers so far have signed a petition asking for their company CEOs to call the White House, demand that ICE leave US cities, and speak out publicly against the agency’s recent violence.
It was perhaps naive, she says, to believe that tech leaders were ever really kinder, gentler capitalists, even if they positioned their companies as socially progressive.
“It’s important to remember that many of these tech leaders are people who are thinking about things from a business point of view,” O’Mara says.
But, she adds, a truism in American business is that political instability is not good for bottom lines.","Since Donald Trump returned to the White House last January, the biggest names in tech have mostly fallen in line with the new regime, attending dinners with officials, heaping praise upon the administration, presenting the president with lavish gifts, and pleading for Trump’s permission to sell their products to China. It’s been largely business as usual for Silicon Valley over the past year, even as the administration ignored a wide range of constitutional norms and attempted to slap arbitrary fees on everything from chip exports to worker visas for high-skilled immigrants employed by tech firms.

But after an ICE agent shot and killed an unarmed US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, in broad daylight in Minneapolis last week, a number of tech leaders have begun publicly speaking out about the Trump administration’s tactics. This includes prominent researchers at Google and Anthropic, who have denounced the killing as callous and immoral. The most wealthy and powerful tech CEOs are still staying silent as ICE floods America’s streets, but now some researchers and engineers working for them have chosen to break rank.

More than 150 tech workers so far have signed a petition asking for their company CEOs to call the White House, demand that ICE leave US cities, and speak out publicly against the agency’s recent violence. Anne Diemer, a human resources consultant and former Stripe employee who organized the petition, says that workers at Meta, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, TikTok, Spotify, Salesforce, Linkedin, and Rippling are among those who have signed. The group plans to make the list public once they reach 200 signatories.

“I think so many tech folks have felt like they can’t speak up,” Diemer told WIRED. “I want tech leaders to call the country’s leaders and condemn ICE’s actions, but even if this helps people find their people and take a small part in fighting fascism, then that’s cool, too.”

Nikhil Thorat, an engineer at Anthropic, said in a lengthy post on X that Good’s killing had “stirred something” in him. “A mother was gunned down in the street by ICE, and the government doesn’t even have the decency to perform a scripted condolence,” he wrote. Thorat added that the moral foundation of modern society is “infected, and is festering,” and the country is living through a “cosplay” of Nazi Germany, a time when people also stayed silent out of fear.

Jonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, added a “+1” to Thorat’s post. Shrisha Radhakrishna, chief technology and chief product officer of real estate platform Opendoor, replied that what happened to Good is “not normal. It's immoral. The speed at which the administration is moving to dehumanize a mother is terrifying.” Other users who identified themselves as employees at OpenAI and Anthropic also responded in support of Thorat.

Shortly after Good was shot, Jeff Dean, an early Google employee and University of Minnesota graduate who is now the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, began re-sharing posts with his 400,000 X followers criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, including one outlining circumstances in which deadly force isn’t justified for police officers interacting with moving vehicles.

He then weighed in himself. “This is completely not okay, and we can't become numb to repeated instances of illegal and unconstitutional action by government agencies,” Dean wrote in an X post on January 10. “The recent days have been horrific.” He linked to a video of a teenager—identified as a US citizen—being violently arrested at a Target in Richfield, Minnesota.

In response to US vice president JD Vance’s assertion on X that Good was trying to run over the ICE agent with her vehicle, Aaron Levie, the CEO of the cloud storage company Box, replied, “Why is he shooting after he’s fully out of harm’s way (2nd and 3rd shot)? Why doesn’t he just move away from the vehicle instead of standing in front of it?” He added a screenshot of a Justice Department web page outlining best practices for law enforcement officers interacting with suspects in moving vehicles.

Even venture capitalist Jason Calacanis, who cohosts the popular All In podcast with White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks, suggested that “masked unidentified federal agents asking people for their ‘papers’ are breaking the 4th amendment.”

Thorat, Dean, Levie, and Calacanis did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

The tech sector’s response to sociopolitical crises over the past several years have been a mixed bag. During the nationwide protests in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder six years ago, many large tech companies issued statements against systemic racism and police brutality and pledged to diversify their workforces. Some of those commitments were criticized as being hollow, and “DEI” soon became a political flashpoint rather than a shared corporate goal. But now, in the wake of Good’s death and other reports of alleged violence by ICE agents, big tech companies and their CEOs are choosing to stay silent, a testament to how the political landscape in the US has rapidly changed.

There’s a long history in the US of business leaders avoiding taking a stand on political issues, says Margaret O’Mara, a historian who studies the history of politics and Silicon Valley. It was perhaps naive, she says, to believe that tech leaders were ever really kinder, gentler capitalists, even if they positioned their companies as socially progressive. “It’s important to remember that many of these tech leaders are people who are thinking about things from a business point of view,” O’Mara says.

But, she adds, a truism in American business is that political instability is not good for bottom lines. “The reason why American tech has been so successful is because the political climate has been calm enough for people to build great companies,” O’Mara says. Some leaders may want to believe that ICE arrests and the icy streets of Minnesota are far enough away from their own boardrooms not to have any impact, but that belief might not hold much longer.","https://media.wired.com/photos/6965992c482e29ae79e365d8/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Backlash-Against-ICE-Policing-Tactics-Business-2242486803.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 13:58:47.543549

In September, an immigration judge in Louisiana ordered him deported to Syria or Algeria based on a separate rationale the Trump administration tacked on after Khalil’s arrest in Manhattan: failing to disclose certain information on his green card application.

Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., is appealing the deportation order through the Board of Immigration Appeals. Khalil’s lawyers have said that any appeal of the BIA decision, which would go to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, is unlikely to be successful, since the appeals court “almost never” grants stays of removal to noncitizens.

Separately, a federal district court last year ordered Khalil to be released from detention after he had been held for more than three months in Louisiana. It’s not clear what the 3rd Circuit’s ruling means for his release.

Further complicating the situation is a separate decision expected Thursday from U.S. District Judge William Young. The Boston-based Reagan appointee ruled in September that the administration had violated the free speech rights of campus activists when Young targeted pro-Palestinian international students with arrest and deportation. Now, he’s slated to decide what the remedy for those violations should be.

Young’s case centered on the arrests and attempted deportations of five activists, including Khalil. So Young’s decision could influence the administration’s next steps.

The 3rd Circuit panel consisted of Judge Thomas Hardiman, appointed by then-President George W. Bush; Judge Stephanos Bibas, appointed by President Donald Trump; and Judge Arianna Freeman, appointed by then- President Joe Biden. Freeman wrote a partial dissent, disagreeing that the matter should proceed through immigration court.

Khalil’s lawyers noted that Thursday’s decision doesn’t go into effect immediately, adding that “the Trump administration cannot lawfully re-detain Mr. Khalil until the order takes formal effect.”

Esha Bhandari, a member of Khalil’s legal team, said the decision “does not weigh in on the core First Amendment questions in this case and we are heartened by a strong dissent.” She added that “we have several options available for next steps, including being able to seek review en banc from the Third Circuit. The status quo remains in place while we continue the legal fight.”

Khalil himself acknowledged that “the door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line,” but added: “I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”

Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether the administration intends to re-detain Khalil.

“The immigration laws enacted by Congress ordinarily require an alien to challenge his deportation in a [petition for review of a final order of removal]—unless he raises questions that a court of appeals could not meaningfully review in that context. That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two,” Thursday’s decision said.

“But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fed%2Ffa%2F6d1413a64490b0ac8d945b023f86%2Fcampus-protests-mahmoud-khalil-15993.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 12:59:00.403442

What we know

The Department of Homeland Security said a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis this evening after the man allegedly fled a targeted traffic stop and then attacked the officer.

The new shooting comes a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis. More than 2,000 federal agents have been deployed to the city.

Good’s family thanked the public for their support, remembering Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, as a “beautiful light” who “brought joy to anyone she met.”

The Department of Homeland Security has called the operation in Minnesota its biggest to date, with more than 2,400 people having been arrested since it began Nov. 29.

Federal agents have used tear gas and pepper spray in confrontations with residents and protesters as pushback continues to grow in the days following Good's death.

Six people with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over concerns about the direction of the investigation into Good’s death, according to a source familiar with the resignations.

Officials in Minnesota sued the federal government Monday to halt the deployment of thousands of immigration agents to the state.

In video, family frantically pleads for help as they describe man shot by ICE in Minneapolis

In a live video posted to Facebook tonight, members of a family pleaded for help as they described a man who they said was shot in the leg by ICE agents.

The video, recorded from inside a home, showed several people frantically talking in Spanish to what appeared to be 911 dispatchers, one of whom seemed to be translating for the other. The video did not show anyone who appeared wounded.

“Please, help us. We have children,” a man says after several people tell the dispatcher that the person in question had been shot in the leg.

The Department of Homeland Security said tonight that a federal officer had shot a Venezuelan man in the leg after what the agency said was an “ambush.” It was not immediately clear whether the shooting described in the video was the same one referenced by federal and city officials.

NBC News has geolocated the video to the same neighborhood in North Minneapolis, where officials said the shooting occurred. The video was posted around the time of the shooting.

The person who posted the video did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The person filming the video at various points opens the curtains of a window. Red and blue flashing lights from a vehicle can been seen outside.

“They were chasing my husband for about half an hour,” a woman in the video can be heard telling dispatchers. “They were trying to crash into him and he got to the house, and since we closed the door on them, they shot him.”

The woman tells the dispatchers that ICE agents are outside the property, trying to get in.

“Tell them they shot the door,” another woman’s voice can be heard saying. “Son, come. Son, come.”

At least two young children can be seen in the video.

Mayor says ICE is 'creating chaos' but warns against 'taking the bait'

Immigration agents who have flooded the Minneapolis area are ""creating chaos,"" Mayor Jacob Frey said tonight, while also urging peace and warning protesters against ""taking the bait.""

Frey has been critical of federal immigration authorities since the fatal shooting of Good, which sparked national outrage and competing narratives between federal and local officials about what happened.

“I’ve seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable. If it were your city, it would be unacceptable there, too,” he said tonight.

But, as protesters and immigration enforcement once again clashed on the icy streets of Minneapolis, he appealed for calm.

Frey praised peaceful demonstrators while forcefully discouraging violence. The violent protesters, he said, are not helping the cause of immigrants or the residents of the city.

""And for anyone that is taking the bait tonight: Stop. That is not helpful. Go home. We cannot counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos.”

‘This is not sustainable,’ Minneapolis mayor says

The situation in Minneapolis is not sustainable, the city’s mayor said tonight, following another shooting of a civilian by a federal immigration agent.

Mayor Jacob Frey was speaking to reporters as the city, already experiencing unrest following the fatal shooting of Renee Good, was roiled further by the shooting of a man after what federal officials called an “ambush.”

“This is not sustainable. This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in. And at the same time, we are trying to find a way forward to keep people safe, to protect our neighbors, to protect order,” Frey said.

The city’s police force numbers about 600 officers, he said, dwarfed by what he said are about 3,000 immigration officers in the area. The local officers, he said, should be able to focus on police work and responding to day-to-day 911 calls.

He said tonight that residents have been asking local police officers to “fight ICE agents on the streets, to stand by their neighbors.”

“We cannot be at a place right now in America where we have two governmental entities that are literally fighting one another,” Frey said.

Police chief tells protesters to immediately disperse

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara called a protest that erupted in response to the shooting tonight unlawful and called on protesters to immediately disperse.

Protesters have thrown fireworks, rocks and ice at police, he said.

“It is well past the line, and people need to leave,” he said, adding: “This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further.”

Minneapolis police chief says federal agent shot man during a struggle

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a federal agent shot a man tonight during a struggle outside a home north of downtown Minneapolis.

After he was shot, the man retreated into the home and refused to come out, O’Hara said at a news conference.

Eventually federal agents entered the home and the man was taken to a hospital, O’Hara said. The chief described the injury as non life-threatning.

O’Hara said that a person may have assaulted the officer but that he wasn't sure who. The FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are processing evidence at the scene, he said.

Shooting occurred miles from where Renee Good was killed

The shooting by a federal agent tonight occurred in the 600 block of 24th Avenue North, the city said, roughly 12 miles north of where Good was killed last week.

Minneapolis officials ask for calm after shooting

Minneapolis officials asked for calm after a federal immigration officer shot a man during what federal authorities described as a violent confrontation.

The city said on X that the man was hospitalized with apparently non-life-threatening injuries.

“We understand there is anger,” the city said. “We ask the public to remain calm.”

In a separate post, the city asked federal immigration authorities to leave the city and the state immediately.

""We stand by our immigrant and refugee communities — know that you have our full support,"" the city said.

Trump calls ICE shooting of Renee Good 'sad to see on both sides'

Trump today softened his tone on last week's fatal shooting of Good , calling it ""unfortunate.""

""It's so sad to see on both sides,"" Trump said in an interview with Reuters.

A week earlier, hours after the shooting, Trump said on Truth Social that Good “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer.”

Asked today whether Ross did the right thing, Trump told Reuters: “I don’t get into right or wrong. I know that it was a tough situation to be in.”

“There was very little respect shown to the police, in this case, the ICE officers,” he added.

Federal officer shoots man in leg after 'ambush' in Minneapolis, DHS says

A federal officer shot a Venezuelan man this evening in Minneapolis after what the Department of Homeland Security described as an “ambush,"" the agency said.

The officer had been conducting a targeted traffic stop at 6:50 p.m. local time when the man left in a vehicle, which crashed into a parked car, and then ran away, the department said in a statement.

As the officer pursued the man, who the department said was in the country illegally, he assaulted the officer, according to the statement.

During the struggle, two people came out of an apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, according to the statement.

The man got loose and also began attacking the officer with a shovel or a broomstick, the department said.

“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots to defend his life,” the department said, adding that the man officers had been chasing was shot in the leg.

All three men barricaded themselves in the apartment but were taken into custody, according to the statement.

Both the man who was shot and the officer were hospitalized, the department said. Additional details about the incident were not immediately available.

Tensions grow as crowd gathers after reported shooting in Minneapolis

An angry crowd gathered tonight in a residential area where law enforcement officers were present and temporarily blocking a street.

People blew whistles, yelled expletives and threw snowballs at masked officers, video captured by NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis showed.

At one point, the officers could be seen using ""flash bang"" devices and chemical irritants on the protesters, according to the KARE reporter on the scene, and moving a perimeter closer to multiple law enforcement vehicles that had their lights activated.

Minneapolis says it's aware of reports of shooting involving federal law enforcement

The city of Minneapolis said it was aware of reports of a shooting involving federal law enforcement in North Minneapolis.

The city said on X tonight that it was working to confirm additional details.

Gov. Walz tells people to record 'atrocities' against Minnesotans

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz encouraged people tonight to help create a record of the “atrocities” against Minnesotans by recording immigration agents.

“You have an absolute right to peacefully film ICE agents as they conduct these activities,” he said in a brief address. “Help us create a database of atrocities against Minnesotans, not just to establish a record for posterity, but to bank evidence for future prosecution.""

Walz cited a social media post in which Trump told Minnesotans not to fear because “THE DAY OF RECONKING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING,” and he pleaded with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “end this occupation.”

“You’ve done enough,” he said.

ICE officer who shot Renee Good suffered internal bleeding, official says

Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who fatally shot Good in Minneapolis last week, suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the incident, a Department of Homeland Security official said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that the officer had been treated at the hospital and released.

6 prosecutors who resigned from state U.S. attorney’s office identified

The six prosecutors who resigned from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Minnesota were identified as Joe Thompson, Melinda Williams, Harry Jacobs, Tom Calhoun Lopez, Ruth Shnider and Tom Hollenhorst, a source familiar with the resignations told NBC News.

Hollenhorst announced last week that he would be retiring, according to the source.

Trump threatens funding for states over 'sanctuary' cities as clashes intensify in Minneapolis

Trump said that he would cut off federal funding next month for any state that includes “sanctuary” cities, expanding his attacks on mostly Democratic-run cities after days of clashes in Minneapolis.

Trump’s vow, which he made on social media, repeated comments he first made in a speech in Detroit yesterday, when he said he would halt payments starting Feb. 1 to any state that had so-called sanctuary cities, which limit local authorities’ cooperation with federal immigration officers.

Any such effort would undoubtedly be challenged in court. A federal judge in August blocked a previous attempt to freeze funding for more than 30 sanctuary jurisdictions unless they cooperated with his immigration crackdown.

Trump’s declaration came amid escalating tensions in Minneapolis, a week after a U.S. immigration officer fatally shot Good, a U.S. citizen, in her car.

Good family hires noted civil rights attorney Antonio Romanucci

Good’s family hired civil rights attorney Antonio Romanucci, who said he's dedicated to ""fervently pursuing justice on behalf"" of Good.

“It is always challenging to pursue litigation against state and local law enforcement officers because of the many immunities they are afforded. But legal action against the federal government is even more complex,"" according to a statement by Romanucci, who also represented loved ones of George Floyd, the Minneapolis man murdered by police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020.

""This process will not deter us in any way from fervently pursuing justice on behalf of Renee Good,” he said.

Renee Good's family releases a statement

Good’s family thanked the public for their support today, remembering her as a “beautiful light” who “brought joy to anyone she met.”

“The kind of unending care we’ve been given during this time is exactly the kind that she gave to everyone,” her parents and four siblings said in a statement released through their attorney.

“She was our best friend with a seemingly infinite capacity for love. Nae-Nae gave everything she had to take care of her friends and family, and indeed people she never met,” the statement read. “If there was any celebration for any one of us, Nae amplified it. If there was sorrow, she was with you for all of it. Nae found joy in others being comforted and was herself a fountain of comfort.”

Her family called her their “protector” and said “we feel her absence deeply as we struggle to compose this statement without her gentle guidance.”

“Knowing we can’t match her eloquence, we are remembering Nae in all the little things she’d be doing for us today. She is in the tight hug we offer each other as we lean on the counter,” the family said. “She’s in the goofy cackles we elicit in each other as we recall sweet memories, and she’s in the tears we leave on each others’ shirts. She is in the flow state that comes when your spirit is creating something passionate to share with others. Her voice is the one singing the song stuck in your head. More than anything, she is there when your heart breaks and fills for another person.”

“When we remember Nae, we remember her abundant heart, and we will move forward imitating that unending care,” they concluded.

Joe Rogan criticizes ICE tactics: ‘Are we really going to be the Gestapo?’

Joe Rogan compared ICE to “the Gestapo” in the latest episode of his popular podcast yesterday, openly breaking with Trump on his administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.

Rogan, one of the biggest podcasters in the world, endorsed Trump in the 2024 election just days after he held a three-hour interview with him on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” The show, which has consistently retained its No. 1 spot on the Spotify podcast charts, has more than 20.6 million subscribers on YouTube.

But yesterday, Rogan, who has been increasingly critical of Trump’s mass deportation agenda in recent months, expressed concern over ICE’s activities in an episode featuring Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. He said that “most people” believe law enforcement should arrest criminals but that many of the same people also believe ICE is “operating illegally.”

No immediate court decision on a request to stop the immigration crackdown in Minnesota

A judge made no immediate decision today on Minnesota’s request to suspend the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the state, where federal agents have yanked people from cars and confronted angry bystanders demanding they pack up and leave.

Plumes of tear gas, the deployment of chemical irritants and the screech of protest whistles have become common on the streets of Minneapolis, especially since an immigration officer fatally shot Good on Jan. 7 as she drove away.

“What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,” state Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said at the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case “on the front burner” and gave the U.S. Justice Department until Monday to file a response to the request for a restraining order. Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement.

Menendez said the state and cities will have a few more days to respond.

“It is simply recognition that these are grave and important matters,” she said of the timetable, noting that there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

Justice Department attorney Andrew Warden suggested the slower approach set by Menendez was appropriate.

Menendez is also handling a separate lawsuit challenging the tactics used by ICE officers and other federal officers when they encounter protesters and observers. A decision could be released this week.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and vows not to back down. The Defense Department is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist, CNN reported.

“What we see right now is discrimination taking place only on the basis of race: Are you Latino or are you Somali? And then it is indiscriminate thereafter,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told Fox News. “In other words, they are pulling people off the streets. They have pulled U.S. citizens off the streets, and you don’t need to take my word for it at this point. This has been very well documented.”

The president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota said four tribal members were detained at a homeless camp in Minnesota last week. Three remained in custody late last night.

“Enrolled tribal members are citizens of the United States by statute and citizens of the Oglala Sioux Nation by treaty,” said tribe President Frank Star Comes Out, who demanded their release.

A week later, the memorial for Renee Nicole Good is still growing

It has been a week since an ICE officer fatally shot Good in Minneapolis, and the memorial to honor her at the scene of the slaying continues to grow.

Flowers, stuffed animals and protest signs continued to pile up and adorn the spot on Portland Avenue between East 33rd and 34th streets where Good was slain by ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

Minneapolis mayor speaks on ICE, investigation into Renee Good's death

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he doesn’t want to eliminate Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but believes ICE agents should target states that have larger numbers of undocumented immigrants.

“This, however, is the largest immigration enforcement action on record in the United States,” he said in a Wednesday Fox News interview on “Fox & Friends.”

“Why is the largest scale immigration enforcement action taking place where we don’t even have that many undocumented immigrants? Why would it not take place in Texas or Florida or Utah where you do actually have those large numbers of undocumented immigrants,"" he said.

The Mayor continued: “That is where it would make more sense. But again, if the issue is murder or crime, the answer is we do work with the federal government. In fact, we are presently doing that. So the truth is it is not about murder or crime.”

Frey went on to say that there is “discrimination taking place only on the basis of race” in his city.

“Are you Latino or are you Somali? And it is indiscriminate thereafter. They are pulling people off the streets. They have pulled U.S. citizens off the streets,” he said. “If this were about murder or rape or crime or fraud, then, look, we have worked together not just with the Biden administration, with the past Trump administration, with the Bush administration. We have worked with a number of administrations to successfully drive down crime. This is not about that.”

The Mayor, who called for ICE to “get the f— out” of Minneapolis following Renee Good’s death, said he wants there to be a “full and fair investigation” into what happened.

“I may have disagreements with some people that are part of your audience, but I hope that people can trust that I love my city,"" he said. ""We are experiencing an extraordinary comeback. Crime is down in virtually every category in virtually every neighborhood. Small businesses were opening. And this whole chaos that has taken place, yeah it is setting us back.”

DHS says officers were 'forced' to arrest man whose neck they kneeled on in Minneapolis

After a video posted to social media showed ICE officers kneeling on the neck of a man whom they were arresting in Minneapolis, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said they were ""forced"" to make the arrest after the man impeded law enforcement.

The video shows ICE officers yanking a man from his car and dragging him to the ground, while he is kicking his legs in an attempt to wrestle free. Three officers were attempting to handcuff the man, with one officer holding his arms around the man's neck while two others tried to pin him to the ground.

The officer around the man's neck then moves his hands to assist the other two officers in handcuffing the man, and replaces his hands with his knee on the man's head and neck.

DHS said the incident, which took place on Jan. 7, occurred after officers were responding to a distress call from colleagues at the scene who requested backup ""because they were being attacked by agitators."" The spokesperson said that amid the chaos, an officer who ""feared for his life"" fired his weapon in defense.

When officers arrived, ""hundreds of violent rioters swarmed them, assaulted them, and blocked their path,"" DHS said. It added that officers gave commands to the ""violent agitator who was obstructing law enforcement"" to move out of the way, but he refused and DHS said he ""clearly resisted arrest.""

DHS said officers were ""forced to arrest him for impeding law enforcement,"" and that officers used the ""minimum amount of force necessary to gain control of the violent agitator.""

The spokesperson pointed out that the social media video is slowed down at the point at which the office places his knee on the man's neck. DHS said it was actually ""a split second during a violent struggle.""

Oglala Sioux Tribe calls for release of members

The Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota demanded the release of three tribal members who were allegedly taken into custody from a homeless encampment last week by ICE agents agents in Minnesota.

Those captured are ""tribal citizens"" and ""are not aliens,"" according to a tribe statement. The members being held are categorically outside immigration jurisdiction,"" the tribe said.

""This is not a misunderstanding or an enforcement discretion issue,"" tribal President Frank Star Comes Out said. ""This is a treaty violation. Treaties are not optional. Sovereignty is not conditional. Our citizens are not negotiable.""

Representatives for ICE, DHS and the Bureau of Indian Affairs could not be immediately reached for comment today.

Stephen Miller claims Minnesota governor and Minneapolis mayor are guilty of terrorism

Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told Fox News last night that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — both strident critics of the federal operation — were guilty of terrorism and of inciting violence.

""You can use the term insurgency, you can use the term insurrection, you can use the term domestic terrorism,"" Miller said, without outlining how either man has incited violence in the state.

Local prosecutor reiterates plan to collect evidence herself

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, who along with city and state authorities was shut out of the FBI's investigation of Renee Good's death, said she still hopes to collect enough evidence herself to make her own decision on bringing criminal charges against ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

Whether she manages to do that remains to be seen. Without cooperation from the FBI — which has Ross' gun, shell casings and Good's car — Moriarty said she will rely on an online portal she announced last week for the public to submit evidence, and whatever the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shares from the material it collected at the scene before it was booted from the case.

Moriarty, a former public defender who is in the last year of her four-year term as prosecutor and is not running for re-election, said in an interview that she has the legal authority to prosecute a federal officer. No matter where the evidence takes her, her goal is to add transparency to the case, she said. ""We want community members to feel as though there is documentation and perhaps accountability,” Moriarty said.

The federal investigation has already turned divisive, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche saying in a statement yesterday there was “currently no basis” for the criminal section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to investigate Ross. Several prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over their concerns with the direction of the investigation. At least some felt pressure to examine any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow, a law enforcement official with knowledge of their decisions told NBC News. The official said the prosecutors were also concerned about cutting out state and local authorities.

Moriarty said she has also asked police in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs for evidence of other types of serious crimes allegedly committed by federal agents.

6 people resign from Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s Office over handling of Renee Good's death investigation

Federal prosecutors resign over concerns about probe into Minneapolis ICE shooting, source says

At least three prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over their concerns with the direction of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, a person familiar with the resignations told NBC News yesterday.

The person confirmed the resignations of Joseph Thompson, Melinda Williams and another attorney. The two named attorneys, Thompson and Williams, did not immediately respond to messages from NBC News seeking comment.

The attorneys felt pressure from Justice Department leadership in both Minneapolis and Washington to investigate any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow, said a law enforcement official with knowledge of their decisions. The official said the prosecutors were also concerned about a decision to cut out state and local authorities from the federal investigation.

Immigration agents deploy tear gas, pepper spray in Minneapolis as confrontations grow

From high school students to elected officials, residents in Minnesota are pushing back against the growing deployment of federal immigration officers in their neighborhoods, leading to days of confrontations and protests.

Resident Neph Sudduth stopped to choke back tears as she witnessed immigration officers roaming around her neighborhood, just a few blocks from the site where an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good last week, and clashing with protesters.

""They will hurt you for real! They will hurt you for real!"" she shouted at anti-ICE demonstrators, urging them to move away from the officers’ vehicles. Just then, an immigration officer rolled down his window, extended his arm and sprayed a protester point-blank in the face with a chemical agent.

Minnesota sues federal government to try to end deployment of immigration agents

Officials in Minnesota sued the federal government to halt the deployment of thousands of immigration agents to the state.

""We allege that the obvious targeting of Minnesota for our diversity, for our democracy, and our differences of opinion with the federal government is a violation of the Constitution and of federal law,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference.

Calling the deployment a federal ""invasion of the Twin Cities,"" he said: ""This has to stop.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. – JANUARY 15, 2026 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12)and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) reintroduced the Eliminating Bias in Algorithmic Systems (BIAS) Act, legislation to ensure that every federal agency that uses, funds, or oversees artificial intelligence (AI) has a dedicated Office of Civil Rights focused on combating AI-driven bias, discrimination, and related harms.

The bill would require federal agencies to establish or strengthen civil rights offices with staff trained in algorithmic accountability and civil rights enforcement, and to regularly report to Congress on how AI systems are impacting vulnerable communities. These reports would also include recommendations for legislative action to address emerging harms.

“I represent Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, a region that reflects both our industrial past and the technologies shaping our future. As a growing hub for innovation in Artificial Intelligence, we have a responsibility to make sure AI does not deepen the inequities Black, brown, low-income, and other vulnerable communities already face. AI carries the same biases humans do, and without oversight, those harms will be replicated if not amplified,” said Rep. Lee. ""The Eliminating BIAS Act puts real guardrails in place to demand transparency, accountability, and strong civil rights protections, especially in an age of rampant disinformation and misinformation. I’m proud to partner with Senator Markey to ensure innovation never comes at the cost of our civil rights or human dignity.”

“From housing to health care to public services, AI is increasingly being used to make consequential decisions, diagnoses, recommendations, and predictions that can significantly alter our lives,” said Senator Markey. “As the risks of bias and discrimination in AI systems become more apparent, the federal government must lead by example and protect marginalized communities that face the greatest consequences when AI goes wrong. My Eliminating BIAS Act will ensure that the government has the proper tools, resources, and personnel to protect these communities and mitigate AI’s dangerous effects, while providing Congress with critical information to address algorithmic harms.”

Algorithms are already discriminating against disadvantaged communities in a variety of contexts. For example, companies have used algorithms to exclude(link is external) users of certain gender identities from viewing job advertisements, block(link is external) advertisements for clothing made for people with disabilities, and charge higher interest rates for minorities. In addition, facial recognition technologies have the highest error rates among Black women(link is external). If left unchecked, biased algorithms will further exacerbate discrimination, inequality, and racism.

“Algorithmic systems affect nearly every part of daily life, making decisions about employment, housing, education, health, finance, and so much more. These systems have been shown to repeatedly create biased outcomes that disproportionately harm Black people and other communities of color. Yet, this administration has encouraged rapid adoption of algorithms without regard for civil rights. The Eliminating Bias in Algorithmic Systems Act presents an alternative path where agencies are required to report the harms created by algorithmic systems and ways to mitigate them” said Jina John, Policy Counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

“Common Sense Media applauds Senator Markey for reintroducing the Eliminating BIAS Act,” said Amina Fazlullah, Head of Tech Policy Advocacy at Common Sense Media. “Without intentional choices to prioritize fairness, AI systems will not learn from past mistakes and will continue to replicate historic inequities, putting children, families, and marginalized communities at risk. This bill ensures federal agencies have the expertise, transparency, and oversight needed to identify and address discriminatory algorithms. As AI increasingly influences access to education, healthcare, employment, and housing, strong safeguards are essential to build public trust in how the government uses these technologies.”

“New America's Open Technology Institute is pleased to endorse Senator Markey's and Congresswoman Lee's Eliminating BIAS Act, which requires federal agencies to establish civil rights offices focused on bias, discrimination, and other harms that may arise from the use of algorithms. This proposed legislation centers rights and fairness in the federal government's development, use, and oversight of artificial intelligence tools. Empowering civil rights offices within federal agencies is critical to ensuring that our government uses artificial intelligence in ways that safeguard vulnerable communities and the health of our democracy.” said Prem Trivedi, Director, New America's Open Technology Institute.

“The National Urban League proudly supports the Eliminating BIAS Act—legislation that is long overdue. While AI holds great promise, far too often opaque algorithms reinforce systemic inequities that disproportionately harm Black, Brown, Indigenous, and immigrant communities. By requiring federal agencies to stand up civil rights offices staffed with technologists, mandating transparency to Congress, and establishing a cross agency working group, this bill puts accountability and equity at the heart of the government’s use of AI. Today, our government must lead by example—ensuring that technology uplifts every community,” said Marc H. Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League.

The Eliminating BIAS Act is cosponsored in the Senate by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Adam Schiff (D-Ca.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and in the House of Representatives by Reps.

U.S. Suspends Immigrant Visa Processing for 75 Countries

The U.S. government has announced an indefinite suspension of immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries, effective January 21, 2026, as part of a broader immigration enforcement and vetting review. Under the directive, U.S. consular officers are instructed to pause or refuse immigrant visa issuance for affected nationals while the State Department reassesses screening standards and compliance with public charge and security-related requirements. Countries reportedly impacted include Somalia, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Yemen, and others.

The freeze applies specifically to immigrant visas processed abroad and does not impact nonimmigrant visa categories (such as B, F, H, or L visas) or adjustment of status applications filed within the United States. The measure is characterized as temporary, but no end date has been announced, creating uncertainty for applicants awaiting consular processing and for employers sponsoring employees for permanent residence from overseas.

Impact: The suspension of immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries may cause significant delays to green card timelines and consular case processing. Employers should identify affected cases, adjust mobility planning, and closely monitor State Department guidance as the pause continues.

February 2026 Visa Bulletin

The Department of State’s February 2026 Visa Bulletin reflects continued immigrant visa backlogs, with limited movement across most family- and employment-based categories. For employers, the bulletin underscores ongoing challenges in green card timing, particularly for employees chargeable to India and China, and reinforces the need for realistic workforce and retention planning.

In the employment-based categories, EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 for India and China remain unchanged, continuing long wait times with no forward movement. The most notable advancement appears in EB-3 for Rest of World, Mexico, and the Philippines, which moved forward modestly. Other employment-based categories showed little to no change. Family-sponsored categories also remained largely static, with limited movement primarily in select Mexico and Philippines preferences.

February 2026 Visa Bulletin – High-Level Movement Summary

Impact: Teams should monitor Final Action Dates and Dates for Filing closely. USCIS will accept employment-based adjustment filings using the Dates for Filing chart for February 2026, but slow movement and retrogression risk continue, underscoring the need for early sponsorship, careful tracking, and planning for extended nonimmigrant status reliance.

U.S. Visa Bond Requirements

The U.S. Department of State has updated its “Countries Subject to Visa Bonds” list, expanding the pilot program that requires certain visitors to post refundable visa bonds when applying for B-1/B-2 (business/tourist) visas. Under this Temporary Final Rule, consular officers may require applicants from designated countries to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000, intended to increase compliance with visa terms and discourage overstays. The bond requirement is determined at the visa interview and is refunded if the traveler departs the U.S. before their authorized stay expires or if admission is denied.

As of January 8, 2026, the list includes 38 countries whose nationals may be subject to visa bond requirements. Many of the additions took effect on January 21, 2026, though some were already in force earlier. Nationals of these countries must post a bond only if directed by a consular officer and must also file DHS Form I-352 to secure the bond.

Impact: The expanded visa bond program may add significant cost and administrative requirements for certain B-1/B-2 travelers, including $5,000–$15,000 bonds, Form I-352 filing, and possible port-of-entry restrictions. Mobility teams should plan for added expense, update travel guidance, and proactively support affected travelers to avoid delays.

DHS Terminates Somalia’s Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

The Department of Homeland Security has announced the termination of TPS for Somalia, with the designation set to expire on March 17, 2026. Somali nationals currently relying on TPS will lose protection from removal and work authorization unless they obtain another lawful immigration status before that date. TPS for Somalia had been in place since 1991 and was most recently extended through March 2026.

DHS stated that the termination follows a review of country conditions and a determination that Somalia no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS, though the decision has drawn criticism and may be subject to legal challenge.

Impact: Somali TPS holders will need to transition to another immigration status to maintain work authorization after March 17, 2026. Employers should identify affected employees, assess alternative status options, and plan for potential workforce impacts while monitoring for possible litigation or policy changes.

Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration Immigration Policy

A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration immigration policy aimed at curtailing temporary legal status for thousands of migrants, ruling that the government’s action violated procedural and legal requirements. The decision stems from a lawsuit challenging the administration’s effort to end certain humanitarian parole or temporary status programs for migrants from multiple countries, which would have affected an estimated 10,000–12,000 individuals who were lawfully residing in the U.S. under family-based parole programs.

The judge’s order prevents the administration from moving forward with the policy pending further litigation, emphasizing that the government failed to provide the legally required notice and justification for terminating status for those individuals. This action represents a broader pattern of judicial checks on executive immigration actions, particularly those involving rollback of existing status programs without standard procedural safeguards.

Impact: The court’s ruling temporarily preserves lawful status and work authorization for affected individuals, avoiding immediate disruption for employers and employees. However, the administration may appeal, and ongoing litigation creates continued uncertainty, underscoring the need for close monitoring and contingency planning for impacted populations.

USCIS Premium Processing Fee Increase

USCIS has announced that premium processing fees will increase effective March 1, 2026, as part of a required biennial inflation adjustment under the USCIS Stabilization Act. The new fees will apply to Form I-907 requests postmarked on or after March 1, 2026, and filings submitted with outdated fees will be rejected. The increase does not affect eligibility, adjudication standards, or processing timelines.

Updated Premium Processing Fees (Effective March 1, 2026):

Impact: For in-house global mobility and immigration teams, the impact is primarily financial and operational. Premium processing is commonly used for time-sensitive cases such as H-1B and L-1 filings, OPT/STEM employment authorization, travel needs, and immigrant petition milestones, and the higher fees should be reflected in 2026 budgets and forecasts. Where possible, employers may consider filing before March 1, 2026 to use the current fee structure, and should update internal processes and coordinate with finance and external counsel to avoid filing errors.

DHS Removes One-Year R-1 Residency Requirement

Effective January 14, 2026, DHS issued an interim final rule eliminating the one-year foreign residency requirement for religious workers seeking to return to the U.S. in R-1 nonimmigrant status after reaching the five-year maximum stay. While R-1 workers must still depart the U.S. upon reaching the five-year limit, they are no longer required to remain abroad for a full year before reapplying for R-1 admission.

The change applies to all R-1 religious workers, including ministers, monks, nuns, and other qualifying religious occupations. DHS noted that severe EB-4 immigrant visa backlogs have left many religious workers unable to transition to permanent residence before exhausting their R-1 time, and the rule is intended to mitigate staffing disruptions caused by visa retrogression. The rule took effect immediately and is subject to a 60-day public comment period.",https://wolfsdorf.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/News-Digest-Header-1.png,N,,2026-01-15 12:59:44.667773

Washington, D.C. | The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) strongly condemns today’s State Department action freezing visa processing for nationals from 75 countries under an expanded and deeply troubling interpretation of the “public charge” doctrine.

Unlike prior travel bans that relied on overt nationality-based exclusions, this policy weaponizes economic status, health, age, disability, and other personal characteristics to justify widespread visa denials and indefinite processing freezes. Under the new guidance, consular officers are instructed to deny visas based on speculative assessments of whether an individual might rely on public benefits in the future—including considerations such as health conditions, English proficiency, age, weight, or a potential need for long-term medical care.

This approach represents a dangerous escalation. It replaces even the pretense of individualized adjudication with vague, discretionary standards that invite bias, discrimination, and arbitrary decision-making—while disproportionately impacting immigrants from the Global South, including Arab, African, Muslim, and other historically targeted communities.

By framing this mass freeze as a temporary “reassessment” of immigration procedures, the administration has effectively created an indefinite pause on family reunification, employment-based immigration, and lawful pathways to permanent residence for millions of people—without congressional authorization, clear timelines, or meaningful oversight.

ADC rejects the false premise underlying this policy: that immigrants are a burden rather than contributors and that denying entry based on income, health, or age makes the United States safer. These measures do nothing to enhance security. Instead, they institutionalize discrimination, separate families, and erode long-standing civil and human rights protections.

In light of these restrictive measures, we call on the State Department to immediately implement a robust, transparent, and functional waiver process—one that is accessible in practice, adjudicated promptly, and explicitly designed to keep families together. A waiver system that exists only on paper or that depends on unchecked consular discretion is unacceptable.

Family unity and due process are fundamental rights. ADC will continue to challenge discriminatory immigration policies and advocate for a system rooted in dignity, fairness, and equal protection under the law.

“President Trump has found yet another way not only to limit people seeking to come to the United States, but also to create misperceptions about the very real economic benefits that immigrant populations have long brought to the United States,” said Yumna Rizvi, CVT senior policy analyst.

In language from the White House, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that visa processing will be halted for immigrants from 75 unnamed countries, beginning January 21. He noted that this action is intended to stop “welfare and public benefits” from going to immigrants.

The move, which will affect nearly 40 percent of the countries on the globe, impacts only those seeking to immigrate to the U.S. and does not apply to student or tourism visas.

Nonetheless, it’s the latest effort by the Trump administration to curb immigration by pointing to potential use of U.S. safety net programs.

“The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,” the department posted on the social platform X.

“The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.”

The list of 75 countries includes Somalia, Haiti, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, Brazil, Russia and Pakistan. The department said it will stop processing visas from these countries on Jan. 21.

“We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,” the department wrote in a follow-up post on X.

The pause, first reported by Fox News, comes amid the Trump administration’s sweeping efforts to restrict both legal and illegal immigration into the U.S., as well as its probes into social services fraud in Minnesota, which has focused on the Somali American community.

The State Department in November informed visa officers they could deny immigrant visas to those with certain medical conditions if they deem the applicant likely to rely on public benefits should they have medical issues.

That guidance instructed officers to consider both an applicant’s health and overall financial picture when determining whether to issue a visa.

Common conditions like cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes were among those on the list.

Beyond limiting immigration, the State Department has also been revoking existing visas, announcing this week that it has revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump returned to office a year ago.

WASHINGTON, DC — Today, a coalition of national civil rights, faith and Latino advocacy organizations led by UnidosUS held a virtual press conference demanding the U.S. Congress take immediate action to rein in heinous and excessive immigration enforcement practices that are eroding constitutional protections, undermining public safety and harming communities across the country. This press call followed a joint letter signed by 74 national, state and local organizations across the country also calling on the U.S. Congress to exercise its constitutional oversight role.

During the press conference held ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, national advocates cited growing concerns following the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a mother and U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis, as well as the numerous accounts of indiscriminate abuse and unwarranted deaths seen in other states couched under the guise of federal immigration enforcement operations.

“The abuse of power we have seen over the last year from this administration is unlawful, unacceptable, and un-American,” said UnidosUS president and CEO Janet Murguía. “What the Latino community has experienced in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and most recently Minneapolis, feels like this administration has declared war on our community and that we are under assault by our own government. That is why this coalition is demanding Congress use its oversight and appropriations power to ensure transparency and to hold the administration accountable.”

In the joint letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), the civil right leaders called on Congress to “enact clear, enforceable guardrails that protect constitutional rights, ensure transparency, and curb the abuse of power we see daily across the country.”

As the Trump administration approaches one year in office, the coalition emphasized that Congress has the authority and responsibility to reject unchecked funding for immigration enforcement, warning that last summer’s legislation provided the administration with unprecedented resources, including $170 billion and 10,000 additional ICE agents. This has fueled abuses of power and the weaponization of a broken immigration system, outcomes that could be repeated without meaningful guardrails and oversight.

Leaders also warned that the expansion of detention, surveillance and unaccountable enforcement, paired with inadequate training and oversight, has predictably resulted in fear, racial profiling, due process violations, wrongful detention of U.S. citizens, unsafe detention conditions and expanded surveillance practices that endanger civil liberties.

National civil rights organizations called on Congress to exercise its constitutional oversight authority and include enforceable guardrails in legislation and in FY 2026 appropriations to rein in abuses of power and protect communities:

Congress Should Respond to Unlawful Use of the Military: Prohibit the domestic deployment of military personnel or resources for immigration enforcement or policing, reaffirming long-standing limits on military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

Protect Communities from Misuse of Power: Ban masked federal agents and require clear identification and body cameras; codify sensitive-location protections for schools, hospitals, courts and places of worship; suspend 287(g) agreements until independent oversight is in place; and ensure arrests and detentions are properly documented and legally authorized.

Restore Due Process: Require judicial warrants for all arrests and detentions, transparent reporting and independent investigations into deaths or wrongful detentions, access to legal counsel and family for detained individuals, and prohibitions on mass detention, dragnet surveillance, and the use of non-immigration data for enforcement purposes.

The organizations stressed that these reforms should apply nationwide and are intended to protect the constitutional rights and safety of all communities while reinforcing Congress’s role in providing oversight of federal immigration enforcement.

The Republican counteroffer? What if we added money for body cameras?

The wide gulf between the two parties presents a major test for Democratic negotiators, who have struggled to determine where to draw the line on ICE funding. Progressives have demanded changes at the agency, after an agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minnesota, seeking measures to bar agents from wearing masks and to require warrants for arrests.

But Democrats are also eager to enact a full-fledged appropriations bill ahead of a Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Doing so would help them place financial restraints on President Donald Trump’s administration — while failing to pass a funding bill would give Trump and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought greater latitude to make spending decisions.

In short, Democrats are in a bind: Support money for ICE and own the tortured politics of funding that organization, or oppose ICE funding and give the administration the power to make all sorts of spending decisions.

Democrats — or, at least, some of them — would support ICE funding if that legislation came with significant restrictions. But instead of actually negotiating on those principles, Republicans are hoping the body cams could be a workaround, as both parties try to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the month.

According to Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev. — chair of the Appropriations subcommittee that controls Homeland Security funding — Republicans want to send Democrats a new offer soon on Homeland Security funding. He told MS NOW that the offer would include more money for body cameras for ICE agents.

Amodei conceded that Democrats have “legitimate concerns” about accountability at ICE, but he said major policy changes are “not under serious consideration.”

Meanwhile, Amodei seemed to think a funding boost for body cameras could give Democrats a chance to claim a small victory. “You can walk away and say, ‘Hey, we moved the needle on the dial,’” Amodei said.

Democrats, however, have been quick to reject the idea.

“ICE has enough money. We’re not giving them any more,” the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., told MS NOW.

Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., agreed.

“I’m not a cheap date, so no,” McGovern told MS NOW. “Not for me. That doesn’t satisfy me.”

Amodei’s pitch falls far short of a demand by members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who took a formal position against any Homeland Security appropriations bill that doesn’t include “meaningful and significant reforms to immigration enforcement practices,” the group said in a statement.

That could include stopping agents from wearing masks, requiring warrants for arrests, an end to the use of private detention facilities and requiring federal officials to share information with state law enforcement, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told reporters.

But Republicans aren’t interested in those proposals.

Hard-line conservatives in the House could support more money for body cameras, but there’s no appetite for restrictions on agents wearing masks, Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told MS NOW.

“As soon as they stop doxing our ICE agents, I’d be willing to discuss that,” Harris said.

Other Democrats have shifted their focus from policy changes to stricter limits on the Trump administration’s ability to move money around unilaterally.

Recommended

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the top Senate Democrat on the subcommittee that funds the Department of Homeland Security, said he’s seeking stricter constraints on the Trump administration’s ability to shift money from one program to another. He cited the involvement of Homeland Security Investigations in ICE raids and the diversion of funds to pay for the South Florida immigration detention center nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz.”

Murphy separately outlined policy changes he’s seeking at ICE, including a requirement for warrants, a ban on masks during enforcement operations and a requirement for Border Patrol officials to stay at the border. When it comes to appropriations talks, though, Murphy said he’s trying to stay realistic.

“I understand I’m not going to get all my complaints solved in the DHS appropriations bill,” Murphy told reporters. “So I’m not trying to write a perfect bill. I’m simply trying to make it as hard as possible for the money to be used for the purposes, for other purposes other than what Congress intends.”

Other negotiators aim to attach policy changes to the funding measure.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top House Democratic appropriator, told MS NOW that Democrats are “exploring policy riders, looking at the best way to proceed” in the funding negotiations.

DeLauro said the stance held by the Progressive Caucus isn’t a fringe demand. Democrats are united in pushing for changes at ICE as part of funding talks, she said.

“It’s not a wing of the party — this is a uniformity,” DeLauro told MS NOW. “Everyone is so upset about the terrors in their communities. This is widespread. So it’s not a particular caucus.”

Republicans view the whip count differently.

According to Amodei, Republicans were never counting on progressive Democrats to vote for a measure to fund the DHS. And the idea that progressives would support a DHS funding bill only got more farfetched after the shooting of Renee Good in Minnesota.

The Republican offer is meant to be an olive branch to Democrats who are less concerned about major policy changes and more focused on avoiding a full-year continuing resolution, which gives the Trump administration more flexibility to spend money as they wish.

“It sure as hell didn’t help put the bill to bed,” Amodei said of the ICE shooting’s effect on funding negotiations. “But we also realize there are some folks on the D side who were never going to vote for a DHS bill. And it’s like, OK, tell me how you win with a full-year CR.”

“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

His warning came just hours after a federal officer shot a man in the leg after an attempted traffic stop in Minneapolis on Wednesday night. Protests against federal immigration operations exploded after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross earlier this month.

Trump floated using the Insurrection Act several times last year, including in October, citing the need for “safe cities” across the country.

Deploying the military for domestic law enforcement purposes usually requires congressional authorization, but invoking the 19th-century law would permit Trump to do so unilaterally. It also allows for the federalization of National Guard troops under certain circumstances. The law is rarely used. President George H.W. Bush was the last to invoke it, during the Los Angeles riots in 1992.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

A spokesperson for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday, “Minnesota needs ICE to leave, not an escalation that brings additional federal troops beyond the 3,000 already here. The mayor’s priority is keeping local law enforcement focused on public safety, not diverted by federal overreach.”

On Wednesday evening, Walz, a Democrat, said that the presence of ICE officers was no longer “a matter of immigration enforcement.”

“Instead, it’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government,” he said. “Let me say once again to Donald Trump and Kristi Noem — end this occupation. You’ve done enough.”

The Trump administration escalated immigration enforcement in Minneapolis last month after conservative influencers brought new attention to allegations of day care fraud involving Somali immigrants in the region. However, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families said investigators determined that child care facilities involved in the recent fraud allegations were operating normally.

Trump and his allies have seized on the allegations, publicly attacking both Minnesota Democrats and Somali immigrants. Last month, he accused Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., the first Somali American to serve in Congress, of being “one of the many scammers.” Omar has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it’s ending temporary protected status for Somalis, saying that those with TPS must leave the U.S. by March 17.

The president has also repeatedly lashed out at Walz, who was the 2024 Democratic nominee for vice president.

“Moronic Tim Walz has allowed Minnesota to become overrun by Somali fraudsters who steal from American Taxpayers, and take advantage of our generosity,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday. “Tim is completely incompetent, which is why he lost big time last year, and bowing out of Re-Election is the only good decision he has ever made.”

Walz announced earlier this month that he was ending his re-election bid for a third term, citing the focus on the fraud allegations, in order to fully focus on the work of being governor.

“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260114-trump-rs-e97865.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 11:58:26.496913

The 2-1 ruling by a panel of the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opened the door to Khalil being re-arrested after it ordered, opens new tab the dismissal of a lawsuit he filed challenging his initial detention.

That holding came from U.S. Circuit Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas, both of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, who said that under the Immigration and Nationality Act, his claims needed to be instead heard through an appeal of a final order of removal from an immigration judge.

""The scheme Congress enacted governing immigration proceedings provides Khalil a meaningful forum in which to raise his claims later on—in a petition for review of a final order of removal,"" they wrote in an unsigned opinion.

Khalil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza, was arrested on March 8 by immigration agents in the lobby of his university residence in Manhattan.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, had called the protests antisemitic and vowed to deport foreign students who took part. Khalil became the first target of this policy.

Though Khalil was initially detained in New York, by the time his lawyer sued over his detention there, immigration officials had moved him to New Jersey, leading his case to be transferred to a judge there.

He walked out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center in June, after U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz of Newark, New Jersey, ordered the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to release him from custody.

In June, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that justification would likely be declared unconstitutional and ordered Khalil released.

The panel ruled the federal district court in New Jersey did not have jurisdiction over the matter because immigration challenges are handled differently under the law.

In a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled that federal immigration laws require deportation challenges to be made by filing a petition for review of a final order of removal with a federal appeals court — not a lower-level district court.

“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple—not zero or two,” the panel wrote. “But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct.”

The law bars Khalil “from attacking his detention and removal in a habeas petition,” the panel added.

“We are disappointed by and strongly disagree with the majority’s opinion, but take heart in the powerful dissenting opinion and will continue to fight against his unlawful persecution and detention through all available legal avenues,” said Khalil’s attorney, Baher Azmy, in a statement to CNN.

The decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel.

An outspoken leader of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia University, Khalil was arrested at his apartment on March 8, 2025. He then spent three months detained in a Louisiana immigration jail, missing the birth of his firstborn son.

Federal officials have accused Khalil of leading activities “aligned to Hamas,” though they have not presented evidence to back up the claim and have not accused him of criminal conduct.

The government has justified the arrest under a seldom-used statute that allows for the expulsion of noncitizens whose beliefs are deemed to pose a threat to US foreign policy interests.

In June, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that justification would likely be declared unconstitutional and ordered Khalil released.

President Donald Trump’s administration then appealed that ruling, arguing the deportation decision should ultimately fall to an immigration judge, rather than a federal court. They have also accused Khalil of failing to disclose information on his green card application.

Khalil has dismissed those allegations as “baseless and ridiculous,” framing his arrest and detention as a “direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza.”

The appeals court decision comes as an appeals board in the immigration court system is weighing a previous order from an immigration judge that found Khalil could be deported. His attorneys have argued that the federal order should take precedence.

That judge has suggested that Khalil could be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

His attorneys have said he would face mortal danger if he were forced to return to either country.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap26015521561946.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-15 11:59:01.277115

According to the West Virginia State Police, troopers and ICE agents conducted a traffic stop just before 12:30 p.m. Friday, Jan. 9, on a pickup truck for equipment violations near the intersection of Sleepy Hollow Drive and Oakmont Drive in Putnam County.

Troopers say the driver was identified as Miguel Angel Alvarado Molina, a native of Honduras. According to WVSP, Molina is accused of being in the country illegally. They also say he had a “final order of removal” as a fugitive.

After further investigation, troopers and ICE officers went to a work site at a home in Hurricane. They say the homeowner allowed them onto the property to speak with seven individuals who were working on the roof.

Troopers say an ICE officer climbed the ladder to speak with the individuals.

Authorities requested additional units, and the individuals then came down from the roof without incident, according to WVSP.

The WVSP says all of the individuals were taken into ICE custody for allegedly being “unlawfully present in the United States.”

To date this legislative session, 15 states have proposed bills to prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing masks to protect themselves and their families by shielding their identities. While most of the bills have been introduced in Democrat states (Alaska, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington) Republican-controlled states of Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee also have proposed legislation.

Legislators are not the only ones to jump into the fray to oppose ICE agents in their states. Twenty-one democrat state attorney generals (AGs) sent a letter to Members of Congress urging them to pass legislation to prohibit immigration agents from wearing masks to conceal their identity. In their letter they claimed that ICE agents wearing masks “have the effect of terrorizing communities rather than protecting them.” These AGs further contend that “the commonplace use of masks and the failure of ICE to identify themselves as law enforcement makes everyone less safe and weakens the integrity of our justice systems.”

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) justifiably says that these legislative bans “stoke dangerous rhetoric against ICE agents.” In a January 8 statement released by DHS, the agency pointed out that ICE officers now face “a more than 1,300% increase in assaults, a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks against them, and an 8,000% increase in death threats.”

California was the first, and so far, the only state to pass legislation prohibiting masking. The legislature passed the No Secret Police Act, Senate Bill (SB) 627 which Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law on September 20.

On November 17, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit to block the implementation of California’s law which was set to go into effect on January 1, 2026, but was paused to allow the court to hear arguments in the case on January 14. In its complaint, DOJ asserted that the law violates the Supremacy clause by attempting to regulate federal agencies and forcing them to adopt certain policies. The complaint also stated that the federal government will not comply with this unconstitutional law that “recklessly disregards officers’ safety and federal operational needs.”",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/ICE-agents-wearing-masks-in-camo-ICE-flickr.jpg.webp?itok=eLQy3LWD,N,,2026-01-15 11:00:11.664183

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

The three articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly. Nearly 70 Democrats have co-signed, but as the minority party in both chambers, any support or movement for the articles will likely only occur if Democrats win the midterm elections and flip the House.

“She needs to be held accountable for her actions,” Kelly said. “Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok.”

On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. Federal immigration officers have intensified immigration enforcement, leading to massive pushback from the community there and protests across the country.

The articles from Kelly accuse Noem of obstructing Congress after lawmakers were denied oversight visits at DHS facilities that hold immigrants; violating public trust through due process violations of U.S. citizens’ and immigrants’ rights and aggressive warrantless arrests in immigration enforcement; and misusing $200 million in taxpayer funds by awarding a contract to a company run by the husband of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, according to ProPublica.

A dozen members of Congress have sued Noem over those denied visits at ICE facilities to conduct oversight and were granted a stay to that policy by a federal judge. But Noem issued a new policy and last weekend several Minnesota lawmakers were blocked from visits to ICE facilities.

A federal judge is currently probing to see if the new policy from Noem violates her court order from December.

Kelly was joined by several Democrats, including Minnesota’s Angie Craig, who represents a swing district.

“We are being terrorized by Homeland Security and ICE,” Craig said. “This has crossed a line. This rogue agency is violating the rights of American citizens in our communities, and last Wednesday … the escalation by ICE in our communities got Renee Good killed.”

Noem would not be the only Homeland Secretary to be impeached, should the House take that action.

In 2024, Republicans impeached the Biden administration’s DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, on the grounds that he lied to Congress that the southern border was secure and that he violated his duty when he rolled back several Trump-era immigration policies.

The Senate, then controlled by Democrats, dismissed the articles of impeachment.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/14/11142026Noem/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:58:50.169116

Now, we're telling the story of the first year of our fight against the Trump administration’s second term, our lessons learned, and our path forward.

We were prepared for this fight from day one.

Before President Trump was elected, we examined his campaign promises — including those outlined in Project 2025 — and outlined a plan for how we would fight to protect the rights and liberties of all people. We spent months plotting out our litigation and advocacy strategy across the country, building a plan to ensure that cities and states would be a Firewall for Freedom — a shield defending against a federal government attacking civil rights and civil liberties.

Within hours of President Trump's inauguration, it was clear that he and his administration would, once again, test the Constitution and the willingness of our nation’s institutions and people to defend it. But we were ready. The ACLU mobilized our lawyers, advocates, organizers, storytellers, and supporters to delay unconstitutional policies before they took effect, dilute their reach when full blockage wasn’t immediately possible, and defeat them through courts, public pressure, and sustained organizing. In 2025, we took over 230 legal actions against the Trump administration, with remarkable success: 64% of our lawsuits have delayed, diluted, or defeated the Trump administration’s agenda.

But despite everything we’ve accomplished so far, we cannot underestimate the continued speed and ferocity of this assault on civil rights and civil liberties or the impact it will continue to have on us all. And as we enter 2026, the stakes feel as high as ever.

Many work at the community level, alongside neighbors and friends, with human rights defenders networks around the world, from the Mozambique Human Rights Defenders Network to Somos Defensores in Colombia.","The year 2025 was difficult for human rights and human rights defenders.

Unceasing attacks came from governments, including the most powerful, as well as from the private sector and non-state groups, pushing agendas in opposition to human rights. Many of these assaults are amped up by technology, with the methods and means becoming ever cheaper and ever more accessible to the masses.

An annual analysis from the Dublin-based international rights group Frontline Defenders paints a devastating picture of killings, arbitrary detention, surveillance, and harassment. CIVICUS, an organization that measures civic space (defined as “the respect in policy, law and practice for freedoms of association, expression and peaceful assembly and the extent to which states protect these fundamental rights”), documented declines in 15 countries and improvements in only three. The location and nature of the drops were diverse, taking place from mature democracies such as the United States, Germany, France, and Switzerland, to authoritarian regimes such as Burundi and Oman, and including countries in crisis and conflict such as Sudan and Israel. Some types of human rights were uniquely politicized and singled out in 2025, including women’s rights and environmental rights. Freedom House recorded the 19th straight year of declines in global freedom.

All this is compounded by an unprecedented slash-and-burn to international aid budgets for organizations and individuals working on human rights worldwide. The Human Rights Funders Network of almost 450 institutions across 70 countries estimates that by 2026, human rights funding globally will experience a $1.9 billion reduction compared to levels in 2023.

Taken together, this makes the world more dangerous than ever for human rights defenders and they have fewer resources at their disposal to combat the threats.

In 2026 and moving forward, two crucial questions arise for the defense of human rights globally. First, who will do the work of fighting to protect and advance human rights in the year ahead, and second, how can those in the international community still fiercely committed to human rights support them? These questions will be shadowed by another trend: impunity. Yet, at the same time, lessons and a few positive developments from 2025 can guide human rights defenders on how to seize opportunities in the coming year, beginning even this month at the United Nations.

The Earthquakes of 2025

Eviscerating Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance Assistance

In the United States, 2025 began with the newly inaugurated Trump administration dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and canceling approximately 85 percent of its programming (from a budget of more than $35 billion in the fiscal year ending in September 2024). The gutting eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars of support for those working to protect human rights and expand freedom and democracy around the world. The State Department’s grantmaking efforts were similarly cut, with more than half of its awards canceled, including programs directly supporting human rights defenders such as one initiative providing emergency financial assistance to civil society organizations and a fund to promote human rights and democracy and respond to related crises.

Most other major donor countries followed suit, though not with the same sweep or to nearly the same degree. Canada said it would reduce foreign aid by $2.7 billion over the next four years, the Dutch announced structural spending cuts of € 2.4 billion on development aid starting in 2027, and the European Union announced a €2 billion reduction in its main mechanism for development aid for 2025-2027. Multilateral funders were not immune to the trend: the United Nations, for one, will see major budget and staffing cuts for human rights in 2026.

The U.S. retreat from foreign assistance rapidly impacted all development sectors, from health, to education, to humanitarian assistance, but no sector was targeted with such enmity as that of democracy, human rights, and governance. Advocates and implementers saw not only the dire resource clawbacks discussed above, but also found themselves tarred by a steady diet of derisive commentary from the very policymakers doing the cutting.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who, once championed human rights and democracy “activists” as a U.S. Senator, even serving on the board of the democracy-promoting International Republican Institute before the administration eliminated the congressional funding that supported it. He once told a crowd at the Brookings Institution “[f]oreign aid is a very cost-effective way, not only to export our values and our example, but to advance our security and our economic interests.”

But as secretary of state, he abruptly reversed course, writing last April that the State Department unit overseeing civilian security, human rights, and democracy had “a bloated budget and unclear mandate,” and that its “Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor had become a platform for left-wing activists to wage vendettas against `anti-woke’ leaders in nations such as Poland, Hungary.” Other members of the administration were similarly sharp-tongued about the sector, with now-former USAID Administrator Pete Marocco conflating the promotion of “civic society” with “regime change” in official court documents and President Donald Trump himself referring to USAID’s leadership as “radical lunatics.”

The rhetoric mirrors similar language used by authoritarians across the globe who have long been opposed to foreign assistance for democracy, human rights, and governance work, and it has real-world consequences for those advocating for human rights and freedom. Leaders of multiple countries have seized on the words of the Trump administration to launch spurious investigations of human rights defenders and other civil society activists who had received U.S. funding.

Closing Civic Space and New Technology

Closing civic space is not a new threat to human rights defenders, but it is one that has reached a fevered pitch in the last few years. This has included both an increase in traditional attacks and a greater reliance on new tactics for suppression, especially in the digital sphere.

Nearly 45 percent of all civic space violations CIVICUS recorded for its annual analysis were related to the freedom of expression. The organization documented more than 900 violations of the right to peaceful assembly and more than 800 violations of freedom of association. The most frequent examples were detentions of protesters and journalists, followed by the detention of human rights defenders outside the context of a protest or journalism, merely for doing their work.

Authoritarian regimes also have become ever more adept at utilizing the digital space for repression. Tactics such as doxing, censorship, smearing, and online harassment are important tools in an authoritarian approach. They have been supplemented in recent years by less evident tactics such as shadow-banning, which the CIVICUS analysis defined as when “a platform restricts content visibility without notifying the user,” allowing the platform to maintain an appearance that it is neutral.

Women rights defenders face additional risks online, including technology-facilitated gender-based violence: In a global survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 38 percent of women reported personal experience with violence online, from hacking and stalking to image-based sexual abuse.

Attacks in the digital space often are also connected with or fuel physical attacks, “including killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and harassment,” as Frontline Defenders reported in its analysis. Tunisia is paradigmatic. Amnesty International reported that, beginning in 2024, a “wave of arrests followed a large-scale online campaign…which saw homophobic and transphobic hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against LGBTI activists and organizations spreading across hundreds of social media pages, including those espousing support for the Tunisian President Kais Said. Traditional media outlets also broadcast inflammatory messages by popular TV and radio hosts attacking LGBTI organizations, calling for their dissolution and for the arrests of LGBTI activists.”

What to Expect for Human Rights in 2026

The absence of meaningful and unified international pushback to human rights abuses by some of the world’s most powerful nations means the rights-based international system will continue to face unprecedented attacks, and the challenges that rights defenders face in the year ahead are likely to increase in number and intensity. Authoritarians worldwide have monitored the assault against human rights in the past year — from genocide in Gaza to the crackdowns on protesters in Tanzania to restrictions on freedom of association and expression in El Salvador and so many more instances — and they have learned that they are unlikely to be held accountable internationally in the near term.

Yet despite these challenges, a few developments in 2025 offer some reasons for optimism in the year ahead. Several large-scale, youth-led movements in 2025 held their governments accountable for rights violations, from the July Revolution in Bangladesh that ousted an abusive prime minister to the Gen Z protests in Kenya over economic conditions and government corruption, a protest moniker that spread to other countries as well.

Some governments passed rights-protecting laws, from Thailand’s legalization of same-sex marriage to Colombia’s laws preventing child marriage. Courts stood up for human rights and held perpetrators to account, from the International Criminal Court’s conviction of Sudan’s Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman for war crimes and crimes against humanity to the U.S. conviction of The Gambia’s Michael Saang Correa for torture, to the symbolic judgment of the People’s Tribunal for Women of Afghanistan. These trends are likely to continue in 2026, despite the challenges, because courageous human rights defenders are using every avenue to fight for rights.

This year will also bring targeted opportunities to continue the fight for human rights. A preparatory committee for a proposed international crimes against humanity treaty begins work this month at the United Nations. Also at the U.N., this year’s Universal Periodic Reviews, a regular peer review of countries’ human rights records, will focus on some of the world’s worst rights offenders — including Sudan, Eswatini, and Rwanda — as well as countries with highly mixed records. These reviews provide an opportunity for the world to examine, publicly and critically, the rights records of all 193 countries and for victims and activists to share their stories and insights. While the United States has not submitted its self-evaluation due late last year, the process continued with the usual submissions from the U.N. and others.

Creative activists also are likely to use prominent events, such as the 2026 Olympic Games, to push for the expansion and recognition of human rights. They can take the opportunity of the United States’ 250th anniversary celebrations to highlight and internationalize the country’s founding principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as well as the requirement that all governments “[derive] their just powers from the consent of the governed.”

Who Will Lead the Fight for Human Rights in 2026?

As many governments pull back and even attack human rights, the work of human rights defenders and organizations will become more critical than ever. Some of them have been leading the fight for decades, including leading international NGOs, national organizations, networks, and prominent individual leaders. Others have done critical human rights work but haven’t labeled themselves as rights defenders, such as organizations providing access to clean water, supporting girls’ education, or working to prevent violent conflict.

Many work at the community level, alongside neighbors and friends, with human rights defenders networks around the world, from the Mozambique Human Rights Defenders Network to Somos Defensores in Colombia. Some are in exile, fighting for rights in their home countries and for refugee and diaspora communities, like the brave Afghan women who organized a landmark People’s Tribunal in 2025 to expose rights violations against women. Others are professionals whose skills directly relate to human rights — lawyers, judges, journalists, and more. They include people like the brave journalists who continue to report on the context in Gaza, despite the incredible risks, and the Burmese lawyers who continue to document rights violations. Some are individual activists, using their platforms and skills to protect rights and call attention to attacks against them, like Iranian Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi who was recently detained alongside other rights defenders while attending a memorial service for a human rights lawyer. Some are informal coalitions, student and youth groups, or protest participants — social movements have been and will be an essential component of the fight for human rights. All of these actors play a critical role in the human rights ecosystem. All of them are human rights defenders.

Aid funding cuts have devastated civil society organizations and will continue to impact human rights advocates. A survey by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems and International IDEA of 125 civil society organizations based in 42 countries found that 84 percent of respondents had lost funding due to U.S. and other countries’ aid cuts, with the same number expecting further cuts in 2026. UN Women reported that more than one in three women’s rights and civil society organizations have suspended or shut down programs to end violence against women and girls and more than 40 percent have scaled back or closed life-saving services. The philanthropic organization Humanity United found that 44 percent of peacebuilding organizations that it surveyed would run out of funds by the end of 2025.

These cuts will only be amplified as time goes on, as fewer young people can become human rights professionals while managing to put food on the table, as legal cases that take years to process aren’t filed for lack of funding, as human rights abuses aren’t documented, as the attacks from authoritarian regimes go unchecked. Shrinking development budgets will no longer provide similar levels of support to courts and anti-corruption bodies that human rights defenders have traditionally approached to pursue justice or for support hotlines where ordinary people can call in anonymously to report abuses at the hands of security forces. Such foreign assistance enabled vital avenues of accountability, but also signified solidarity, that at least some political decisionmakers both at home and abroad believed in human rights and supported those working to deepen and protect them.

But despite the myriad challenges, there will be human rights defenders who continue to fight the fight. For many, changes in funding or the withdrawal of political top-cover won’t stop them from finding avenues. One need only look at Iran’s protests today, where thousands of people are exercising and demanding their human rights amidst a brutal crackdown, internet blackout, and without international funding. Rights defenders have been doing a lot with a little for many years. Some — especially women, youth, Indigenous people, and disabled defenders — have often been excluded from human rights funding and support in the past. A new generation has seen the horrors of Gaza, El-Fasher, eastern Ukraine, or even around the corner from their home, in the news and online, and they have committed themselves to social justice and the prevention of atrocities.

Human rights has always been a universal endeavor which has required diverse supporters, advocates, and allies – this is true now more than ever.

How Can the International Community Support?

Even those governments and institutions that continue to lead in supporting human rights internationally will need to do more with less, as the above-outlined cuts exemplify, to support those on the front lines. This is the chance to shift “localization” – the practice of funding local civil society organizations directly and based on their priorities, rather than via large overhead-requiring NGOs funded by donor countries — from an ideal to a necessary strategy. A grant of $20,000 may not keep a major international organization online, but it can fund a community-based service provider. Donors can integrate a rights-based approach across portfolios instead of siloing the issue, integrating human rights goals and strategies into other foreign policy initiatives. For example, companies can integrate human rights efforts and measurements into their supply chains for products from batteries to chocolate, producing products they would already produce but in a way that advances human rights as well. Military operations can add human rights and gender considerations with little cost but potentially huge impact. This requires training, tools, and high-level political will to succeed. And they can continue to advocate for rights and use diplomatic pressure and support as key tools.

The elephant in the room is the United States. The Trump administration not only is backtracking on the traditional U.S. commitment and values of democracy and human rights internally and internationally but also has sought to hamper others in funding such initiatives. But there are still important steps that can be taken to protect human rights. Congress must do its job and provide oversight, holding the administration accountable to the laws that protect this important work. Members should speak out against injustices and rights violations, at home and abroad. Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), for example, has played a key role in the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, calling out rights abuses in places like Turkey, and Rep. Tim Kennedy (D-NY) led a congressional letter to the Department of Homeland Security urging the Trump administration to overturn its decision to terminate Temporary Protective Status for Burmese people. State governments have always played a key role in advancing rights, and this will become more critical than ever.

Foreign governments that have engaged on human rights issues but haven’t been the largest international donors or advocates will be particularly important. Some of them are stepping up already. Examples include Japan playing a leading role in advancing women’s issues, South Africa and Gambia taking cases to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel and Myanmar, respectively, of violating the Genocide Convention, and Ireland continuing its steadfast allyship with human rights defenders.

Now is the time for committed countries around the world to continue to demonstrate the global nature of this agenda, set out more than 75 years ago in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reinvigorated by 18 international human rights treaties.

Philanthropy and the international private sector will be more essential than ever in 2026. Foundations cannot offset the huge funding gaps left by governments and multilateral donors — total U.S. philanthropic giving is about $6 billion per year, whereas U.S. overseas development assistance alone in 2023 accounted for $223 billion — but they can provide strategic investments that help protect rights and those defending them, amplify their voices, fund innovative new approaches, and help the ecosystem survive. Philanthropies around the world provided nearly $5 billion in human rights support globally in 2020 alone, and their funding is critical for many organizations.

Companies have their own role to play, one that includes but goes well beyond corporate social responsibility, from responsible tech and AI to eliminating forced labor from supply chains to hiring diverse employees. The private sector has a unique opportunity to ensure that human rights remain on the global agenda, because there is a strong business case in favor of human rights protections and alliances with those who truly understand the needs and wants of local populations. A great example is the effort by numerous auto and electronics companies to move away from cobalt batteries, both a recognition of the horrible rights violations facing individuals and communities around cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a recognition that this move is also better for business due to supply chain volatility.

Defending against challenges to human rights, democracy, and good governance in 2026 and beyond will require creativity and broad coalition-building across sectors that too often are siloed, such as health, peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance, and the field of democracy, human rights, and governance. Everyone who does not traditionally think of themselves as a human rights defender, from government officials to the private sector, will need to step up to support those on the frontlines of the fight to defend human rights.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2233982389.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:59:35.435549

Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, citing the secretary’s handling of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
“She needs to be held accountable for her actions.” The first impeachment article alleges Noem denied Kelly and other members of Congress “oversight of ICE detention facilities,” the congresswoman said at her presser.
“Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok,” Kelly said at the press conference Wednesday.
“Families are forever torn apart.” “I want to tell her right now: Secretary Noem, you have violated your oath of office, and there will be consequences.
“We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”","Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, citing the secretary’s handling of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Kelly outlined three impeachment articles against the secretary, accusing Noem of obstruction of Congress, “violation of public trust” and “self-dealing.”

“Secretary Noem has brought her reign of terror to the Chicagoland area, L.A., New Orleans, Charlotte, Durham, and communities north to south to east to west,” Kelly said at the press conference. “She needs to be held accountable for her actions.”

The first impeachment article alleges Noem denied Kelly and other members of Congress “oversight of ICE detention facilities,” the congresswoman said at her presser.

Kelly explained the second article, which accuses Noem of violating public trust, by saying Noem “directed DHS agents to arrest people without warrants, use tear gas against citizens, and ignore due process.”

Kelly said Noem frequently says “she’s taking murderers and rapists off our streets, but none of the 614 people arrested during Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago has been charged or convicted of murder or rape.”

On the third impeachment article, which accuses the secretary of self-dealing, Kelly said Noem “abused her power for personal benefit,” and “steered a federal contract to a new firm run by a friend.”

Kelly, who is running for the Senate in Illinois, announced her intention to file the impeachment articles last week, after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis.

“Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok,” Kelly said at the press conference Wednesday. “Families are forever torn apart.”

“I want to tell her right now: Secretary Noem, you have violated your oath of office, and there will be consequences. I am watching you, members of Congress are watching you, the American people most importantly are watching you. And most of all, we are not liking what we’re seeing,” Kelly said.

While the effort is unlikely to go anywhere in the GOP-controled House, the congresswoman said that as of Wednesday morning the measure has the support of almost 70 members of Congress, and she expects more to sign on.

“We’re trying to build more sponsors of the legislation,” she said, when asked at the press conference if she expects to get a majority of House Democrats on board. “I mean, people joined on quickly when I put it out there, people contacted me almost immediately, and it’s been growing and growing as people find out about it.”

She said she has spoken to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) about the effort but would not say directly whether he supports it.

“You’ll have to answer to Jeffries, but I would not be standing here if I was told not to,” she said.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last year became the first Cabinet official in recent history to be impeached by the House when Republicans secured a narrow 214-213 vote.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) brushed off the impeachment effort as “silly.”

“How silly during a serious time. As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, Rep. Kelly is more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually cleaning up her crime-ridden Chicago district,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement to The Hill.

“We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/kellyrobin_011426gn04_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-15 10:59:17.825063

Janet Mills and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), released statements Wednesday warning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents could move into the communities soon.

Neither cities nor Mills have confirmed where they are hearing about the possible ICE activity.

Mills addressed the possibility of federal law enforcement operations in Maine in a video statement Wednesday evening.

She said her administration has tried unsuccessfully to confirm whether any operations are planned, but is coordinating with municipalities, including Portland and Lewiston, along with law enforcement, to prepare.

""I have directed the Maine State Police to work closely with local law enforcement, as necessary, to provide whatever support is needed in advance of and during any potential federal operations,” Mills said. “If they come here, I want any federal agents – and the President of the United States – to know what this state stands for. We stand for the rule of law. We oppose violence. We stand for peaceful protest. We stand for compassion, for integrity and justice.""

Mills urged anyone considering protesting to do so peacefully.

""For those of you who may consider protesting, I fully support your right to do so, and I urge you to do so peacefully – to meet any hostility with reserve and resolve,"" Mills said. ""Know this: Maine will not be intimidated, and we will not betray the values that make us who we are.""

""For reasons of operational security and officer safety, ICE does not comment on any ongoing, upcoming or potential operations,"" an ICE spokesperson told NEWS CENTER Maine.

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline, Portland Mayor Mark Dion, and King also released statements Wednesday about the possibility of ICE agents coming to Maine.

From Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline:

It’s my understanding that there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon. I urge residents and businesses to know their rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops them in the street, visits their home, or visits their business. As a reminder, Lewiston Police do not enforce federal law.

I understand that this is an unsettling time for many of our residents. Lewiston is a strong city and we care about our community and each other. Please check on your neighbors and stay safe.

From Portland Mayor Mark Dion:

Our community is anxious and fearful regarding the understanding that ICE is planning to send agents to Portland and Lewiston next week. We are a welcoming city. There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents. In that view, Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods. While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. The consequence of law enforcement should not be chaos and violence, which only results in making Portland less safe.

The City Council and I stand, not apart, but with our lawfully admitted immigrant and refugee communities. I urge our residents to look out for one another. Know your rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops you on the street, visits your home, or arrives at your business or place of employment. As a reminder, Portland Police does not cooperate with ICE and they do not participate in enforcing federal immigration law. If you decide to protest or demonstrate, keep your efforts peaceful and consistent with the expectations for lawful behavior that we all share.

NEWS CENTER Maine is still working to independently confirm the mayors’ and the governor’s statements regarding potential federal operations in Maine.

From Sen. Angus King:

Like many in Maine, I have begun to hear rumors of imminent federal law enforcement activities coming to our state. Given the videos and headlines we have seen from operations conducted in other states – many of them reckless, heartless, and irreversibly destructive – I share the same worries many of you have.

Maine believes in law and order. We enjoy that order because our state and local law enforcement authorities place a priority on lawful and timely responses to clear criminal threats.

Abraham Lincoln once reminded Americans in the face of conflict to have faith that ‘right makes might, and in that faith let us do our duty as we understand that.’ In the days ahead, I want to encourage everyone to look out a little closer for one another and be mindful of the rights that our Constitution gives to every man, woman, and child in this nation. If you witness any lawlessness done cloaked in the cause of federal law enforcement, please alert your local leaders, state officials, and federal delegation.

Much of the country was not paying attention to Minnesota before Renee Good was killed by an ICE agent last week.
But with this big surge in ICE agents arriving, they’ve kind of changed tactics.","When Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer last week in Minnesota, it brought attention to the robust effort to combat US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Twin Cities. Residents of Minneapolis and the surrounding areas are joining decentralized networks of activists who are committed to alerting their neighbors to ICE presence on their blocks.

Madison McVan, a reporter for the Minnesota Reformer, rode along with some of those activists to observe their tactics. The activists patrol their neighborhoods looking for ICE officers. When they find them, they alert their networks and tail the officers so their neighbors know where ICE is in the city. These patrols have led to tense standoffs with ICE officers and have drawn accusations of “domestic terrorism” from the Trump administration.

McVan spoke with Today, Explained co-host Noel King about what she experienced while riding along with activists and how these networks sprang up in the first place. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

There’s much more in the full podcast. So listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You’ve been riding along with Minneapolis residents who are tailing ICE as a form of resistance. What’s that been like?

It’s been intense. The idea is that if residents follow ICE and record them, that they can possibly prevent arrest from taking place at all.

Key takeaways

Minnesotans are following ICE vehicles in the Twin Cities and alerting their neighbors that officers may be in the area.

Since Renee Good’s killing, the activists have shown more resolve and their numbers have increased.

ICE has responded by trying to intimidate the activists, driving to their homes and telling them they could be arrested for obstructing their operations.

And is it working?

The people I rode along with think it is working. They basically say if we follow ICE and we record them, they’re a lot less likely to get out of their cars and start asking people for their citizenship documentation and that kind of thing.

Tell me what you’ve experienced when you’ve been in the car with these people.

There’s usually one person driving and then a second person manning the phones. And so the passenger is following along with a group chat. They’re on a group call with other people in the neighborhood who are doing the same thing, so they can correspond about where they’re seeing ICE and notify each other when someone finds ICE and starts following the vehicle.

This kind of plays out [in] a pattern that I’ve seen over and over now, which is that the observers start following an ICE vehicle. The ICE vehicle identifies themselves as federal officers by checking to see if they’re being followed. They turn into a side street or they do an aggressive maneuver, or they start weaving through parking lots — seeming to make sure they’re being followed. And then at some point they stop the vehicle, the observers stop behind them, the ICE agents get out of the car, surround the vehicle, and tell the observers to stop following them — that they’re obstructing ICE operations and that they may be arrested if they continue following.

When I was riding along with a pair of observers, they were following an ICE vehicle, and that exact thing happened. ICE officers got out of their vehicles, they surrounded the car, and one officer told the driver, stop following us or we’ll arrest you. The observers decided to continue following the car, and the ICE vehicle drove straight to the address of one of the observers that was in the car. So it seemed like they were doing some kind of, looking up of the identity of the person who owned the vehicle and then driving to their home address.

The ICE vehicles stopped at the observer’s home and then kept going, and so the observers decided to continue following the vehicles. Two of the vehicles in the convoys split up and the observers decided to follow the third ICE car. As they were following that third ICE car, agents circled back to the observer’s house that they had just stopped in front of and went and banged on the door. The observer’s wife was home. She was terrified and she pretended she wasn’t home, and neighbors started coming out of their houses. Once they realized ICE was next door, [they started] blowing whistles, some people stopped and honked horns, and eventually the agents left.

Much of the country was not paying attention to Minnesota before Renee Good was killed by an ICE agent last week. Was this going on before that?

There was an immigration enforcement surge starting in December, so that was when patrols really started ramping up. But even before that, people were organized in rapid response networks and starting when Trump took over for his second term.

The idea behind the rapid response networks was that if we see an ICE action taking place, we can notify a bunch of people in the neighborhood, and the neighbors can respond to film ICE to inform people of their rights and to protest. But with this big surge in ICE agents arriving, they’ve kind of changed tactics. It seems like now the ICE agents are traveling in smaller groups; they’re conducting arrests quickly. They’re really trying to get in and out before people have time to respond en masse and start protesting. That’s why the rapid response networks have shifted more towards a proactive approach, following ICE agents in hopes of preventing raids or arrests before they even happen.

The Trump administration has suggested that the people doing this are organized activists who have, I don’t know, possibly mendacious goals. Tell me about them, though. Who are these people? How did they get organized?

Well, I think this is where it’s relevant to mention that Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd less than a mile from where an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good. So this neighborhood has been organized before. They’ve mobilized en masse against police brutality before. So I think that there’s already a culture — particularly in the south side of Minneapolis — of organization and protest.

“I think the killing of Renee Good has really only strengthened the resolve of a lot of the people who are already involved in this, and it’s driven more people to try to join the movement.”

The people who are doing this come from all walks of life. We’re seeing churches get involved in this. We’re seeing parents organize with people whose children go to the same schools, so that they can be standing outside during dismissal or so that they can escort immigrant parents when they’re dropping off their children at school. It’s people who have a lot of time and identify as activists, and it’s also people who are commuting to work in the suburbs saying, “Let me take a different route today to see if I spot ICE, and I’ll let you know if I see anything.”

Do you know if Renee Good was one of these people?

We don’t know the details of her involvement in any of these networks. The people I talked to who lived in her neighborhood, who were involved in some of these rapid response groups, said they did not know her. But it’s important to note that it’s possible she could have been in the group and they wouldn’t have known, because everyone uses anonymous nicknames. It’s possible she was there using an anonymous nickname, but I haven’t seen any evidence of that yet.

After Renee Good was killed by the ICE agent, it has seemed like things in Minneapolis have become pretty chaotic. How have these people changed their tactics since she was killed? Are they doing anything differently?

I think the killing of Renee Good has really only strengthened the resolve of a lot of the people who are already involved in this, and it’s driven more people to try to join the movement. I think a lot of people who are protesting ICE or who are going out on patrols are asking themselves what they’re willing to risk for this movement, knowing that someone was shot while protesting ICE.

You’re a journalist, so of course you’re sort of looking at all sides of this debate in Minneapolis. What do you make of the argument from ICE agents that this is threatening — that people following them in cars feels like a threat and that it shouldn’t be happening?

Well, I think that’s part of the point. I think the people on the ground here, many of them feel that this is an occupied city, and they want to show that they’re unhappy with that. They want to try to disrupt ICE operations within the bounds of the law to protect their immigrant neighbors. That’s how they see it. So I’m not surprised that ICE agents feel threatened by this. I think that’s part of the goal.

That’s very interesting, because as you know, the Trump administration has tried to paint Renee Good and others like her as a danger to the city itself. Kristi Noem called Renee Good a “domestic terrorist”. Vice President JD Vance has called this “classic terrorism.”

How do you make sense of statements like that based on what you’re seeing and the activists who are doing this kind of work?

I think it’s important to remember that at least the activists I’ve been with are committed to doing this within the bounds of the law. So it’s really this gray area between what’s considered obstruction in a legal sense and what is practically obstruction of ICE’s work. Honking horns and following them is not physically blocking them from making an arrest, but it certainly discourages them from doing so. That’s kind of where a lot of the action is happening.

And when it comes to Renee Good, it’s unclear what exactly her involvement may have been in any kind of organized movement to protest. But I think what her actions show is that the people of Minneapolis collectively — at least most of them, it feels like — have decided that when they see ICE, they’re taking action in whatever form feels right for them.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2254723729.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C11.748390650472%2C100%2C76.503218699056&w=1200,N,,2026-01-15 10:01:12.076282

The majority of the new applicants were flagged as law enforcement officers, the officials said, but many had no experience in any local police or federal law enforcement force.
“They now have to bring them back to FLETC,” said one of the officials, referring to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.
ICE has also placed some new recruits into a training program before they completed the agency’s vetting process, NBC News has reported.
In Minneapolis alone, more than 2,000 ICE officers have been sent to the area to boost arrests, and they have apprehended over 2,400 people since Nov. 29, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.","As Immigration and Customs Enforcement was racing to add 10,000 new officers to its force, an artificial intelligence error in how their applications were processed sent many new recruits into field offices without proper training, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the error.

The AI tool used by ICE was tasked with looking for potential applicants with law enforcement experience to be placed into the agency’s “LEO program” — short for law enforcement officer — for new recruits who are already law enforcement officers. It requires four weeks of online training.

Applicants without law enforcement backgrounds are required to take an eight-week in-person course at ICE’s academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia, which includes courses in immigration law and handling a gun, as well as physical fitness tests.

“They were using AI to scan résumés and found out a bunch of the people who were LEOs weren’t LEOs,” one of the officials said.

The officials said the AI tool sent people with the word “officer” on their résumés to the shorter four-week online training — for example, a “compliance officer” or people who said they aspired to be ICE officers.

The majority of the new applicants were flagged as law enforcement officers, the officials said, but many had no experience in any local police or federal law enforcement force.

Both law enforcement officials noted that ICE’s field offices provide more training beyond what is provided at the academy or in the online course before officers are sent out onto the street and that the officers singled out by the AI tool most likely received that training. The officials weren’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity.

The Department of Homeland Security didn’t respond to a request for comment. The AI mistake was identified in mid-fall — over a month into the recruitment surge — and ICE immediately began taking steps to remedy the situation, including manual reviews of résumés of new hires, the officials said.

“They now have to bring them back to FLETC,” said one of the officials, referring to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.

The AI tool was initially the mechanism used to categorize résumés, the officials said. The officials weren’t sure how many officers were improperly trained. It’s also not clear how many may have been sent out to begin immigration arrests.

As the immigration agency surges agents into American cities, their enforcement tactics are increasingly questioned by local law enforcement, community groups and lawmakers following the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis by ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

Ross had more than 10 years of experience with ICE and wouldn’t have been subject to the AI screening for new recruits.

The error highlights the challenge of training such a large number of new recruits as ICE continues to ramp up operations to boost deportation numbers amid pressure from the White House. ICE has also placed some new recruits into a training program before they completed the agency’s vetting process, NBC News has reported.

In Minneapolis alone, more than 2,000 ICE officers have been sent to the area to boost arrests, and they have apprehended over 2,400 people since Nov. 29, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. Minnesota has sued to try to remove DHS.

ICE had a mandate to hire 10,000 new officers by the end of 2025 and offered new recruits $50,000 signing bonuses using the money Congress allocated under the One Big Beautiful Bill. One of the officials said that although ICE met the goal on paper, bringing back people who were misidentified for more training means it didn’t successfully add 10,000 ICE officers on the street in 2025.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260114-ice-officer-badge-vl-146p-97e565.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 12:59:39.809048

The first point to make here is that plans to scrap the existing asylum appeal system were trailed in the summer then formally announced on 17 November 2025 with no prior consultation.
Since then, we have heard nothing about details, timescales, transitional arrangements or whether the new system will apply to immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals.
The letter confirms that immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals will be heard by this new body.
All of this could potentially be accomplished within the existing system.","The Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has disclosed some further details on the new immigration and asylum appeal body. The plans are contained in a letter to the chair of the Justice Committee. Some further hints at the process behind the scenes separately emerged in live questions to Sarah Sackman, Minister of State for Courts and Legal Services.

The first point to make here is that plans to scrap the existing asylum appeal system were trailed in the summer then formally announced on 17 November 2025 with no prior consultation. The judiciary were only informed 24 hours beforehand. Since then, we have heard nothing about details, timescales, transitional arrangements or whether the new system will apply to immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals. Even now, the “details” that are emerging are very much outline principles.

The second point to make is that not only is the policy process is being led by the Home Office but the Ministry of Justice seems to have very little to do with these plans at all. Have a watch of Sarah Sackman’s brief evidence on this:

Sackman does not appear to be substantively engaged with the project. She speaks of her department “supporting” the Home Office with the project and the MOJ’s role being limited to “managing the transition”. It does not sound as if the new body would even sit within the Ministry of Justice. Will we be returning to the days prior to 1987 when the Home Office appointed adjudicators? How is that “independent” from the Home Office?

Mahmood’s letter suggests that the main purpose of the change is to widen the recruitment pool for appeal decision-makers. She implies there are too few people who meet current minimum recruitment standards who are willing to do the existing job of immigration judge. Essentially any barrister or solicitor with five years of experience is potentially eligible. That’s well over 200,000 people. And a person with equivalent experience in law is also eligible. Rather than seeking to improve pay, conditions or make more use of the ‘equivalent experience’ criterion, the government has decided to reduce the minimum qualifications required. We still do not know what the new minimum will be.

There will still be a right of appeal from the new body to the Upper Tribunal on an error of law, apparently. Some had wondered whether this would be so. Given the minimum qualifications for adjudicators will be widened from actual practicing lawyers to, by definition, non legally qualified individuals, it seems likely there will be more appeals to the Upper Tribunal than at present. That’s not a great way of speeding things up.

The letter confirms that immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals will be heard by this new body. Given that the appeals legislation will need changing, this perhaps (I’m looking for silver linings here) raises the possibility of restoring the “not in accordance with the law, including immigration rules” ground of appeal in place of the “human rights only” grounds introduced in 2014. But I’m not holding my breath.

There is reference in the letter to legal advice being facilitated before a claim is heard by the new body. There’s no equivalent reference to legal representation being funded for appeals at the new body. That’s concerning.

There is some language around making appeals one stop shops, albeit without using those exact words (™Jack Straw 1998). Over the last 30 years we have repeatedly heard politicians claiming to want one appeal to rule them all. Their civil servants have then repeatedly introduced systems that require separate claims to be brought consecutively. Adding issues to an existing appeal is considered by the Home Office to be an ambush, basically.

What would all help with getting all relevant issues decided at a single appeal is making the process fair and quick. Around three months for an initial decision, say, and then three to six months for an appeal. Instead, we’re going to have a load of ill-considered institutional upheaval taking years.

There will be a fast track for claims from safe countries. This is not referred to as a detained fast track, but one imagines it might involve detention. Some other cases will be prioritised by the new “independent” body on public interest grounds. These grounds will presumably be decided by one of the parties to the appeal (the Home Office) but not the other. Late claims made prior to removal would appear to be one such category, according to Mahmood.

The letter does say that the system will preserve “safeguarding for vulnerable individuals, ensuring complex protection claims receive the time and scrutiny required”.

My main thought is that this seems like a colossal waste of time and energy. All of this could potentially be accomplished within the existing system. Improvements to initial decision-making and early access to legal advice would reduce the pressure on the tribunal system. Instead, the government is looking at very complex, costly and protracted procedural changes which may well end up having no impact on the existing tribunal backlog, because existing appeals continue in the existing system. It’s a classic Home Office response to a genuine problem. Instead of doing the admittedly hard work needed to resolve genuine problems, tear it all up to create more work — which is an opportunity cost for doing other more purposeful and impactful work — and still having to solve the same difficult problems anyway.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shabana_Mahmood_Official_Cabinet_Portrait_July_2024_cropped_2-450x600.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:59:39.356248

The state asked for an immediate ruling on the temporary restraining order requested by Attorney General Keith Ellison to put an end to the Trump administration's ""Operation Metro Surge.""

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez called the case a ""frontier"" in constitutional law and said the court needs more time to gather information, while promising to keep the case “on the front burner.”

“It is simply recognition that these are grave and important matters,” the judge said of the timetable, noting there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

The judge acknowledged the parallels between the current case and Tincher v. Noem, which was filed in December. While the Tincher lawsuit brought forth by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) claimed six community members had their rights violated by ICE and other federal agents, the judge said the latest case differs because it's broader in scope.

An ICE agent shot an alleged illegal immigrant in the leg on Wednesday during an arrest attempt. The Department of Homeland Security claims the agent fired at the suspect because he was ""fearing for his life and safety"" after the individual resisted arrest and ""violently assaulted the officer.""

The suspect was reported to be stable and is now in custody, while the ICE agent is allegedly in the hospital.

This comes after an incident last week in Minneapolis, where Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen, was fatally shot by an ICE agent, who fired into the driver's windshield and open window from the side of the vehicle and subsequently exclaimed ""f---ing b----"" as the car crashed into another parked vehicle.

MINNESOTA SUES TRUMP ADMIN OVER SWEEPING IMMIGRATION RAIDS IN TWIN CITIES

Democrats and local residents have condemned the shooting as a murder and called for the agent's prosecution, while the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have defended the incident by arguing that it was a justified shooting.

Protests continued on Wednesday after the latest shooting, with demonstrators using horns and whistles and officers deploying tear gas and pepper balls.

There were at least a hundred people at the scene, where officers were dispersing pepper spray, throwing pepper balls and using flash bangs as rioters tossed items at the agents. Demonstrators were also calling on ICE to leave the city and holding signs with phrases such as ""f--- ICE.""

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a crowd was committing ""unlawful acts,"" including throwing fireworks at officers, and urged people to ""leave immediately.""

""This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further,"" he said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged peaceful demonstrations in response to the shooting.

""I know you’re angry. I’m angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets. But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace. Don’t give him what he wants,"" Walz wrote on X.

Walz also made an address to Minnesotans where he again called on ICE to leave the state.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has repeatedly demanded that ICE leave, said the agency's presence is not establishing safety for community members.

""This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in,"" he said at a news conference, adding that the deployment of roughly 3,000 ICE agents in Minneapolis and statewide was ""creating chaos.""

""It's certainly not creating safety when a huge percentage of the shootings that have taken place so far this year in Minneapolis have been by ICE,"" he said. ""So let's be very clear. I've seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable.""

The mayor also praised people protesting peacefully but warned that others were ""taking the bait.""

""We cannot counter Donald Trump's chaos with our own brand of chaos,"" he said.

""American citizens are getting picked up off the street by people in masks,"" the mayor added. ""That's not the way things should be conducted in any city in America.

Civil rights groups reported at least 20 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations from East Los Angeles to downtown, including one in Montebello captured on surveillance video.

Footage from Montebello shows an unmarked truck pulling up before ICE agents jump out and surround a home. Within seconds, one of them climbs a ladder onto the roof. Construction workers on the roof run and jump from one roof to another as they try to get away. No one was detained.

""They were just scared actually - just in fear for their lives. They didn't know what was happening,"" said Manny, the contractor who hired the workers.

Manny said he rushed to the job site when he heard what happened and found his crew nervous and scared.

""We just gathered and I prayed for all of them, and I prayed for their protection and that God would give us peace during this troubled time,"" he said.

Manny said this doesn't just affect the people ICE targets - it affects everyone trying to work and survive.

""Some people are scared to come back to work,"" he said. ""They're just a little (shaken up) and they just don't want to experience that again.""

Civil rights groups said Wednesday's operation in Montebello was one of many taking place throughout the region.

Videos from Little Tokyo in downtown L.A., Commerce and Pico Rivera showed agents confronting and detaining people in public areas.

""They're using brutal violence against an unarmed, civilian population to impose their political will,"" said Ron Gochez of Union del Barrio. ""Things are escalating and so for us, we know we have to continue our work, we have to continue organizing, we have to continue defending our community.""

Gochez pointed to a new California law requiring ICE agents not to wear face coverings, but he said it's not being enforced.

""They don't have to abide by state law or local ordinance, and so to pass these meaningless bills into law here in California when these are federal agents who don't have to listen to them, it's really a waste of our time,"" he said.

Meanwhile, in cities like Montebello, neighbors said they're thinking twice before leaving their homes.
