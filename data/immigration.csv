ECHR: an instrument of peace causing discord All EU nations as well as non-EU member United Kingdom are signatories to the ECHR, which is not directly related to the European Union.","Several EU members in recent months have repeatedly voiced a desire to change — or at the very least — reinterpret certain guidelines pertaining to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) so they can adapt their own national laws in ways that would allow them to further restrict asylum and implement related immigration controls.

Earlier this year, nine EU member states came together to issue a call to the bloc to change its interpretation of the ECHR, which governs many fundamentals relating to asylum law for those countries signatories to the convention — especially in all matters relating to the human rights of migrants and refugees.

Italy, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland joined forces and demanded that the EU streamlines its laws to expel foreign criminals — even if this means that guidelines issued under the ECHR have to be reexamined and adapted accordingly. Great Britain is also beginning to think along those lines, although it is no longer and EU member state.

The nine nations in particular want the European Court of Human Rights, which is the final instance for ruling on ECHR-related matters, to revise and relax its guidelines on the deportation of such criminals to countries, which are not deemed safe.

In their view, an asylum seeker forfeits their right to protection if they significantly break the law of the country which hosts and protects them.

Examples of clashes between EU and ECHR

Some EU nations, such as France, have faced frustrations when trying to further tighten their asylum laws, as constitutional and legal experts rejected tabled bills, which were incompatible with the ECHR.

Other members of the bloc, like Greece, have faced criticism for using emergency measures to stop the processing of asylum applications earlier this year in Crete amid a sudden rise in arrival numbers, with the European Court of Human Rights reminding the Mediterranean nation that it can only suspend such asylum procedures for a limited window of time.

Italy, meanwhile, has repeatedly run into legal trouble at multiple levels — mainly national — with its plan to proactively intercept some migrants in international waters in the Mediterranean and then take them to two purpose-built facilities in Albania for remote processing; those deemed ineligible for asylum could then be returned directly from non-EU member Albania with far less red tape than is involved in Italy.

Many of the legal hold-ups relating to the Albania process ultimately have to do with what the ECHR does and does not allow — or rather, the interpretation of various Italian judges thereof.

UK: push for even greater ECHR changes

Separate to this development, Britain has also repeatedly voiced staunch demands to change certain ECHR fundamentals or be allowed to change its interpretation of the laws — with some politicians even threatening to exit the treaty altogether.

This week, the UK's government once again announced it hoped to introduce sweeping changes to its asylum law, some of which may at the current time not entirely be in line with some legal ECHR basics.

Among several new restrictions tabled to be introduced, the UK hopes to introduce a system whereby asylum seekers pegged to be deported can always be sent back to their country of origin; if the country of origin refuses to accept their own people back, the British government might go as far as banning anyone from that country from being issued with visas, as part of a proposed tit-for-tat policy, according to UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.

This blanket refusal, among other proposed changes, might however be in breach of ECHR guidelines, at least at the present moment.

Among EU nations, Denmark has recently expressed the view that it would be happy to join forces with Britain to push for a re-examination of how the ECHR is applied.

ECHR Article 3: What qualifies as 'torture'?

Details on concrete proposed changes to the ECHR are currently only known from UK lawmakers and not from European ones, although it is likely that they will overlap.

British authorities want in particular to see changes, amendments or legally binding reinterpretations to Article 3 of the treaty, which deals with the prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, and Article 8, which governs the right to family life.

Multiple deportations of criminal asylum seekers have been blocked due to an interpretation of Article 3, whereby sending someone back to a country from which they have escaped would constitute a form of torture; Britain argues that it is in its own public's best interest to allow such deportations to prevent future crimes and to serve as a deterrent to other foreigners who might consider engaging in criminal activities.

ECHR Article 8: A family affair

Article 8 of the ECHR meanwhile has been used to justify family reunifications, which Britain and other countries currently critical of the ECHR do not want to ban altogether but to make considerably more difficult, for example by introducing certain income thresholds to qualify applicants to send for immediate family members.

In the past, some attempts at limiting family reunification rights have been halted by citing Article 8; the same law has also been cited in the past — in connection with other laws — to prevent the deportation of entire families to safe countries or countries which have been deemed safe once again.

The Home Office says, for example, that currently in Britain, ""there are around 700 Albanian families whose asylum claims have been rejected, yet their removal is not currently being enforced by the Home Office, despite Albania having a gold-standard of cooperation with the UK on returns and being a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).""

""Article 8 rights are currently leading to high numbers of arrivals from those who would not otherwise have the right to live in the UK,"" a press release by the Home Office earlier this week further highlights.

The definition of a 'safe country'

The definition of safe countries in general is also a thorn in the side of many European nations that are hoping to tighten their asylum laws, as squaring that with their membership of the ECHR has repeatedly proven problematic.

Many individual governments across Europe, as well as the EU itself, have designated lists of countries they consider 'safe' and are therefore destinations for possible deportations of nationals from that country, who have been refused protection by the host country.

In April 2025, the European Commission proposed to formalize this, including Bangladesh, Kosovo, Egypt, Morocco, Colombia, India and Tunisia on the list of safe countries.

This broadening of safe nations has been justified in legal documents from the European Commission by stressing that it would not interfere with individual assessments of asylum, as a country might not be safe for all inhabitants of a certain country, depending on their individual circumstances and experiences, which may have led them to claim protection elsewhere.

However, the EU also tried to argue as an extension to those changes that any country could be considered 'safe' if 20 percent or fewer applicants from that country generally were granted protection in the EU, which the human rights organization Amnesty criticized as a loophole of the proposed regulation.

A statement from Amnesty in July 2025 underlined: ""The fact that up to 20 percent of those applying for international protection from these countries are recognized as refugees indicates that these places are in fact not safe for all.""

CJEU ruling and Italy's Albania plans

Another example for the ongoing debate on safe countries of origin is a judgment from August this year by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding Italy's attempts to designate certain countries 'safe' — such as Bangladesh and Egypt.

The judgement underlined that migrants should always have the right to challenge such designations in court, and that countries must make accessible the information they used to reach the designation of 'safe' for each individual case, according to a statement from the International Bar Association (IBA), which is the global voice of the legal profession.

The new EU Pact on Asylum and Migration, which is due to come into effect next year, sets out to strengthen the right of designation of 'safe' countries, but the CJEU judgement, according to some legal experts quoted by the IBA, might still strengthen challenges to the pact in the future.

""The buried treasure in the [CJEU judgment] is the effectiveness of a challenge, and access to documents,"" says Steve Peers, a professor of EU and human rights law at Royal Holloway, University of London, who commented in the IBA article on the issue.

""With the new EU Pact, it might be easier to say a country is safe but it will [also] be easier to challenge this in individual cases.""

Changes to ECHR possible — but at what cost?

The Council of Europe (CoE), which oversees the application and implementation of the ECHR, has responded to these recent developments by declaring that it is ""absolutely ready"" to consider discussing changes to the treaty.

Its secretary general, Alain Berset, said that it might be time for the organization ""to change and adapt,"" while firmly stressing, however, that this could also weaken the international organization, which was formed in the wake of World War II to stop future conflict.

""These are complex challenges, and democracies must always remain open to reflection through the appropriate institutional avenues,"" Berset said earlier in the year.

Council of Europe defends human rights court amid tensions over migrant returns

The ECHR can be — and has in the past been — amended by adding new so-called protocols.

With different member states having varying migrant population and native population rates, there is also a risk that a ""one size fits all"" approach to these challenges would not leave all signatory states equally satisfied.

ECHR: an instrument of peace causing discord

All EU nations as well as non-EU member United Kingdom are signatories to the ECHR, which is not directly related to the European Union.

The ECHR is a treaty dating back to the early 1950s, which provides a loose but binding framework to protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of people, whose governments are part of the Council of Europe (CoE), which is headquartered in Strasbourg, France.

The Council of Europe has 46 member states, and its main body, the European Court of Human Rights, which is also based in Strasbourg, is in charge of making sure that all its signatory states comply with the legal framework set by the ECHR.

All 27 EU nations have to be signatories to the Council of Europe; however beyond the UK, non-EU members include such nations as Turkey, Armenia and Montenegro.

Until its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia was also a member; it has been suspended since.

But when Mr. Chalco Chango’s son showed up, the agents arrested him, too.
Mr. Chalco Chango crossed the southern border into the United States with his son in 2023.
In his declaration to the court, Mr. Chalco Chango described, in vivid detail, feeling helpless while in isolation in the jail.","For at least five days, a blind Ecuadorean man who was arrested this month in New York City by U.S. immigration authorities was held in isolation at a county jail, locked in his cell for 24 hours a day and deprived of his cane.

“I feel so terrible I cannot see and that I cannot walk, read or do things on my own,” Carlos Anibal Chalco Chango, 40, said last week in a declaration prepared by his lawyers based on their conversations with him.

On Monday night, after days of pressure from the lawyers, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency relented: Mr. Chalco Chango was released from the Orange County jail in upstate New York. It was a surprising move by an agency that rarely releases detainees under President Trump.

The two-week effort by his lawyers to free him came amid pitched legal battles playing out across the United States, as lawyers file emergency motions to have ICE release migrants who are being subjected to mandatory detention.

Unlike Mr. Chalco Chango, many of the more than 60,000 immigrants in detention don’t have lawyers. Most are forced to fight deportation alone, leaving many to consider the Trump administration’s offers to leave the country voluntarily to avoid months in jail.

What distinguished the Ecuadorean man’s case was his disability.

ICE agents arrested Mr. Chalco Chango on Nov. 4 as he was leaving his home in Corona, Queens, an immigrant-rich neighborhood where advocates and local officials have documented an increase in arrests of mostly Hispanic men this month.

The federal immigration agents were seeking to arrest Mr. Chalco Chango’s 20-year-old son, and they approached the older man to show him a picture of their “intended target” on a cellphone, according to government filings.

Mr. Chalco Chango told them that he was blind and could not see the image, according to his lawyers, who said the agents pushed him against a wall, handcuffed him and put him inside a car. An agent told him in Spanish to call his son and tell him to turn himself in, his lawyers said. Then, the agent said, Mr. Chalco Chango would be free to go.

But when Mr. Chalco Chango’s son showed up, the agents arrested him, too. Both men were whisked away to 26 Federal Plaza, the ICE offices in Lower Manhattan, setting off the legal saga to release him.

The federal government said in filings that the agents had “engaged in a consensual conversation” with Mr. Chalco Chango, who they said “freely admitted to the officers” that he had no legal status.

Mr. Chalco Chango crossed the southern border into the United States with his son in 2023. Border Patrol agents who encountered them released them to seek asylum, according to filings.

After his Nov. 4 arrest, Mr. Chalco Chango was placed in a holding cell at 26 Federal Plaza, where he was barred from having his cane or using a text-to-audio phone app that could help him read legal documents.

After a judge, Andrew L. Carter Jr. of Manhattan federal court, ruled that Mr. Chalco Chango could not be removed from the country, ICE moved him on Nov. 8 to the Orange County jail.

There, officials said they had “serious concerns” about safely accommodating him in the jail’s general population because of his blindness, according to a court filing by the office of Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

In a letter on Monday informing Judge Carter of Mr. Chalco Chango’s release, the government said it considered the case moot, a suggestion that no further proceedings over his detention were necessary. The judge directed the parties to send him a joint letter by Thursday addressing whether they agreed that the case was moot, though Mr. Chalco Chango’s separate immigration case still appears unresolved.

Paige Austin and Harold A. Solis, lawyers at Make the Road New York, an advocacy group representing Mr. Chalco Chango, said in an interview on Tuesday that they wanted assurances from ICE that their client would not be detained in the future.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In his declaration to the court, Mr. Chalco Chango described, in vivid detail, feeling helpless while in isolation in the jail.

He thought his cell might have a clock, he said, but he could not see it. He could, however, detect when people were outside the cell by the shadows they cast.

So when he saw shadows, he added, “I try to ask through the door — what time is it?”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/18/multimedia/18met-immigrant-blind-pzqf/18met-immigrant-blind-pzqf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 18:58:06.598598

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.

Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.

""Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,"" the proposal states.

Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.

""This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,"" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. ""By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.""

Politics of social safety net programs

The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.

People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.

Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.

U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.

Executive order targeted benefits

In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""

Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.

Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.

Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a ""public charge"" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.

In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision. It meant that using benefits such as the SNAP, housing aid or transportation vouchers would not count against green card applicants.

Topline:

The man accused of igniting a fire that led to the deadly and destructive Palisades Fire in January will remain in custody without bond, U.S. Judge Rozella Oliver decided Tuesday in Los Angeles. Jonathan Rinderknecht has been in custody since his arrest in Florida on Oct. 7.

Where things stand: Rinderknecht was indicted by a federal grand jury in October and is charged with one count of arson, one count of timber set afire and one count of destruction of property by means of fire. Rinderknecht pleaded not guilty in mid-October and faces anywhere from five to 45 years in federal prison if convicted. His trial is set to begin April 21, 2026. His lawyers recently asked the court to allow him out of custody as he awaits trial.

Argument against release: In a filing on Monday, prosecutors said Rinderknecht is a flight risk because of his familial ties to France, as well as a danger to the community. The filing states that Rinderknecht threatened to burn down his sister’s home and that he purchased a gun and threatened to kill his brother-in-law. Prosecutors also raised the fact that a judge determined in October that the suspect’s mental health had declined.

The allegations: Authorities allege Rinderknecht set fire to brush near the Skull Rock Trailhead in the Santa Monica Mountains at around midnight Jan. 1, starting the Lachman Fire. Though the fire was held to just 8 acres and was believed to have been extinguished, authorities say it flared up once again amid strong, dry winds a week later. That fire grew into the Palisades Fire, which killed 12 people and destroyed more than 6,800 structures.

Go deeper: How could the Palisades Fire have reignited after a week? Experts explain

California law requires banks to let homeowners delay their mortgage payments for up to one year as they recover from the January fires. But that period rapidly is coming to a close, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass says the timeline should be much longer.

On Tuesday, Bass asked mortgage companies to voluntarily extend relief for another three years, which would bring the total forbearance period to four years after the Palisades and Eaton fires destroyed thousands of homes.

“Many impacted residents remain in temporary housing and face mounting financial strain,” Bass said in a news release. “They're piecing life together while having to negotiate with contractors and wait for insurance claims to come through.

""Asking them to shoulder mortgage payments on top of all that would force them into an impossible — and unacceptable — choice.”

How mortgage relief currently works

Under Assembly Bill 238, signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September, homeowners affected by the Palisades or Eaton fires can request mortgage forbearance for up to 12 months. The law extended a previous 90-day forbearance period that banks agreed to honor after the fires.

Bass’ office said she wants the banks to agree to let homeowners take another three years of deferred payments and put them on the back end of their mortgage.

The mayor also is requesting that banks refrain from charging fees or penalties and leave mortgage holders’ credit scores unaffected by the extended relief period.

‘This is not like a free lunch’

Richard Green, director of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, said he’s not sure Bass will convince banks to agree to these terms. And he said homeowners would need to closely scrutinize any relief plan.

Depending on the details around interest payments, he said, some homeowners could exit the forbearance period owing more on their mortgage than their property is worth.

“Consumers would have to understand that this is not like a free lunch,” Green said.

He compared Bass’ proposal to President Donald Trump’s recent suggestion about creating a 50-year mortgage to address nationwide housing affordability concerns. Both plans adjust financing terms without tackling the fundamental reason housing costs so much, he said.

“It's not a great deal,” Green said. “We need to be able to build more housing faster, whether it's in the aftermath of a disaster or not.”

Temporary relocation money is running out

Last month, a nonprofit group called Department of Angels released a survey of thousands of fire survivors that found about 80% of residents displaced by the Eaton Fire and about 90% of those displaced by the Palisades Fire still have not returned to their previous homes.

Many now are paying rent for temporary housing in addition to their regular mortgage payment. The survey found that within the next year, 23% of Altadena residents and 29% of Pacific Palisades residents will run out of insurance payments that cover the cost of that new rent.

The Trump administration unveiled a sweeping plan Tuesday to sidestep Congress and outsource large pieces of the U.S. Department of Education, telling lawmakers and staff that it would shift work dedicated to, among other things, elementary and secondary education, postsecondary education and Indian education to other federal agencies.

All three of those offices were originally placed at the department by Congress when it created the agency in 1979, and these moves are being made without Congress' consent.

According to two people who were briefed on the plan by the Trump administration, and who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, the administration has forged six new agreements between the Education Department and other agencies, offloading day-to-day operations of congressionally-required programs while retaining a small contingent of staff at the department.

For example, under these new agreements, much of the work of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, which includes managing Title I, a key federal funding stream that helps schools support low-income students, would shift to the U.S. Department of Labor, as would much of the work of the Office of Postsecondary Education.

The U.S. Department of the Interior would take on much of the work of the department's Office of Indian Education.

The U.S. Department of State would take on international education and foreign language studies programming.

Responsibility for the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) program, which offers childcare on college campuses to low-income student-parents, would move to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

In a USA Today op-ed published Sunday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon wrote of this kind of agreement: ""We'll peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage programs and empowering states and local leaders to oversee the rest. These partnerships are commonplace across the federal government to improve service delivery and increase efficiency.""

In July, the Education Department announced one such agreement with the Labor Department, in which Labor took on responsibility for adult education and family literacy programs previously administered by the Education Department, though an Education Department release insisted, ""The programs will be managed alongside [Education Department] staff, with continued leadership and oversight by [the Education Department].""

Tuesday's agreements do not include a handful of the department's signature responsibilities, including special education, student civil rights enforcement and student loans.

Opponents of the administration's move say, given that Congress created these offices and explicitly located them inside the Education Department, the White House cannot legally move their work without Congress' approval.

U.S. Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a senior member of the Senate education committee, said in a statement, ""This is an outright illegal effort to continue dismantling the Department of Education, and it is students and families who will suffer the consequences as key programs that help students learn to read or that strengthen ties between schools and families are spun off to agencies with little to no relevant expertise and are gravely weakened—or even completely broken—in the process.""

In briefing lawmakers and staff, the department insisted that these programs' statutory responsibilities would remain at the department, even if the work would be done elsewhere.

It's unclear if retaining a modicum of department staff, in partnership with other agencies, will be enough to convince the courts the administration is following federal law.

According to NPR's two sources, the briefing was led by Lindsey Burke, now deputy chief of staff for policy and programs at the department, who also co-authored the education section of the conservative government blueprint, Project 2025, outlining how to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.

""The federal Department of Education should be eliminated. When power is exercised, it should empower students and families, not government,"" Burke wrote.

There will likely be legal challenges opposing Tuesday's moves.

We know that putting troops in our communities for political purposes breaks public trust and is disrespectful to their service.

Guided By Service

This mobilization on Capitol Hill is a seminal moment for those pushing back on the Trump administration’s abuses of power -- and it’s one I relate to. My family has served this country for multiple generations. I’m a veteran myself, a former U.S. Army captain, and someone who feels strongly that we need to go to congresspeople, not wait for them to come to us.

When I was commissioned in 2000, it was uncommon for women to be assigned to combat arms branches, and I was one of only a handful of women assigned to the Field Artillery, a combat arms branch. Although other women officers were sent to work in training units, I fought for and won an assignment with a forces command (FORSCOM) unit, joined my unit shortly before September 11, 2001 and subsequently deployed in 2003. While most soldiers carried religious items on them, as a young Army officer deployed overseas, I had a pocket U.S. Constitution in the lining of my helmet because I believed so deeply in the values I swore an oath to defend.

""I had a pocket U.S. Constitution in the lining of my helmet because I believed so deeply in the values I swore an oath to defend.""

This year marks the 250th birthday of the Army, Marines, and Navy. We can’t let our armed forces, which were created to defend our liberties, devolve into an arm of someone’s political pursuits. But that’s what we have seen take place this year. President Donald Trump and his administration have sent troops into our communities and enacted policies that roll back civil rights progress.

Already we’ve seen President Trump federalize National Guard troops and other service members to cities under the guise of keeping communities safe. Often, this is happening without the consent of state governors and officials. As a veteran, I am working every day to stop this abuse of power.

Military Troops Do Not Belong on Our Streets

I’m joining the dozens of veterans on Capitol Hill for the same reason I first joined the military years ago: to protect and defend the Constitution. The oath didn’t end when I took off my uniform, and as commander in chief, President Trump also took an oath to protect the Constitution.

In the United States, the federal military should not be used for domestic law enforcement. That is a fundamental principle embodied in the Posse Comitatus Act, one that helps separate our democracy from dictatorships abroad. History shows what happens when we cross that line. The tragedy at Ohio’s Kent State University in 1970, when National Guard troops shot at student demonstrators, proves that putting military troops in our communities can result in disastrous consequences. National Guard troops should be reserved for genuine emergencies, not deployed to our cities to serve the president’s political whims. Kent State continues to serve as a reminder of what happens when we comingle military troops and policing of civilians.

President Trump’s ongoing use of militarized force is not about safety; it’s about asserting power. Over the summer, his administration sent troops and armed federal agents into Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. His administration continues to threaten to send them to Chicago, and Portland despite objections from city and state leaders.

Military troops -- and armed federal agents in masks who appropriate military uniforms -- do not make our communities safer or safeguard our rights. These deployments erode the public’s trust in a non-partisan military when our neighbors struggle to understand why troops are patrolling their communities, or to distinguish between National Guard and federal agents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents often wear military-style uniforms or gear, creating confusion that further erodes public trust. True safety comes from strong and supported communities, not from local militarization. That’s why so many veterans, active-duty service members, and military families have joined the ACLU and others in condemning these dangerous and escalatory actions.

The Politicization of the Military Must Stop

Time and again, we’ve seen how, when the military crosses the line to civilian law enforcement, the fabric of our democracy decays. The Trump administration’s dangerous misuse of the military does not begin or end with troops deployed to our cities. It extends to the politicization of the military itself.

In September, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth summoned hundreds of senior military leaders to Quantico and delivered remarks attacking the principles of equity and accountability. President Trump followed with a disturbing address urging troops to use U.S. cities as “training grounds” to fight the “enemy within.” These are not the words of leaders strengthening national defense; this is a weaponization of the military that threatens our Constitution.

Secretary Hegseth’s agenda goes further. He has moved to weaken service members’ ability to report assault, harassment, and discrimination. He also called for combat standards to “return to the highest male standard,” even though all combat roles have been gender-neutral since 2016. He spent his first months in office purging the highest levels of the military of women leaders and Black senior officers, as well as axing the Women, Peace, and Security Program that was started in the president’s first term.

As one of the few women who served in a combat arms role before it officially opened up, these attempts to dismantle progress towards the military becoming more welcoming are barbaric. The strength of our military has always come from its professionalism and unity of purpose, not from political loyalty. When leaders use the armed forces to promote a partisan political agenda, they betray the values our service members swear to defend.

When we plague the military with politics, we reduce the effectiveness of a force that is supposed to be ready for real emergencies. Our troops deserve leadership that values service to the Constitution over service to any specific president. It’s what we took an oath to do.

How We Can Act

America must be a place where everyone is safe in their neighborhoods and free to speak their minds. When troops are on our streets, we make one of our founders’ biggest fears – that a leader will send his army to police the people – a dangerous reality. Congress must act now to protect our freedoms by pulling troops out of our cities. It has the power to restrict any future deployments into our cities.

I stand with the veterans on Capitol Hill. We must lawfully protest troops on our streets and end the politicization of the military. I know my fellow veterans are not alone in asking our government to do right by our troops. All Americans must join together, on Capitol Hill and beyond, to urge the Trump administration to withdraw federal troops from our neighborhoods now.

Today, we sent a message to Congress in person doing exactly that. We urged them to co-sponsor the Military in Law Enforcement Accountability Act in the Senate and the National Guard Proper Use Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. These are vital steps to curbing the president’s ability to deploy National Guard troops for improper domestic law enforcement.

I am proud of my service to this country. Most of all, I want to ensure our military remains a respected institution in service to the people, not a single president, for the next 250 years.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/11/veteran-op-ed-social.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 17:56:44.116627

Immigration officials respond to Bro-Tex in St. Paul

What we know:

According to reports from the scene from Pioneer Press reporter Frederick Melo, at least one person was removed from a building by federal agents, and a chemical irritant was deployed as protesters ""swarmed"" authorities outside Bro-Tex Inc. in St. Paul.

Video from the scene shared by 50501 Minnesota and Women's March Minnesota on social media features a lot of screaming and yelling, and as federal officials try to leave, protesters try to stop them. Officials physical interacted with protesters, and at least one protester threw an item at a departing vehicle.

A St. Paul City Council staffer confirmed to FOX 9 that federal agents on scene included the FBI, ICE, DEA and HSI (Homeland Security Investigations). St. Paul and Ramsey County were not there nor involved.

Federal agents had cleared the scene prior to noon on Tuesday. A spokesperson for ICE confirmed their investigation to FOX 9 Tuesday afternoon:

""Today in St. Paul, ICE HSI and law enforcement partners conducted court authorized law enforcement activity and served a search warrant in furtherance of a federal criminal investigation. There is no threat to public safety, and the investigation remains ongoing at this time.""

Bro-Tex has been in business in St. Paul since 1923. It manufactures cloth and microfiber wipe products.

This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

Mayor Carter statement on ICE operations

What they're saying:

Mayor Carter released a statement on Tuesday afternoon calling the federal response ""ICE operations."" The mayor is in ""close communication"" with the city attorney's office and St. Paul Police Department.

""Though we don't have many details right now, I share the concern and fear this raises for our workers, families and entire community,"" Carter said in the statement. ""Remember you have rights.""

At the scene of the ICE operations earlier on Tuesday, Mayor Carter, giving an example of similar raids around the country, said federal agents ""grab a roofing crew"" and are doing so without warrants. It's unclear what happened in Tuesday morning's incident.

The City of St. Paul has immigration resources available on its website.

St. Paul council member demands transparency

What they're saying:

Molly Coleman is on the St. Paul City Council and represents Ward 4, where Tuesday's raid involving federal agents took place. She joined FOX 9's All Day to give her account of the events, and is seeking transparency. She says city officials started to hear about a large federal enforcement mobilization early in the morning. Their initial information suggested it was not an ICE raid, but a lawful, permissible enforcement.

Coleman says the scene escalated due to the size of the law enforcement response and the force they used. The injuries suffered by community members and protesters were largely due to chemical irritants. Some people were shoved to the ground by agents. Coleman says she doesn't know where some community members are, and why others have been detained. She said at least three were placed in a vehicle and detained.

Coleman says they want transparency on what happened, and why.

""As a St. Paul City Council member, if I call the federal government and say tell me where you took our people, they’re not answering, they’re not calling me back. That’s true for elected officials throughout the state at all levels of government,"" Coleman said. ""I think it’s immensely concerning we have a federal government that is so uninterested in telling the truth to the people of St. Paul. It’s a very difficult and troubling situation.""

MN lawmakers react to ICE raid

Local perspective:

The Minnesota House's St. Paul delegation released the following statement following Tuesday's federal response in St. Paul:

""This morning, we have been monitoring incidents with federal agents in our city. We have been in contact with local law enforcement and elected leaders, and we will continue to work with them to protect our community.

""To all our constituents in St. Paul, we want to say: be a good neighbor, take precautions, know your constitutional and civil rights, document any incidents with federal law enforcement, and make sure you protect yourself. If you find yourself in need of assistance, please contact local law enforcement or get in touch with community organizations. Always remember that you have rights.""

Immigration Defense Network to hold vigil on Wednesday

What's next:

In a press release on Tuesday, the Immigration Defense Network said it will hold an ""urgent community vigil"" and press availability at 9 a.m. on Wednesday outside Bro-Tex in response to what happened Tuesday morning.

The Immigrant Defense Network on Tuesday afternoon said federal agents ""stormed"" a workplace, ""detained workers, deployed chemical irritants,"" adding that Tuesday's ""escalation was unacceptable"" because workers were taken from their jobs.

""What happened today is not law enforcement — it is an assault on our community,"" said a representative from the Immigrant Defense Network on Tuesday. ""No one should fear that simply going to work, providing for their family, or standing up for their neighbors will result in federal agents storming a workplace, detaining people en masse, and deploying chemical weapons against Minnesotans.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/11/1280/720/st-paul-protest-ice.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-11-18 16:57:33.396084

Standing outside the Capitol, some of the survivors directed their remarks at Mr. Trump.
In their upside-down telling, Mr. Trump had consistently fought for the release of the Epstein files.
She added, “These are your average Americans.” She said the Epstein files represented the “failures” of the government and Congress to their citizens.
And rightfully so.” Some of Ms. Greene’s colleagues were more interested in simply falling in line, as usual, with Mr. Trump.","Attention now turns to the Senate, which had been keeping the Epstein issue at arm’s length but now plans to take up and pass the bill this week, clearing it for Mr. Trump’s signature. The president, who toiled for months to derail the bill but reversed himself once it was clear it would pass overwhelmingly, has said he would sign it.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said his chamber would move quickly — and probably unanimously — on the bill without considering any changes.

“When a bill passes 427 to 1, and the president says he’ll sign it into law, I’m not sure there’s going to be a need or desire for an amendment process,” he said.

In the House, the sole lawmaker to vote “no” was Representative Clay Higgins, a far-right Republican from Louisiana.

Even as all of them voted to demand the release of the files, Republican leaders dismissed the measure as a “political show vote” driven by Democrats who were only feigning interest in the Epstein saga in the hopes of inflicting political damage on Mr. Trump. And even though the president has said he would sign the bill if it were to reach his desk, its proponents raised questions about whether the Justice Department would ultimately release the files.

“I’ve been opposed to it all along,” Speaker Mike Johnson said at a morning news conference before the vote, standing next to a poster board with five bullet points citing the “dangers” of a measure that he ultimately supported, along with his entire conference.

Acknowledging the reason he had tried for months to keep the bill off the floor, Mr. Johnson said he had no choice but to support a piece of legislation he considered deeply flawed because of the political blowback he would receive for voting no.

“None of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency,” he said.

Representative Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who cosponsored the measure and led the charge to force a vote on it, said the vote was overdue.

“The speaker was dragged to it kicking and screaming, but here we are,” he said. “It’s not necessarily a rebalancing of the branches of government, but a rebalancing of the people against the executive branch.”

The top Senate Democrat said he would push for immediate consideration of the bill Mr. Thune failed to do so in short order.

“The American people have waited long enough,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters, saying the action could come as soon as later on Tuesday. “They want to see what’s in it.”

Proponents of the measure worked to keep pressure on Mr. Trump to follow through and release the files, something that does not require an act of Congress but that he has chosen not to do.

“The real test will be, will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who broke hard with Mr. Trump on the Epstein matter, said at a morning news conference outside the Capitol.

There, she was joined by some of the victims of Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in prison in 2019 while facing sex-trafficking charges. Standing outside the Capitol, some of the survivors directed their remarks at Mr. Trump.

“While I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I’m grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill, I can’t help to be skeptical of what the agenda is,” said Haley Robson, who met Mr. Epstein when she was 16 and has said she recruited friends to his sex-trafficking ring after being abused herself.

The vote capped a monthslong effort by Republicans to make sure that this day never came to pass. Mr. Trump leaned aggressively on three Republicans who signed a petition that made it possible for the proponents to circumvent leadership and force the floor vote to happen.

He called the holdouts personally and had White House officials issue warnings to the rank-and-file that support for the discharge petition would be viewed as a “hostile act” by the administration.

But the pressure campaign backfired. In the case of the three hard-right Republicans — all women — who refused to remove their names, people familiar with their thinking said, it only caused them to dig in more.

In the House, Mr. Johnson vociferously opposed the petition. He claimed that the bill did not do enough to protect victims’ privacy, even though it included language that did so. He said it was unnecessary given that a House committee was investigating the handling of the Epstein case. And for weeks after her special election victory in Arizona, Mr. Johnson refused to seat Representative Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, who had said she would provide the final signature needed to force the vote on the floor as soon as she was sworn in.

Mr. Johnson finally did so last week and Ms. Grijalva signed, putting the petition at the 218-signature threshold to represent a House majority and guarantee a floor vote.

Unwilling to take what was certain to be a humiliating loss on the House floor, Mr. Trump then reversed himself on the matter and called on his party to back the bill.

Many Republicans in Congress followed suit, embracing a bill they claimed to have supported all along.

In their upside-down telling, Mr. Trump had consistently fought for the release of the Epstein files. And so had they.

Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, said the action was “an important vote to continue to show the transparency that we’ve delivered.”

On the House floor on Tuesday before the vote, Democrats noted that Mr. Trump did not need a vote in Congress at all to release the files and accused Republicans of having tried to hide behind procedure to block the vote.

“Donald Trump could release these files on his own,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. He accused Republican leaders of trying to block the vote “for months and months and months.”

Republicans, in turn, highlighted the fact that their own Oversight Committee investigation led to the release of a trove of documents from Mr. Epstein — though they did not mention that it was Democrats who had forced them to begin the inquiry. They claimed that they had opposed the vote because they wanted more justice for Mr. Epstein’s victims.

“We now know that Epstein himself hated President Trump,” said Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, referring to emails Mr. Epstein wrote to his associates regarding the president. “It’s in black and white.”

But the fight has left lasting rifts and grudges within Mr. Trump’s coalition. On Tuesday morning, Ms. Greene defended herself against Mr. Trump’s charge that she was a “traitor” for backing the release of the Epstein files.

“A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves,” she said, standing in front of Mr. Epstein’s victims. “A patriot is an American that serves the United States of America, and Americans like the women standing behind me.”

Later on the House floor, she laid out why the Epstein episode had resonated so strongly with Mr. Trump’s populist base even as the president has sought to change the subject.

“These American women aren’t rich, powerful elites,” Ms. Greene said, speaking from the Democratic side of the chamber. She added, “These are your average Americans.”

She said the Epstein files represented the “failures” of the government and Congress to their citizens. “For far too long, Americans have been put last, and they’re sick and tired of it,” she said. “This is why they don’t trust Congress. This is why they don’t trust the government.”

Ms. Greene noted that she and the three other House Republicans who forced the vote endured attempts at intimidation for months. “This is what the American people are sick of. And rightfully so.”

Some of Ms. Greene’s colleagues were more interested in simply falling in line, as usual, with Mr. Trump. And they were not ashamed to hide it.

Representative Troy Nehls, Republican of Texas, who had staked out a firm “no” position on the release of the files just days ago, dismissing it all as the “Epstein hoax” devised by Democrats to “distract us from the winning of President Trump and his administration,” was unapologetic about his about-face. He conceded that he was merely doing what Mr. Trump had said to.

“It is a hoax by the Democrats against Trump,” Mr. Nehls said on Monday evening, lighting a cigar on the steps of the Capitol.

So then why support it?

“Why not?” he replied. “Trump said just release the damn files. He said do it — release the damn files.”

Megan Mineiro and Robert Jimison contributed reporting.

Additional changes include moving a child care grant program for college students and foreign medical school accreditation to the Health and Human Services Department, and transferring Fulbright programs and international education grants to the State Department. The Interior Department will take over the Indian Education Office.

Shifting duties away from the Education Department aligns with President Trump’s goal of eventually closing the agency, a move opposed by teachers’ unions and student rights groups and one that can only be accomplished with an act of Congress.

Less clear was how moving programs to other agencies aligned with Mr. Trump’s reason for closing the Education Department, which he has said was to give states more power in shaping school policies. A senior official at the Education Department said the changes would streamline bureaucracy so that more dollars would go to classrooms.

“Cutting through layers of red tape in Washington is one essential piece of our final mission,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement, adding that the changes were an attempt to “refocus education on students, families and schools.”

The plan drew some immediate blowback from Republicans, including Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who said in a statement that the “department’s core offices are not discretionary functions.”

“They are foundational,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. “They safeguard civil rights, expand opportunity, and ensure that every child, in every community, has the chance to learn, grow and succeed on equal footing.”

Kevin Carey, the vice president for education and work at New America, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said the changes were “wasteful, wrong and illegal.”

“Secretary McMahon is creating a bureaucratic Rube Goldberg machine that will waste millions of taxpayer dollars by outsourcing vital programs to other agencies,” Mr. Carey said. “It’s like paying a contractor double to mow your lawn and then claiming you’ve cut the home maintenance budget. It makes no sense.”

Administration officials have pointed to the recent federal shutdown to justify the moves, noting that schools remained open and students continued to be taught despite nearly all of the Education Department’s staff having been furloughed.

The department has posted several social media memes making such a point. In an X post last week, the department announced that federal workers were returning to the office, adding, “But let’s be honest: did you really miss us at all?”

Liz Huston, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration was committed to shrinking the agency “while still ensuring efficient delivery of funds and essential programs.”

“The Democrat shutdown made one thing unmistakably clear: Students and teachers don’t need Washington bureaucrats micromanaging their classrooms,” Ms. Huston said.

Republicans in charge of the House and Senate in Washington have signaled little enthusiasm for voting on a bill to close the department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979.

Mr. Trump has also shown little interest in collaborating with Congress in his bid to reshape the federal government, and his administration has continued to seek ways to diminish the Education Department.

“We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said in March after signing an executive order that directed Ms. McMahon to start razing the department.

Ms. McMahon’s first act after joining Mr. Trump’s cabinet this year was to instruct the department’s staff to prepare for its “final mission” of shuttering the agency. The following week, Ms. McMahon fired 1,315 of those workers.

The layoffs decimated the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which was created to enforce Congress’s promise of equal educational opportunity for all students, and eliminated the agency’s research arm dedicated to tracking U.S. student achievement, which for many students is at three-decade lows.

In July, after the Supreme Court cleared the way for mass layoffs at the department, the administration moved adult education, family literacy programs and career and technical education to the Labor Department.

The secretaries follow with a list of questions demanding further information from both departments. They ask whether the Justice Department had “shared, or does it intend to share, information from voter files” with any other federal agency, and whether the Homeland Security Department had received information about voters from other sources.

The Justice Department has embarked on an effort to compile the largest set of national voter roll data it has ever collected, to essentially establish a national voting database. The push, which is meant in part to bolster unsubstantiated claims by President Trump and his allies that large numbers of undocumented immigrants have voted illegally, has worried election officials and voting rights experts who say the data could be used to try to discredit future election results.

Nearly every request for the private data was initially rebuffed by top state election officials, who said they needed more information on how the list would be used, leading the Justice Department to sue at least eight states this year.

In the letter, the election officials cite what they view as potentially contradictory information. They state that Heather Honey, a top election official at the Homeland Security Department and previously a leader of the right-wing election activist movement, told a private gathering of secretaries of state that the department “had not received voter data or requested it” and “had no intention of using voter data.”

The letter continues, “The same day, D.H.S. publicly contradicted her representation and confirmed that they had received this data” and would put it through a program the agency developed that checks immigration status.

The secretaries of state also recounted a meeting in August with a top Justice Department official, who told them that the department “intended to use voter information to assess compliance” with the rules for maintaining federal voter lists.

“The first step to repair any relationship with the federal government is clear and transparent communication,” Jena Griswold, the Democratic secretary of state in Colorado and one of the officials who signed the letter, said in an interview. She criticized many of the administration’s actions regarding elections, arguing that they “make our elections less secure and decrease the level of confidence and trust from Democratic secretaries of state with federal counterparts who used to be trusted partners.”

“We’ll have to see what they say,” she said. “At this point, we want answers.”

Representatives for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since Mr. Trump’s return to office, secretaries of state and other top election officials have confronted significant changes to the relationship between the federal government and states regarding elections.

Beginning in February, as part of sweeping federal cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration eliminated programs that had helped election officials coordinate cybersecurity plans and communicate regarding potential threats. The administration has also placed right-wing election activists like Ms. Honey in critical election positions in the federal government.

At the same time, both the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security have made repeated attempts to obtain the private information of voters kept by states on their voter rolls. This information includes partial social security numbers and driver’s license numbers, information not available on publicly available voter rolls.

And in March, Mr. Trump issued an executive order seeking to require proof of citizenship to register to vote, the return of all mail ballots by Election Day and other changes.

That effort, however, was largely blocked by the courts.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/18/multimedia/18trump-news-promo-5pm-whqb/18trump-news-promo-5pm-whqb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 16:57:16.386468

President Trump has sought to deploy National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas to the city, too, but that effort remains tied up in the courts.
Last weekend, the federal government said it was sending 200 Texas National Guard troops back home who had yet to be deployed on Chicago streets.
About 100 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control and on standby.
At the forefront of the order was the deployment to D.C. of about 2,300 National Guard troops.","The Trump administration’s strategy of using federal agents and troops to enforce immigration laws and what it says is a bid to reduce crime in U.S. cities has extended to North Carolina. Border Patrol agents made scores of arrests in Charlotte over the weekend and then moved into the Raleigh area on Tuesday.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been heavily involved in many of the cities. National Guard troops have been called in to help in a few of them. In other cities, the federal intervention has involved agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Here is how federal forces have been used in cities:

Charlotte: How long will federal forces be there?

Border Patrol agents made more than 130 arrests in the city over the weekend. The agents are led by Gregory Bovino, a senior official in the agency who is from western North Carolina and who has directed similar operations in Chicago and Los Angeles this year.

The use of the Border Patrol, an arm of Customs and Border Protection that has focused primarily on the nation’s southern border in recent years, is an example of how the Trump administration has expanded the scope of some of its agencies. In the past, the Border Patrol has operated mostly near a land or maritime border, whereas ICE typically operates inside the United States. (The Border Patrol and ICE are each part of the Department of Homeland Security.)

But the Border Patrol’s stated mission is to detect and prevent the illegal entry of people into the United States, so it can make arrests anywhere in the nation, though some of its powers — like the ability to stop and search people — are more limited outside a zone of 100 miles near a border.

Raleigh: Broadening operations in North Carolina

Border Patrol agents expanded their operations in North Carolina on Tuesday by deploying agents to the state’s heavily Democratic Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. The full scope of the operation was not immediately clear. But North Carolina is the first state to be targeted that is considered a political battleground state.

The federal crackdown on illegal immigration that began in the Chicago area in early September goes on, though it has been tamped down somewhat by the courts. Before he departed, Mr. Bovino and federal agents that included Border Patrol personnel had in recent weeks taken some of the most aggressive actions yet.

A federal judge condemned agents for using unnecessary force that included using tear gas and pepper spray against Chicago residents without giving them proper warning, and for pointing guns at civilians who were not a physical threat. The judge also said Mr. Bovino had lied to her about his tactics. The Justice Department argued that the tactics were justified because some protesters had become violent.

President Trump has sought to deploy National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas to the city, too, but that effort remains tied up in the courts. Last weekend, the federal government said it was sending 200 Texas National Guard troops back home who had yet to be deployed on Chicago streets.

Overall, the federal operation in the region has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests. But the sweeps have rounded up American citizens and legal residents, too.

Memphis: Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, welcomes intervention

Memphis is the only Democratic-led city in a state with a Republican governor that has seen federal forces move in. On Monday night, a judge in Tennessee temporarily blocked the National Guard from participating in federal actions in the operation, which Mr. Trump and state officials have said has focused on combating serious crime. (The state is expected to appeal the ruling before the pause takes effect.)

But the use of the Guard was just one part of a broad federal task force, which is otherwise unaffected by the ruling. More than a dozen agencies have taken part since it began in late September, including the F.B.I.; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, resulting in more than 2,600 arrests. Some of those arrested have been undocumented immigrants, and residents have reported seeing immigration agents throughout the city.

Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, has welcomed the federal effort and agreed to deploy the Guard. But many local Democratic officials in Memphis, while acknowledging that crime has been a longstanding issue, have said that serious crime was already on the decline and that using the Guard was unnecessary. Still, many have made a point of working with the extra federal resources.

Protests in Memphis have been far more muted than in other cities in part because many groups have focused their efforts more on informing residents, hoping to lower the number of arrests or stops by federal agents.

Los Angeles: After raids in June, immigration sweeps go on

Nowhere has the presence of federal forces been more apparent than in Los Angeles, home to the country’s largest population of undocumented immigrants. Raids across Southern California in June led to huge protests that prompted President Trump to send 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to the city. Mr. Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw that operation, left the Los Angeles area in September to lead operations in Chicago and then Charlotte. But federal agents have remained in the area and continue to conduct immigration sweeps.

County and city officials have said that they have received almost-daily reports from residents of immigration sweeps from South Los Angeles to the Inland Empire region east of the city. Since June, federal agents have made nearly 9,000 immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Local leaders have said that the arrests and continued presence of federal immigration agents in the area have instilled fear among immigrant communities.

Portland, Ore.: Modest protests continue outside ICE facility

The Trump administration ramped up its immigration enforcement in the city around June, and a small but persistent group of protesters has held daily demonstrations outside Portland’s ICE building ever since. Skirmishes with the authorities led to the closing of that building for more than three weeks at one point, according to the Department of Homeland Security, but protests had largely fizzled by September. Late that month, however, Mr. Trump tried to send National Guard troops to the city, saying that the ICE building and federal workers there needed to be protected from “war-ravaged Portland.”

Portland and Oregon sued, and a federal judge this month issued a permanent block on the deployment. The administration is appealing. Over the weekend, the Pentagon said that it was going to send home about 200 California National Guard troops who had been sent to Portland but never deployed on the streets. About 100 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control and on standby.

Mr. Trump began a takeover of the nation’s capital in August after claiming that crime had gotten out of control (though data suggested crime has dropped in the district). At the forefront of the order was the deployment to D.C. of about 2,300 National Guard troops.

They have also been directed to help efforts to beautify the city, and they have spent parts of the last few months picking up leaves and depositing mulch at parks. The troops are expected to remain well into 2026. The District of Columbia has sued, arguing that the Trump administration has exceeded its authority by ordering in the troops without the consent of Mayor Muriel Bowser, and by using those troops to conduct law enforcement. The judge has not yet ruled on the case.

But Ms. Bowser has welcomed assistance from other federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who have coordinated with the D.C. police to get guns and drugs off the street. The Department of Justice said last week that in the 100 days since the federal takeover, more than two dozen federal and local agencies had made more than 6,000 arrests and seized more than 600 illegal guns.

(CN) — Four Portland-area counties will turn over information regarding immigrants — including lawful permanent residents — who were convicted of violent crimes, a federal judge ruled on Monday.

The ruling follows a petition filed by the federal government in October, in which it accused the counties of refusing to comply with administrative subpoenas issued by Homeland Security Investigations in July.

Under Oregon’s sanctuary laws, state bodies are required to decline any request from a federal agency that relates to immigration enforcement, unless ordered to do so by a judicial subpoena.

“We’re obligated to follow state law,” said Andy Jones with the Multnomah County Attorney’s Office, explaining in a Monday hearing that the court must authorize a subpoena before the county can comply with it in this instance.

Dave Lewis, Washington County attorney, noted that some of the subpoenas request information that isn’t under the county’s control, but rather resides in a state-managed database.

The federal government argued that if the counties don’t have the requested information, they can still comply by simply submitting a declaration saying as much, Susanne Luse with the United States Attorney’s Office said.

“If they’re not in possession, we simply want a statement,” Luse said.

U.S. District Judge Michael McShane, a Barack Obama appointee, noted that the parties appeared to generally agree and remarked that he thought the case might be “more hotly contested.”

Rather, the proceedings largely centered on administrative logistics. If the federal government intends to submit more petitions to the court — which it must to require that state entities comply with the subpoenas — McShane said the process should be streamlined.

“Certainly I don’t want to referee every document request,” McShane said.

McShane granted the federal government’s petition, authorizing the counties — which also include Clackamas and Marion — to turn over the requested information if they have it.

“The scope of enforcement is narrow, and we’re going to keep it narrow,” McShane said.

The information sought by the federal government is specific and “not all that remarkable,” McShane noted.

The federal government originally sought to enforce 10 administrative subpoenas, but the number fell to nine after one of the individuals was arrested. In its petition, the federal government said the information is necessary to locate “dangerous, criminal aliens who are subject to removal from the United States pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act.”

The counties reportedly released violent criminal offenders who may be subject to removal from the country between 2022 and 2023, according to the federal government.

While the counties largely appeared to be on the same page, Marion County — where county seat and state capital Salem is located — presented a separate legal question to the court.

In August, after Marion County received the ICE subpoenas, the county sued Oregon Governor Tina Kotek in federal court seeking guidance on how it should proceed. Specifically, Marion County asked whether it could release the records it gathered in response to the subpoenas, noting that the documents are public records that would be available to anyone who made a public records request.

It raised those arguments again when the federal government filed its petition in October, then asked the court to settle its issues of state law by moving for partial summary judgment in the multicounty case.

The state filed an amicus brief opposing Marion County’s motion, explaining that the state public records law issues raised by the county have nothing to do with the issues raised in the federal government’s petition.

McShane said he would issue a written ruling soon.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/courthousenews.com/2025/10/immigration-ice-police-jacket.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-11-18 16:57:43.480664

According to Bloomington Police Chief Booker Hodges, officers started the three-day sting on Nov. 5. They used several methods to find people who were attempting to solicit a 17-year-old girl for sex.

In all, police arrested 16 men during the investigation, which Hodges called ""Operation Creep.""

Hodges said most of the men came from within the Twin Cities area.

One of the men, he said, is an employee for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who could face federal charges. Hodges said the ICE employee works as an auditor.

""When he was arrested, he said 'I'm ICE, boys,'"" Hodges said during a press conference Tuesday. ""Well, unfortunately for him, we locked him up.""

Not all of the men have been charged.

Hodges added that he knew ""ICE took custody of a few of them but we don't have a way to verify someone's status here at the Bloomington Police Department.""

He added that sting operations have become more difficult in recent years because of advanced technology.

""We need to make sure that we pass some laws that make it so these companies can't continue to have these people on their platforms,"" Hodges said.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and police departments from Eden Prairie, Richfield and the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport assisted with the operation, Hodges said.

Durham officials are on alert after Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said Border Patrol agents will be in the capital city on Tuesday.

Durham Mayor Leo Williams began Monday’s meeting by reading a joint statement by him; Nida Allam, the chair of the Durham County Board of Commissioners; and Bettina Umstead, the chair of the Durham Public Schools Board of Education.

“We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights and compromises safety,” Williams said. “Our schools, neighborhoods and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages and experiences that define Durham.

“We stand together in our commitment to protect, uplift and care for every resident who calls Durham home and reject any policy that threatens that trust and unity that we have built in our community,” he said.

Councilman Nate Baker had stronger words about the arrests, saying immigrants have been used as “pawns in this game that the fascist federal government is playing right now in this country.”

“They are being terrorized,” he said. “What we see on television is only a fraction of the terror that is happening in homes across this country and in cities where action is being taken in clear violation of human rights and undermining safety, as our governor spoke earlier.”

Baker said that the City Council would do “everything we can.”

“Our immigrant friends and neighbors are the backbone of our city and of our country,” Baker said. “They are so important for our industries, they are so important for our culture and for our society, and they bring so much, and they have the same hopes and aspirations as everyone else, and they have been thrust into the shadows.”

Councilwoman Javiera Caballero, an immigrant from Chile, said immigrant rights has been an issue she has fought “long and hard for my entire time on Council.”

“I have no doubt that Durham will step up and help protect its residents,” she said. “We’ve done it before. We’ll do it again. I think the risks are a lot harder now, more challenging.”

Councilman Carl Rist, the son of a German immigrant, thanked Caballero for keeping the issue at the forefront for the City Council.

“We’re always stronger on this council and in our public bodies in Durham when we speak with one voice,” he said.

In February, the Border Patrol confirmed the arrests of 11 people, including three young Indian immigrant men, in a Durham neighborhood, The News & Observer previously reported. Neighbors who witnessed the event said they saw tactical gear and masked agents in cars with tinted windows. Details about the arrests, including the men’s identities, were not released.

In July, Caballero and Rist joined other Durham officials and grassroots organization Siembra NC in front of the Durham County Courthouse to alert the community after four plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were seen, frightening some residents.

Months later, the Durham City Council passed a resolution declaring the city a Fourth Amendment Workplace to protect city workers from potential ICE arrests.

On Friday, Durham County Sheriff Clarence Birkhead said the Sheriff’s Office was unaware of any planned operations in Durham.

“I want to reiterate that Durham County does not participate in the 287(g) program, and we do not participate in any [Customs and Border Protection] or ICE ‘roundup’” operations,” Birkhead said. “Unfortunately, we are also not informed prior to any such CBP or ICE operations being initiated in local jurisdictions. CBP and ICE agents are federal law enforcement, therefore, they are acting under a federal mandate.”

In a motion to dismiss the case filed Monday, city attorneys wrote that the Trust Act, which limits the Boston Police Department’s ability to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on non-criminal matters, was both permissible under federal law and an important way to protect residents.

“Boston is safer when residents, regardless of immigration status, know they can call the Boston Police Department to report crime, participate in the economy, and utilize City services — basic functions of civic life that promote the prosperity and stability on which public safety relies,"" they wrote. “Boston has built this trust through decades of community policing and cooperative work with local leaders. The Trust Act protects that success.”

President Donald Trump’s administration filed the lawsuit in September, saying the Trust Act undermined law enforcement and public safety.

On Aug. 5, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi published a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions,” places where local regulations limit police cooperation with ICE, that included the city of Boston and “vowed to bring litigation to end these policies nationwide.” The federal justice department filed a similar suit against New York City in July.

The September lawsuit was not the first time the federal government had attacked the Trust Act since Trump took office in January. In March, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu was called to testify before Congress to defend it alongside the leaders of other so-called “sanctuary cities.”

As Wu said during her Congressional hearing, attorneys emphasized in their motion this week that the Trust Act still allows police to work with ICE on criminal investigations such as in drug or human trafficking cases. While the federal government had argued in its lawsuit that the law violates the federal Immigration and Naturalization Act, city attorneys disagreed, saying that law only permits cooperation, but doesn’t require it.

Any requirement to work with federal immigration enforcement, they wrote, would be a violation of Boston’s rights under the 10th Amendment, which gives state governments large powers of self-governance.

“Municipalities retain the authority not to participate in immigration enforcement,” they wrote. “Boston has declined the INA’s invitation, and the Tenth Amendment protects the City’s authority to do so.”

A Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll from July found that, by and large, Bostonians support the Trust Act’s limitations on Boston Police’s cooperation with ICE. The Trust Act is also in line with a 2017 ruling by Massachusetts’ highest court that found that, under state law, local officials cannot detain a person based on civil immigration law violations alone.

Letitia James, the New York State attorney general and a Democrat, celebrated the ruling.","A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against New York State in hopes of enabling immigration agents to conduct arrests in state and local courthouses.

The judge, Mae A. D’Agostino, ruled late Monday in favor of New York, finding that a 2020 state law and two executive orders that limit civil arrests near local courts and in state facilities were not unconstitutional, as the Department of Justice had argued in June.

The 41-page ruling marked another defeat for President Trump’s efforts to strike down laws passed by cities and states that limit cooperation between localities and the federal government on immigration matters.

In July, a federal judge in Illinois dismissed a lawsuit that had argued that state and local officials there were violating the Constitution by enforcing so-called sanctuary measures. The Justice Department filed a similar lawsuit against New York City’s sanctuary laws in late July that is ongoing.

The ruling on Monday night has no effect on the arrests that federal officers have been conducting in immigration courthouses in New York City, which are federal property. Scores of migrants showing up for routine court hearings have been arrested this year.

“The court made the right decision in upholding New York’s sovereignty, and the state will continue to work with federal and local law enforcement in cracking down on violent offenders while keeping our communities safe and enforcing our laws,” Jess D’Amelia, a spokeswoman for Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement.

New York lawmakers passed the 2020 state law, known as the Protect Our Courts Act, during Mr. Trump’s first term, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began arresting undocumented immigrants at state and local courts. Other states, including California and Washington, have similar policies barring ICE agents from courthouses.

The New York law allows agents to arrest people at or near courthouses only if they have a court order or criminal warrant signed by a judge — provisions that make it much harder for ICE to conduct arrests at the courthouses.

In June, Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Albany that argued that the state law shielded criminals while endangering public safety, saying that the state was helping “prevent illegal aliens from apprehension.”

The lawsuit argued that the state law violated the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which says that the Constitution and federal statutes take priority over any conflicting state laws.

But Judge D’Agostino, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2011, ruled that the state policies were not pre-empted by federal law and that New York was within its rights in deciding not to help the federal government with immigration enforcement.

She wrote that the state’s measures reflected New York’s “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment and not preempted” by federal immigration laws.

Letitia James, the New York State attorney general and a Democrat, celebrated the ruling.

“Everyone deserves to seek justice without fear,” Ms. James said in a statement. “This ruling ensures that anyone can use New York’s state courts without being targeted by federal authorities.”

ICE officials have previously argued that arresting people in courthouses is easier and safer for its officers and the public, in part because people who enter courthouses have been screened for weapons.

But its intensity has begun to subside as Homeland Security officials have confirmed that a new immigration enforcement surge has begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Johnson in a hearing Tuesday said there are currently only four people being held at the Broadview facility, a drastic reduction that comes weeks after detainees there testified they had been crammed into rooms filled with more than 100 people for multiple days.

The decline in population comes as federal immigration agents sent to the area as part of the Trump Administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement efforts have begun leaving Chicago ahead of a possible return in the spring.

“I guess they just can’t take our winters,” U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman said Tuesday. “I don’t blame them.”

More than 3,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws have been arrested in and around Chicago during the operation. But its intensity has begun to subside as Homeland Security officials have confirmed that a new immigration enforcement surge has begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Broadview facility — which serves as a processing facility where detainees are supposed to be held for only a few hours before being moved to a detention facility elsewhere — has drawn widespread protests in recent months.

Tuesday’s hearing was part of a class-action lawsuit brought last month by the MacArthur Justice Center and the ACLU of Illinois, who sought a temporary restraining order to address what advocates claim are “inhumane and unlawful conditions” at the Broadview facility.

Gettleman granted that order following a daylong hearing earlier this month in which several former Broadview detainees testified that they were crammed into overstuffed holding rooms with dozens of others, had difficulty contacting their families or attorneys and weren’t able to shower or change their clothes sometimes for multiple days.

Some detainees also said they were coerced into signing voluntary deportation forms after being lied to or threatened by federal agents.

Since then, government prosecutors said ICE has made significant strides toward improving those conditions, though attorneys for the plaintiffs say they’ve still had trouble contacting clients inside Broadview.

Last week, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura McNally and attorneys in the case performed a site visit at the controversial immigration facility.

Attorneys representing the detainees on Tuesday said there were around 20 people held at the facility during that visit, and they mentioned some issues regarding food quality and attorney access still remained.

Johnson told the court though that aside from “a few tweaks outstanding,” ICE is currently complying with Gettleman’s temporary order.

Attorneys for the detainees are now seeking a preliminary injunction which would turn Gettleman’s temporary order into a more permanent one. A hearing on that issue is scheduled for December.

Texas cannot use its new congressional map for the 2026 election and will instead need to stick with the lines passed in 2021, a three-judge panel ruled Tuesday.

The decision is a major blow for Republicans, in Texas and nationally, who pushed through this unusual mid-decade redistricting at the behest of President Donald Trump. They were hoping the new map would yield control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts — up from the 25 they currently hold — and help protect the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House.

The map cleared the GOP-controlled Legislature in August and was quickly signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott. Several advocacy groups sued over the new district lines, saying lawmakers intentionally diluted the voting power of Black and Hispanic Texans and drew racially gerrymandered maps. Over the course of a nine-day hearing in El Paso earlier this month, they aimed to convince the judges that it was in voters’ best interest to shelve the new map until a full trial could be held.

It was not immediately clear if the state still has a legal path to restoring the new map in time for 2026. Unlike most federal lawsuits, which are heard by a single district judge and then appealed to a circuit court, voting rights lawsuits are initially heard by two district judges and one circuit judge, and their ruling can only be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The decision comes 10 days into the monthlong period when candidates can sign up for the March primary. The filing deadline is Dec. 8.

This is just the opening gambit in what promises to be a yearslong legal battle over Texas’ congressional map. A lawsuit over the state’s 2021 redistricting — including its state legislative and education board seats — went to trial earlier this summer and remains pending before the same three-judge panel. The judges have indicated they may want to see how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a major voting rights case before issuing their full ruling on Texas’ maps.

Gavin Newsom, challenging a California law he recently signed that prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing masks, a practice that became common this year amid the president’s immigration crackdown.

It says federal law enforcement agencies will not comply with the pair of state laws, which take effect on Jan. 1, and asks the court to strike them down.

“California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.

Several states have introduced measures to ban masking by immigration agents, but California was the first to pass one into law.

The lawsuit comes as little surprise. Mr. Newsom himself said in July that he was “looking at the constitutionality” of the bill, months before signing it in September. Legal experts predicted it would be challenged in court, where numerous conflicts between California and the Trump administration are now playing out.

“If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people’s rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,” Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, said in a statement.

Supporters have argued that the measure is constitutional because state and local governments can require federal agencies to follow general laws, such as speed limits. The mask law applies to both federal and local law enforcement agents in California.

Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who wrote the bill, vowed to fight to defend it.

“We see I.C.E. and other federal agents going into communities with these ski masks, just terrorizing communities, where you don’t even know if someone is an actual agent or not,” Mr. Wiener said in a video posted on social media.

“It causes fear, and it’s unacceptable in a democracy.”

The lawsuit claims that officers must have the option to shield their identities because of the threats and violence they face on the job. It cites a huge increase in assaults and death threats against officers, and says websites publish agents’ personal information “to harass and threaten them and their families.”

“Now is an extraordinarily dangerous time to serve in federal law enforcement,” the lawsuit said.

It contends that the California laws prohibiting officers from wearing masks and requiring that they display identification “would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities.”

Because federal agencies will not comply with the laws, officers are at risk of criminal prosecution if the laws are not struck down, the suit says.

“Trump has not adequately alleged the falsity of CNN’s statements. Therefore, he has failed to state a defamation claim,” the three-judge panel wrote in its unsigned ruling.

The panel included two of Trump’s own appointees, U.S. Circuit Judges Kevin Newsom and Elizabeth Branch. The unanimous ruling was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Adalberto Jordan, an appointee of former President Obama.

Trump filed the lawsuit against CNN in 2022 for $475 million in punitive damages, pointing to online opinion pieces and on-air comments that used the phrase “Big Lie” to describe Trump’s baseless fraud claims after the 2020 election.

CNN has maintained the lawsuit is meritless. A network spokesperson declined to comment on the appeals ruling.

Also on Monday, the Trump administration and lawyers for Illinois and Chicago filed what are expected to be their final briefs on President Donald Trump’s authority to deploy the National Guard to Illinois.

Former Justice Stephen Breyer is scheduled to speak to students at Suffolk University in Boston on Thursday morning. The event is closed to the public.

Morning Reads

Fed Governor Lisa Cook Offers First Defense of Mortgage Records (Nick Timiraos, The Wall Street Journal)(Paywall) — In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, “Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook’s lawyer on Monday provided the first detailed defense of her mortgage applications, arguing that apparent discrepancies in loan documents were either accurate at the time or an ‘inadvertent notation’ that couldn’t constitute fraud given other disclosures to her lenders,” according to The Wall Street Journal. “President Trump has sought to fire cook from the Fed over alleged fraud involving her mortgage applications,” but the “Supreme Court has for now blocked Trump’s attempt to remove her and will hear arguments in January.”

Texas National Guard troops expected to leave Chicago and return home, source says (Dalia Faheid, CNN) — As the Supreme Court weighs Trump’s authority to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, some of the troops that have been there awaiting the justices’ decision are heading home, according to CNN. “Two hundred federalized [Texas National Guard] troops had arrived in the city over a month ago with a mission from the Trump administration to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other US Government personnel – but instead stayed waiting at training bases for weeks” because of the legal battle over the deployment. The changes to the deployment are not expected to affect the 300 troops federalized from the Illinois National Guard.

Supreme Court not ready to tackle prayers at football games again (Maureen Groppe, USA Today) — In its Monday order list, the court announced that it had “rejected an appeal from a Christian high school that was blocked from leading a communal prayer before a state championship football game,” according to USA Today. “The court’s decision not to get involved doesn’t have a practical effect on Cambridge Christian School, which sued the Florida High School Athletic Association in 2015 after its request to pray over the loudspeaker was denied. Since then, Florida passed legislation requiring the athletic association to allow schools to make opening remarks at games it oversees, and the FHSAA has said that includes communal prayers.” However, it does mean that the court at this time will not further clarify what types of public prayers violate the establishment clause; the school had contended that such clarification was needed to ensure that public programs did not needlessly prevent expressions of faith.

US Supreme Court won’t hear patent appeal against Apple, Google, LG (Blake Brittain, Reuters) — Monday’s order list also showed that the court won’t weigh in on a dispute “involving the right to challenge expired patents, leaving in place a win for Apple, Google, and LG Electronics,” according to Reuters. Gesture Technology Partners, which had challenged “a decision to invalidate a patent that it had accused the technology companies of infringing,” had contended that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board does not have the authority to review expired patents and that the case should have been “reviewed by federal courts” instead.

Gupta Wessler Nabs High Court Veteran From Justice Department (Alex Ebert, Bloomberg Law)(Paywall) — A seasoned Justice Department lawyer “with thirteen US Supreme Court arguments on his resume” is moving to “plaintiff-side Washington appellate boutique Gupta Wessler,” according to Bloomberg Law. “Matt Guarnieri is joining as a principal, adding another oral advocate to a practice that is already a routine high court player. In a social media post announcing the hire, the firm said its lawyers have now argued 33 cases before the high court—the most in recent years among plaintiff-side groups.”

A Closer Look: A Brief History of Supreme Court Clerkships

In his latest Empirical SCOTUS column for SCOTUSblog, Adam Feldman explored the idea that a Supreme Court justice’s most lasting legacy is the clerks he or she mentors, because former clerks often go on to exert a significant influence on the federal judiciary, such as by serving as judges (or justices) themselves.

But what you may not have realized when reading that column is that this avenue of influence wasn’t available to the justices until the late 19th century, nearly a century after the court began its work. Until then, there was no budget for justices to have a law clerk. Instead, they each had only a messenger, someone who could run opinion drafts or other dispatches back and forth from their home to the homes of the other justices. (There was no Supreme Court building until 1935 – the court would meet in different locations, although principally within the U.S. Capitol building.)

The Supreme Court’s clerk situation began to change in the 1880s, when Justice Horace Gray joined the court. As Justice Amy Coney Barrett outlined in her book, Listening to the Law, Gray had gotten used to working with a clerk while serving as a Massachusetts state court judge, and he paid out of pocket to continue having one after he was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1882.

Four years later, in 1886, Congress appropriated the funds necessary for not just Gray but for every justice to hire a clerk or stenography assistant. The court’s docket was rapidly expanding, and U.S. Attorney General Augustus Garland had advised lawmakers to offer funds for additional court employees, “emphasizing that cabinet officials and senators had comparable assistants,” Barrett wrote.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the work of these clerks or assistants varied widely depending on which justice they served. Some were more like professional typists, while others did in-depth legal research. All, however, took on some unusual tasks, including running personal errands.

In the 1920s, Congress authorized each justice to hire a second law clerk, and in the 1940s, Congress gave each justice a third. It was around this time that all the justices began relying on their clerks to do more substantive work, such as reviewing cert petitions, a task that is still core to clerks’ work today.

Congress allocated even more money to the court in the 1970s, making it possible for each justice to hire up to four clerks. Four is still the magic number on the court today, although the chief justice is allowed up to five.

In Listening to the Law, Barrett wrote that it would be “impossible” to describe the work of the Supreme Court without describing the contributions made by clerks. In addition to screening potential cases, they help their justice prepare for oral argument, draft opinions, and review opinion drafts from other chambers.

And after their Supreme Court clerkship is done, former clerks often go on to have impressive legal careers, as Feldman wrote. Six of the current justices previously served as Supreme Court clerks (all but Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor.)

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to review a ruling by a federal appeals court that, the Trump administration contends, “has already caused—and, if left in place, will continue to cause—‘untold interference with the Executive Branch’s ability to manage the southern border.’” The immigrant rights group and asylum seekers who filed the lawsuit had urged the justices to leave the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in place, telling them that the government’s argument “would empower border officials to render” federal law governing the processing of asylum seekers “wholly inoperable at ports of entry.” For more on Noem v. Al Otro Lado, read Amy’s analysis.

Court Won’t Hear Appeals Regarding Prison Construction and School Prayer

Also on Monday, the court, over the objections of three justices, turned down an appeal from the sheriff of New Orleans in a dispute over the city’s obligation to build a new facility for inmates with mental health issues. Sheriff Susan Hutson had sought to end the city’s obligation by turning the court’s attention to a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a federal law that was intended to reduce frivolous lawsuits by inmates, which provides for the cut-off of future-oriented relief after two years. For more on this case and other notable developments from Monday’s order list, read Amy’s analysis.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents will be deployed in the Raleigh area on Tuesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell and Democratic legislative sources briefed by Gov. Josh Stein’s office told The Assembly and INDY on Monday.

“It is the city of Raleigh’s understanding that the Border Patrol and ICE are already in Raleigh and that they will be active tomorrow,” Cowell told The Assembly and INDY. “We have not been informed of nor are we coordinating or helping plan any of this, so we don’t know what activities they’ll be undertaking tomorrow, or really a lot of other details.”

In a statement, Stein said his office “is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh.”

Stein, a Democrat, asked immigration agents “to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations. Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.

“To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement,” Stein added. “Let’s keep each other safe.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, said in a statement that the department does not “discuss future or potential operations.”

“We will not stop enforcing the laws of our nation until every criminal illegal alien is arrested and removed from our country,” McLaughlin said.

Like Cowell, the legislative sources said they were short on details.

“I do know that they are bringing people here,” said one state senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We don’t know how long they plan to be here. But they certainly are making their presence known tomorrow.”

The sources also did not know how many agents CBP would send, or whether their intended target—“Raleigh”—meant the city, Wake County, or the entire Triangle. Durham officials said on Monday that they are planning a press conference for Tuesday morning. (The press conference was canceled as of Tuesday morning; officials said they would release a statement instead.)

The Durham County Sheriff’s Office responded to an inquiry by re-sending a statement it originally provided last week that said the office was not aware of any CBP operations. The sheriff’s office has not responded to follow-up inquiries.

A Durham Police Department spokesperson said he had not heard of immigration officials “coming to Durham to conduct an operation like they are in Charlotte.” Federal agencies are not required to notify local law enforcement about their plans, the spokesperson said.

During Monday night’s Durham City Council meeting, Mayor Leonardo Williams read a statement that affirmed the city’s commitment to protecting immigrants but did not address whether Durham would be targeted.

About 200 CBP agents were deployed to Charlotte on Saturday as part of what the Department of Homeland Security is calling “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Greg Bovino, the North Carolina-raised head of CBP, vowed to “hit Charlotte like a storm.” At least 130 people were arrested in the first 48 hours, according to CBP.

ABC News has reported that CBP agents stationed in Charlotte will be sent to New Orleans this Friday.

Like other cities that immigration officials have targeted this year, Charlotte is led mostly by Democrats. Republicans, including President Donald Trump, blamed the city’s “soft-on-crime” approach for the high-profile killing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska this summer.

Earlier this month, three Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation asked Stein to deploy the National Guard to fight what they called the city’s “increasingly dire” crime problem.

“The men and women who wear the badge in Charlotte have sounded an unmistakable cry for help,” wrote U.S. Reps. Mark Harris, Pat Harrigan, and Chuck Edwards. “Yet you have rejected their cry. The people of North Carolina deserve to know why their governor has refused help while the officers sworn to protect them plead for immediate assistance.”

Stein has not deployed the National Guard.

Violent crime in Charlotte has dropped by 20 percent over the last year, according to the city’s police department. Violent crime has dropped as well in Raleigh and Durham, also Democratic strongholds.

As federal agents moved into Charlotte this weekend, the Trump administration also accused the city’s “sanctuary politicians” of allowing “criminal illegal aliens” to “roam free.” Like Durham and Raleigh’s police departments, Charlotte’s police do not participate in a federal program that authorizes them to enforce immigration laws.

And until recently, the Mecklenburg County jail did not honor “detainers,” or requests to hold immigrants who would otherwise be released for up to 48 hours so that immigration officials can take them into custody. That changed after the Republican-led General Assembly passed laws in 2024 and 2025 requiring sheriffs to honor detainers and notify immigration officials before releasing immigrants held on felony and other charges.

The Trump administration said that North Carolina jails failed to honor nearly 1,400 detainers, which Republicans say put residents at risk.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden has argued that partnering with immigration authorities erodes trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement.

McFadden was one of five Black Democrats who were elected in urban counties in 2018 after pledging not to cooperate with immigration authorities. Also in that group were the new sheriffs of Durham and Wake counties. Those offices—as well as the police departments in Durham and Raleigh—have taken similar approaches to immigration enforcement.

“Border Patrol is in Charlotte for one reason: the need is real,” Kyle Kirby, chair of the Mecklenburg County GOP, said in a statement. “When local Democrats—who control all aspects of local government—refuse to enforce the law, federal agencies have no choice but to step in and protect this community.”

Democrats argue that the immigration agents’ aggressive tactics have terrorized and intimidated Latino residents.

“Everyone wants to be safe in their communities,” Stein said in a video posted on X this weekend. “But the actions of too many federal agents are doing the exact opposite in Charlotte. We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling, and picking up random people in parking lots and off our sidewalks. This is not making us safer.”

Cowell said she wanted Raleigh residents to know that the city’s police are on their side.

“If citizens see things that they think are not lawful, feel threatened—any of those—they can call the police as normal tomorrow,” Cowell said. “And we do have First Amendment rights. We are just trying to encourage nonviolent, peaceful sort of activity tomorrow.”

Executive order targeted benefits In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""
Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to.","The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services wants to expand a Biden-era policy known as public charge that could further curtail immigrants' use of public benefits.

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.

Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.

""Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,"" the proposal states.

Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.

""This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,"" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. ""By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.""

Politics of social safety net programs

The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.

People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.

Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.

U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.

Executive order targeted benefits

In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""

Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.

Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.

Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a ""public charge"" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5027x2828+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2Ff1%2F483a0fc4495aa8af954582280111%2Fgettyimages-1229220583.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:59:43.584121

November 5: CAC President Elizabeth Wydra joined Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to discuss Learning Resources v. Trump.","This month, the Supreme Court is considering two major challenges to Trump overreach—one on its merits docket and one on its shadow docket—and CAC has been involved in both.

At the beginning of November, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the challenge to President Trump’s unlawful tariffs. Our amicus brief ex

plained that President Trump doesn’t have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to single-handedly set global tariffs. As CAC Legal Fellow Simon Chin explained after oral argument, “The Government argues that when Congress passed IEEPA, in 1977, it carried forward authority over tariffs from an older law called the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). But as Neal Katyal, counsel for the private challengers, emphasized at oral argument when citing our brief, a 1933 amendment to TWEA severed that law from its original war powers foundations.”

The stakes of this case are high, as CAC President Elizabeth Wydra emphasized in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. As Elizabeth explained, the Court has “so far, in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs. This will be a test of whether they will actually be the check that the Constitution envisions on the Executive.”

Among Trump’s many other disturbing power grabs has been his deployment of the National Guard in American cities. CAC is fighting back in courts from coast to coast, filing amicus briefs against Trump’s unlawful use of the National Guard in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.

Most recently, CAC filed a brief in the Supreme Court explaining why it should deny the government’s request to stay a district court injunction blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. Our brief explains that Martin v. Mott, a case arising out of the War of 1812, doesn’t insulate the President’s deployment decision from judicial review.

Because the Trump administration relies on Mott in claiming that courts can’t review its decision to deploy the Guard, CAC’s historical research has been a helpful resource in setting the record straight. Our brief was cited as providing a valuable perspective in Slate magazine and the One First newsletter. And when Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, seemingly claimed that Trump had unreviewable “plenary power,” CAC’s Deputy Chief Counsel Brian Frazelle was quick to explain that he was “flat wrong.”

With both the Los Angeles National guard case and the consolidated tariffs cases before the Supreme Court, CAC’s historical research provides key context and insight for the Justices. As Elizabeth suggested, now is the Supreme Court’s chance to show it can serve as a check on the Trump administration’s lawless actions.

Appalachian Voices v. Environmental Protection Agency — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether the Trump administration can unilaterally terminate an entire mandatory grant program created by Congress. Our brief argues that the Constitution’s separation of powers prohibits the President from unilaterally withholding federal funds based on disagreement with congressional policy, and because the Trump administration unilaterally terminated a mandatory grant program, the executive branch violated the Constitution’s separation of powers. C. Circuit Court of Appeals, brief filed November 3.

League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President — WIN — The D.C. District Court held that President Trump’s executive order requiring proof of citizenship on the Federal Form for registering voters violated the separation of powers. Echoing our brief, the court observed that the Elections Clause “provides that Congress—not the President—is the check on States’ authority to regulate federal elections.” C. District Court, decision rendered October 31.

Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections — The Supreme Court is considering whether President Trump has the legal authority to single-handedly impose tariffs. Our brief responds to a historical argument made in support of the tariffs—namely, that the relevant federal law incorporates a traditional presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime that traces back to the nineteenth century and was first codified in the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA)—explaining why this narrative is unsound at every step. Supreme Court, brief filed October 24.

Illinois v. Trump— WIN — In October 2025, the Seventh Circuit denied the administration’s motion for a stay, leaving in place a district court order that prevents troops from deploying in Chicago. In doing so, the Seventh Circuit adopted the reasoning of CAC’s amicus brief to conclude that Martin v. Mott does not foreclose judicial review. The Trump administration subsequently asked the Supreme Court to stay the district court’s order, and CAC filed an amicus brief opposing the administration’s application, reiterating our arguments about why courts can review the President’s decisions to mobilize the National Guard. That application is currently pending. Seventh Circuit, brief filed October 12, decision rendered October 16, brief filed in Supreme Court October 20.

Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto v. HHS — WIN — In a case challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful decision to cut off funding for legal services for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, the Ninth Circuit denied the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. The Court addressed—and rejected—the government’s jurisdictional argument. Echoing our brief, the Court understood the Plaintiffs to challenge the government’s failure to comply with the TVPRA’s mandate, rather than raise a breach-of-contract claim. Ninth Circuit, decision rendered October 10.

Grundmann v. Trump — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether Donald Trump’s attempted firing of the Chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority was illegal. Our brief explains why long-established practice has placed the validity of multimember independent agencies like the FLRA beyond doubt, and also demonstrates that the text and history of the Constitution further underscore the legitimacy of multimember independent agencies. C. Circuit, brief filed October 10.

Green Party MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns said she was ""really worried"" about Monday's announcement.
Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.
There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.
Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".","The government's plans to fast-track the deportation of illegal migrants and a major overhaul of human rights law have been described as ""inhumane"".

Green Party MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns said she was ""really worried"" about Monday's announcement.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood detailed sweeping reforms of the UK's immigration policy, meaning anyone granted asylum will be returned home if their country is deemed safe in the future.

Addressing the House of Commons, the minister said she had a ""moral duty"" to fix the ""broken asylum system"" and ""unite what is today a divided country"".

Chowns responded: ""The right to seek asylum for someone fleeing violence in their home country... is a basic principle of international law and it's also a basic principle of our shared humanity.

""And it appears what the government is trying to do is really lean into this whole narrative that all of the problems in the country are to do with people coming over in small boats.

""It's completely false and it's deeply, deeply concerning.""

Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.

It would mean only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, would be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

And the UK will also join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9b0f/live/617f15c0-c3de-11f0-bbb8-f506e20a7d44.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:59:55.254946

Dudek tells WIRED that though there had been agreements to share data with DHS before—mostly Social Security numbers—the scope of the recent SORN seems unprecedented.
Normally, says Dudek, DHS is able to check certain Social Security numbers against SSA data, within a limited scope.
The government also previously held that Social Security data shouldn’t be used for citizenship purposes.
For instance, if someone receives a Social Security number and later becomes a naturalized citizen, Social Security data would not necessarily reflect that change.","Last week, the Social Security Administration (SSA) quietly updated a public notice to reveal that the agency would be sharing “citizenship and immigration information” with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This data sharing was already happening: WIRED reported in April that the Trump administration had already started pooling sensitive data from across the government for the purpose of immigration enforcement.

This public notice issued by SSA makes that official, months after the fact. The notice is known as a system of record notice (SORN), a document that outlines how an agency will share the data it has, with whom, and for what purpose. This notice is required under the Privacy Act of 1974. Normally, SORNs are issued before any data is shared between agencies, giving the public and government officials sufficient time to offer comment. But WIRED found that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was pulling in data from across DHS, SSA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and state voter data, among other sources, based largely on the US Citizenship and Immigration Service’s (USCIS) Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database.

“There are laws that require the government to inform the public about their use of various kinds of databases and other surveillance technologies,” says Adam Schwartz, privacy litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital privacy and free speech. “If the government starts using the database and does not put out the appropriate disclosure and then later does put out that appropriate disclosure, they still have violated the law.”

The Trump administration has gone to drastic lengths to remake the government in its image. A core component of this has been an effort to vacuum up large swathes of data from across federal agencies, many of which were never meant to be comingled. This has frequently happened regardless of the laws, norms, or procedures that normally govern the access and sharing of sensitive data. The SORN from SSA is just the latest confirmation of exactly how much data is being shared in ways experts tell WIRED is “unprecedented.”

Much of this data sharing begins with misinformation about the data at hand. In the early days of the Trump administration, Elon Musk seized on a misunderstanding of SSA’s data to spread the claim that 150-year-old people were receiving benefits. They weren’t, but DOGE capitalized on the idea that the SSA’s systems were inefficient and fraudulent to burrow into the agency’s data and technology systems. In April, reporting from The New York Times found that in an effort to force immigrants to self-deport, the administration was adding them to the SSA’s database of dead people, effectively meaning that their Social Security numbers could not be used to get jobs or access government services. As part of the effort to combine disparate data across the government to verify citizenship and surveil immigrants, DHS recently published a different but related SORN that effectively transforms SAVE into a voter verification system, which experts also warned could be bypassing the requirements of the Privacy Act.

Leland Dudek, who served as acting commissioner for the Social Security Administration between February and May 2025, led the agency when members of DOGE first appeared. Dudek says he was initially supportive of DOGE and acted as a bridge between SSA staff and members of the DOGE team before becoming disillusioned.

Dudek tells WIRED that though there had been agreements to share data with DHS before—mostly Social Security numbers—the scope of the recent SORN seems unprecedented. Normally, says Dudek, DHS is able to check certain Social Security numbers against SSA data, within a limited scope.

But he says that the SSA does not have a way to deactivate a Social Security number, meaning that it can’t be used to allow someone to work or collect government payments, unless that person has died. Dudek says what appears to have changed within the new SORN is that there is now “a special indicator code that identifies types of questionable data or special circumstances concerning an application for an SSN.” This, he says, appears to mean that there would now be a way to essentially flag a Social Security number and take it out of use, without marking them as deceased.

“You can literally cut off anyone's financial life you want, and you don't need to use the death master file,” he says.

President Donald Trump has focused heavily on cracking down on immigration since his return to office. The administration has canceled Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from countries in Africa and Latin America; deployed the National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement; and claims to have deported more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants. The administration has also sought to collect more data on immigrants, particularly those using government services like housing assistance or food benefits, and Republicans have renewed an effort to add a citizenship question to the US Census. Part of this effort also appears to be the creation of a national citizenship database.

“It seems that DHS was dead set on creating a national citizenship data bank, and for whatever reason, they determined that the Social Security Administration had the largest set of citizenship data across any agency in the government,” says Nikhel Sus, deputy counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). “The American people had no opportunity to weigh in on this dramatic new expansion of the SAVE system before the government illegally repurposed Social Security Administration data.”

CREW is part of a group of organizations currently suing the US government, claiming that the Trump administration is unlawfully consolidating sensitive data across agencies. “These belated systems of records notices only confirm after the fact that the government has run roughshod over the law,” says Sus.

The government also previously held that Social Security data shouldn’t be used for citizenship purposes. In a 2023 letter from the SSA to the Fair Elections Center, a nonprofit focused on voting rights, SSA lawyer Jessica Vollmer wrote that “while SSA records provide an indication of citizenship, they do not provide definitive information on U.S. citizenship,” and that “SSA does not have citizenship information for all individuals who have been issued an SSN.” That authority lies with DHS.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin tells WIRED that “USCIS remains dedicated to securing the nation’s electoral process—by allowing states to efficiently verify voter eligibility, we are reinforcing the principle that America’s elections are reserved exclusively for American citizens. We encourage all federal, state, and local agencies to use the SAVE program.”

SSA did not respond to a request for comment.

“[I am] not aware of something happening on this scale, where there was a total disregard for the required procedures of the Privacy Act,” says John Davisson, director of litigation and senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which is also part of the suit against the government.

Davisson also says that the legal statute that the SORN cites as justification—one that dates back to when immigration was handled by the now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)—does not actually support unrestricted data sharing with DHS. In a 1999 opinion, the Department of Justice limited the kinds of restrictions agencies could put on sharing data with law enforcement. “It essentially says you cannot obstruct an otherwise lawful disclosure of citizenship- or immigration-related information. It does not actually give the Social Security Administration an affirmative grant of authority to disclose information outside of the strictures of the Privacy Act,” says Davisson.

But Davisson says that doesn’t mean there are no restrictions at all. “This administration has attempted to subvert that reading of the statute and to claim that it has carte blanche to obtain from any agency, anywhere in government, whatever immigration or citizenship information it wants.”

Experts tell WIRED that because Social Security data was never collected with the goal of being used for citizenship or immigration purposes, it is also likely to include inaccuracies.

For instance, if someone receives a Social Security number and later becomes a naturalized citizen, Social Security data would not necessarily reflect that change. “There are a lot of reliability concerns when you match disparate data sets across agencies, especially when the data was collected for different purposes,” says Sus. “You could have mismatches. You could have the wrong people's records being incorrectly linked together.” This could mean that people who are legally in or are citizens of the United States could lose their ability to vote or work due to data matching errors.

Dudek, like Sus, says that SSA data is not a reliable way to determine citizenship and could risk disenfranchising people. Dudek says that in order to combine data responsibly, experts would need to clean and cross-match it across other data sources to reduce the risk of false negatives or positives, and agencies would need to disclose risks or biases within the data itself.

“Is that being done?” says Dudek. “I'm not aware of it being done, and that concerns me.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/69138e7642f0d7fe529d4a38/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Social-Security-Data-Officially-Being-Shared-with-DHS-to-Target-Immigrants-Politics-2215825808.jpg",N,,2025-11-18 11:00:06.522831

“This is yet another breach of trust that will push families back into the shadows and deter them from seeking health care.”","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moved late Monday to make it easier for immigration officers to deny green cards to those who use public benefits like Medicaid or food stamps.

The latest iteration of the so-called public charge rule would strike down the Biden-era version of the rule, which returned the country to long-standing criteria that allowed rejections of green cards for those “primarily dependent” on government assistance, such as those who received cash assistance or help with nursing home care.

The rule does not revert to the 2019 rule crafted under the first Trump administration that allowed immigration officers to reject applicants who used any number of public programs.

But critics say the lack of guidance opens the door to immigration officers arbitrarily rejecting applicants while discouraging immigrants from asking for assistance.

The Monday proposed rule described former President Biden’s policy as a “straitjacket [on] DHS officers,” barring them from considering “all factors and information relevant to an alien’s likelihood at any time of becoming a public charge.”

“Consideration of these, in the totality of the circumstances, will allow officers to more accurately assess an alien’s likelihood at any time of becoming a public charge using their good judgment,” the rule states.

The proposed rule was widely panned by health care groups and immigration advocates.

“By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law. The proposal’s invitation to political bias, coupled with the administration’s out-of-control enforcement assault on immigrant families, make this proposal even more dangerous,” said Adriana Cadena, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition, in a statement.

“The chaos and fear that drive the chilling effect are much worse than last time, so the impact could be even bigger.”

Roughly 1 in 5 Americans are enrolled in Medicaid, while about 12 percent receive food stamps.

The programs are available only to those who are lawfully present in the United States, and with Medicaid, migrants are only able to receive care if their state has agreed to cover the cost.

“The administration is forcing lawfully present immigrant families with low incomes to make impossible choices between preserving their immigration status and ensuring that their kids have what they need to grow and thrive. We know from experience that this policy will reach far beyond those directly covered, harming countless U.S. citizen children,” said George Kelemen with Share Our Strength, which runs the No Kid Hungry Campaign.

“Many families will withdraw from the programs for which they’re eligible for—programs that help feed, house and keep them healthy. This means more kids in America will be at risk of hunger, of losing stable housing, of getting sick.”

The proposed rule says the Trump administration will promulgate a new public charge rule at a later date.

But advocates argue the lack of clear guidance will prompt those reviewing green cards to unnecessarily reject applicants.

“This move is designed to create confusion and uncertainty. The courts have determined that public charge has a very narrow meaning and that it does not apply to benefits like health care that everyone inevitably needs at some point in their life. But now, immigration officials are sure to make inconsistent and arbitrary decisions, forcing families to guess at what programs may or may not count,” said Sarah Grusin, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program, in a statement.

Kate WhannelPolitical reporter

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has defended sweeping changes to the UK's asylum system, telling MPs the current situation is ""out of control and unfair"".

Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: ""If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.""

Under the plans, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped ""safe and legal routes"" into the UK will be created.

Some Labour MPs expressed concerns, with Nadia Whittome calling the plans ""dystopian"" and ""shameful"", but the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome.

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the proposals were ""positive baby steps"". However, she warned that unless the UK left the European Convention on Human Rights, Mahmood's efforts would be ""doomed to fail"".

Badenoch urged the home secretary to work with the Conservatives, saying she may find their votes would ""come in handy"" if Labour backbenchers did not support the changes.

Over the past year, the government has been forced to backtrack on some of its policies - including cuts to welfare and the winter fuel payment - after objections from its own MPs.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson welcomed the introduction of new safe and legal routes - but accused the home secretary of ""stoking division by using immoderate language"".

Mahmood hit back angrily, telling the MP: ""I wish I had the privilege of walking around this country and not seeing the division that the issue of migration and the asylum system is creating across this country.""

She said she regularly faced racist abuse - using a racial slur she said is used against her - as well as being told to ""go back home"".

So far, around 20 Labour MPs have criticised the plans. Whittome, the MP for Nottingham East, accused the government of ""ripping up the rights and protections of people who've endured unimaginable trauma"".

Folkestone and Hythe MP, and immigration lawyer, Tony Vaughan said making refugee status temporary would create a ""situation of perpetual limbo and alienation"".

Richard Burgon said the measures were ""morally wrong"" and would ""push away Labour voters"".

""Why not recognise that now rather than in another few months and have to make a U-turn,"" the MP for Leeds East said.

Other Labour MPs expressed support for Mahmood. Chris Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live the system had to be fair ""otherwise it'll collapse, and there's nothing progressive about letting that happen"".

MP for Blackley and Middleton South, Graham Stringer, said the home secretary was ""going down the right track"".

He said she would reach a ""compromise"" with Labour MPs but added: ""It might all be for naught if we don't get out of the European Convention on Human Rights.""

Speaking to the BBC later, Mahmood said changing the system was a ""moral mission"" for her.

""If we don't win this argument… we will lose public support for having an asylum system at all and therefore we'll lose something brilliant about this country.

""I'm not willing to put public support for having an asylum system at risk.""

She acknowledged that some Labour MPs had concerns but insisted ""the vast majority of my colleagues agree with me"".

So far this year 111,800 people have claimed asylum in the UK - 39% arrived in a small boat, while 37% arrived by legal means before claiming asylum.

The government says its plans are aimed at reducing the number of people coming to the UK and increasing removals of people who do not have a legal right to be in the country.

The Home Office published the changes in a 30-page document and a few hours later Mahmood presented them to the House of Commons.

Under the proposals, people granted refugee status will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, with their status reviewed every 30 months - half the current time period.

People could be returned to their home country, when it is deemed safe to do so.

The amount of time refugees will have to be in the UK before being allowed to apply for permanent residence will be quadrupled from five years to 20.

Families with children who have been refused asylum will be offered incentives to leave but could be forcibly removed if they refuse to go voluntarily.

Asylum seekers with income or assets would have to contribute to the cost of their stay in the UK.

Mahmood told MPs this would ""end the absurdity where an asylum seeker receiving £800 a month from his family and an Audi was receiving free housing at the taxpayer's expense and the courts judged we could do nothing about it"".

Home Office sources have pushed back against suggestions asylum seekers could have items of sentimental value, such as wedding rings, confiscated to pay for their accommodation.

In order to make it easier to remove failed asylum seekers, the government intends to change the way the European Convention of Human Rights and Modern Slavery Act is applied.

Mahmood also threatened to stop granting visas to people from three African countries - Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia - unless those governments improved co-operation on deportations.

Setting out her plans for capped safe and legal routes, Mahmood said voluntary and community organisations would be given ""greater involvement"" in receiving and supporting new arrivals.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4064/live/42051ef0-c3ee-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 15:58:07.840201

He also worried that the United States had isolated itself as its education system weakened, dulling the nation’s global competitive edge.","As the Trump administration seeks to remake the immigration system and deports tens of thousands of people, many immigrants are more scared about living in the United States, and yet their resolve to remain here is largely unchanged.

A new national survey of immigrants in the country — both documented and undocumented, and varying widely in how and when they arrived — found that about half of all immigrants say they feel less safe since President Trump took office. The survey was done by The New York Times and KFF, a nonprofit that conducts polling and research about health policy.

Among the immigrants surveyed — whether they are here legally or not, or have been naturalized as citizens — concern that they or a family member could be detained or deported has risen significantly since before Mr. Trump’s return to power.

Still, large majorities also say their own future, and that of their children, remains bright, with the concept of the American dream retaining its powerful appeal. About 70 percent said that if they could go back in time, they would still make the choice to migrate to the United States.

The survey captured a snapshot of immigrant life against a backdrop of enormous change in the United States, with many people standing by their choice to come — sometimes illegally — even as their image of the country as a welcoming place has been shaken. Immigrants feel that, across every measure, they are better off in the United States compared with the living conditions that propelled them to leave their homelands.

The survey, of 1,805 immigrants across the country, is a broad look at a group for which there is often very little data to understand their views and experiences, given that the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask specifics about immigration status. The group is also a small share of the population and too difficult to reach to be measured with accuracy by most surveys.

[Read more about how this survey was conducted here and see all the questions that were asked here.]

The poll reflected the breadth of immigrants in the United States, including a significant share who find Mr. Trump’s immigration policies “necessary” and some who are “proud” of increased enforcement. For many Americans, the archetype of an immigrant may be someone who has recently arrived in the country. But a vast majority of immigrants living in the United States — more than 70 percent — have been in the country for 10 or more years, according to the available data from the Census Bureau. A little more than half are U.S. citizens, and 53 percent say they speak English exclusively or at least very well.

The survey found that 60 percent of immigrants, including a majority of those with legal status, say that the United States used to be a “great place” for immigrants but no longer is — a view that is especially common among those from Latin America and Asia. European immigrants were likelier to say that the United States was a great place for immigrants.

Marcos Herrera, 42, moved to Florida from Chile in 2009 to join his Puerto Rican girlfriend. He hoped to continue his studies in mechanical engineering but could not afford to finish his degree and now works as a custodian at Walt Disney World.

Though he became a legal permanent resident and feels mostly safe, he said that he has watched with terror and sadness as other Latinos in Florida have been picked up and deported after years of working hard in the country.

“In the past, there was no fear like there is now,” he said. “Families should not be separated.”

Even as the current view of the country has dimmed for many — amid raids, anti-immigrant rhetoric and masked agents that now permeate American life — their commitment to stay has not.

The share of immigrants, 70 percent, who said that they would still make the choice to migrate to the United States is largely unchanged from two years ago, before Mr. Trump’s push for mass deportations.

For most, especially those who escaped violence, poverty and repression, their view appears to be a matter of perspective.

Large majorities say that their financial situation is better in the United States than the country they left (70 percent), their employment situation is better (65 percent) and educational opportunities are better for themselves and their children (74 percent). Slightly fewer, though still about half, say that their safety is better because they came to the United States.

Most immigrants expressed optimism about their future in the United States, regardless of Mr. Trump’s approach to immigration enforcement. Nearly 80 percent, including a majority of those who are undocumented, said that they were on their way to achieving the American dream or had achieved it already.

“People often compare their decision about moving, or not, compared to where they were,” said Pawan H. Dhingra, a professor at Amherst College who researches immigration and was not affiliated with the survey. So it was not necessarily surprising, he said, that immigrants were both “feeling less safe and still feeling like the American dream is possible.”

Mr. Trump has moved decisively — and divisively — to fulfill his campaign promise to impose a hard-line immigration agenda, after winning in 2024 with support from voters who shifted to the right amid scenes of disorder at the border and an influx of migrants in large cities.

The president has ended paths to asylum, deported people to countries where they are not from and deployed agents in a made-for-TV display of force. The scope of the crackdown has already tested voters who support Mr. Trump’s deportation goals but believe that his methods have been too aggressive.

The share of immigrants who worry that a family member could be detained or deported jumped significantly, to 41 percent, up from 26 percent two years ago, during more lenient Biden-era immigration policies. Concern about deportation has grown since 2023 among citizens and noncitizens, among those here legally and those who are not.

Roughly half of immigrants — including 82 percent of undocumented immigrants — said that they were afraid about what was happening with immigration enforcement; a similar share said they felt angry.

“I feel we had the American dream, until everything in January started to fall apart,” said Leticia Anaya, 60, a Mexican mother who became a U.S. citizen in 2001 and lives in Aurora, Colo.

Ms. Anaya, whose father crossed the border in the 1970s and sponsored her for a green card in 1990, said that her family had made a plan when they heard of U.S. citizens being detained by federal agents. They stored all their documents, including naturalization papers, birth certificates and passports, in a “special box” tucked in a closet at home, she said.

“It’s not like I am very afraid, but it could happen,” said Ms. Anaya, who said she lost her job with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs because of Mr. Trump’s mass layoffs. “I look Hispanic. I have an accent.”

Still, 40 percent of immigrants say that they feel Mr. Trump’s enforcement tactics are necessary, and 15 percent say that the tactics made them feel proud.

Roughly 30 percent of undocumented immigrants say increased enforcement is necessary.

Those who say increased enforcement is needed are disproportionately U.S. citizens, many of whom have been here for decades, the survey found.

“Trump is trying to make this country more valuable instead of bringing anybody that wants to come in and do whatever they want,” said Gustavo Rojas, 42, a citizen who came to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1990 and lives in Boston. “I just think that Biden was slipping too much. Way too much.”

Mr. Rojas, who is unemployed and identifies as a Republican, said that he had struggled to start a career after high school and tried to join the Marines but was discharged because of a schizophrenia diagnosis. He said he believed that he was better off in the United States because of what he described as generous government assistance.

“I think the country’s going in the right direction,” Mr. Rojas said of the immigration crackdown. “It’s not affecting me at all.”

Other surveys have shown that Americans have grown skeptical about the future of the American dream, with 53 percent of respondents in a 2024 Pew Research Center survey saying that it is still possible.

The new survey found that most immigrants — regardless of their immigration status — feel that their children will have a better life. A similar share expressed this in 2023, before Mr. Trump took office.

Sami Takieddine, 46, was born in Britain to parents who fled Lebanon’s civil war in the 1970s. The family moved to the United States in 1980, when Mr. Takieddine was an infant, and found a foothold in New Jersey and Georgia.

Over four decades, Mr. Takieddine notched one milestone after another: He became a citizen, bought a home, sent his two teenage children to good schools and climbed the ranks to become a director at a technology company in Atlanta.

“I think that America stands for, ‘Do good things, be good at what you do, be good to other people and you can really succeed,’” Mr. Takieddine said, adding that the American dream still exists.

Huayun Geng, 49, a software engineer living in Washington State, said that although he had found success in the United States, he worried about the future of his two children, ages 16 and 8.

Mr. Geng, who emigrated from China in 2012 on an H-1B visa and became a legal permanent resident in 2020, said that the country had been made politically unstable by the divide between Democrats and Republicans.

He also worried that the United States had isolated itself as its education system weakened, dulling the nation’s global competitive edge.

“I’m living a better life myself now in U.S. over when I was in China, but I feel like it’s getting harder and harder for people who just came in to achieve the same kind of dreams as I did,” Mr. Geng said. “Now, when I’m looking at my kids, I feel like it will be very hard for them.”

Here are the key things to know about the The New York Times/KFF survey of immigrants:

The survey was conducted among 1,805 adult immigrants nationwide from Aug. 28 to Oct. 20.

The poll includes immigrants who are U.S. citizens, those with visas or permanent residency and those who are likely undocumented, who were identified as not being citizens or having valid visas.

The survey was conducted on the telephone, via the mail and online, and could be taken in English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Haitian-Creole. The survey was designed by researchers at KFF in collaboration with The Times, and was administered by SSRS, a public opinion research company. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked here.

To further ensure that the results reflect all immigrants, not just those willing to take a poll, the poll gives more weight to respondents from demographic groups that would otherwise be underrepresented among survey respondents, like immigrants without a college degree and those who do not speak English proficiently.

The margin of sampling error for all immigrants is about plus or minus three percentage points. In theory, this means that the results should generally reflect the views of the overall population of immigrants, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. The margin of error is larger for subgroups.

What is the difference between a Dillon Rule and Home Rule city?

Can a city like Charlotte restrict ICE or Border Patrol from accessing city data?","Federal Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Charlotte have sparked widespread concern, especially after reports of racial profiling, detentions, and property damage.

Why it matters: Cities have little authority to intervene. North Carolina's Dillon Rule limits their ability to curb federal enforcement, even as community fear grows.

Charlotte leaders met Monday to clarify what local government can legally do and what limits state law imposes.

What legal authority does the city have over ICE and Border Patrol?

The city has limited authority to restrict federal operations due to state preemption under North Carolina's Dillon Rule structure.

""All of the power originates from the General Assembly,"" Charlotte city attorney Andrea Leslie-Fite said at Monday's city council meeting. ""City Council only has as much power as is explicitly granted or inherently granted by state law.""

That means cities like Charlotte cannot issue executive orders or create ""sanctuary"" policies like some Home Rule cities, such as Chicago.

What is the difference between a Dillon Rule and Home Rule city?

A Dillon Rule city like Charlotte can only take actions that the state government explicitly allows by law.

A Home Rule city like Chicago, however, has broad authority to govern itself unless the state specifically prohibits something.

In short, Dillon Rule limits local power; Home Rule grants it.

Can the city block ICE or Border Patrol from using city property?

Not entirely.

Restricted city areas (like offices or secured zones) require a judicial warrant to access.

Public areas (like lobbies or meeting rooms) remain open.

Can a city like Charlotte restrict ICE or Border Patrol from accessing city data?

No. Most city records are public under state law.

What should residents do if confronted by agents or if someone impersonates them?

CMPD is not involved in federal immigration operations and does not assist ICE with civil warrants.

Residents can call 911 or CMPD if they are unsure whether someone is a legitimate federal agent.

What about North Carolina's new immigration law?

House Bill 318, which took effect Oct. 1, 2025, requires sheriffs to determine the immigration status of people arrested for certain crimes and to hold them up to 48 hours for ICE pickup.

""It codifies that relationship and creates an expectation for jail administrators … not the city,"" Fite said

That means CMPD and the city have no role in enforcing detainers — that's under Mecklenburg County Sheriff Gary McFadden.

What's next: On Nov. 24, Charlotte City Council will vote on a measure directing the city manager to quickly deploy short-term funding, in coordination with Mecklenburg County, to local organizations helping residents affected by ICE and Border Patrol activity.

In addition to the funding motion, the committee also voted unanimously to direct the city attorney to develop an educational campaign to inform residents of their rights and available resources.",https://images.axios.com/oHrD2JW_2Mx9SgkmG2KQroAH0eQ=/0x39:3446x1978/1366x768/2025/11/17/1763421035447.jpeg,N,,2025-11-18 11:00:11.961158

Mayor Jonathan Varden said ICE contacted the city two weeks ago to notify officials of a joint operation with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency that included multiple driver’s license checkpoints across Chilton County. ICE also asked whether Jemison’s City Hall Auditorium could be used to process individuals if necessary.

“The city has historically cooperated with local, state, and federal agencies,” Varden said in a statement. “All our laws should be enforced equally across the board, without prejudice, with grace and humility.” Police confirmed the operation took place Tuesday, Nov. 11, and is no longer active.

The mayor acknowledged a protest scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 18. He said the city supports residents’ right to peacefully protest and is working with organizers to ensure the safety of all participants.

Organizers say the protests have led to division and threats within the community. Protest organizer Irbin Hernandez said, “Once we started it, we started to see so much division in the city, like the racist people came at us, death threats all types of stuff and this isn't just a racial problem, this is a people problem. This is a problem we have imbedded in the south.”

Co-organizer Stacy Serrano said some residents are now fearful of contacting police. “There's a lot of community who is scared to even call the police department because they're scared, they're like they're working with ICE. If I call because somebody is breaking into my house what if they come and get me?” she said.

The mayor called the online threat “appalling” and said there is “zero tolerance for such threats and intimidation tactics.” An investigation is underway, and the city plans to release a full statement once the case concludes.

Despite the tension, organizers say the protest is intended to promote unity. Hernandez said, “We just want to create peace and unity in the town and the state and every city and hopefully everybody hears us.”",https://abc3340.com/resources/media/88820eb4-45e3-4667-b4df-5f803f85d37a-jemison_municipal_complex.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 11:00:17.873517

The city’s ordinance, known as the Boston Trust Act, also doesn’t stand as an obstacle to federal authorities conducting enforcement actions.

The federal law doesn’t create a mandate for information sharing or honoring civil detainer requests, according to the motion.","A Trump administration attempt to strike down Boston’s sanctuary city law can’t overcome constitutional hurdles protecting localities from federal incursions, the city said in filings asking a judge to toss the government’s lawsuit.

“Here, Boston has declined” the invitation to assist the federal government’s immigration crackdown, “and the Tenth Amendment protects the City’s authority to do so,” Boston said in its Monday filing.

The Justice Department had said Boston’s Trust Act raised its own constitutional issues, arguing in the complaint that the non-cooperation amounted to illegal obstruction of immigration efforts by strictly limiting the city’s cooperation with federal authorities. The lawsuit is part of the administration’s broad immigration enforcement efforts and push to accelerate the rate of deportations from the US.

The bid to spike the Department of Justice’s sanctuary city lawsuit urged the court to find the local ordinance is protected by the Tenth Amendment, which says all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are reserved to the states. A federal judge invoked that protection in July when dismissing a similar action filed against Illinois, the city of Chicago and Cook County.

The DOJ has also targeted New York City, Los Angeles, and Rochester, NY with sanctuary city lawsuits.

Boston said the Trump administration is wrong in arguing that the federal Immigration and Nationality Act mandates local participation in enforcement efforts. The city’s ordinance, known as the Boston Trust Act, also doesn’t stand as an obstacle to federal authorities conducting enforcement actions.

Trust Act

Boston enacted the Trust Act in 2014, limiting what information city police will share and denying federal officers access to suspects in city custody who are thought to be in the country illegally. The measure was designed to promote trust between local police and immigrant communities.

The ordinance preceded the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s 2017 Lunn v. Commonwealth ruling that found municipalities have no authority to honor civil detainer requests that immigration officials issue asking localities to detain people until they can be taken into custody by federal authorities.

The Trust Act says local police also can’t ask people their immigration status, give detainees’ release dates to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, make arrests based on ICE administrative warrants or perform functions of an immigration officer.

The law does allow police to provide criminal history information to the Department of Homeland Security Investigations division of ICE and collaborate on investigations related to human trafficking, child exploitation, drug and weapons trafficking, and cybercrimes.

In 2024, Boston police denied 15 civil immigration detainer requests and neither detained nor transferred any individuals to ICE custody, according to city records.

No Obligation

Boston told the court that the Immigration and Nationality Act doesn’t oblige states or localities to help the government in its immigration duties, and courts have ruled that invitations to assist in those federal duties can be declined without amounting to obstruction.

The federal law doesn’t create a mandate for information sharing or honoring civil detainer requests, according to the motion. The city’s decision to not engage in either “reflects its choice of how to deploy limited resources and is not an obstacle to the enforcement of federal law.”

The city also rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the ordinance amounts to illegal regulation of the federal government.

In an emailed statement, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said the city will not “participate in mass deportation.”

“Boston will continue to work with state and federal law enforcement to protect our residents,” Wu added, “but we are challenging this meritless and unconstitutional attack on our local authority.”

Representatives for the DOJ weren’t immediately available for comment.

The city is represented by in-house attorneys and the Public Rights Project.

It is our job – [political content redacted] – to unite where there is division, so we must now build an asylum system for the world as it is.","I will make a statement about how we restore order and control to our borders. I do so as this government publishes the most significant reform to our migration system in modern times.

This country will always offer sanctuary to those fleeing danger, but we must also acknowledge that the world has changed and our asylum system has not changed with it.

Our world is a more volatile, and more mobile, place. Huge numbers are on the move. While some are refugees, others are economic migrants seeking to use, and abuse, our asylum system. Even genuine refugees are passing through other safe countries searching for the most attractive place to seek refuge.

The burden that has fallen on this country has been heavy. 400,000 have sought asylum here in the last 4 years. Over 100,000 people now live in asylum accommodation, and over half of refugees remain on benefits 8 years after they have arrived.

To the British public, who foot the bill, the system feels out of control and unfair. It feels that way, because it is. The pace and scale of change has destabilised communities. It is making our country a more divided place.

There will never be a justification for the violence and racism of a minority, but if we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger, and ends in hatred.

I have no doubt about who we really are in this country. We are open, tolerant and generous. But the public rightly expect that we can determine who enters this country, and who must leave.

To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.

[Political content redacted]

My predecessor as Home Secretary picked up this [political content redacted] inheritance, and rebuilt the foundations of a collapsed asylum system.

Decision making has been restored, with a backlog now 18% lower than when we entered office. Removals have increased – reaching nearly 50,000 under this government.

Immigration enforcement has hit record levels, with over 8,000 arrests in the last year.

The Border Security Bill is progressing through Parliament, and my predecessor struck a historic agreement with the French, which means small boat arrivals can now be sent back to France.

These are vital steps, but we must go further. Today, we have published ‘Restoring Order and Control’, a new statement on our asylum policy.

Its goals are two-fold: firstly, to reduce illegal arrivals into this country, and secondly, to increase removals of those with no right to be here.

It starts by accepting an uncomfortable truth: while asylum claims fall across Europe, they are rising here, and that is because of the comparative generosity of our asylum offer when compared to so many of our European neighbours.

This generosity is a factor that draws people to these shores, on a path that runs through other safe countries. Nearly 40 percent come on small boats and over perilous channel crossings, but a roughly equal number come here legally, via a visitor, work or study visa, and then go on to claim asylum.

They do so because refugee status is the most generous route into this country. An initial grant lasts 5 years, which is then converted, almost automatically, into permanent settled status. In other European countries, things are done differently.

In Denmark, refugee status is temporary, and they provide safety and sanctuary until it is possible for a refugee to return home. In recent years, asylum claims have hit a 40-year low, and now, across Europe, countries are tightening their systems in similar ways.

We must act too. We will do so by making refugee status temporary, not permanent. A grant of refugee status will last 2 and a half years, not 5. It will be renewed only if it is impossible for a refugee to return home. Permanent settlement will now come at 20 years, not 5.

I know this country welcomes people who contribute. For those who want to stay, and are willing and able to, we will create a new ‘work and study’ visa route, solely for refugees, with a quicker path to permanent settlement.

To encourage refugees into work, we will also consult on removing benefits for those who are able to work but choose not to.

Outside of the most exceptional circumstances, family reunion will not be possible, with a refugee only able to bring family over if they have joined a work and study route, and if qualifying tests are met.

While over 50,000 were granted refugee status in the last year, more than 100,000 claimants and failed asylum seekers remain in taxpayer-funded accommodation, and we know that criminal gangs use the prospect of free bed and board to promote their small boat crossings.

We have already announced that we will empty asylum hotels by the end of the Parliament, and we are exploring a number of large military sites as an alternative.

We will now also remove the 2005 legislation that created a ‘duty’ to support asylum seekers, reverting to a legal ‘power’ to do so instead. While we will continue to support those who play by the rules, those who do not – be that through criminality or antisocial behaviour – can have their support removed. We will also remove our duty to support those who have a right to work.

It is right that those who do receive support, pay for it if they can, so those with income or assets will have to contribute to the cost of their stay. This will end the absurdity that we currently experience. Where an asylum seeker receiving £800 each month from his family, and who had recently acquired an Audi, was receiving free housing at the taxpayers’ expense, and the courts judged we could do nothing about it.

These measures are designed to tackle the pull factors that draw people to this country, but reducing the number of arrivals is just half of the story. We must also enforce our rules and remove those who have no right to be here. This will mean restarting removals to countries where they have been paused.

In recent months, we have begun voluntary removal of failed asylum seekers to Syria once again; however, there are still many failed asylum seekers here from Syria, most of whom fled a regime that has since been toppled. Other countries are planning to enforce removals, and we will follow suit. Where a failed asylum seeker cannot be returned home, we will also continue to explore the possibility of return hubs, with negotiations ongoing.

We must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are. Today, we are not removing family groups – even when we know that their home country is perfectly safe. There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims.

This is true despite an existing returns agreement, and that Albania is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. So, we will now begin the removal of families. Where possible, we will encourage a voluntary return, but where an enforced return is necessary, that is what we will do.

Where the barrier to a return is not the individual, nor the UK Government, but the receiving country, we will take action.

I can announce today that we have told Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Namibia that if they do not comply with international rules and norms we will impose visa penalties on them. And I am sending a wider message here: unless other countries heed this lesson, further sanctions will follow.

Much of the delay in our removals, however, comes from the sclerotic nature of our own system. In March of this year, the appeals backlog stood at 51,000 cases. This government has already increased judicial sitting days, but reform is required, so we will create a new appeals body, staffed by professional independent adjudicators, and we will ensure there is early legal representation available to advise claimants and ensure their issues are properly considered.

Cases with a low chance of success will be fast-tracked, and claimants will have just one opportunity to claim and one to appeal, ending the merry-go-round of claims and appeals that frustrate so many removals.

While some barriers to removal are the result of process, others are substantive issues related to the law itself. There is no doubt that the expanded interpretation of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights has contributed.

This is particularly true of Article 8: the right to a family life. The courts have adopted an ever-expanding interpretation of this right.

As a result, many people have been allowed to come to this country, when they would otherwise have had no right to, and we have been unable to remove others when the case for doing so seems overwhelming.

This includes cases like an arsonist, sentenced to 5 years in prison, whose deportation was blocked on the grounds that his relationship with his sibling may suffer.

More than half of those detained are now delaying or blocking their removal by raising a last-minute rights claim.

Article 8 is a qualified right: that means we are not prevented from removing individuals or refusing an application to move to the UK if it is ‘in the public interest’. To narrow Article 8 rights, we will therefore make 3 important changes, in both domestic law and our immigration rules.

Firstly, we will define what, exactly, a family is – narrowing this down to parents and their children.

Secondly, we will define ’the public interest’ test so the default becomes a removal or refusal, with Article 8 rights only permissible in the most exceptional circumstances.

Thirdly, we will tighten where Article 8 claims can be heard, ensuring only those who are living in the UK can lodge a claim, rather than their family members overseas, and that all claims are heard first by the Home Office and not in a courtroom.

We will also pursue international reform of a second element of the European Convention: the application of Article 3 – the prohibition on torture and inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment.

We will never return anyone to be tortured in their home country, but the definition of ‘degrading treatment’ has expanded into the realm of the ridiculous.

Today, we have criminals we seek to deport, but discover we cannot because the prisons in their home country have cells that are deemed too small, or even mental health provision that is not as good as our own.

As Article 3 is an absolute right, a public interest test cannot be applied. For that reason, we are seeking reform at the Council of Europe, and we do so alongside international partners who have raised similar concerns. But it is not just international law that binds us.

According to data from 2022, over 40% of those detained for removal claimed they were modern-day slaves. This well-intentioned law is being abused by those who seek to frustrate a legitimate removal.

So, I will bring forward legislation that tightens the modern slavery system to ensure that it protects those it was designed for, and not those who seek to abuse it.

Taken together Madam Deputy Speaker, these are significant reforms. They are designed to ensure our asylum system is fit for the modern world, and that we retain public consent for the very idea of providing refuge.

We will always be a country that offers protection to those fleeing peril, just as we did, in recent years, when Ukraine was invaded, when Afghanistan was evacuated, and when we repatriated Hong Kongers.

For that reason, as order and control is restored, we will open new, capped, safe and legal routes into this country. These will make sponsorship the primary means by which we resettle refugees, with voluntary and community organisations given greater involvement, to both receive refugees and support them, working within caps set by government.

We will also create a new route for displaced students to study in the UK, and another for skilled refugees to work here. Of course, we will always remain flexible to new crises, across the world, as they happen.

I know the British people do not want to close the doors. But until we restore order and control, those who seek to divide us will grow stronger.

It is our job – [political content redacted] – to unite where there is division, so we must now build an asylum system for the world as it is. One that restores order and control. One that opens safe and legal routes to those fleeing danger across the world, and one that sustains our commitment to providing refuge for this generation, and those to come.

I know the country we are. We are open, tolerant and generous. We are the greater Britain that those on this side of the House believe in. Not the littler England that some would wish we would become. These reforms are designed to bring unity, where others seek to divide.

The lawsuit filed Monday argues California's laws violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, under which federal laws take precedence over state laws. The Trump administration also claims the laws threaten the safety of federal officers.

The federal government said in court documents that it ""does not intend to comply.""

""Today we filed a lawsuit to strike down California's unconstitutional law aimed at unmasking the faces of our federal agents, which will allow criminals to dox them,"" Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, wrote on X. ""Unconstitutional laws such as this one further endanger our brave men and women protecting our community.""

A spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the lawsuit in a statement to CBS News.

""If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people's rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,"" spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo wrote. ""We'll see the U.S. Department of Justice in court.""

In September, Newsom signed the No Secret Police Act into law. The measure bans federal, state and local officials from concealing their identity with face coverings while conducting operations.

The California Highway Patrol is exempt, as well as undercover operatives, members of SWAT teams, and people who have health issues or who need masks for medical reasons such as preventing smoke inhalation.

The lawsuit against California argues the state is discriminating against federal agents as it exempts some state officials from the mask ban.

Newsom also signed the No Vigilantes Act in September, which will require non-uniformed federal agents operating in California to visibly display identification that includes their agency and either a name or badge number starting in January.

California Democratic state senators pushed for the passage of these bills in June, in response to federal agents wearing face coverings while conducting immigration enforcement operations across California.

Both laws will impose criminal penalties on federal law enforcement officers for noncompliance in some cases.

Critics of the facial covering ban, including the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, argue it puts officers and their families' lives and well-being at risk by prohibiting them from protecting their identity when needed. State-level critics also say it only serves to punish local law enforcement for the actions of federal agents.

The Department of Homeland Security called on Newsom to veto the bills in September and, upon passage, stated it would not comply.

""To be clear: We will NOT comply with Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional mask ban,"" DHS posted on X in September, calling the law a ""PR stunt.""

In June, a federal version of the No Secret Police Act was introduced by New York Democratic Reps. Dan Goldman and Adriano Espaillat. This act would also ban facial coverings and require law enforcement officers and DHS agents to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining individuals.

Nothing led her to believe that, just a few hours later, she would be walking out the door with all her belongings and an order never to return. At 3:30 p.m., as she headed to her office during a break in the asylum case she was judging, a terse, three-sentence email from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) brought her career to an end.

“I didn’t expect not to be able to finish the hearing that day. I felt sad to be leaving a job I had dedicated so much effort and care to. And, of course, I felt uncertain about what would happen next in my life,” she recalls in a telephone interview with EL PAÍS. She had an hour and a half to gather her belongings and leave the courthouse. Dillon was her family’s main source of income, and they had health insurance thanks to her job. She still doesn’t understand why she was fired, as the email offered no explanation.

Hers is not an isolated case. In San Francisco alone, the Justice Department has fired seven judges since April, 25% of the total, and in the Sacramento court, only around half of the 11 judges remain. This area of California has been hit hard by the unexplained dismissals ordered by the Trump administration, which have occurred throughout the country. Of the nearly 800 immigration judges, 139 have been fired, taken an early-out offer, or been involuntarily transferred, according to recent estimates from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI).

The pattern has been similar in many cases. In early September, the day before her two-year term at the Annandale immigration court in Virginia was set to expire, Judge Anam Petit received the notification on her computer. After seeing the message, she briefly left the courtroom where she was presiding over a hearing, then returned to the bench and, with a trembling voice and shaking hands, delivered a complex ruling without revealing what had happened, she told this newspaper via email. She cannot say for sure what the reason for her dismissal was, because she was never told, but she emphasizes that many of the judges who were terminated had experience defending immigrants.

In addition to firing officials responsible for immigration cases, in its first months the Trump administration also eliminated protections against deportation, canceled grants that provided legal representation to minors, and transferred detainees to remote locations, including prisons outside U.S. jurisdiction, thus transforming the immigration justice system to suit its purposes. All of this was done in the name of achieving the largest deportation in history.

“The Trump administration’s policies, including expedited removal procedures and politicized interpretations of asylum laws, have resulted in a lack of due process,” says Dana Leigh Marks, who was an immigration judge in San Francisco for 35 years and is now retired.

Marks has been advocating for years for the independence of immigration judges who, contrary to popular belief and unlike the rest of the country’s judiciary, fall under the power of the executive branch. Although judges have always demanded independence from the government, they had never before denounced the politicization of their work. But since Trump took office the administration has sent them directives forcing them to expedite proceedings and dismiss asylum cases.

“Judges are supposed to act independently and not receive instructions or orders on how to rule in cases. That was the policy during the previous administration: to rigorously exercise judicial independence and rule in each case according to the facts and the law. That’s why it’s confusing to receive so many memos and directives that give clear instructions on how judges should rule in particular cases,” Dillon explains.

The mass firings of judges, amid a backlog of 3.4 million cases in immigration courts, defy practical explanation. From within the judiciary, however, it is understood as a way to remove judges who disagree with the anti-immigration policies imposed by the Trump administration. “It appears that the vast majority of the judges who have been fired were hired during the Biden administration or had experience in private law practice or with non-governmental organizations that assisted immigrants, rather than coming from a Department of Homeland Security prosecutorial background,” Marks posits.

The work of immigration judges is very complex, and in the past, to practice it, one had to have at least 10 years of experience in the field of immigration. The dismissed judges are being replaced by others without experience and even by U.S. army lawyers.

On October 24, the Department of Justice announced the hiring of 11 permanent and 25 temporary immigration judges. Most of those with immigration experience gained it as prosecutors or worked for the Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agencies responsible for arrests and deportations.

Among the temporary staff there are military lawyers from the Marine Corps, Navy, Army and Air Force. Earlier this summer, the Pentagon authorized about 600 military lawyers to work for the Justice Department, which changed the requirements for temporary immigration judges, eliminating the need for prior experience in immigration law.

Express deportations

One of the most radical changes to the immigration justice system concerns expedited deportations. Before Trump, these were reserved for migrants who entered the country illegally and were apprehended at the border. Their deportation can now be ordered by an immigration officer; that is, they are not required to go through a full legal process with a lawyer before a judge.

Additionally, these deportations have extended to people who have been living in the country for years and — contrary to the government’s claims that they are expelling criminals — the majority of those deported have no criminal record. Many of them lack legal status, but they could be eligible for immigration benefits if they were allowed to stay while their cases are resolved, which was the practice followed by immigration judges before Trump. Now, for example, if someone entered on a student visa and overstayed, they can be deported even if they have married a U.S. citizen and are eligible for residency.

“The Trump administration is changing the interpretation of certain legal terms that have been well established in the past, and by doing so, it is preventing people from having full removal proceedings. Instead, it is subjecting them to expedited removal proceedings,” Marks explains.

Previously, individuals who were undocumented or even had deportation orders were not a government priority for deportation. They regularly attended their immigration court appointments for routine check-ins. Now, court visits to comply with immigration requirements have become ambushes. ICE agents wait outside and detain people who arrive for their appointments. Scenes of masked officials forcibly taking people away and separating parents from their desperately crying children have become commonplace.

Detentions in immigration courts have also changed the way lawyers work. “This is something new we’re seeing across the country: immigration lawyers who need to prepare habeas corpus petitions for their clients who attend their regular reviews with ICE are concerned that those interviews could end in detention,” explains Cristina Vélez, director of law and policy at Asista, an organization that advises and trains professionals, including lawyers who defend migrants who have been victims of abuse and domestic violence.

“Because the scope of detention law enforcement has expanded enormously and reached people who previously would not have been detained, our members and professionals, who previously did not specialize in federal court litigation, now have to train, expand their skills, and find funding to do that work,” she adds.

Another radical change in immigration justice is the elimination of the possibility for ICE detainees to be released on bond. Instead, they are sent to detention centers in often remote locations, where access to family and lawyers is nearly impossible.

Adding to all this is the lack of funding for the immigration court system, something highlighted in an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute published this week. While immigration enforcement agencies have received massive budget increases in recent decades — most recently, $170 billion over four years through Trump’s tax reform — immigration courts have received a tiny fraction of that total: $844 million this year, just 2.5% of what ICE and the Border Patrol receive.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/ICZLFO5HI5AFRNHKS6VSXUBFIY.jpg?auth=061e858765a3549b3ae2fb93d4177dbff77ef8af253a34e2684652427f9fe1f7&width=1200,N,,2025-11-18 08:56:20.723846

This article was produced as a project for the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s National Fellowship Fund for Reporting on Child Well-being.

As 16-year-old Lily Martinez was heading home from her job at the local hospital this summer, her mother called urgently and told her not to come home, instructing her to go to a friend’s house instead.

“She told me that ICE was outside, and it was just her and my brother at home. She didn’t want to open the door for anyone,” Martinez said. “I didn’t know what to do, and I was really scared at that moment.”

Martinez and her brother were born and raised in Queens, New York. Her parents are undocumented immigrants from Mexico who have lived in the U.S. for two decades. Earlier this year, her uncle in Texas was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while driving and deported to Mexico. She’s afraid this could happen to her parents too.

“Sometimes I get so anxious that I’m distracted even when I’m with my friends,” she said.

Millions of U.S.-born children live in “mixed-status” households, families in which at least one member is undocumented or under threat of deportation. Though these children are citizens, the fear that they will lose their parents and caregivers defines their daily lives and has profound consequences for mental health.

“You can’t not consider the issue of immigration as a child well-being issue,” said Mayra E. Alvarez, the president of The Children’s Partnership, a California-based advocacy organization.

In California, nearly half of all children have at least one immigrant parent. Nationwide, it’s 1 in 4. Yet children’s mental health often remains invisible in policy debates framing immigration as a security issue rather than one of public health.

In February, 11-year-old Jocelynn Rojo Carranza, a U.S. citizen from Gainesville, Texas, died by suicide after enduring persistent bullying that included threats of immigration enforcement against her family. In interviews, her mother said classmates told her that the family would be reported to ICE, leaving her “all alone.” The case became a flashpoint for how aggressive enforcement rhetoric and peer hostility around immigration can dramatically elevate risk for children living in mixed-status families.

Researchers studying 547 U.S.-born adolescents found that having a detained or deported family member was associated with higher risks of suicidal ideation, externalizing behaviors, and alcohol use. The report, published in July in Psychiatric News, found that even the persistent threat of family separation generates toxic stress, affecting memory, emotion regulation, and impulse control into adulthood.

Claudia Santos, 17, from Santa Maria, California, has experienced similar fears. Her parents are undocumented strawberry farmworkers, and she worries they could be picked up and deported like so many in her community.

“In middle school, I had suicidal thoughts. But I always thought about what that would do to my parents and my little sisters,” Santos said.

The landscape has grown more perilous under the second Trump administration. Earlier this year, the president signed a budget reconciliation bill that allocated $145 billion toward immigration enforcement and border security. According to recent data released by ICE, over half a million people have been deported. Children are witnessing their parents and caregivers being arrested from places considered safe, such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship.

Experts and advocates say that children are showing visible signs of stress.

“I have parents asking for support from their little ones,” said Dr. Sandra Espinoza, an associate professor at Alliant International University in Los Angeles and a psychiatrist working with Latinx immigrant communities. “Children bite their nails, they are scared at night.”

That fear ripples across entire communities, affecting everyday activities, including even leaving the homes. Leisy Abrego, a sociologist and professor of Chicana/o and Central American Studies at UCLA, recalled that graduation last academic year was missing the usual scores of immigrant families.

“It’s always standing-room only. This time, there were empty rows,” Abrego said. “Imagine what is happening as children are observing this.”

Children of undocumented Latinx parents in the U.S. are at greater risk for long-term mental health struggles, especially when a parent is suddenly taken away, according to Espinoza’s co-authored 2024 study in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy. Researchers found that many of these children grow up carrying invisible scars—feelings of loss, mistrust, fear of separation, and shame—that often resurface later in life, especially in their closest relationships.

Although the research is still sparse, it’s beginning to show that the fear children carry growing up with an undocumented parent doesn’t simply fade away once they become adults. One 2021 national study of nearly 1,800 U.S.-born Latinx adults found that those who had a parent deported during childhood had more than twice the odds of exhibiting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms years later. Experiences such as a loved one being deported, living with the constant fear that a parent could be taken, or witnessing an immigration raid were all linked to adult PTSD.

“A child can learn to think, ‘My caregiver, who was the most safe person in my world, was taken from me. And so I’m going to adapt by not trusting people anymore or by not getting close to people anymore,’” Espinoza said.

Pregnant people under constant fear of deportation also show higher levels of cortisol, stress hormones that can affect fetal development. “These are babies pulling their hair out, babies with stomach aches,” Alvarez said, referring to research conducted by The Children’s Partnership. “It starts that early.”

Chronic stress impairs the immune system, delays cognitive development, and increases vulnerability to mental illness. For children of immigrants, stress may also begin with the trauma carried over from their home countries and can involve poverty, war, or political persecution. It then continues through the instability of U.S. immigration enforcement. This intergenerational trauma echoes through families, as parents struggling with depression or post-traumatic stress may become emotionally unavailable.

“Even when parents are present,” Espinoza said, “if they’re living in a constant state of hypervigilance caused by a broken legal and political system, it’s going to be difficult to be fully present with your child. That’s not the parent’s fault. It’s the environment’s fault.”

For Woojung Park, a 26-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient from South Korea, that environment has felt like a lifelong sentence.

As the only member of her family without permanent legal status—her parents now have green cards and her younger sister is a citizen—Park has lived with a constant sense of isolation.

“It’s like carrying a dirty secret,” Park said. “When I found out we’d overstayed our visa, my mom told me not to tell anyone. … I felt deceived by her. It took years to rebuild that trust.”

Park was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD as a teenager. “I don’t know if being undocumented correlates to it, but it probably was a factor because there’s so much anxiety that comes with it.”

Herlin Soto Matute, 28, a Nicaraguan-born immigrant, grew up in northern California in a mixed-status family. While her two younger sisters are U.S. citizens, Matute and her parents received Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which offers temporary legal protection to immigrants from countries facing war, natural disasters, or political instability.

TPS allowed Matute and her parents to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation—but only for as long as the program is renewed. Under Donald Trump’s first term, the administration tried to end TPS protections for thousands of recipients, but federal courts ultimately delayed those terminations. When Trump returned to office this year, his administration again began rolling back protections. For families like Matute’s, it felt like a cycle of dread repeating itself, keeping her up at night.

“It has been not only about mental and emotional state, but how do these systems have everything to do with how you view yourself, how you behave, how you respond, your psychological state, your physical symptoms?” she said. “Everything is intertwined with every person in power, all of those systems together make our identity.”

Motivated by those experiences, Matute pursued a doctorate in psychology and now works to support Latinx and immigrant communities through her private practice. Still, the precarity of TPS continues to shape her life. Her parents have grown tired and are accepting of the idea of being deported.

For Martinez, who is a high school senior, the future looks different from what she once imagined. She always wanted to leave New York for college and live on her own in a dorm.

“But now I don’t really want to do that anymore,” she said. “With everything that’s been going on, I feel like I can be of some use here at home.”

The fear of losing loved ones also extends far beyond undocumented communities. Across the country, refugee families are feeling the same collective anxiety that undocumented families have long endured. More than 90,000 Bhutanese people in the U.S.—most of them from a Nepali-speaking minority who were resettled after fleeing ethnic cleansing and surviving years in refugee camps since 2008—now find themselves facing a new wave of fear. Since March, ICE has arrested at least 60 Bhutanese in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, and other states, deporting 27 of them. Most are still missing, unreachable to their families.

“We were very much caught off guard,” said Angel Bista, a 26-year-old Nepali-speaking interpreter and community advocate in Michigan.

Advocates say children raised in such environments don’t easily outgrow that fear.

“No matter how good a therapist I am, no intervention in the world is going to make these real problems disappear,” Espinoza said. “Until we have true immigration reform, are my clients ever really going to be able to rest?”

They didn’t leave.

For two weeks, Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors sat guard in the hospital lobby 24 hours a day, working in shifts to monitor her movements, her attorney Ming Tanigawa-Lau said.

ICE later transferred the Salvadoran woman to Anaheim Global Medical Center, against her doctor’s orders and without explanation, her attorney said. There, Tanigawa-Lau said, ICE agents were allowed to stay in Solis-Portillo’s hospital room round-the-clock, listening to what should have been private conversations with providers. Solis-Portillo told her attorney that agents pressured her to say she was well enough to leave the hospital, telling her she wouldn’t be able to speak to her family or her attorney until she complied.

“She described it to me as feeling like she was being tortured,” Tanigawa-Lau said.

Legal experts say ICE agents can be in public areas of a hospital, such as a lobby, and can accompany already-detained patients as they receive care, illustrating the scope of federal authority. Detained patients, however, have rights and can try to advocate for themselves or seek legal recourse.

Earlier this year, California set aside $25 million to fund legal services for immigrants, and some local jurisdictions — including Orange County, Long Beach, and San Francisco — have put money toward legal aid efforts. The California Department of Social Services lists some legal defense nonprofits that have received funds.

Sophia Genovese, a supervising attorney and clinical teaching fellow at Georgetown Law, said law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, can guard and even restrain a person in their custody who is receiving health care, but they must follow constitutional and health privacy laws regardless of the person’s immigration status. Under those laws, patients can ask to speak with medical providers in private and to seek and speak confidentially with legal counsel, she said.

“ICE should be stationed outside of the room or outside of earshot during any communication between the patient and their doctor or medical provider,” Genovese said, adding that the same applies to a patient’s communication with lawyers. “That’s what they’re supposed to do.”

ICE Guidelines

When it comes to communication and visits, ICE’s standards state that detainees should have access to a phone and be able to receive visits from family and friends, “within security and operational constraints.” However, these guidelines are not enforceable, Genovese said.

If immigration agents arrest someone without a warrant, they must tell them why they’ve been detained and generally can’t hold them for more than 48 hours without making a custody determination. A federal judge recently granted a temporary restraining order in a case in which a man named Bayron Rovidio Marin was monitored by immigration agents in a Los Angeles hospital for 37 days without being charged and was registered under a pseudonym.

In the past, perceived violations by agents could be reported to ICE leadership at local field offices, to the agency’s headquarters, or to an oversight body, Genovese said. But earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security cut staffing at ombudsman offices that investigate civil rights complaints, saying they “obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles.”

The assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, Tricia McLaughlin, said that agents arrested Marin for being in the country illegally and that he admitted his lack of legal status to ICE agents. She said agents took him to the hospital after he injured his leg while trying to evade federal officers during a raid. She said officers did not prevent him from seeing his family or from using the phone.

“All detainees have access to phones they can use to contact their families and lawyers,” she said.

McLaughlin said the temporary restraining order was issued by an “activist” judge. She did not address questions about staffing cuts at the ombudsman offices.

DHS also said Solis-Portillo was in the country illegally. The department said she had been removed from the United States twice and arrested for the crimes of false identification, theft, and burglary.

“ICE takes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in our custody very seriously,” McLaughlin said. “It is a long-standing practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This includes access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.”

Protections in California

Anaheim Global Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Dignity Health, which operates Glendale Memorial Hospital, said it “cannot legally restrict law enforcement or security personnel from being present in public areas which include the hospital lobby/waiting area.”

California enacted a law in September that prohibits medical establishments from allowing federal agents without a valid search warrant or court order into private areas, including places where patients receive treatment or discuss health matters. But many of the most high-profile news reports of immigration agents at health care facilities have involved detained patients brought in for care.

Erika Frank, vice president of legal counsel for the California Hospital Association, said hospitals have always had law enforcement, including federal agents, bring in people they’ve detained who need medical attention.

Hospitals will defer to law enforcement on whether a patient needs to be monitored at all times, according to association spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea. If law enforcement officers overhear medical information about a patient while they’re in the hospital, it doesn’t constitute a patient-privacy violation, she added.

“This is no different, legally, from a patient or visitor overhearing information about another patient in a nearby bed or emergency department bay,” Emerson-Shea said in a statement.

She didn’t address whether patients can demand privacy with providers and attorneys, and she said hospitals don’t tell family and friends about the detained patient’s location, for safety reasons.

Sandy Reding, who is president of the California Nurses Association and visited the Glendale facility when Solis-Portillo was there, said nurses and patients were frightened to see masked immigration agents in the hospital’s lobby. She said she saw them sitting behind a registration desk where they could hear people discuss private health information.

“Hospitals used to be a sanctuary place, and now they’re not,” she said. “And it seems like ICE has just been running rampant.”

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Nov. 18 on a proposal to provide more protections for detainees at county-operated health facilities. These include limiting the ability of immigration officials to hide patients’ identities, allowing patients to consent to the release of information to family members and legal counsel, and directing staff to insist immigration agents leave the room at times to protect patient privacy. The county would also defend employees who try to uphold its policies.

Solis-Portillo’s lawyer, Tanigawa-Lau, said her client ultimately decided to self-deport to El Salvador rather than fight her case, because she felt she couldn’t get the medical care she needed in ICE custody.

“Even though Milagro’s case is really terrible, I’m glad that there’s more awareness now about this issue,” Tanigawa-Lau said.

Republicans in the House could be on track today to approve the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, a vote that follows President Donald Trump's unexpected blessing for a measure that has driven rancor through the party and its base.

The bipartisan effort, which has been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., was long fought by Trump and Republican leadership from reaching the House floor. As recently as last week, White House officials met with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., about her support for releasing the files, but her position was unchanged after the meeting.

Trump has also attacked Republicans for pushing the measure, including Massie and most recently Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

However, Trump did an about face over the weekend as it became clear a vote in the House was likely to succeed, and said Republicans should approve the bill.

On Monday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Senate can take up the bill as well, and that he would sign it if it passes. The measure, if passed, would compel the Justice Department to release all of its files on the convicted sex offender within 30 days.

""I'm all for it,"" Trump said from the Oval Office, but maintained it was a ""hoax"" that he didn't want to ""detract"" from his party's success.

Trump does not need legislation in order to approve the files for release, but he told reporters that Congress ""can do whatever they want"" on the vote.

His remarks came after a simple majority of House members signed onto what is known as a discharge petition – a workaround that forces votes without leadership or committee approval. Last week, the chamber's newest member, Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., became the decisive 218th signature on the petition.

Grijalva's swearing in was delayed for seven weeks after her election, galvanizing Democrats who accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of stalling in order to put off the vote. Johnson rejected that claim, saying her oath of office would not be taken until the government shutdown fight was resolved. He also committed to not block the vote on the House floor.

Tuesday's expected vote also comes after a wave of Epstein files were released last week by members on the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. Democrats first released a set of three emails, followed by thousands of pages of new files released by the panel's chairman, James Comer, R-Ky. The documents triggered new questions about the extent of Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender before his death in 2019.

Ahead of the vote, Massie and Khanna plan to gather with survivors and their families and friends. They last appeared together in September on Capitol Hill to lobby for the release of the Epstein files, saying transparency was the path to holding those involved fully accountable.

Survivors reiterated that position in a Friday letter to Congress in which they urged the release of files relating to Epstein and his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving time at a Texas facility after her conviction on trafficking charges.

""Epstein and Maxwell's crimes exposed a double standard of justice, where rich and powerful men and women evade repercussions,"" they wrote.

Americans will likely face higher prices on items for their Thanksgiving dinners this year.

Turkey, typically the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal, will be one of the biggest sticker shocks for consumers. Wholesale prices for a turkey have jumped 40% from a year ago, according to the Department of Agriculture. Outbreaks of avian influenza, or bird flu, and increased demand have contributed to these higher prices.

Those opting for beef instead of turkey should also prepare to pay more. Beef prices are nearly 15% higher than they were last year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Canned vegetables are 5% more expensive compared to last year, due to higher packaging costs from the steel and aluminum tariffs the Trump administration put in place earlier this year.

President Trump announced Friday that he would be rolling back tariffs he imposed on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other commodities, in an effort to combat high prices at grocery stores.

David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, said those rollbacks won't lower prices completely, as tariffs aren't the only cause of increasing prices.

""By removing the tariffs, what we're doing is we're slowing down the increase in the price of many of these goods,"" Ortega said. ""So while we may not see prices go down for the holidays, it helps in terms of moderating the price increases that we've been accustomed to at the grocery store.""

Some grocery items have seen some price decreases in time for the holiday season. Egg prices have seen a decline from earlier this year, and domestic wine prices are down about 1.2% from last year due to a steady supply and softening demand.

Ortega says buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits or vegetables is one way consumers can avoid higher prices from aluminum packaging. He also recommends shoppers plan their meals out in advance, look for private label or store brands over name brands, and shop early for certain items to take advantage of sales or promotions grocery stores might have.

""It really pays off to plan ahead and create a shopping list, making sure you're sticking to it and avoiding impulse purchases,"" Ortega said.

This story was originally published by Boyle Heights Beat on Nov. 17, 2025.

After a report revealed federal immigration agents are allowed to interfere in medical decisions at Adventist Health White Memorial, the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network is calling for hospital administrators to uphold patient privacy and ensure that staff can advocate for patients without retaliation.

The article, published by LAist on Oct. 9, reported that hospital administrators are blocking doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care. Administrators at White Memorial have told doctors not to call a detained patient’s family members, even to find out what type of medication they’re on or what conditions they have, doctors told LAist.

Community demands stronger protections

Since then, community stakeholders who are part of the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network presented demands at a Nov. 5 meeting with hospital leaders, including Kerry Heinrich, the president and chief executive officer of Adventist Health System, and John Raffoul, president of Adventist Health White Memorial.

As part of those demands, the network — which is made up of residents and community leaders from organizations like Legacy LA, InnerCity Struggle and Centro CSO — wants immigration agents out of patient rooms during medical consultations and procedures. Many in the network have deep ties to White Memorial, including having friends who were born there or taking their children for care at the hospital.

Hospital issues memo in response to community concerns

In response, White Memorial, in a Nov. 12 memo, thanked community leaders for sharing their concerns and outlined the following five points:

“Every patient’s privacy is protected and respected. We follow the laws that keep people’s medical information private, and we take that responsibility very seriously.

Doctors and nurses make care decisions together with their patients. No outside groups tell them how to treat a patient.

When there is a medical reason to contact a family, our team can do that through the right process. There are rules we must follow, but our goal is always to support care and connection whenever possible.

Law enforcement officers cannot interfere with medical care or put anyone’s safety at risk. Our hospital protects the privacy and safety of everyone here — patients, families, and staff.

We stand by our care teams. They are supported and protected as they care for every person with kindness and respect.”

“We know trust takes time to build and can be lost quickly. Many of you told us that trust has been broken, and we understand that. We want to keep earning your trust through open communication, transparency, and action, not just words,” the memo reads.

The memo — signed by Juan De La Cruz, president of the Adventist Health White Memorial Charitable Foundation — does not specifically address the network’s demand that agents be kept out of patient rooms during medical consultations and procedures.

Leaders say the memo falls short of key demands

Raquel Roman, executive director of Proyecto Pastoral, which operates the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network, said White Memorial’s memo is a “good first attempt.” But, she added, “it doesn’t meet the demands we presented.”

“There is still opportunity to continue dialogue,” Roman said.

“Ultimately, we want to make sure our community and the doctors treating our community feel safe being at White Memorial, whether they go in there on their own or if somebody gets detained by ICE,” she said.

Lucy Herrera, executive director of Legacy LA, said the memo contained “a lot of gray area.”

“The way they [White Memorial] responded in the memo makes it seem like they’ve already been doing all of these things, when we’ve been hearing the opposite,” said Herrera.

Herrera said an open dialogue with White Memorial can be beneficial. “As a coalition, I want to stay vigilant to ensure that they comply with our demands,” she said.

For Henry Perez, executive director of InnerCity Struggle, the memo “signals that they have heard the community’s concerns.” However, he said, the hospital’s response is doing the “bare minimum.” As a hospital, “they already should be protecting patients’ privacy,” he said.

“White Memorial has the opportunity to fully stand with our immigrant communities … and it falls short of really communicating and conveying that they understand the horrors that our community is going through at the hands of ICE agents,” Perez said.

Sol Márquez, with the social justice group Centro CSO, wants White Memorial to make specific assurances that hospital staff won’t be punished when advocating for patients. In the memo, Marquez said, “I don’t think that they’re actually saying anything concrete.”

“We just really don’t want any of the staff to be reprimanded for asking ICE to leave the room, and for trying to make a rightful connection with the detainees and their families,” Márquez said.

Network presses for concrete changes in ongoing talks

As part of efforts to call attention to the issue, Centro CSO launched a petition soon after the LAist article was published, calling for White Memorial to uphold HIPAA, the federal law that safeguards patient privacy, and to bar U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from making medical decisions for patients.

It urges White Memorial not to retaliate against or reprimand doctors and nurses “for asking ICE to leave examination rooms.”

Sammy Carrera with Centro CSO said the petition has garnered more than 300 signatures so far.

The petition highlights the role of White Memorial in Boyle Heights.

“White Memorial is situated in a working-class neighborhood made up of predominantly Chicano, Latino, and undocumented people. ICE is bringing detainees to this hospital knowing their presence threatens the very community they are attacking and deporting,” the petition reads.

The Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network is meeting to discuss next steps. De La Cruz notes in the memo that the hospital is “committed to keeping the conversation going.”

“We are opening our doors for guided visits to help you see how care works inside the hospital. We are also creating new ways for you to be part of hospital discussions and advisory groups,” the memo reads.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting agreed Monday to fulfill a $36 million, multi-year contract with NPR that it had yanked after pressure from the Trump White House.

The arrangement resolves litigation filed by NPR accusing the corporation of illegally yielding to President Donald Trump's demands that the network be financially punished for its news coverage. The argument, part of a broader lawsuit by NPR and several stations against the Trump administration, focused on CPB funding for NPR's operation of a satellite distribution system for local public radio stations. NPR announced Monday it would waive all fees for the stations associated with the satellite service.

The judge in the case had explicitly told CPB's legal team he did not find its defense credible. CPB lawyers had argued that the decision to award the contract to a new consortium of public media institutions was driven by a desire to foster digital innovations more swiftly.

""The settlement is a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system in our legal challenge to [Trump's] Executive Order,"" Katherine Maher, President and CEO of NPR, said in a statement. ""While we entered into this dispute with CPB reluctantly, we're glad to resolve it in a way that enables us to continue to provide for the stability of the Public Radio Satellite System, offer immediate and direct support to public radio stations across the country, and proceed with our strong and substantive claims against this illegal and unconstitutional Executive Order. We look forward to our day in court in December.""

In its submission Monday evening to the court, CPB did not concede that it had acted wrongfully — nor that it had yielded to political pressure from the administration.

Instead, in a statement posted on its website, CPB asserted its side ""prevails"" as a result of the settlement.

""This is an important moment for public media,"" said Patricia Harrison, President and CEO of CPB. ""We are very pleased that this costly and unnecessary litigation is over, and that our investment in the future through [Public Media Infrastructure] marks an exciting new era for public media."" CPB had awarded a rival contract to PMI, a newly created consortium of public radio organizations including several major stations, to ensure the digital distribution system functions properly. That contract will continue, CPB said.

Federal subsidies for public broadcasting stopped on Oct. 1 as a result of a party-line vote over the summer by Congress, called a rescission. Only a skeleton crew remains at CPB, which was created as a nonprofit corporation more than a half-century ago to funnel federal subsidies to public media. While PBS has had layoffs and NPR is monitoring its own finances, many local stations across the country have been hit hard.

Over the course of the litigation this fall, mounting evidence appeared to demonstrate that CPB's board chair and executives had acted against NPR in what turned out to be a futile attempt to salvage the corporation's own future.

In hearings last month in Washington, D.C., U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss told CPB's legal team they had not made a credible case for why the corporation reneged on the contract just a day after a top White House official warned senior CPB leaders against doing business with NPR. A trial had been set to start on Dec. 1.

CPB's change of mind — and NPR's ensuing lawsuit — sparked consternation and unease within the larger public media ecosystem. The two organizations had served as partners for decades. But that relationship frayed earlier this year, as the system came under attack from the Trump administration.

Trump's public campaign against NPR and PBS started in earnest soon after he returned to the White House. Trump kicked it into high gear in late March with a series of social media posts.

In early April, CPB leaders sought to get money out the door before Trump took action against public media. On April 2, CPB's board approved the extension of a contract with NPR to distribute public radio programs, including those not produced by NPR. The arrangement stretched back four decades. The amount included millions still due on the then-current contract.

The next day, CPB's board chair and two senior executives met with a top White House budget official who attested to her ""intense dislike for NPR."" The budget official told them CPB didn't have to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" according to a deposition from CPB executive Clayton Barsoum submitted as part of NPR's legal filings.

And the day after that — just 48 hours after that board vote — CPB reversed itself. CPB executive Kathy Merritt informed NPR's top official over the satellite and distribution service that it had to be spun off: it could not be part of NPR. NPR refused to do so. CPB revised the scope of the contract and solicited new bids. NPR's submission proved unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, the White House was ramping up the pressure. It accused NPR and PBS of bias. On April 14, for example, it issued a formal statement that called their offerings ""radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news'."" NPR and PBS's chief executives have rejected the accusations of bias.

On May 1, Trump issued an executive order that no federal money should go to the two public broadcasting networks. NPR and three Colorado public radio stations then filed suit against the White House, saying they were being unlawfully punished because the president did not like their news coverage. They contended the executive order represented a violation of First Amendment protections. Their suit names CPB as a defendant as well for, in their characterization, bending to the president's will. In Monday's legal filing, CPB agreed that the executive order was precisely the sort of government interference that Congress sought to prevent in establishing CPB as it did.

In the summer, Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress, urged on by Trump, pulled back all $1.1 billion for future public broadcasting that had already been approved and signed into law by the president.

Throughout the legal battle, NPR has said, regardless of the outcome of the case, it would work with Public Media Infrastructure.

NPR's broader constitutional case against Trump's executive order purporting to ban federal funding of public media continues. A hearing on its merits is scheduled for December.

I don’t care.
I don’t care.” Super cold.
And they’re like: “We’re being transferred.” She said: “We’re going to transfer you to Maine.” I was like: Maine?
I don’t feel like this was a mistake.","I was reapplying for my work visa in the immigration office. I was doing everything completely legally. I came to the U.S. legally 11 and a half years ago. I was granted asylum. Then I got a notice to appear in one of ICE’s offices in June for what they called a routine check-in. We went to Cancún for vacation with my family. When we came back, got out of the plane, they pulled me aside and I didn’t understand why. They said: “You need to reapply through the consulate and we need to send you back to Canada.” And in my head, I thought that meant: OK, I’m just getting on a plane and going home. I was never concerned. I had a green card. I traveled multiple times before out of the country. I was sitting there, looking for flights to go home, and I was taken. They were like: “We have to detain you.” I was under arrest. With no explanation. It felt like I had been kidnapped. You’re kidnapping me. They said they are detaining and deporting people who are here illegally and criminals. I was never in the country illegally. I did not come here illegally. I was legal from day one. Having a mother taken away from her kids, I felt like a knife was just like — it’s like stabbing my heart. I never expect this in America. I was taken to the first detention center in chains. When I got there, I was like: Where am I? It looks like a prison. They took us to the booking. We’re asked to strip naked in front of each other. There were 30 of us in one cell, just like a line of bunks and then open showers and toilets. And you are supposed to use this toilet in front of 12, 14 other people. If I wanted to use the bathroom, I feel violated. What did we do to be treated this way? That is inhumane. I was treated like a criminal, like I killed somebody. And every single time I asked a question, it was: “I’m not your case officer. I don’t know. I’m just doing my job.” They said, “Listen, I know every one of you will say, ‘I left my kids at home with no one to take care of them.’ I don’t care. You will say that you haven’t eaten anything all day long. I don’t care. You will say that you’re terrified, you are here unjustly. I don’t care.” Super cold. Freezing, freezing. They nicknamed them the ICE boxes. I don’t think it’s more than 30 degrees. We’re huddled, trying to stay warm, wrapped in these aluminum foils, looking like dead bodies. There’s no window that you can look outside. I never was able to breathe fresh air. Fluorescent lights are shining 24/7. I couldn’t sleep. We kept hearing rats squeal, like, scream. One of the girls had her period, and there was blood everywhere. They knew I was on my menstrual cycle, but I was not offered to shower for five days. This nurse comes in, and she’s like: “Pregnancy test.” She made us pee in front of each other into these Dixie cups. We’re all just standing there in a circle, holding our open urine, and she’s plopping these pregnancy tests in and then being like: “OK, you guys are good. Chuck it back in the toilet.” The food was horrible. It was disgusting. I ended up getting very sick. I lost a lot of my weight. Twenty pounds. My body was really starting to shut down. I felt like, oh, my goodness, am I going to die here? I worked as a journalist in Egypt and I was persecuted and detained and tortured. My experience at the Butler County Jail was more traumatizing than my detention in Egypt. I got woken up in the middle of the night, and they’re like: “Jasmine, you’re leaving.” I jumped up. I’m like: I’m going home? And they’re like: “We’re being transferred.” She said: “We’re going to transfer you to Maine.” I was like: Maine? “You’re going to Arizona.” I’m like: Why am I going to Arizona? I begged every single guard for help. Can you please tell anyone, your supervisor, that I would love to pay for my flight home? Just get me out of here. ICE issued a statement saying I was was “detained for not having legal documentation to be in the U.S.” I do not support anyone being in a country illegally. I had all my paperwork. I was in the immigration office. I was never in the country illegally. It says “a green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation’s laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if a law is broken and abused.” In my early 20s, I was young. I was in college. I got in trouble for possession of marijuana. I was pardoned. It was dismissed. It’s been years. And I have renewed my green card twice. Never had an issue with immigration. “U.S.C.I.S. obtained evidence that indicated you provided material support to a Tier 3 terrorist organization.” I volunteered with a nonprofit that took care of orphans and poor and sick people in Egypt. So basically, they tried to link this nonprofit which is a most reputable, respected nonprofit to a Tier 3 undesignated terrorist organization. This is how they framed it. I don’t feel like this was a mistake. I feel like this was on purpose. That is not a rare case. This is systematic. They are just grabbing anyone that they can. They’re trying to find ways to deport as many people, even if these people were here legally. Not knowing what’s going to happen to me, it felt like that was the worst because I wanted just to call my husband. I wanted to hear my kids, that my kids are OK. During the time that I was there, it was also my daughter’s birthday. I feel like they took that away from me. I was scared they were going to forget me. I was put on solitary confinement for six days for advocating for myself and the other Muslim inmates to have a quiet space to pray. That’s when my mental health started to deteriorate too fast. “It’s just a matter of time. You will get deported and get killed in Egypt.” That was the thing that I couldn’t get out of my mind. I’ll just get deported and get killed. I had a medical check, and I had to go visit this nurse. She could tell that I was distraught and confused, and she looked at me. And she goes: “Can I pray for you?” And she said this beautiful prayer in Spanish that I have no idea what she was saying. I just cried, and I cried. And I cried. And she just held my hands, and I was like: OK, I’m going to get through this. An officer called and said, “Pack your stuff.” Where am I going? “Just pack your stuff.” I was transferred back to the San Diego prison. It was a two-hour drive. Someone just grabbed me and said: “You’re coming with me this way.” She’s like: “Yeah, Uncuff her. She’s being released today.” My eyes just like: What? He said, “You are released.” I actually forget what the word ‘released’ mean in English, to be honest. It just, I didn’t — “What do you mean by released?” I was in shock. They stripped the chains off of me quickly, snuck me into the airport, escort me onto the plane, sit me down, and they’re like: “OK, you’re free. You can use your cellphone now. Take care.” And they’re kind of like, “Outside.” And I did not know where to go. I didn’t have a phone. An officer said, “We just got this letter today. The Department of Homeland Security reinstated your asylum status. It was the happiest moment of my entire life. [ARABIC SPEAKING] “Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah.” So the first thing we did was to drive to the mosque. Then we went out to eat in a Palestinian restaurant. I ate a lot. I was happy to see my husband. I was more happy to see my girls, no offense. The youngest one was having nightmares and kept waking up. So I knew they needed me and just reassure them I’m OK, even though it’s still hard for me. It’s still fragile. I am a different person than the person that got detained. I lost my job that I love. I lost my health insurance. I was not able to finish my degree all because I got detained for 73 days. I was so lucky to have only been in there for two weeks. Can you imagine someone in the system that doesn’t have my privilege, all the lawyers, all the money, all my connections? The majority of the women that I met have been in there for months. I received a five-year ban from America. Everyone asked me, they’re like: “Well, you’re never going to go back, are you?” I’m appealing. I want to go back. I love America. I am in the process now of getting my citizenship. I still love the American people. But I’m doubting if I’ll ever feel safe and call the United States my home. I don’t think this government will stop. Your government is funding a system that doesn’t follow any rules. Immigrants will be the first target. After that, they will target any opposition. Violating due process this time means they will violate it again and again and again.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/13/arts/17op-ice-detention-clean-thumb/17op-ice-detention-clean-thumb-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay,N,,2025-11-18 03:56:38.090865

ROBERTSON",,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/weekends-border-patrol-surge-north-150030675.html,"U.S. immigration agents arrested more than 130 people over the weekend in a sweep through Charlotte, North Carolina’s largest city, a federal official said Monday.
The movements in North Carolina come after the Trump administration launched immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago.
The Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents.
DHS said about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored since October 2020, putting the public at risk.
“Democrats at all levels are choosing to protect criminal illegals over North Carolina citizens,” state GOP Chairman Jason Simmons said Monday.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh as soon as Tuesday, the mayor of the state’s capital city said, while Customs and Border Protection agents continue operating in Charlotte following a weekend that saw arrests of more than 130 people in that city.

Mayor Janet Cowell said Monday that she didn’t know how large the operation would be or how long agents would be present. Immigration authorities haven’t spoken about it. The Democrat said in a statement that crime was lower in Raleigh this year compared to last and that public safety was a priority for her and the city council.

“I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges,” Cowell said in a statement.

U.S. immigration agents arrested more than 130 people over the weekend in a sweep through Charlotte, North Carolina’s largest city, a federal official said Monday.

The movements in North Carolina come after the Trump administration launched immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago. Both of those are deep blue cities in deep blue states run by nationally prominent officials who make no secret of their anger at the White House. The political reasoning there seemed obvious.

But why North Carolina and why was Charlotte the first target there?

Sure the mayor is a Democrat, as is the governor, but neither is known for wading into national political battles. In a state where divided government has become the norm, Gov. Josh Stein in particular has tried hard to get along with the GOP-controlled state legislature. The state's two U.S. senators are both Republican and President Donald Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.

The Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents.

But maybe focusing on a place where politics is less outwardly bloody was part of the equation.

The White House “can have enough opposition (to its crackdown), but it's a weaker version"" than what it faced in places like Chicago, said Rick Su, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who studies local government, immigration and federalism.

“They’re not interested in just deporting people. They’re interested in the show,” he said.

The crackdown

The Trump administration has made Charlotte, a Democratic city of about 950,000 people, its latest focus for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime — despite local opposition and declining crime rates. Residents reported encounters with immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Border Patrol officers had arrested “over 130 illegal aliens who have all broken” immigration laws. The agency said the records of those arrested included gang membership, aggravated assault, shoplifting and other crimes, but it did not say how many cases had resulted in convictions, how many people had been facing charges or any other details.

The crackdown set off fierce objections from area leaders.

“We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color,” Stein said in a video statement late Sunday. “This is not making us safer. It’s stoking fear and dividing our community.”

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Monday she was “deeply concerned” about videos she’s seen of the crackdown but also said she appreciates protesters’ peacefulness.

“To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: You are not alone. Your city stands with you,” she said in a statement.

The debate over crime and immigration

Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County have both found themselves part of America’s debates over crime and immigration, two of the most important issues to the White House.

The most prominent was the fatal stabbing this summer of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train, an attack captured on video. While the suspect was from the U.S., the Trump administration repeatedly highlighted that he had been arrested previously more than a dozen times.

Charlotte, which had a Republican mayor as recently as 2009, is now a city dominated by Democrats, with a growing population brought by a booming economy. The racially diverse city includes more than 150,000 foreign-born residents, officials say.

Lyles easily won a fifth term as mayor earlier this month, defeating her Republican rival by 45 percentage points even as GOP critics blasted city and state leaders for what they call rising incidents of crime. Following the Nov. 4 election, Democrats are poised to hold 10 of the other 11 seats on the city council.

While the Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on the state because of sanctuary policies, North Carolina county jails have long honored “detainers,” or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them. Nevertheless, some common, noncooperation policies have existed in a handful of places, including Charlotte, where the police do not help with immigration enforcement.

In Mecklenburg County, the jail did not honor detainer requests for several years, until after state law effectively made it mandatory starting last year.

DHS said about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored since October 2020, putting the public at risk.

For years, Mecklenburg Sheriff Garry McFadden pushed back against efforts by the Republican-controlled state legislature to force him and a handful of sheriffs from other urban counties to accept ICE detainers.

Republicans ultimately overrode a veto by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper late last year to enact the bill into law.

While McFadden has said his office is complying with the law’s requirement, he continued a public feud with ICE leaders in early 2025 that led to a new state law toughening those rules. Stein vetoed that measure, but the veto was overridden.

Republican House Speaker Destin Hall said in a Monday post on X that immigration agents are in Charlotte because of McFadden’s past inaction: “They’re stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city.”

Last month, McFadden said he'd had a productive meeting with an ICE representative.

“I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.

But such talk doesn't calm the political waters.

“Democrats at all levels are choosing to protect criminal illegals over North Carolina citizens,” state GOP Chairman Jason Simmons said Monday.

Rutilio Vázquez, who lives in the East Valley Farms neighborhood, says federal agents arrived at 5:30 a.m. Thursday, with bright lights, drones, and loud commands as they ordered people to exit one of the properties.

“When they talk, they say that we are federal police or something like that. ‘We want you to come out with hands on your head,’” he told KSBY News in Spanish.

ICE reports that three undocumented people from Mexico and one U.S. citizen were arrested. Investigators allege a labor recruiter named Jorge Vasquez collected illegal fees – in one case up to $8,000, including a $1,000 upfront deposit – in exchange for the opportunity to work in the U.S. under H-2A visas.

According to ICE, the money was deducted from the farm workers’ wages and the workers were threatened with violence or deportation if they failed to comply or complained to government inspectors.

During the raid, multiple community members arrived, attempting to confront law enforcement. Federal agents deployed flash-bangs in an attempt to disperse the crowd.

Vázquez says he was questioned that morning about his immigration status and confirmed to officers he was undocumented. However, “one of the officers came up to me and said, ‘Don’t be afraid, because we’re not going to deport you to Mexico. We only have a problem with one person who lives here. We came for those people,’” he recalled.

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell confirmed to ABC11 that federal agents will be in Raleigh on Tuesday.

""As the capital city, it is important to us that everyone who lives, works, plays, and learns in Raleigh feels safe,"" Cowell said in a statement. ""We have been made aware that Customs and Border Protection are coming to Raleigh. While the Raleigh Police Department is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law. I can confirm that RPD has not participated in any immigration planning activities.

""Above all, Raleigh is a safe city, with crime down year-over-year. Public safety is a priority for me and this City Council,"" the mayor continued. ""This is a key moment to reaffirm our commitment to serving all members of our community. If you need help from the police, you call 911, and help will come. I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges. Together we are Raleigh Strong.""

Other Democrats, including Durham Mayor Leo Williams and Gov. Josh Stein also reacted to the news of federal action.

""We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights and compromises safety,"" Williams said. ""Durham does not operate from fear. We lead with compassion, justice and determination. Our schools, neighborhoods and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages and experiences that define Durham.""

Stein said, ""Our office is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh. Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations. Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte. To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement. Let's keep each other safe.""

In Morrisville, Councilmember Steve Rao said he was already getting messages from people wondering what documentation they should carry with them.

""Uncertainty about paper work, what kind of paperwork should I have in my car if I'm driving, do I need to have my immigration status, my visa, am I waiting for a green card?"" said Rao.

Agents spent the weekend in Charlotte. Protests were held across Charlotte before and during the agents' presence.

While many of the raids in Charlotte targeted Hispanic-owned businesses, Rao also worried about the possible effects on Morrisville's large South Asian population.

""So there is this fear and uncertainty about how you're treated, how you're handled,"" Rao said. ""I think many Indian-Americans are here legally on skilled immigration visas. There's been concerns about fees being increased to $100,000 from $5,000 for applying for those. And if there are people here illegally, whether their paperwork has transpired or whatever, these people need to know their rights.""

On Sunday in Raleigh, hundreds of people marched from Moore Square to the State Capitol in downtown Raleigh to protest what they saw happening in Charlotte.

A top Border Patrol commander touted dozens of arrests in North Carolina's largest city on Sunday as Charlotte residents reported encounters with federal immigration agents near churches and apartment complexes. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched Operation Charlotte's Web, which they say resulted in more than 80 arrests.

The Trump administration has made the Democrat-run city of about 950,000 people its latest target for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime, despite fierce objections from local leaders and declining crime rates.

Morrisville issues safety guidance

Meanwhile, Morrisville's mayor Pro-Tem Satish Garimella posted this guidance and warning on Facebook for people who live in Morrisville and Wake County.

""We've received information that there may be ICE activity in the Raleigh area tomorrow might be a day or more. Out of an abundance of caution, please make sure you have your ID, a copy of your passport, and any important immigration documents with you if you need to go out. It's also a good idea to keep your original documents in a safe place where someone you trust can access them if needed. If you prefer and are able to stay home, that is also an option. Sharing this only to ensure everyone stays informed and prepared. Please pass this message along to anyone who might need it. Thank you and stay safe.""

There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.
Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".","The government's plans to fast-track the deportation of illegal migrants and a major overhaul of human rights law have been described as ""inhumane"".

Green Party MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns said she was ""really worried"" about Monday's announcement.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood detailed sweeping reforms of the UK's immigration policy, meaning anyone granted asylum will be returned home if their country is deemed safe in the future.

Addressing the House of Commons, the minister said she had a ""moral duty"" to fix the ""broken asylum system"" and ""unite what is today a divided country"".

Chowns responded: ""The right to seek asylum for someone fleeing violence in their home country... is a basic principle of international law and it's also a basic principle of our shared humanity.

""And it appears what the government is trying to do is really lean into this whole narrative that all of the problems in the country are to do with people coming over in small boats.

""It's completely false and it's deeply, deeply concerning.""

Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.

It would mean only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, would be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

And the UK will also join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9b0f/live/617f15c0-c3de-11f0-bbb8-f506e20a7d44.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 02:56:36.734055

The expected action comes after U.S. Border Patrol agents reportedly arrested over 130 people in Charlotte this weekend in places like restaurants, grocery stores, Home Depot parking lots and an east Charlotte church, The Charlotte Observer reported.

“As the capital city, it is important to us that everyone who lives, works, plays and learns in Raleigh feels safe,” Cowell said in a statement Monday night.

“However, if any operation or activity should occur, I kindly ask all residents to refrain from engaging or confronting Border Control personnel and allow them to carry out their official duties,” according to a statement on behalf of Sheriff Willie Rowe. “The safety and well-being of our community remains the primary concern of the Wake County Sheriff’s Office, and we strive to avoid circumstances that may lead to injuries or unnecessary arrests.”

U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are different agencies. The Border Patrol is the law enforcement arm of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It has been sent to cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and, most recently, Charlotte.

The news of a possible Border Patrol action in Raleigh on Tuesday was first reported by INDY and The Assembly Monday night.

Crime is down year-over-year in Raleigh, and public safety is a priority for the City Council, Cowell said in her statement.

“This is a key moment to reaffirm our commitment to serving all members of our community,” she said. “If you need help from the police, you call 911, and help will come. I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges.”

Durham leaders denounce Border Patrol actions

In Durham, Mayor Leo Williams opened Monday night’s City Council meeting with a joint statement from him; Nida Allam, chair of the Durham County Board of Commissioners; and Bettina Umstead, chair of the Durham school board.

“We’re deeply troubled by recent news accounts of increased presence of immigration officers in and around North Carolina,” Williams read. “We want to assert a courageous stance on behalf of our immigrant communities that are essential to the fabric of our state and city. We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights and compromises safety.

“Durham does not operate from fear,” he added. “We lead with compassion, justice, determination. Our schools, neighborhoods and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages and experiences that define Durham.”

Concerns about who will be targeted

State Democratic leaders representing Charlotte said earlier Monday that the arrests amounted to racial profiling, The N&O reported. Mecklenburg County Democratic Rep. Carolyn Logan denounced the tactics of “reaching and grabbing ... for whoever they can see and grabbing them off the street. They don’t know if they’re criminals, they’re just looking to skin color.”

Later Monday, after news about Raleigh broke, State Sen. Lisa Grafstein, a Wake County Democrat, said in a text to The N&O that she shares concerns raised by Stein after the Border Patrol deployment in Charlotte “about the methods being used and the violent targeting of people who are simply living their lives peacefully.”

“We saw in Chicago that the vast majority of people being targeted have no criminal history,” Grafstein said. “Many of the actions we are seeing are unconstitutional and are bringing violence and chaos. I hope and believe that the people of Wake County — a welcoming and diverse community — will look out for each other.”

Rep. Phil Rubin, a former federal prosecutor and a Wake County Democrat, said the conduct in Charlotte was “unacceptable, un-American, and dangerous.” In a news release, he urged residents — including immigrants, who have rights — to know their rights ahead of federal agents’ expected presence in Raleigh.

“During my service as a federal prosecutor right here in Raleigh, I worked with federal agents — people who used their immense power carefully, targeted dangerous offenders to keep our communities safe and lived their oath to uphold the Constitution,” Rubin said. “What we’ve seen from federal agents in Charlotte is not the work of the federal law enforcement I knew. It would not have been tolerated then, and we should not tolerate it now.”

Asked about the Triangle deployment, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson shared a statement about the people arrested in Charlotte over the weekend, “who have all broken the immigration laws of our country.”

“Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony,” the Homeland Security statement says.

The Observer reported that federal immigration agencies have not released names or paperwork, or said where those arrested are being detained, so the claim about records could not be verified.

“We will not stop enforcing the laws of our nation until every criminal illegal alien is arrested and removed from our country,” the Homeland Security statement says.

The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department was dispatched at around 10:40 p.m., according to a news release.
The teenager and his family, who are all U.S. citizens, “were already scared to begin with” before the incident, Kirakosian said.
Rodriguez interrogated him, asking where he and his family were from and demanded identification, Kirakosian said, for nearly 20 minutes.
Kirakosian said this incident likely resulted in an arrest because the agent was off duty.","An off-duty law enforcement officer was arrested in Riverside County last week after pulling a firearm on a 17-year-old and detaining him on the side of the road.

Gerardo Rodriguez, 46, was known by neighbors to be an agent employed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Patrol, said Greg Kirakosian, a lawyer representing the teenager.

An ICE spokesperson wrote that Rodriguez is not employed by the agency. A CBP spokesperson said in a statement: “This matter is under investigation.”

The teenager had driven by Rodriguez’s home in Temecula to drop friends off at a nearby house at around 10 p.m. on Nov. 10, Kirakosian said. When he drove back he was stopped by Rodriguez, who pulled a gun. The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department was dispatched at around 10:40 p.m., according to a news release.

Rodriguez was taken into custody without incident the next day and charged with assault by a public officer, child endangerment and assault with a deadly weapon, the Sheriff’s Department said. He posted bail the same day and his next court date is scheduled for Dec. 26.

The teenager and his family, who are all U.S. citizens, “were already scared to begin with” before the incident, Kirakosian said.

“They’re Mexican Americans, you know, in Southern California right now, and there’s ICE raids happening left and right,” he said.

Security camera footage from a neighbor shows Rodriguez “in the middle of the street, kind of marching down with a gun in his hand,” Kirakosian said.

“It’s not like he pulled it out in an emergency. He had it out. He was walking down the street with a gun in his hand,” he said.

As he sees the truck approach, Rodriguez walks toward the middle of the street, pulls out a gun and points it at the vehicle.

“Stop, stop. Slow down. Freeze. Police,” Rodriguez yells.

The teenager feared he would be shot, Kirakosian said, so he stopped. Rodriguez ordered him to park, again identifying himself as police, then approached the driver’s side and pointed his gun at the teenager. Rodriguez interrogated him, asking where he and his family were from and demanded identification, Kirakosian said, for nearly 20 minutes.

In the video, Rodriguez argues with the teenager, claiming he was speeding down the street. He repeatedly claims the teenager almost ran him over.

The teenager’s friends, who were still at a house nearby, saw the incident and notified parents who were also at the home and approached Rodriguez, eventually persuading him to let the teenager go, according to Kirakosian. They called the teenager’s mother, who immediately grabbed her son’s passport to prove his citizenship, he said. By the time the mother had arrived, Rodriguez had left, and they then called the police.

Police obtained a search warrant and confiscated Rodriguez’s security camera footage and the gun when they arrested him, Kirakosian said.

The incident is the latest in a growing number of armed confrontations involving ICE agents or people posing as them confronting people and demanding identification. An ICE agent was confronted by local police when he pulled a gun on a woman in Fullerton this month, and multiple ICE and Border Patrol shootings have taken place in and outside Southern California in recent months.

Kirakosian said this incident likely resulted in an arrest because the agent was off duty.

“You got ICE agents who apparently feel so emboldened by what they do on a day-to-day basis, they’re essentially treating their own neighborhoods as an area they need to start investigating,” Kirakosian said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/937907a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Fef%2Fee6ba1ba44218b788e7ac2e7984a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2195569366,N,,2025-11-18 02:56:48.688886

(WTVD) -- There are feelings of anxiousness among some Latinos as U.S. immigration agents arrested nearly 150 people in Charlotte during the weekend. Activists said they were concerned that the Department of Homeland Security operations that started in North Carolina's largest city could expand across the Tar Heel State.

""The damage is done in all 100 counties of North Carolina. I live in Raleigh. I have folks in Sanford, Chatham County, and Wilson. We're talking about families who are not leaving their homes and children who are not going to school,"" said Iliana Santillan with Brava NC. ""We have elderly folks who are not getting medical help they need because they are afraid,""

On Monday evening, Sen. Graig Meyer, a Democrat who represents Caswell, Person, and Orange counties, told ABC11 that federal agents will be in Raleigh as early as Tuesday this week.

Grassroots advocacy organizations such as Brava NC are partnering up, as they believe the effects of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Charlotte are already being felt across the state.

Santillan recommended that people who are concerned seek legal advice.

""I'm a naturalized citizen myself, and I have considered carrying my passport with me as a precautionary measure because right now we know they have questioned and harassed American citizens. So, nobody is really safe,"" she said.

This comes as the DHS launched Operation Charlotte's Web, an effort aimed at targeting people with criminal records who are in the country illegally. DHS said it is surging law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.

""We're seeing an increase in street stops and workplace stops,"" said Eisha Jain, the Henry P. Brandis Distinguished Professor of Law at UNC-Chapel Hill.

Jain said these efforts are similar to those in Chicago and Los Angeles. Though immigration enforcement efforts are in Charlotte now, she wouldn't rule out ICE's presence in other parts of the state, such as the Triangle, later.

""In terms of how areas are chosen, I think there's a lot of discretion on the part of the government in terms of where to concentrate immigration enforcement actions,"" she said.

Jaine told ABC11 that there's a lot of uncertainty as to why people are stopped and what happens during that interaction.

""One of the most important rights I think all people have, citizens and noncitizens alike, is the right to be left alone by the government when they're walking down the street.

(KTLA) – A 45-year-old California man who reportedly works as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent is accused of illegally detaining a minor at gunpoint while off duty last week.
He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” Kirakosian explained, referring to the teen.
“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said.
As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center on allegations of assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer.
KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.","RIVERSIDE COUNTY, Calif. (KTLA) – A 45-year-old California man who reportedly works as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent is accused of illegally detaining a minor at gunpoint while off duty last week.

The Nov. 10 incident, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, played out at around 10:30 pm outside a home in Temecula, California.

Lawyer Greg Kirakosian, who represents the boy and his family, told Nexstar’s KTLA that the 17-year-old was driving home after dropping a friend off down the street when he saw the suspect, identified by investigators as Gerardo Rodriguez, pointing a gun at his vehicle and demanding he pull over.

“In the moment, I think he was just scared for his life. He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” Kirakosian explained, referring to the teen. “Then that same person came up to his driver’s side door and pulled him out at gunpoint.”

In footage of the incident obtained by KTLA, the 45-year-old is seen pulling a gun from his waistband as he walks up the street, pointing it at the teen’s truck and demanding he stop the vehicle while reportedly brandishing his badge.

“Freeze, police,” Rodriguez shouts. “Put the car in f****** park. Get out of the car. Turn it off, get out. You’re speeding in the f****** neighborhood. Come over here, sit down, get your a** down. You have a driver’s license?”

The 45-year-old, who is known to residents on the street as an ICE agent and also reportedly told the boy he worked for ICE, then began interrogating the Mexican American teen, asking him who he was, where he is from and demanding documentation, eventually drawing the attention of others who live on the street.

“By the time our client’s parents showed up, the neighbors had essentially come to the rescue and stopped him from doing what he was doing, calming him down and forcing him to go back inside his house and leaving the boy alone,” Kirakosian said.

The teenager’s parents had been alerted by a friend to what was happening, prompting them to rush over from their home with their son’s passport, fearing the incident could be some type of immigrant enforcement operation. They called 911 after they arrived.

Responding deputies turned the investigation over to RCSD’s Investigation Bureau, who contacted Rodriguez later the same night, arrested him and conducted a search of his house “where evidence related to the investigation was collected,” the department said in a news release.

“I think right now, a lot of Mexican Americans, whether they are in a situation like this or not, who are angry upset and scared, and this just really came close to home for them,” Kirakosian said when asked how the family was doing after the harrowing ordeal.

The L.A.-based civil rights attorney added that he believes the 45-year-old has become emboldened by what he does and sees other ICE agents doing on a day-to-day basis.

“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said. “I don’t know how much worse the situation is going to get, honestly. This kid could’ve been shot.”

This incident comes after several others in which federal law enforcement agents have pulled their firearms on citizens.

On Nov. 9, video captured an ICE officer pointing his gun at a woman behind him in an intersection in Santa Ana, California, witnessed by a Fullerton police officer returning from the Santa Ana Jail facility, who refused to get involved if no crime had been committed.

Federal officials later claimed the woman was following the agent.

On Oct. 30, a 24-year-old Ontario man was shot by a federal agent who was reportedly trying to notify officers involved in an enforcement operation that there were children across the street.

In that instance, federal officials claimed the agent fired “defensive shots” while fearing the 24-year-old was attempting to run over officers.

As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center on allegations of assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer. Jail records show he posted bond and was released the same night.

KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.

The proposals have been brought forward by Minister for Justice Jim O'Callaghan and Minister of State Colm Brophy.
Mr O'Callaghan said ""every country has a right to introduce its own migration policy"".
The minister stressed that changes to the UK asylum laws ""can have an impact in Ireland"" and ""have had an impact in the past"".
""But that's not to say that the UK can't change their asylum laws.","The Coalition leaders are meeting in Dublin and are expected to sign off on a further tightening of migration rules, relating to the criteria for family reunifications.

The proposals have been brought forward by Minister for Justice Jim O'Callaghan and Minister of State Colm Brophy.

If passed by Cabinet next week, it will likely result in a reduction in the total number arriving under the family reunification policy which stood at 22,000 last year.

Applicants seeking family reunification will also have to be self sufficient and not owe accommodation costs.

Separately, the Coalition leaders are also discussing plans to change the current requirement that people who are granted refugee status may apply for naturalisation after three years' resident.

The new proposal would increase that to five years.

It comes as Minister O'Callaghan said earlier that Ireland will need to be ""nimble"" and may need to change its own laws and provisions in order to respond to a proposed overhaul in UK asylum laws.

Britain is set to overhaul its approach to human rights' laws to make it easier to deport migrants who arrive illegally, in a major shake-up of asylum policy.

Mr O'Callaghan said he expects the proposed changes to UK asylum laws will have an impact on Ireland and that the Government may have to change the law here in response.

In a statement this evening, the minister said he and the Government are aware that changes to the UK's asylum practices or laws can result in changes to the flow of asylum seekers between the UK and Ireland.

""I am committed to ensuring that Ireland is not viewed more favourably than the UK by those seeking to claim asylum,"" he said.

Mr O'Callaghan said he will closely monitor the changes proposed by the UK government and will ""respond to those proposals having considered them fully and discussed them with Government colleagues"".

""I will be publishing a new International Protection Bill to reform Ireland's asylum system later this year and any necessary changes arising from the UK’s change of policy can be included in that Bill,"" he said.

""Prior to the changes proposed by Home Secretary Mahmood, I had already directed a separate review of Ireland's rules on family reunification and will shortly bring proposals to Government in respect of this issue.""

The minister also spoke earlier at Farmleigh House following the British Irish-Intergovernmental Conference where he and Tánaiste Simon Harris met British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Hilary Benn and Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Matthew Patrick.

Mr O'Callaghan said ""every country has a right to introduce its own migration policy"".

""The British government has every right to bring forward its own proposals, but we would ask and are grateful for close engagement, because we clearly have interdependencies here because of the contract here,"" he said.

The minister stressed that changes to the UK asylum laws ""can have an impact in Ireland"" and ""have had an impact in the past"".

""But that's not to say that the UK can't change their asylum laws. They're perfectly entitled to change their asylum laws, and I thank them again for giving us a heads up in respect of it, however, what it does indicate is that I suppose we need to be nimble in Ireland as we may need to change our laws and our provisions as well to respond to any changes that have taken place in the UK,"" he said.

Mr Benn said he did not believe any of the new proposals would put the UK at odds with its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.

""The British government is absolutely committed to the European Convention of Human Rights, unlike other parties in Britain who want to take us out of it, and that really would undermine the Good Friday Agreement, which has seen so much progress take place in Northern Ireland,"" he said.

Mr Benn said there is a debate going on in the Council of Europe about the interpretation and application of various aspects of the ECHR, adding that ""there is a great deal of public concern about illegal migration to the United Kingdom"".

""This is undoubtedly the case, and that's why it's vital we have a system that everyone can have confidence in, that can distinguish between those who are trying to move for other reasons by claiming asylum, when, in fact, the sovereign system is there for people who are fleeing persecution,"" Mr Benn said.",https://www.rte.ie/images/00237e88-1600.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 22:56:15.963627

This move is designed to create confusion and uncertainty

“This move is designed to create confusion and uncertainty. The courts have determined that public charge has a very narrow meaning and that it does not apply to benefits like health care that everyone inevitably needs at some point in their life. But now, immigration officials are sure to make inconsistent and arbitrary decisions, forcing families to guess at what programs may or may not count,” said Sarah Grusin, Senior Attorney at the National Health Law Program. “This is yet another breach of trust that will push families back into the shadows and deter them from seeking health care. NHeLP and our partners will fight to stop these harmful changes to public charge, just as we did during Trump’s first term.”

The current Biden-era rule’s definition of “public charge” assures families that immigration officials will not count most public benefits. Under the current rule, only cash assistance for income maintenance and government-funded long-term institutional care are considered in public charge determinations, meaning use of programs like most Medicaid, nutrition assistance, and housing support do not threaten an individual’s immigration status.

During the previous Trump administration, changes to the definition of public charge went well beyond the settled, historic understanding of public charge, causing widespread fear in immigrant communities and leading many to withdraw from or avoid enrolling in public programs, even when they or their children were fully eligible.

Refugee status

In a document outlining the changes, the government warns being granted refugee status ""is to essentially receive the ability to live in this country, forever"" - and must change to ""reflect our changing times"".

Refugee status will become temporary and subject to review every two and a half years under a ""core protection"" offer, way down from five years of initial right to remain currently offered.

Anyone granted refugee status will be removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe, while the wait for permanent status will be quadrupled to 20 years.

How UK and Denmark's immigration policies compare

Safe and legal routes

Refugee charities often claim the reason so many people cross the Channel in small boats is because there are not enough safe and legal routes asylum seekers can take to the UK.

The government has said it will introduce new routes. For those arriving on these for work and study, they could be offered long-term status in 10 years, subject to consultation.

Local communities will be able to sponsor individual refugees granted asylum, like the Homes for Ukraine scheme.

More families to be deported

The government says a ""hesitancy"" to deport families can lead to ""particularly perverse incentives"", such as people risking bringing their child to the UK illegally on the assumption that this will make them less likely to be removed.

To change this, there will be no automatic right to family reunion for refugees unless they successfully enter the ""protection work and study"" route and become eligible to sponsor family members.

Children won't be separated from the parents during deportations, though, it is understood.

Financial support not guaranteed

Currently, the government has a legal obligation to provide support to asylum seekers who would otherwise be ""destitute"", but the document says the government will remove this.

Housing and weekly allowances will be discretionary and no longer be guaranteed.

Those with a right to work in the UK who can support themselves but don't may be denied housing and benefits, while those with income and assets such as cars will have to contribute to their costs.

A new body to speed up appeals

A new appeals body will be created to speed up the time it takes to decide whether to refuse an asylum application, allowing those who fail to be deported sooner.

It will be staffed by ""professionally trained adjudicators"", the document states.

Those whose claims are denied will be limited to one appeal. They can currently make several on different grounds.

Human rights law changes

The Tories and Reform have advocated leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), something the prime minister - who was a human rights lawyer - is reluctant to do.

But new legislation will be brought forward to ensure the ECHR's ""right to family life"" clause is balanced against the public interest, as it has been used to prevent deportations.

Ministers will also work with international partners to reform part of the treaty designed to prohibit torture and inhuman treatment, which they say has allowed foreign criminals to stay in the UK because of how it is interpreted.",https://e3.365dm.com/25/11/1600x900/skynews-shabana-mahmood-small-boats_7084629.jpg?20251118000216,N,,2025-11-17 20:57:01.907920

“What we know is that there was a true, true injustice happening in our communities where we were being attacked for what we look like,” said Linda Tortolero with Latino Policy Forum.","CHICAGO (WGN) — Federal immigration agents began moving out of Chicago within the past few days, and a coalition of civil rights organizations joined forces on Monday to stress the importance of community support and sticking together.

“They came to Chicago to intimidate, they came to Chicago to divide, but what they have done is, they have brought our family together stronger than ever,” Marty Castro said.

From June to October, federal agents rounded up more than 3,300 people in the Chicago area, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Department of Justice listed 614 of those arrests for closer review and found only 16 — or 2.5% — had any criminal history flagged by federal authorities. This means roughly 97% of those arrested had no criminal record at all.

“What we know is that there was a true, true injustice happening in our communities where we were being attacked for what we look like,” said Linda Tortolero with Latino Policy Forum. “We were being taken from our families and abducted because of the color of our skin and the fact that we speak Spanish.”

The judge overseeing the case has ordered immigration officials to provide detailed justification for each detention and signaled that some of those detained may have to be released if the government cannot demonstrate a clear public safety risk.

Those from the coalition expressed their renewed effort to all stick together and look out for one another.

“My hope is not just in what is happening today, and is not just in us coming together at this time, but it really is in the great potential that comes out of our sustainability,” said Karen Freeman-Wilson with Chicago Urban League.

In a recent statement, DHS said, “President (Donald) Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem said we’d secure the border, enforce our laws, reinstate integrity into our immigration system and protect American jobs and that’s exactly what we’ve done.”

Burns has been using artificial intelligence to generate audio recordings of his courtroom decisions at the New York Broadway Immigration Court, according to internal Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) records obtained by Migrant Insider.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by:

“That seems highly unusual,” said a senior Justice Department official familiar with EOIR operations, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. The official could not confirm whether Burns employs the AI to draft full written decisions or only to read his written rulings aloud using text‑to‑speech software, according to audio files reviewed by Migrant Insider.

A Test Case for AI in the Immigration Courts

The concern comes months after Acting EOIR Director Sirce E. Owen circulated Policy Memorandum 25‑40, which acknowledged that the immigration courts have “neither a blanket prohibition on the use of generative AI in its proceedings nor a mandatory disclosure requirement regarding its use.”

The August memo—distributed internally to all immigration judges and court administrators—permitted individual courts to adopt local standing orders on AI use but did not require them to disclose when such technologies are applied in adjudications.

The memo’s omission of any restriction on text‑to‑voice or AI‑generated decision delivery appears to leave it to individual judges’ discretion. Burns appears to be among the first to take advantage of that gap. His courtroom assistants said the use of “voice rendering” software began earlier this year and is now a regular feature of his decisions.

One of the Nation’s Most Restrictive Judges

Burns’ use of AI tools comes amid controversy over his record as one of the most restrictive immigration judges in the country. According to data compiled by

, Burns approved just 2 percent of asylum claims between fiscal 2019 and 2025—compared with a national average of 57.7 percent. Pathfinder data show the same 2 percent benchmark, placing him among the lowest nationwide.

The numbers have fueled criticism from immigration advocates, who say the fusion of extreme denial rates with opaque AI‑assisted adjudication threatens defendants’ faith in the system. “When a person’s freedom depends on a judge’s voice, there needs to be certainty that it’s the judge’s own reasoning being rendered—not a synthesized layer of technology,” said one immigration lawyer who practices before the Broadway court.

A Highly Controversial Appointment

Internal EOIR emails released through the memos show that Burns’ path to the bench was unusually political. Initially interviewed in May 2020, he was rated “highly qualified” by two Assistant Chief Immigration Judges for his litigation experience but ranked overall as “Not Recommend.” Senior EOIR leadership later overrode that ranking—reclassifying him as “Highly Recommended” in September 2020, just as Trump‑era DOJ officials accelerated appointments of judges with prosecutorial backgrounds.

At the time of his selection, Burns served as an Assistant Chief Counsel for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in New York, where he represented the government in removal proceedings and appeals. His résumé and military record were cited in his eventual appointment announcement that December, one of 14 judges named by the outgoing administration. Nearly all came from government enforcement roles, according to EOIR data logs.

Pattern of Political Replacement

The Burns memos form part of a broader DOJ paper trail indicating a systematic reshaping of the immigration judiciary. Recent EOIR correspondence references the removal—through firings and resignations—of more than 125 judges since January, replaced with politically aligned appointees.

An August rule further loosened hiring standards, allowing the Attorney General to appoint “any licensed attorney” as a temporary immigration judge.

Broader Due Process Implications

EOIR declined to comment on Burns’ use of text‑to‑voice technology or his designation history. A Justice Department spokesperson responded only that “immigration judges apply the law to the facts of each case.”

But as AI applications quietly enter immigration courtrooms without disclosure requirements or oversight, experts warn of an accelerating shift. “We’re witnessing the automation of adjudication in a system that already struggles with fairness,” said one former EOIR official. “When the human element fades, so does accountability.”

Polychroniou",,,,,https://truthout.org/articles/vance-blames-immigrants-biden-in-response-to-affordability-questions/,"Unlike President Donald Trump, Vance recognized that costs are up compared to last year.
The Trump White House “inherited this terrible inflation crisis from the Biden administration,” Vance said.
The vice president then blamed immigrants for the administration’s lack of action to make housing more affordable.
Christopher J. Calton, a research fellow at a nonpartisan think tank called The Independent, condemned the administration in May for blaming immigrants for rising prices.
Trump also disregarded rising prices in a lengthy Truth Social post over the weekend, writing that he and Republicans “are winning BIG” on “the Economy” and “Affordability.”","In an interview with Fox News last week, Vice President JD Vance downplayed the significance of rising inflation and costs for consumer goods in the U.S., claiming that any price increases are not the result of Trump administration policies.

Unlike President Donald Trump, Vance recognized that costs are up compared to last year. But he blamed former President Joe Biden for the increases.

The Trump White House “inherited this terrible inflation crisis from the Biden administration,” Vance said.

The vice president then blamed immigrants for the administration’s lack of action to make housing more affordable. (A new report from the National Association of Realtors, published earlier this month, notes that the median age of homebuyers in the U.S. is now 40 years old — the highest age ever recorded by the organization.)

“A lot of young people are saying, ‘Housing is way too expensive.’ Why is that? Because we flooded the country with 30 million illegal immigrants who are taking houses that ought, by right, go to American citizens,” Vance said.

This claim — frequently peddled by Vance and Trump to deflect blame for the state of the economy — is blatantly false, housing and immigration experts say.

There is “no significant relationship between unauthorized immigrants and general house price growth for each state in the U.S.,” said a joint study from researchers at Texas A&M and the University of Maine published earlier this year.

The National Immigration Forum similarly blasted such reasoning in an explainer on the subject last month, stating:

While immigrants do contribute to rising housing demand, they are not the primary drivers of increasing housing costs. Instead, factors such as housing shortages, restrictive zoning laws, and shifts in housing preferences in the wake of the pandemic are the more dominant forces behind rising prices. Furthermore, immigrant workers are essential to the housing supply, making up a crucial segment of the construction workforce that can address shortages and improving housing stock.

Christopher J. Calton, a research fellow at a nonpartisan think tank called The Independent, condemned the administration in May for blaming immigrants for rising prices.

“The simple truth is that we would have a severe housing shortage even if President Trump were to deport every undocumented immigrant tomorrow,” Calton said, adding that, “the longer we scapegoat immigrants for America’s self-imposed housing shortage, the longer it will take us to solve it.”

Beyond his bigoted remarks about immigrants, Vance’s other claim in the interview — that inflation is the fault of the previous administration — is also flawed.

While inflation was high under the Biden administration, most economists attributed it at the time to the reopening of the economy following the COVID pandemic, as demand for products went up and disruption in supply chains affected prices. “Greedflation” — when corporations use the effects of inflation to justify raising prices higher than is necessary in order to make more profits — also played a role in costs going up.

Even so, year-over-year inflation shrank slightly from 3.0 percent in 2023 to 2.9 percent in 2024. So far in 2025, it appears that inflation is on track to rise by 3.0 percent again.

While not a significantly huge increase, the rate change suggests that Vance’s arguments about an “inherited” inflation problem are false — if prices were getting better under Trump’s watch, that number would be lessening, not growing.

What’s more, studies demonstrate that Trump’s various tariffs have indeed contributed to a rise in retail prices for consumers, amounting to an effective tax rate of about 18 percent on American shoppers, the highest level since 1934.

Trump repeatedly promised to lower prices on the campaign trail last year, vowing to do so “on day one” of taking office. However, just weeks after he won his second term, Trump admitted that he might not be able to keep his pledge.

“I’d like to bring them down. It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard,” Trump said.

Presently, Trump is deflecting from concerns about affordability. In response to off-year elections earlier this month that saw huge wins for Democrats across the country, Trump insisted that voters were not casting their ballots based on concerns about affordability, describing the concept as a “con job” by Democrats. Instead, Trump said he and Republicans “are the ones that have done great on affordability.”

“Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down, and the press doesn’t report it,” Trump said during a White House event nearly two weeks ago.

But that claim is false: Grocery store prices, similar to inflation overall, have increased by 2.7 percent since Trump won the 2024 presidential election.

Trump also disregarded rising prices in a lengthy Truth Social post over the weekend, writing that he and Republicans “are winning BIG” on “the Economy” and “Affordability.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/2025_1117-vance.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:56:45.859852

On Sunday, Gregory Bovino, a top Border Patrol commander, on social media touted dozens of arrests in Charlotte as part of an effort dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Just a day earlier on Saturday, federal officials confirmed a surge of immigration enforcement there as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

“UTEP’s embrace of right-wing politics in the last few years has been alarming and is unreflective of El Paso. As a loving, welcoming community, the invitation of Tom Homan is contrary to the values most El Pasoans hold dear.

“Homan has been one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s cruel, hardline mass deportation tactics. Despite promises to go after the ‘worst of the worst,’ their efforts have done little but terrorize families, including mixed-status families, households with immigrants who have been in the country for decades, parents of U.S. citizens, and U.S. citizens themselves. And all of it has come with a significant emotional and financial cost to Americans.

“While I believe in productive debate and genuine conversation, I’m disappointed and ashamed that the leadership at UTEP is amplifying someone who is actively engaged in demonizing many of those who attend UTEP like DREAMERs, individuals in mixed-status families and first generation Americans, all of whom have long considered UTEP to be a safe place. Attendees should expect a white-washed, ugly rewriting of recent history.”

The university’s invitations of figures like former Vice President Mike Pence and Tom Homan have conspicuously occurred after senior leadership at UTEP intensely pushed back on hosting an event with Congresswoman Escobar and the Biden administration to celebrate the institution’s National Science Foundation grant award in 2024, claiming it would be a ‘political' event.

About Tom Homan

Tom Homan has a dishonorable history. Recent reporting details a lack of ethical judgement, corrupt behavior, and an eager willingness to execute the Trump administration’s cruel, un-American agenda. He played a central role in lobbying Republicans in Congress to syphon billions in taxpayer dollars to fund astronomically high levels for ICE, including the $1.24 billion detention camp in El Paso, which houses immigrants in inhumane conditions.

In February 2025, it was reported that Homan met several times with a right-wing activist with ties to the Proud Boys about the Trump administration’s deportation plans in Chicago. He was also a consultant for GEO Group, one of the private prison companies that has received millions in federal contracts from the Trump administration for the immigration enforcement. Most recently, Tom Homan was recorded by the FBI as part of an undercover operation accepting $50,000 in cash after indicating he could help the undercover agents — who were posing as business executives — win government contracts in a second Trump administration. The investigation was shut down by the FBI and Justice Department after a Trump Justice Department appointee called the case a “deep state” probe in early 2025. He also attacked the Catholic church – including El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz – for the criticism of his inhumane deportation tactics.

“Law enforcement officers risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe, and they do not deserve to be doxed or harassed simply for carrying out their duties,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand.”

In its 16-page complaint, the Trump administration says that it “will not comply” with the state statutes. However, Justice Department lawyers say the measures — which take effect Jan. 1 — “have the purpose and likely effect of impeding federal law enforcement in the State of California” by causing federal officers to fear they could face prosecution in state courts.

“If enforced against the Federal Government, the laws would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities,” the lawsuit says.

“If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people’s rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,” a spokesperson for Newsom said. “We’ll see the U.S. Department of Justice in court.”

“It’s problematic when Californians can’t tell the difference between a law enforcement officer who is charged with protecting them and a criminal who is attempting to cause them harm,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. “The FBI itself has warned that the practice of ICE agents wearing masks to obscure their identity has led to a rise in copycats committing crimes, threatening public safety and eroding trust in law enforcement. My office is responsible for defending the laws of California, and we will do so here.”

The Trump administration’s complaint notes that in June Newsom cast doubt on the legal validity of the legislation under discussion at that time. “We’re looking at the constitutionality of it. And it appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents,” Newsom said during an interview with podcaster Justin Kanew.

California and federal officials have been at loggerheads in court over immigration-related policies for years. Earlier this year, Newsom sued unsuccessfully to block Trump from deploying National Guard troops to protect immigration enforcement operations and federal buildings in Los Angeles.

""We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,"" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.

Officials said there were ""a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters"".

The DHS said it was carrying out the operation because North Carolina had failed to adhere to requests to keep nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees in custody, who had been released due to ""sanctuary policies"".

The complaint, filed in October, accused Department of Homeland Security officials of cramming people into dirty holding cells and not providing enough food and water, among other problems, as they sought to boost immigration arrests during the Operation Midway Blitz enforcement operation. It also claims that officials blocked attorney access at the site and coerced people into signing voluntary deportation forms.

The Tribune got a rare look inside Broadview’s ICE processing center in 2009. Here’s what we saw.

It was filed on behalf of Pablo Moreno Gonzalez and Felipe Agustin Zamacona, who were detained there for several days in October. The two men sought to represent a class of detainees, but the class-action status needed approval from a judge.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman on Monday handed the win to the plaintiffs, even though the government argued that detainees had differing experiences there, given that some were only held for a few hours.

But Gettleman found that the plaintiffs overcame that hurdle, while also meeting requirements around numbers of potential class members.

“Plaintiffs state that, according to ICE data, ICE detained 5,202 individuals at Broadview between January 1, 2025, and July 28, 2025,” Gettleman’s order said. “These figures are from the period prior to the announcement of ‘Operation Midway Blitz,’ which caused a dramatic increase in immigration enforcement in the Chicago area.”

The class is likely more than 1,000 people, the judge found.

The class certification came days after a federal magistrate judge and a cadre of attorneys became some of the only outsiders in recent months to tour the facility, which is now under a temporary restraining order that requires the government to improve conditions there.

After a full-day hearing earlier this month during which detainees described overcrowded cells and scant food, Gettleman found that conditions at the facility — which was not built to house people overnight — did not “pass constitutional muster.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CTC-L-broadview-black-caucus118_243497542_92295b.jpg?w=1024&h=735,N,,2025-11-17 20:57:05.500194

Falk was the UN special rapporteur for Palestinian human rights between 2008 and 2014 and Elver was the UN special rapporteur on the right to food from 2014 to 2020.
“A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,’” Falk told Al Jazeera on Sunday, from Ottawa.
He expressed alarm that Canadian officials may have detained them over their participation in the tribunal.
We know they have been outspoken in documenting and publicising the horrors inflicted on Gaza by Israel, and advocating for justice,” Woo told Al Jazeera.","Former UN special rapporteurs Richard Falk and Hilal Elver were detained and interrogated by Canadian authorities on Thursday while on their way to an event examining Canada’s role in the genocide in Gaza and continued abuses against Palestinians.

Falk, who turned 95 on the day he was detained, said that officials deemed he and his wife posed a “national security threat” to the country upon their arrival at an airport in Toronto. Falk was the UN special rapporteur for Palestinian human rights between 2008 and 2014 and Elver was the UN special rapporteur on the right to food from 2014 to 2020.

“A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,’” Falk told Al Jazeera on Sunday, from Ottawa. “It was my first experience of this sort — ever — in my life.”

Border agents took Falk and Elver’s passports, he told CBC, and brought them to an interview room. Falk said that authorities held him and Elver for over four hours, grilling them on their work on Israel and Gaza, and interrogating them about the genocide more generally. Eventually, they were released.

The questioning was “random and disorganized,” Falk said, but still an element of a global campaign to “punish those who endeavour to tell the truth about what is happening” in Gaza.

“It’s disappointing that Canada — after having acknowledged Palestinian statehood — would take such a hostile attitude toward a very forthright conference that really explained to a public, that hasn’t been so well-informed, the nature of the objections to what Israel has been doing,” he said. “It suggests a climate of governmental insecurity, I think, to try to clamp down on dissident voices.”

Advocates for Palestinian rights have sharply criticized Canada’s government for sending Israel military support, even though officials pledged to stop sending weapons that could end up in use in Gaza last year.

Canada’s Border Services Agency told CBC that the detention was “normal” and “should not be viewed as any indication of wrongdoing.”

Both Falk and Elver were slated to participate in the Palestine Tribunal on Canadian Responsibility, described by organizers as a “people’s tribunal on Canada’s complicity in the genocide and dispossession of Palestinians, including over the last two years in Gaza.”

Falk said he suspects they were stopped due to their planned participation in the event. He and his wife are both U.S. citizens, and have taught at prominent American universities.

The chair of the tribunal, Azeezah Kanji, told CBC that Falk’s detention was “outrageous.” Canadian Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, who supports the tribunal, said he was contacted by the conference’s organizers about Falk’s detention. He expressed alarm that Canadian officials may have detained them over their participation in the tribunal.

“We know they were here to attend the Palestine Tribunal. We know they have been outspoken in documenting and publicising the horrors inflicted on Gaza by Israel, and advocating for justice,” Woo told Al Jazeera. “If those are the factums for their detention, then it suggests that the Canadian government considers these acts of seeking justice for Palestine to be national security threats — and I’d like to know why.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/2025_11-17-richard-falk.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 17:56:55.975187

They can work legally, bring immediate family, apply for legal residency and eventually seek U.S. citizenship.","The Supreme Court agreed Monday to review a policy used under past administrations to deny migrants a chance to apply for asylum on the Mexican border until space opened up to process claims.

The justices will hear the Trump administration's appeal of lower court rulings that struck down the practice known as metering, in which U.S. border agents capped the number of people seeking asylum at border crossings by prohibiting migrants from setting foot in the U.S.

The administration pressed for the high court's intervention even after President Donald Trump suspended the asylum system on the first day of his second term and advocates for migrants said the lower-court rulings have no ongoing practical effect.

The case will be argued in the late winter or early spring.

Metering was first used during President Barack Obama's administration when large numbers of Haitians appeared at the main crossing to San Diego from Tijuana, Mexico. It was expanded to all border crossings from Mexico during Trump's first term in the White House.

The practice ended in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic led the government to restrict asylum-seekers even more severely. President Joe Biden formally rescinded the use of metering in 2021.

Still, the Justice Department said it wanted the justices to hear the case because the court rulings took away “a tool that administrations of both parties have deemed critical for controlling the processing of inadmissible aliens during border surges.”

U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant ruled in 2021 that metering violated the migrants' constitutional rights and a federal law requiring officials to screen anyone who shows up seeking asylum.

A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Bashant's ruling in a 2-1 decision. Twelve of the 29 judges on the San Francisco-based appeals court voted to rehear the case, a strong signal that may have caught the justices' attention.

People seeking refuge in the U.S. are able to apply for asylum once they are on American soil, regardless of whether they came legally. To qualify, they have to show a fear of persecution in their own country because of specific reasons, such as their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.

Starmer defended the government’s asylum plans, which have been met with alarm by many Labour MPs.
“We inherited a broken asylum system just as we inherited a broken economy, broken public services, a broken NHS.
“I didn’t fight an election as a Labour MP to bundle distressed children on to deportation flights,” one MP said.
“These reforms sound tough, but they won’t fix the real problems in the asylum system.","Keir Starmer is facing another major challenge to his authority as angry Labour MPs vowed to force changes to new hardline migration measures that would bring an escalation in the deportations of children and families.

The policies – which include the possibility of confiscating assets from asylum seekers to contribute to costs – have caused significant divisions inside the party, with some MPs accusing their colleagues of not taking seriously public anger about illegal migration and asylum.

The Conservatives have said they could support the government to pass the tough new laws in the event of a major Labour rebellion.

The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has outlined a number of radical measures, including how the government will attempt to change the way the European convention on human rights (ECHR) is interpreted by UK judges in an attempt to stop asylum seekers using their rights to a family life to avoid deportation.

Policies include consulting on enforcing the removal of families, including children, who have been refused the right to settle in the UK and have refused payments encouraging them to leave.

“We will launch a consultation on the process for enforcing the removal of families, including children,” a policy document released on Monday said.

Starmer defended the government’s asylum plans, which have been met with alarm by many Labour MPs.

“We inherited a broken asylum system just as we inherited a broken economy, broken public services, a broken NHS. So we have got to pick it up and fix it,” he told the Daily Mirror.

“We need to make sure there’s a consensus on this, that people have confidence in our asylum system, and the truth is that we need to stop people arriving who shouldn’t be here, and we need to return those who are found not to be genuine refugees.”

At least 20 MPs have publicly expressed concern about the policies including the Folkestone MP and former human rights barrister, Tony Vaughan, the select committee chair Sarah Owen and 2024 intake MPs including Simon Opher, Abitsam Mohamed and Neil Duncan-Jordan.

The chair of the housing and communities select committee, Florence Eshalomi, asked Mahmood in the Commons if she was certain there would not be “unintended consequences” from the policies.

Speaking in the Commons, Mahmood rebuked MPs for suggesting she was using divisive language. She mentioned the crude racial slur she said was “regularly” used against her by people telling her to “go back home”.

“I know through my own experience and the experience of my constituents just how divisive asylum has become in our country,” she said.

A government source said there would be a “huge amount of engagement” with worried Labour MPs and stressed there would be no deportations of unaccompanied children.

“The crisis at our borders is an existential issue for mainstream parties. If we don’t solve the crisis at our border, dark forces will follow,” they said. “Politics is about making arguments for things you think are right. That is what the home secretary is doing today.”

But MPs said there were in particular widespread concerns about “morally bankrupt” moves to ramp up the deportation of families – which in practice would mean increased detention of children before removal.

“I didn’t fight an election as a Labour MP to bundle distressed children on to deportation flights,” one MP said. Another MP in a Green-facing seat said they were facing an enormous backlash on social media. “It’s all terrible. Straight out of the far-right playbook. Lots of colleagues feel the same,” said a third.

Opher said the government “should stop the boats because it’s dangerous, and we should stop the scapegoating of immigrants because it’s wrong and cruel … Measures that create bureaucracy and insecurity do not offer clarity or strengthen control – they cost money, waste time and weaken the system.”

Owen, one of the key organisers against the government’s welfare cuts, said: “A strong immigration system doesn’t need to be a cruel one. It shouldn’t need saying – but refugees and asylum seekers are real people, fleeing war and persecution.”

Duncan-Jordan said: “My taxi driver this morning told me that after 20 years living in this country he no longer felt welcome, despite paying his taxes and making a contribution to the local community.

“British values extend beyond running a raffle or cutting the half-time orange. We are compassionate, tolerant and generous. Kicking out recognised asylum seekers doesn’t speak to any of our values. It hardens us as a nation and portrays Britain as a country like its weather – cold and uninviting.”

Several Labour aides also expressed their own discomfort and expressed scepticism that the government would be able to pass the proposals without a climbdown on some measures, including the seizures of assets and the rights of refugee families to reach permanent settlement sooner than the proposed 20 years.

The government has already been forced to clarify that it did not intend to proactively seize jewellery from refugees.

“I think what the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] will try and do first is seek to dilute these proposals,” one said. Another MP said they saw it as an “opening offer … I’m sure that they will want to try and hear concerns because we know what happens when they don’t.”

One MP in a marginal seat said they were particularly disturbed by the rhetoric that Britain is the “destination of choice” for refugees, which they said was straightforwardly untrue given the UK was the 14th most popular in the recent data.

But another MP said they did not think it would mean immediate rebellions or resignations: “We want to read the proposals and then hear from other interested parties and get expert advice.

“That is what happened with welfare and then the picture became clearer. No one doubts that there is a necessity to tackle illegal immigration but there are parts of this that do not strike me as an obvious deterrent and which will extend people’s suffering.”

However, a significant number of MPs said they were convinced of the need to undertake “the unthinkable” when it came to the asylum system, given the threat of Reform and the even more draconian measures that could come under a Nigel Farage government.

“People need to get real,” one minister said. “The public are moving a lot faster than colleagues on this because they recognise the stereotype of the deserving refugee has changed dramatically over the last decade because of the scale of people on the move.”

Refugee status will be made temporary and reviewed every 30 months, the Home Office’s asylum policy document reads.

The government also plans to weaken asylum seekers’ rights under article 8 of the ECHR, which provides for the “right to respect for family and private life”.

The policy document said this was being used by illegal migrants to “stop” their removal. It proposes “strengthening” the public interest in interfering with article 8 and limiting it to “immediate family”.

The UK will also lobby to “evolve” article 3 of the ECHR, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to counteract how it has “been expanded over time”, with it now being used to allow criminals to stay.

A new appeals body would be formed in an attempt to accelerate removals, the Home Office’s blueprint states. This would be staffed by “professionally trained adjudicators” and its aim would be to “expand the capacity of the appeals system”.

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of Refugee Council, said: “What’s being forgotten here is that behind these proposals are men, women and children who have survived war, persecution and unimaginable loss, and who arrive in the UK with almost nothing.

“These reforms sound tough, but they won’t fix the real problems in the asylum system. Instead, they risk creating more delays, more stress and more inhumane treatment for the very people the system is meant to protect.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e2851968b094865d1a962db537f9efce9b76d8c/581_0_4861_3889/master/4861.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1ed725afe622d79fc010f03afc677178",N,,2025-11-17 19:56:49.343520

B.P.J. | Constitutional Accountability Center,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/little-v-hecox-and-west-virginia-v-b-p-j/,"Transgender students seeking to join women’s and girls’ sports teams, Lindsay Hecox and B.P.J, a minor using her initials, challenged the laws in separate lawsuits.
To begin, Idaho’s HB 500 and West Virginia’s HB 3293 classify students based on sex.
And West Virginia’s HB 3293 uses B.P.J.’s sex—“based solely” on her “reproductive biology and genetics at birth”—to determine that she cannot join girls’ athletics teams and sports.
Similarly, West Virginia’s HB 3293 bars all transgender girls and women from playing on athletic teams for women or girls.
The Idaho and West Virginia laws cannot survive heightened judicial review as applied here and thus violate the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.","Idaho’s HB 500 and West Virginia’s HB 3293 expressly classify students based on their sex assigned at birth and prohibit all transgender women and girls from joining women’s and girls’ sports teams across all levels of competition at any public educational institution. These statutes also subject cisgender and transgender women and girls—but not any men or boys—to invasive sex-verification procedures to determine their eligibility to join public-school sports teams. Transgender students seeking to join women’s and girls’ sports teams, Lindsay Hecox and B.P.J, a minor using her initials, challenged the laws in separate lawsuits.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit considered whether these laws’ sex-based exclusions of Hecox and B.P.J. satisfied intermediate scrutiny, the doctrinal test required for sex-based classifications to pass constitutional muster. Longstanding Supreme Court precedent underscores that classifications that treat individuals differently based on their sex must “serve important governmental objectives” and “the discriminatory means employed [must be] substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” In concluding that the challenged statutes fall short of this demanding standard, the Ninth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit both acknowledged a government interest in promoting competitive fairness in athletics but rejected the notion that, as applied to Hecox and B.P.J., categorical bans on the participation of all transgender women and girls on women’s and girls’ sports teams substantially furthered that interest. Instead, such sweeping prohibitions reduce these students to the mere fact of their sex—and deny them the equal opportunity to participate in public-school athletics and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities.

In November 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in support of the student athletes. Our brief makes three principal points.

First, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equality under the law, prohibiting states from denying to “any person” the “equal protection of the laws.” As the Amendment’s text and history make clear, the Equal Protection Clause establishes a broad guarantee of equality for all persons, securing the same rights and protection under the law regardless of race, sex, or class. Its framers consciously chose universal language intended to secure equal rights for all people. Under the Amendment’s plain text and original meaning, this sweeping guarantee of equality applies to everyone, and states may not impose invidious class-based discrimination that bans students from public-school activities, including sports, based on their sex.

Second, the Nineteenth Amendment buttressed the Fourteenth Amendment’s promise of equality. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment imposed a penalty of reduced congressional representation on states that denied or abridged the right to vote to any of the state’s “male inhabitants,” implicitly sanctioning the disenfranchisement of women. Women’s-rights activists celebrated the Fourteenth Amendment’s universal embrace of equality, but rejected the notion that our foundational promises of democracy, freedom, and equality were real when half the population was excluded from voting based on sex. Demanding fundamental constitutional change, women’s-rights activists finally succeeded with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. The Nineteenth Amendment deepened the Fourteenth Amendment’s core promise of equality, guaranteeing equal citizenship to all regardless of sex and rejecting state-sponsored discrimination rooted in sex-based stereotypes about physical bodies and social roles.

Third, consistent with the text and history of the Fourteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, the Supreme Court has long held that “gender-based classifications . . . require ‘an exceedingly persuasive justification’ in order to survive constitutional scrutiny.” Idaho’s and West Virginia’s laws cannot satisfy this standard. To begin, Idaho’s HB 500 and West Virginia’s HB 3293 classify students based on sex. Idaho’s HB 500 bars Lindsay Hecox from competing on the women’s sports teams she attempted to join because the law identifies her as a “student[] of the male sex” based on her sex assigned at birth. And West Virginia’s HB 3293 uses B.P.J.’s sex—“based solely” on her “reproductive biology and genetics at birth”—to determine that she cannot join girls’ athletics teams and sports. Next, these sex-based classifications do not further the state governments’ stated goals of maintaining competitive fairness in women’s sports. Idaho’s law is remarkably overbroad and covers students who have no relevant advantage over cisgender woman athletes, including Hecox, who is barred from women’s sports teams even though she is prescribed hormone therapy that, as the Ninth Circuit noted, has dramatically altered her body and removed physiological traits that would differentiate her from cisgender peers. Similarly, West Virginia’s HB 3293 bars all transgender girls and women from playing on athletic teams for women or girls.

(Shabana Mahmood)

With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will make a statement about how we restore order and control to our borders. I do so as this Government publish the most significant reform to our migration system in modern times.

This country will always offer sanctuary to those fleeing danger, but we must also acknowledge that the world has changed and our asylum system has not changed with it. Our world is a more volatile and more mobile place. Huge numbers are on the move. While some are refugees, others are economic migrants seeking to use and abuse our asylum system. Even genuine refugees are passing through other safe countries, searching for the most attractive place to seek refuge.

The burden that has fallen on this country has been heavy: 400,000 have sought asylum here in the past four years. Over 100,000 people now live in asylum accommodation, and over half of refugees remain on benefits eight years after they have arrived. To the British public, who foot the bill, the system feels out of control and unfair. It feels that way because it is. The pace and scale of change have destabilised communities. It is making our country a more divided place. There will never be a justification for the violence and racism of a minority, but if we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.

I have no doubt about who we really are in this country: we are open, tolerant and generous. But the public rightly expect that we can determine who enters this country and who must leave. To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.

Rather than deal substantively with this problem, the last Conservative Government wasted precious years and £700 million on their failed Rwanda plan, with the lamentable result of just four volunteers removed from the country. As a result, they left us with the grotesque chaos of asylum seekers housed in hotels and shuttled around in taxis, with the taxpayer footing the bill.

My predecessor as Home Secretary picked up this dreadful inheritance and rebuilt the foundations of a collapsed asylum system. Decision making has been restored, with a backlog now 18% lower than when we entered office. Removals have increased, reaching nearly 50,000 under this Government. Immigration enforcement has hit record levels, with over 8,000 arrests in the last year. The Border Security Bill is progressing through Parliament, and my predecessor struck an historic agreement with the French so that small boat arrivals can now be sent back to France.

Those are vital steps, but we must go further. Today, we have published ""Restoring Order and Control"", a new statement on our asylum policy. Its goals are twofold: first, to reduce illegal arrivals into this country, and secondly, to increase removals of those with no right to be here. It starts by accepting an uncomfortable truth: while asylum claims fall across Europe, they are rising here, and that is because of the comparative generosity of our asylum offer compared with many of our European neighbours. That generosity is a factor that draws people to these shores, on a path that runs through other safe countries. Nearly 40% come on small boats and over perilous channel crossings, but a roughly equal proportion come legally, via visitor, work or study visas, and then go on to claim asylum. They do so because refugee status is the most generous route into this country. An initial grant lasts five years and is then converted, almost automatically, into permanent settled status.

In other European countries, things are done differently. In Denmark, refugee status is temporary, and they provide safety and sanctuary until it is possible for a refugee to return home. In recent years, asylum claims in Denmark have hit a 40-year low, and now countries across Europe are tightening their systems in similar ways. We must act too. We will do so by making refugee status temporary, not permanent. A grant of refugee status will last for two and a half years, not five years. It will be renewed only if it is impossible for a refugee to return home. Permanent settlement will now come at 20 years, not five years.

I know that this country welcomes people who contribute. For those who want to stay, and who are willing and able to, we will create a new work and study visa route solely for refugees, with a quicker path to permanent settlement. To encourage refugees into work, we will also consult on removing benefits for those who are able to work but choose not to. Outside the most exceptional circumstances, family reunion will not be possible, with a refugee able to bring family over only if they have joined a work and study route, and if qualifying tests are met.

Although over 50,000 claimants have been granted refugee status in the past year, more than 100,000 claimants and failed asylum seekers remain in taxpayer-funded accommodation. We know that criminal gangs use the prospect of free bed and board to promote their small boat crossings. We have already announced that we will empty asylum hotels by the end of this Parliament, and we are exploring a number of large military sites as an alternative. We will now also remove the 2005 legislation that created a duty to support asylum seekers, reverting to a legal power to do so instead. We will continue to support those who play by the rules, but those who do not—be that through criminality or antisocial behaviour—can have their support removed.

We will also remove our duty to support those who have a right to work. It is right that those who receive support pay for it if they can, so those with income or assets will have to contribute to the cost of their stay. That will end the absurdity that we currently experience, in which an asylum seeker receiving £800 each month from his family, and who had recently acquired an Audi, was receiving free housing at the taxpayer's expense, and the courts judged that we could do nothing about it.

The measures are designed to tackle the pull factors that draw people to this country, but reducing the number of arrivals is just half of the story. We must also enforce our rules and remove those who have no right to be here. That will mean restarting removals to countries where they have been paused. In recent months, we have begun the voluntary removal of failed asylum seekers to Syria once again. However, many failed asylum seekers from Syria are still here, most of whom fled a regime that has since been toppled. Other countries are planning to enforce removals, and we will follow suit. Where a failed asylum seeker cannot be returned home, we will also continue to explore the possibility of return hubs, with negotiations ongoing.

We must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are. Today, we are not removing family groups, even when we know that their home country is perfectly safe. There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims—despite an existing returns agreement, and Albania being a signatory to the European convention on human rights. So we will now begin the removal of families. Where possible, we will encourage a voluntary return, but where an enforced return is necessary, that is what we will do.

Where the barrier to a return is not the individual, nor the UK Government, but the receiving country, we will take action. I can announce that we have told Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Namibia that if they do not comply with international rules and norms, we will impose visa penalties on them. I am sending a wider message here: unless other countries heed this lesson, further sanctions will follow.

Much of the delay in our removals, however, comes from the sclerotic nature of our own system. In March of this year, the appeals backlog stood at 51,000 cases. This Government have already increased judicial sitting days, but reform is required, so we will create a new appeals body, staffed by professional independent adjudicators, and we will ensure that early legal representation is available to advise claimants and ensure their issues are properly considered. Cases with a low chance of success will be fast-tracked, and claimants will have just one opportunity to claim and one to appeal, ending the merry-go-round of claims and appeals that frustrate so many removals.

While some barriers to removal are the result of process, others are substantive issues related to the law itself. There is no doubt that the expanded interpretation of parts of the European convention on human rights has contributed. This is particularly true of article 8: the right to a family life. The courts have adopted an ever-expanding interpretation of that right. As a result, many people have been allowed to come to this country when they would otherwise have had no right to, and we have been unable to remove others when the case for doing so seems overwhelming. That includes cases like an arsonist, sentenced to five years in prison, whose deportation was blocked on the grounds that his relationship with his sibling may suffer. More than half of those detained are now delaying or blocking their removal by raising a last-minute rights claim.

Article 8 is a qualified right, which means we are not prevented from removing individuals or refusing an application to move to the UK if it is in the public interest. To narrow article 8 rights, we will therefore make three important changes, in both domestic law and to our immigration rules. First, we will define what, exactly, a family is—narrowing it down to parents and their children. Secondly, we will define the public interest test so that the default becomes a removal or refusal, with article 8 rights only permissible in the most exceptional circumstances. Thirdly, we will tighten where article 8 claims can be heard, ensuring only those who are living in the UK can lodge a claim, rather than their family members overseas, and that all claims are heard first by the Home Office and not in a courtroom.

We will also pursue international reform of a second element of the convention: the application of article 3, and the prohibition on torture and inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment. We will never return anyone to be tortured in their home country, but the definition of ""degrading treatment"" has expanded into the realm of the ridiculous. Today we have criminals who we seek to deport, but we discover we cannot because the prisons in their home country have cells that are deemed too small, or even mental health provision that is not as good as our own. As article 3 is an absolute right, a public interest test cannot be applied. For that reason, we are seeking reform at the Council of Europe, and we do so alongside international partners who have raised similar concerns.

It is not just international law that binds us. According to data from 2022, over 40% of those detained for removal claimed that they were modern-day slaves. That well-intentioned law is being abused by those who seek to frustrate a legitimate removal, so I will bring forward legislation that tightens the modern slavery system, to ensure that it protects those it was designed for, and not those who seek to abuse it. Taken together, these are significant reforms. They are designed to ensure that our asylum system is fit for the modern world, and that we retain public consent for the very idea of providing refuge.

We will always be a country that offers protection to those fleeing peril, just as we did in recent years when Ukraine was invaded, when Afghanistan was evacuated, and when we repatriated Hongkongers. For that reason, as order and control are restored, we will open new, capped, safe and legal routes into this country. These will make sponsorship the primary means by which we resettle refugees, with voluntary and community organisations given greater involvement to both receive refugees and support them, working within caps set by Government. We will also create a new route for displaced students to study in the UK, and another for skilled refugees to work here. Of course, we will always remain flexible to new crises across the world, as they happen.

I know that the British people do not want to close the doors, but until we restore order and control, those who seek to divide us will grow stronger. It is our job as a Labour Government to unite where there is division, so we must now build an asylum system for the world as it is—one that restores order and control, that opens safe and legal routes to those fleeing danger across the world, and that sustains our commitment to providing refuge for this generation, and those to come. I know the country we are. We are open, tolerant, and generous. We are the greater Britain that those on this side of the House believe in, not the littler England that some wish we would become. These reforms are designed to bring unity where others seek to divide, and I commend this statement to the House.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Marsham_Street.jpg/640px-Marsham_Street.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 17:57:01.042355

UNHCR notes the 17 November announcement by the Home Secretary outlining proposed changes to the UK asylum system.

We share the Government’s concern regarding the dangerous journeys undertaken by refugees and migrants, the abuses perpetrated by smugglers and gangs, and the challenges that these movements present to governments. We also welcome the Government’s commitment to maintaining the UK’s strong tradition of providing sanctuary and safety to people fleeing conflict and persecution, while ensuring well-managed borders – both are compatible goals.

Refugees are not migrants. They are people fleeing conflict, instability and human rights abuses - circumstances no one would willingly choose. Fair, efficient asylum systems are essential to swiftly identify refugees and provide the protection they need. These should be coupled with well-managed migration pathways that alleviate pressure on asylum systems - often used by those seeking to move for economic reasons - with mechanisms that ensure the swift return of individuals who are found not to have valid claims. This dual approach is central to maintaining well-managed borders. We note the progress made in this regard and will continue to support these efforts.

We also encourage the UK to continue to work with European and other partners on cooperative arrangements to effectively manage irregular arrivals while sharing responsibility for refugees and upholding international protection. With the right safeguards in place, this may include lawful transfers of some asylum-seekers to other countries, including through mechanisms like the UK-France ‘one-in, one-out’ arrangement.

For those whose claims are assessed in the UK, and who are found to be refugees, safety means more than just a grant of asylum. UNHCR urges that they be given a stable status that allows them to rebuild their lives and reunite with their families, while a long-term, durable solution is sought. For some, this will be a return home when circumstances allow. But in view of the protracted nature of many of today’s conflicts, and the persistence of repressive regimes, for many, it entails the heart-breaking reality of building a future elsewhere.

Early investment in refugee integration is in everyone’s interest. UNHCR supports approaches that help refugees rebuild their lives in safety and contribute to their new communities, as so many are doing here in the UK. In contrast, short-term stay arrangements and stringent limitations on refugee family reunion often create prolonged uncertainty and despair, undermining integration and social cohesion. Such arrangements can be complex and costly to administer, and may ultimately not deter arrivals. Building understanding of why refugees flee and ensuring accurate, balanced narratives are equally vital for social cohesion.

UNHCR welcomes the Government’s commitment to safe, regular routes for refugees to be welcomed to the UK, drawing on the experience of the UK Resettlement Scheme and initiatives for Syrians, Ukrainians and Afghans. Such pathways provide a lifeline for refugees unable to live safely or realize their potential where they are, and are a means of sharing responsibility with countries hosting most of the world’s refugees. If accessible and realized at scale, they can provide managed alternatives to dangerous, irregular journeys. This work should be rooted in wider cooperation with European and other governments ‘upstream’ in large refugee-hosting and transit countries to help provide real alternatives to dangerous onward journeys and stabilize movements by strengthening rights, lawful stay and work opportunities.

In a time of unprecedented global displacement, empathy, efficiency, responsibility-sharing and international cooperation are essential to protect displaced people, with measures that work for both states and refugees. UNHCR stands ready to continue working closely with the UK Government, and all governments, to ensure a managed, shared approach to forced displacement that maintains access to asylum, upholds rights and promotes social cohesion.

It happened on Nov. 10 at around 10:40 p.m., when Riverside County Sheriff's Department deputies were dispatched to the Sommers Bend community after learning of someone who was ""brandishing a firearm"" in the area, according to a news release from RSO.

Upon arrival, deputies spoke with the reporting party, who told them that his 17-year-old son was ""stopped by a subject in the roadway while driving in a residential neighborhood."" He also told deputies that the man displayed a badge before ordering the teenager out of the car at gunpoint.

The teen was eventually released to his parents after complying, deputies said. Family members say that he was on his way home from a party when the incident happened.

Investigators with the Southwest Sheriff's Station's Investigation Bureau assumed the case and identified the suspect as 45-year-old Gerardo Rodriguez.

Greg Kirakosian, the attorney representing the family, says that Rodriguez is an agent with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The teenager and his parents are Mexican-American U.S. citizens, Kirakosian told CBS Los Angeles.

""My client thought, and his family thought, he was either gonna be shot dead, or he was gonna be taken by ICE that night,"" Kirakosian said.

Rodriguez was arrested at his home without incident by RSO investigators, at which point a search warrant was authored and served. Deputies discovered and collected evidence related to the investigation.

Home surveillance video of the incident was shared by Kirakosian, which shows a man they say is Rodriguez pacing along the street while holding what looks to be a gun. As a pickup truck approaches, Rodriguez can be heard shouting, ""Freeze, police! Put the car in park right now!"" while pointing the alleged gun at the vehicle. He can then be seen opening the front door and telling the teenager to sit down.

Kirakosian claims that Rodriguez demanded the teenager's ID, told him he knew where he lived and threatened to investigate his family for more than 10 minutes before he finally let him go when neighbors intervened.

""I think he and his family are scared, just like everybody else in Southern California, all the way to Chicago, are scared, and this is getting so out of hand,"" Kirakosian said. ""ICE agents are doing this when they're off the clock, at home, in their pajamas, they're using their badge and their gun, and investigating people in the neighborhood.""

Rodriguez was booked for assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer, according to the Sheriff's Department news release.

CBS Los Angeles has reached out to DHS, ICE and Customs and Border Protection for comment on the incident. They have not yet confirmed the family attorney's statement that Rodriguez is a federal agent.

As their investigation continues, RSO investigators ask anyone with further details to contact them at (951) 696-3000.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/17/0b4fabc3-e067-4279-bbdd-4c032d15ad98/thumbnail/1200x630/fb77ba82c76bf9db5fc56e6a3a201aa8/temecula-federal-agent.png,N,,2025-11-17 16:57:38.437864

Just 2.6% of those detained were found to have prior offenses that the government deemed significant enough to fall under the ""high public safety risk"" classification.
Judge Cummings emphasized that the court's role is not to shape immigration policy but to ensure compliance with existing orders.
""There will be nothing for me to do if arrests made during this Operation Midway Blitz are within the decree,"" he said.","Federal court documents show that, out of 607 people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Chicago, only 16 were classified by the government as a ""high public safety risk,"" despite weeks of intensified enforcement under Operation Midway Blitz.

The list, released as part of ongoing litigation over potentially unlawful arrests, also identified one person as a national security risk and another as a ""foreign criminal,"" but provided no additional details.

The figures, reported by CBS News, come as a federal judge considers ordering the release of hundreds of detainees after finding that many arrests may have violated an existing court order that restricts warrantless detentions. The court-required list includes each person's name, country of citizenship, and whether they remain in custody, were deported, or left the country voluntarily.

According to the government's own assessments, 78% of the 607 detainees were categorized as posing a low public safety risk, while only 7% were considered high risk — and not all in that category had criminal histories. Just 2.6% of those detained were found to have prior offenses that the government deemed significant enough to fall under the ""high public safety risk"" classification.

Eric Balliet, a retired Homeland Security Investigations special agent with 25 years of experience, told CBS News that the numbers contradict repeated statements by the Trump administration that operations in Chicago were targeting ""the worst of the worst:""

""It confuses the public. It certainly instills a sense of fear,"" he said. ""To go after violent criminals, that's a lot of work. That's a lot of effort. That's a lot of time, and candidly, from the people I've talked to, the department and the agency doesn't want to expense that time, that strategic and operational planning to actually get the worst of the worst""

The arrests are now at the center of a broader legal challenge. On November 12, U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings ruled that hundreds of ICE arrests carried out in Chicago and across Illinois may have violated the Castañon Nava Consent Decree, a 2022 order that bars federal agents from detaining individuals without warrants or probable cause. The judge found that DHS and ICE had repeatedly violated the decree, and that field offices were incorrectly told it had been canceled.

Cummings ordered that 615 people detained between June 2 and October 7 be released into Alternatives to Detention programs on bond by November 21. The court also mandated that the government produce a full list of all people detained by ICE and Border Patrol during Operation Midway Blitz — believed to exceed 3,000 arrests — including risk assessments and country-of-origin information.

In a FOX News interview, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said more redeployments were imminent and suggested Chicago could again become a target. He also signaled plans for more arrests, saying, ""If he releases those 650, we're going to apprehend 1,650 on the streets of Chicago.""

Judge Cummings emphasized that the court's role is not to shape immigration policy but to ensure compliance with existing orders.

For years, advocates have criticized ICE for using it in immigration enforcement and surveillance operations.
But per the ruling, ICE agents in Los Angeles can legally constitute reasonable suspicion on the basis of assumed race or ethnicity until the merits of the case are decided.
And in Los Angeles earlier this month, ICE agents took a toddler during another immigration raid at a Home Depot in Cypress Park.
He also justifies the Trump Administration’s argument that such metrics fall under the definition of reasonable suspicion, writing, “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion .","Outside a Home Depot in Westlake, Los Angeles, it was typical for day workers to gather in the parking lot to find work with contractors and homeowners visiting the store. But on June 6, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted violent immigration raids across the city, white vans rushed into the parking lot and unloaded masked officers who, after asking around in Spanish for day workers, handcuffed and arrested people.

The raid, along with a similar one that occurred at an apparel warehouse in another part of the city on the same day, prompted Los Angeles court district judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) a little over a month later covering several Southern California counties. Frimpong wrote that her decision was based on “ample evidence that seizures occurred based solely upon” one of four factors—an individual’s apparent race or ethnicity, their accent or use of Spanish, their presence at a farm or known work pickup site, or the type of work they do.

Using race to determine reasonable suspicion is an issue that has been argued in front of the Supreme Court for decades. In the long history of government surveillance, detention, and deportation, the use of race by multiple federal government agencies in a variety of contexts is nothing new. For years, advocates have criticized ICE for using it in immigration enforcement and surveillance operations.

The Los Angeles case was soon brought to the Supreme Court, which, on September 8, voted 6 to 3 on ideological lines, issuing an opinion in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo overturning the TRO. The decision was unsigned, which in Court precedent typically indicates that the case matter is non-controversial. It also only applies to the restraining order—not the merits of the case as a whole—which will be debated in future litigation surrounding the raids. But per the ruling, ICE agents in Los Angeles can legally constitute reasonable suspicion on the basis of assumed race or ethnicity until the merits of the case are decided. To immigration experts, the decision has “effectively legalized racial profiling.”

Now, the city of Los Angeles and its communities are grappling with the practical implications of the Court’s decision. Street vendors with legal residencies in the Boyle Heights neighborhood have begun carrying their passports, Real ID cards, and green cards with them at all times, making the difficult choice between asserting their right to exist without proof of residency and avoiding the risk of being targeted by an ICE agent and not having their documentation. In an attempt to prevent further fallout, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency in mid-October which lays the groundwork to provide eviction moratoriums for tenants too afraid to leave their homes for fear of arrest.

The lower courts and legal advocates, including Immigration Defenders Law Center managing attorney Brynna Bolt, have argued that the use of the four factors by ICE agents during patrols in Los Angeles—and around the country—is purely racial profiling. “The individuals that we’ve seen swept up, they are primarily Latino, primarily Spanish speaking, primarily working or arrested in proximity to places where people work low-wage jobs,” Bolt tells The Progressive. “We have clients who have lawful immigration status who have been swept up in the raids.”

Though the Supreme Court decision only pertains to Los Angeles and the surrounding areas, it signals the permissibility of racial profiling in the eyes of the Court. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh claims that immigration stops would be a small inconvenience to citizens or legal residents. But in Ventura County, one of seven in California where racial profiling is now temporarily sanctioned, a U.S. citizen was arrested and detained by masked agents who subsequently refused to allow him to produce identification verifying his legal status.

The man, George Retes, is an Army veteran who was held in an immigration detention center for three days and denied access to a lawyer and a phone call. Retes missed his daughter’s third birthday while in detention. “It would have taken them two minutes to check my papers and confirm that I was a citizen,” Retes wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle. “Instead, they arrested me because I was there.” According to the Federal Tort Claims Act, Retes must wait six months after filing an administrative claim with ICE before he can file a lawsuit against the U.S government for being unconstitutionally detained, which he plans to do.

Meanwhile, ICE stops have become increasingly chaotic and violent. In September, an ICE agent fatally shot a man in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, claiming the man had dragged one of the officers with his car; body camera footage released later recorded the officer describing his injuries as “nothing major.” In Boston, Massachusetts, a family has accused ICE of using their five-year-old daughter to lure her father out to agents for arrest. And in Los Angeles earlier this month, ICE agents took a toddler during another immigration raid at a Home Depot in Cypress Park.

The opinion has had a chilling effect on citizens of color throughout the country, some of whom have begun carrying their passports, deleting social media apps from their phone before trips, and canceling trips altogether, as residents of all documentation statuses fear being swept up in ICE raids.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has denied that any use of racial profiling, writing on X that “allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE” and calling the criticisms “anti-ICE LIES.”

Even though immigration policies and programs have been technically considered colorblind, or race-neutral, due to a Civil Rights Era overhaul, immigration enforcement has in practice long employed racial profiling. “That’s always been an issue with immigration,” Bolt says. As a result, immigrant communities of color often fear going out due to pervasive stories of deportation and potential raids that manifest into emotional trauma.

As government surveillance ramped up in the decades after the 9/11 attacks, DHS has employed social media surveillance that specifically targets Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Muslim individuals. Both the DHS and the FBI use Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—which was just expanded by Congress in 2024—to disproportionately surveil Middle Eastern and South Asian Americans, coordinating with corporations like Meta, Google, Microsoft, Verizon and AT&T.

In 2017, the FBI similarly surveilled Black people in an intelligence assessment entitled “Black Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers.” The agency’s actions echoed its historical surveillance of civil rights and Black Panther Party leaders, which was used as a part of a campaign to “discredit, or otherwise neutralize” Black power movements and which resulted in the deaths of Panther leaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.

Now, ICE is following suit by bolstering its surveillance capabilities. The agency is planning to set up intelligence-gathering centers in Vermont and California where contracted senior analysts and researchers can use a combination of social media and law enforcement and federal government database searches to target individuals for deportation.

As Wired reported last month, previous ICE surveillance tools have been the subject of lawsuits over their use in targeting civilians, threatening privacy rights, and sidestepping warrant requirements by collecting “vast amounts of data with no clear link to its enforcement mandate.”

In California, Bolt says that the use of race by immigration agents was already evident: “The federal government has made clear in this case and in the public square and by its own actions that they’re going to continue doing what they’re doing, and that the enforcement operation in Southern California is being driven by race.”

While there was no official written opinion in Noem, Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion downplays the detrimental effects of immigration stops. He also justifies the Trump Administration’s argument that such metrics fall under the definition of reasonable suspicion, writing, “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion . . . . However, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

Kavanaugh’s claim cites the Supreme Court precedent set in 1975’s United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, which found that the Fourth Amendment did not justify Border Patrol agents stopping individuals solely based on the assumption of “Mexican ancestry,” but that race could be used in conjunction with other factors. In Noem, he states that, “Whether an officer has reasonable suspicion depends on the totality of the circumstances.” The current case, he argues, includes the known presence of “an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area” and that they “tend” to work certain jobs and “do not speak much English.”

Legal experts, including Rory Little writing for SCOTUSblog, warn that if Kavanaugh’s concurrent opinion in the temporary decision holds weight further down the road, “his view would constitute a significant doctrinal shift in ‘reasonable suspicion’ Fourth Amendment doctrine.”

The original case, which will determine the merit of using racial characteristics in constituting reasonable suspicion, is currently pending in district court. How the Supreme Court will rule on it is unclear, but their decisions in Noem have given some indication of where the Justices stand. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor spears Kavanaugh’s concurrence, claiming that it “relegates the interests of U.S. citizens and individuals with legal status to a single sentence.”

Sotomayor also reiterates an interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that requires federal agents to rely on “specific articulable facts” to form a “particularized and objective basis” when determining reasonable suspicion, as was decided in 1981 in United States v. Cortez. Traits such as apparent race or language spoken, Sotomayor writes, are facts that “apply to a large category of presumably innocent people,” and therefore cannot indicate illegal presence any more than they could indicate legal presence.

The Supreme Court’s willingness to permit the use of race in Noem remains a stark example of the double standards that it has used when deciding racial cases in the past. As Stanford Law School professor Jennifer Chacón writes in Border Criminologies, “only in immigration policing cases does the Court explicitly reason that someone’s (racialized) appearance alone gets a law enforcement officer almost 100 percent of the way toward ‘reasonable suspicion.’ ”

Still, while Noem has legalized its use in immigration enforcement, the federal government has long been used in the United States to target certain individuals, citizens or not, and it likely won’t stop anytime soon.",https://progressive.org/downloads/22313/download/ICERacialProfiling.jpg?cb=9019bf0529238482c98d86dc90a4ab11&w=1200,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:37.994366

This excerpt features Government Accountability Project whistleblower client Erez Reuveni and was originally published here.

April 7

A senior lawyer in the Office of Immigration Litigation, Erez Reuveni, acknowledged in court that the Trump administration wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran construction worker who lived in Maryland for a dozen years, to El Salvador, where he was being held in a notorious maximum-security prison. In previous administrations, including Trump’s first term, the government routinely worked to get people back when they were deported without legal authority. In this case, however, Bondi put Reuveni on leave and then fired him.

David McConnell, director of the Office of Immigration Litigation: Erez was one of the more aggressive litigators over the years. He vigorously defended Trump 1 policies. I thought he’d be the go-to person for defending them in the second term. When he got fired, everyone doing district court work thought, This could happen to me. Traditionally, we didn’t have a lot of turnover in the office. But now I’ve heard that around 60 out of 320 attorneys have left since February.

Sarah Buckley, Environment and Natural Resources Division: When Erez Reuveni got fired, that really affected morale. He was working under the gun with his clients to say, This isn’t a reasonable way to proceed in court — what’s a reasonable way? And they punished him for it.",https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DOJ-Building.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:42.407456

If Mr. Carlson wanted to interview Mr. Fuentes, then “get the word out,” Mr. Trump said.
The document dump fueled the drama over Mr. Epstein that has engulfed Mr. Trump, Mr. Johnson and his Republican majority.
Mr. Trump dismissed the emails as a “hoax” to drive attention away from the government shutdown, which he blamed on Democrats.","But with beef prices approaching $10 per pound, the Trump administration is scrambling to bring them down, including by lowering tariffs on beef imports and trying to address a shortage of cows. With many Americans frustrated by Mr. Trump’s tariffs, his advisers have been straining to blame the high cost of hamburgers — and anything else — on anyone other than the president.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to explain high beef prices over the weekend by blaming undocumented immigrants, saying they were bringing sick cows into the United States. Mr. Bessent said that forced the Trump administration to halt imports of beef from Mexico, which is the second-largest supplier of beef to the United States.

“Because of the mass immigration, a disease that we’d been rid of in North America made its way up from South America, as these migrants brought some of their cattle with them,” Mr. Bessent said on Fox News on Sunday.

The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for an explanation about Mr. Bessent’s suggestion that sick cows were being brought from Mexico across the border. Mr. Bessent was referring to the spread of New World screwworm, a parasite that the United States has been working with Mexico to eradicate.

Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration is “laser focused” on fixing the problem and added: “This is the perfect storm, again something we inherited.”

The Trump administration has been taking other measures to contend with rising beef costs. Mr. Trump announced this month that he asked the Department of Justice to investigate meat companies that he said were driving up prices through “illicit collusion.”

Last month, Mr. Trump said that he would ease import restrictions on beef from Argentina in an effort to lower prices in the United States. The plan angered American cattle ranchers, who argue that meat prices are reasonable and that more competition will harm their businesses.

Mr. Trump’s economic advisers have acknowledged that it will not be easy to get grocery prices to fall meaningfully in the near term and have instead focused on wage increases to make the case that “affordability” is improving. That is a shift from Mr. Trump’s promise as a presidential candidate last year to lower the price of groceries.

Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said on CNBC on Monday that “purchasing power” has improved under the Trump administration and lamented that the president is being blamed for failing to reduce food costs faster.

“There’s a million things that we’re doing to fix this problem,” Mr. Hassett said. “It’s just kind of astonishing to me that the cost problem is somehow being blamed on us.”

Ms. Evans, like Mr. Richardson, lacks experience in emergency management, which is a legal requirement to lead FEMA.

Ms. Evans has played a central role in the Trump administration’s efforts to cut costs at FEMA, according to three people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Earlier this year, Ms. Evans rejected many FEMA spending requests before they could reach the desk of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has imposed a requirement that she personally approve any expense over $100,000, the three people said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said Mr. Richardson was returning to the private sector and thanked him for his work “refocusing the agency to deliver swift resources to Americans in crisis.”

President Trump has suggested eliminating or overhauling FEMA, with an eye toward shifting more responsibility for disaster response to the states. The administration is expected to release a report in the coming weeks detailing its plans to reshape FEMA’s role in disasters across the country.

That report “will inform this Administration’s ongoing efforts to fundamentally restructure FEMA, transforming it from its current form into a streamlined, mission-focused disaster-response force,” Ms. McLaughlin said in a statement.

Ms. Evans, who had worked in the first Trump administration, was previously national director of the U.S. Cyber Challenge, a private initiative focused on building the country’s cybersecurity work force, and worked in information technology for her own company, according to her LinkedIn profile. She served as the chief information officer at the Office of Management and Budget during the George W. Bush administration.

Mr. Richardson, who served in the Marines, was named to the role of acting FEMA administrator in May, replacing Cameron Hamilton, who was pushed out a day after telling members of Congress that FEMA was vital to communities “in their greatest times of need” and should not be eliminated. His resignation was first reported by The Washington Post.

When he was tapped for FEMA, Mr. Richardson was the assistant secretary at the Homeland Security Department’s office for countering weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Richardson maintained both jobs.

After Mr. Richardson joined FEMA, some of his employees expressed concern about his lack of experience. He told employees in June that he did not know the United States had a hurricane season — a comment that unnerved FEMA employees who heard it. The agency later said Mr. Richardson was joking.

On his first full day as acting administrator, Mr. Richardson told the agency’s employees that if any of them tried to obstruct his agenda, “I will run right over you.”

In a statement responding to Mr. Richardson’s resignation, Representative Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, said, “good riddance.”

“Americans deserve a FEMA leader with at least the most basic core competencies in emergency management, something David Richardson never demonstrated,” Mr. Pallone said.

The future of FEMA is unclear. In June, President Trump said he wanted to eliminate FEMA in November after the hurricane season ended and move emergency management efforts “back to the state level.”

After deadly Texas floods in July, when many Americans were focused on the rescue efforts, the administration’s rhetoric softened and officials spoke instead of reforming the agency.

Still, more than 2,000 employees have left FEMA since Mr. Trump took office, accounting for about one-third of the agency’s permanent work force. Those who resigned included some of the agency’s most accomplished leaders. A task force of local, state and federal emergency managers has been studying reforms to the agency that could raise the threshold for a disaster that warrants federal intervention, change how disaster aid is paid to states, and end FEMA’s role in the long term recovery of disaster-struck communities.

The panel, known as the FEMA Review Council, was required to release its recommendations by Sunday under an executive order Mr. Trump issued in May. An administration officials said the report is expected by the end of this year.

Emergency management officials around the country are eager for its release to understand what they can expect from FEMA in the future.

“We’re all anxiously waiting to see what it says,” Bryan Fisher, director of the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said Saturday at a resource fair for victims of Typhoon Halong, which hit Southwestern Alaska last month.

Since the Texas floods, there has not been a major test of the agency’s evolving disaster response strategy, under which FEMA has added new hurdles to some grant programs and stretched the limits of a dwindling pot of money used to pay for disaster aid. In recent months, Mr. Trump has declared federal disasters in Alaska, where remnants of a typhoon devastated coastal villages, and across the Plains, where severe storms and tornadoes damaged communities.

But the wildfire season has been calmer than expected in the West. And it has been a relatively mild Atlantic hurricane season in the East, with the most destructive storms avoiding landfall in the United States.

In his ruling, Judge Fitzpatrick said that when Ms. Halligan appeared — by herself — in front of the grand jury in September to seek an indictment accusing Mr. Comey of lying to and obstructing Congress in 2020 testimony, she made at least two “fundamental and highly prejudicial” misstatements of the law. He also pointed out that the grand jury materials he ordered her to turn over to him for his review this month appeared to be incomplete and “likely do not reflect the full proceedings.”

“The court is finding that the government’s actions in this case — whether purposeful, reckless or negligent — raise genuine issues of misconduct, are inextricably linked to the government’s grand jury presentation and deserve to be fully explored by the defense,” Judge Fitzpatrick wrote.

As part of his ruling, the judge ordered prosecutors to provide Mr. Comey’s lawyers by Monday evening with the same grand jury materials that he himself has already looked at — a measure he described as “an extraordinary remedy.” Typically, grand jury notes are kept secret before trial, even from defendants and their lawyers.

But the disclosure was needed, Judge Fitzpatrick said, to permit Mr. Comey’s legal team to delve into the question of whether Ms. Halligan and an F.B.I. agent who testified in front of the grand jury had conducted themselves properly when they secured the indictment.

The ruling by Judge Fitzpatrick was only the most recent setback in the Justice Department’s efforts to bring charges against Mr. Comey — a decision that was initially rejected by Ms. Halligan’s predecessor as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik S. Siebert. In an extraordinary move, Mr. Trump ousted Mr. Siebert in September to make way for Ms. Halligan after he suggested there was insufficient evidence to file an indictment against Mr. Comey.

Judge Fitzpatrick’s harsh words came just days after a different judge involved in the Comey case raised doubts about a separate question pertaining to Ms. Halligan: namely, whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had lawfully appointed her to her post as U.S. attorney in the first place. The judge overseeing that issue said she would make a decision on the matter by Thanksgiving.

The indictment against Mr. Comey charges him with lying to and obstructing Congress during an appearance he made in September 2020 in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the hearing, he was asked questions about whether he had authorized anyone at the F.B.I. to serve as an anonymous source in newspaper articles about sensitive investigations.

Ms. Halligan, who had never worked on a criminal case until she was thrust into the Comey prosecution, has faced extensive scrutiny from the moment Mr. Trump installed her atop the U.S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia against the wishes of many career prosecutors there. Her critics have pointed out that her previous experience in the law was limited to working as an insurance lawyer and serving as a personal lawyer to Mr. Trump.

It is extremely unusual for judges to examine how prosecutors act in front of grand juries, let alone to openly criticize their conduct. But that is exactly what Judge Fitzpatrick did to Ms. Halligan.

He noted that during her grand jury presentation she appears to have misrepresented a basic tenet of the law by suggesting that Mr. Comey did not have the right, under the Fifth Amendment, to avoid testifying at his own trial.

She also appears to have made another astonishing error, Judge Fitzpatrick said. In his ruling, he pointed out that she told grand jurors that they did not have to rely solely “on the record before them” to return an indictment against Mr. Comey, but instead “could be assured the government had more evidence — perhaps better evidence — that would be presented at trial.”

The judge also said that Ms. Halligan appears to have botched her efforts to pare down the three-count indictment she had initially sought against Mr. Comey after grand jurors rejected one of the charges. Moreover, he noted that the grand jury transcripts he later received from her did not appear to contain her presentation of the second, two-charge indictment to the grand jury, leaving the record incomplete.

If, however, a second presentation was never made, then the court “is in uncharted legal territory,” he went on.

That would suggest, he wrote, “that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.”

“Either way,” the judge concluded, “this unusual series of events, still not fully explained by the prosecutor’s declaration, calls into question the presumption of regularity generally associated with grand jury proceedings, and provides another genuine issue the defense may raise to challenge the manner in which the government obtained the indictment.”

Judge Fitzpatrick mentioned one more potential problem with the government’s grand jury presentation. He questioned whether the F.B.I. agent who was the sole witness to have testified may have inadvertently disclosed information that should not have been revealed because of the attorney-client privilege.

Ultimately, the decision about whether to dismiss the case based on these purported grand jury errors will lie with Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff, the district court judge who is handling the case. Judge Nachmanoff has already scheduled a hearing for early December to consider separate but related claims by Mr. Comey’s lawyers that Ms. Halligan had abused the grand jury process.

Now, as he prepares to return to the White House on Tuesday after a long absence, the prince may feel he has little to prove, despite all those years when he was effectively unwelcome in Washington. At 40 years old, he has cemented his power not only as the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia but as a global political heavyweight — a diplomatic deal-maker who oversees one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds.

Over the past few years, he has become too powerful for American politicians and chief executives to ignore.

On Tuesday, the face that will greet him could hardly be more welcoming. President Trump has repeatedly proven himself a warm friend of Saudi Arabia, a country where Mr. Trump’s family has cultivated significant business interests.

“This is a personal triumph for the crown prince,” said Gregory Gause, a scholar of Saudi Arabia and professor emeritus of international affairs at Texas A&M University. “Five years ago, if he had showed up in Washington, nobody would have talked to him. He’s coming back with a huge delegation as a regional leader, a world figure.”

The opprobrium that erupted after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing dogged Prince Mohammed for years until he put it behind him. The prince denied prior knowledge of the killing, but a U.S. intelligence assessment determined he had probably ordered it.

A lawsuit against him over the killing was dismissed by a U.S. federal court in 2022, after the State Department determined that the prince had immunity as a head of state. Even President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — who had pledged on the campaign trail in 2019 to turn Saudi Arabia into a pariah state — flew to the kingdom to meet the prince in 2022, when he needed his help to lower global oil prices.

In May, Mr. Trump chose Saudi Arabia as the destination for his first major trip abroad of his second term as president.

“Over the past eight years, Saudi Arabia has proved the critics totally wrong,” Mr. Trump declared during the visit.

During the same visit, Mr. Trump toured a Saudi government-owned real estate project called Diriyah. The Trump Organization is in talks that could bring a Trump-branded property to Diriyah, the project’s chief executive told The Times — the latest example of the Trump family’s fluid mingling of politics with profit.

The crown prince has overseen a significant loosening of religious restrictions in the kingdom over the past decade, allowing greater social freedoms, while increasing political repression at the same time.

Today, the prince’s main focus is no longer on consolidating power, but rather on overhauling the kingdom’s economy. The deadline for his “Vision 2030” program to reduce dependence on oil is looming, even while financial constraints are mounting.

“Since the last visit, Saudi policy has become laser-focused on domestic economic priorities,” said Yasmine Farouk, Arabian Peninsula project director at the International Crisis Group.

He is expected to stick to business on this trip, including bilateral diplomatic and corporate deals. His priorities include signing a mutual defense agreement with the United States, advancing a potential deal to transfer American nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and sealing agreements for the two countries to collaborate in the field of artificial intelligence, according to analysts.

Mr. Trump, in turn, is eager to persuade the prince to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. But that is “pretty much off the table,” said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.

“Saudi Arabia can’t go forward with normalization without Israel in effect recognizing the Palestinians have the right to a state,” he said.

The Trump administration and Saudi Arabia have also been trying to work out an agreement in which U.S. weapons manufacturers would sell F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia, although an intelligence report raised concerns that China could acquire the technology if the sale went through.

Prince Mohammed has sought to build deeper ties with China and other world powers, too.

“We are always keen to strengthen our bilateral relationship with the United States, even though we have a lot of other options,” said Salman al-Ansari, a Saudi political analyst.

The visit comes as Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the Middle East express increasing uncertainty over the strength of American security guarantees. In September, Israel tried to assassinate senior Hamas officials in Qatar, rattling neighboring Persian Gulf countries.

“The Saudis worry about U.S. reliability,” Mr. Gause said. “Part of the way to keep us from leaving is to have all these great deals that we’re going to see signed in Washington in the next few days.”

“We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we’ll see how that turns out,” Mr. Trump said, speaking at an airport in West Palm Beach, Fla. He added that Venezuela “would like to talk” but would not elaborate on what he meant.

“What does it mean? You tell me, I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said. When a reporter asked if he was interested in negotiations, he shrugged. “I talk to anybody,” he said. “I talk to you.”

The Trump administration has been building up its military presence in the Caribbean and reviewing options for potential strikes inside Venezuela, even as Mr. Trump’s aides provide conflicting accounts of what they are seeking to achieve.

It has also launched 21 known strikes on boats it claimed were trafficking narcotics in the waters off Central and South America, killing at least 83 people since September in a campaign that many legal experts say violates international law.

The Trump administration has said the campaign is about stopping the flow of drugs in the region, but has yet to provide evidence that any of these boats were moving drugs. And the discussion by Mr. Trump and his top aides has focused on removing Mr. Maduro from office. The United States and its allies do not recognize Mr. Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela after last year’s election.

On Sunday, the U.S. Navy announced that the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, the country’s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier, had arrived in the Caribbean with its accompanying warships and attack planes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had ordered its deployment to the region last month. Mr. Maduro has placed Venezuela’s military on high alert.

The carrier’s arrival adds to the U.S. military’s ability to conduct boat strikes or potential attacks on Venezuelan soil. The American force in the region has now reached 15,000 soldiers and sailors, the largest in decades.

Later on Sunday, the U.S. military announced the details of its latest strike in the eastern Pacific of a boat the Trump administration said was smuggling drugs by sea. The strike on Saturday killed three people.

In a social media post on Sunday, the U.S. Southern Command said that the boat was being operated by a “designated terrorist organization” and was trafficking narcotics in the eastern Pacific. It did not provide evidence for those claims. The post included a video that showed a boat being struck.

In another move to escalate the pressure campaign against Mr. Maduro, Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday announced that the State Department would designate a Venezuelan group, Cartel de Los Soles, as a foreign terrorist organization. The designation restricts financial transactions of the group or anyone associated with it.

Mr. Rubio said the group is “headed” by Mr. Maduro and high-ranking individuals in his government. A federal indictment from 2020 accuses Maduro of drug trafficking charges related to the group. He has denied the charges.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump, speaking of Mr. Carlson as he traveled back to the White House after spending the weekend golfing at Mar-a-Lago, said, “You can’t tell him who to interview.” The president then insisted that he “didn’t know much about” Mr. Fuentes, whom he previously dined with at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, an episode that also caused a furor.

If Mr. Carlson wanted to interview Mr. Fuentes, then “get the word out,” Mr. Trump said. “People have to decide. Ultimately people have to decide.”

Mr. Fuentes, who had previously bragged that the silence from the White House over the episode was a sign of his growing influence on the right, shared Mr. Trump’s defense of Mr. Carlson on social media, writing “Thank you Mr. President!”

Mr. Trump’s defense of Mr. Carlson did not address Mr. Fuentes’s racist views, or Mr. Carlson’s expressions of sympathy for some of his positions. But the president’s remarks threw the right-wing influencer a lifeline weeks after prominent Republican lawmakers, Jewish organizations and conservative influencers denounced him for the podcast.

Even as many figures on the right disavowed or distanced themselves from Mr. Carlson, others defended him. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, a powerful think tank at the center of conservative politics, said that Mr. Carlson’s critics were “sowing division” and that he would “always be a close friend” to the institution. (Days later, in response to significant criticism over those remarks, Mr. Roberts pleaded ignorance, saying that he “didn’t know much about this Fuentes guy.” His video defending Mr. Carlson has not been retracted.)

The White House stayed out of the uproar for weeks. Mr. Fuentes, appearing on his own podcast soon after speaking to Mr. Carlson, interpreted that silence as a victory for his movement of so-called groypers, who oppose diversity and immigration and believe the United States was better off when Christian white men were in charge.

Mr. Fuentes gleefully singled out Vice President JD Vance for not condemning him. Mr. Fuentes has long been a mocking critic of Mr. Vance and has made racist remarks about his wife, Usha.

Hours before Mr. Trump’s comments on Sunday, Mr. Vance waded into the infighting among conservatives to defend Mr. Carlson’s son Buckley, who works as an aide in the vice president’s office. After a conservative political operative had attacked the younger Carlson on social media, accusing him of bigotry because of his connection to his father, Mr. Vance lashed back.

“I have an extraordinary tolerance for disagreements and criticisms from the various people in our coalition,” Mr. Vance said in a social media post. “But I am a very loyal person, and I have zero tolerance for scumbags attacking my staff.”

“It’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown,’” he wrote.

The president’s turnabout followed his intensive pressure campaign over the Epstein files that often appeared to overshadow efforts on other matters, including the recent government shutdown. In a last-ditch effort in recent days, Mr. Trump reached out personally to try to sway Republican lawmakers backing the measure, summoning one to a meeting in the White House Situation Room with his attorney general and F.B.I. director to discuss the demand to release the files.

It was unclear how quickly Mr. Trump’s tightly controlled Justice Department might release files on Mr. Epstein, or whether the president’s seeming backing of the idea might speed such a release, regardless of the vote. When he ordered the department to look into Democrats associated with Mr. Epstein last week, his own ties to the disgraced financier were receiving renewed scrutiny because of the release of a trove of emails in which Mr. Epstein claimed Mr. Trump knew of his activities.

Even if the bill were to pass the House, it would face longer odds in the Senate, where 60 votes would be needed to bring up the bill. Democrats hold 47 seats, so even if all of them back the measure, they would still need 13 Republicans to join them.

The Republican base remains split over the files, and the tension has led to a falling-out between Mr. Trump and one of his closest political allies, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.

On Sunday, minutes after Mr. Trump publicly reversed course on the Epstein files, he said on social media that Ms. Greene “is working overtime to try and portray herself as a victim when, in actuality, she is the cause of all of her own problems.” Mr. Trump has escalated his attacks on Ms. Greene in the past week, calling her a “traitor,” something that she says has led to death threats.

Ms. Greene is far from the only Republican lawmaker pushing to release the files.

Hours before Mr. Trump’s announcement on Sunday evening, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has helped lead efforts in Congress to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files, suggested on ABC’s “This Week” that “100 or more” House Republicans could support such a measure this week despite opposition from the president. “The record of this vote will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency,” he said.

Speaker Mike Johnson also predicted significant G.O.P. support, acknowledging before Mr. Trump’s reversal on Sunday that there would be “lots of votes” for the bill. Mr. Johnson, who said last week that he would move up the timeline for a vote on the bill to this week, told “Fox News Sunday” that the House just needed to “get this done and move it on.”

“There’s nothing to hide,” he added.

On Wednesday, lawmakers released more than 20,000 emails belonging to Mr. Epstein in which the convicted sex offender claimed that the president once “spent hours at my house” with a young woman who later accused Mr. Epstein of sexually abusing and trafficking her when she was a teenager.

The document dump fueled the drama over Mr. Epstein that has engulfed Mr. Trump, Mr. Johnson and his Republican majority.

In response, attorneys for the asylum seekers and Al Otro Lado, the organization serving them, shared the following comment:

“The issue before the Court is whether noncitizens seeking safety at ports of entry along the U.S. southern border have a legal right to apply for asylum in the United States. As the Ninth Circuit correctly concluded, our immigration laws require the government to inspect and process people seeking asylum at ports of entry and allow them to pursue their legal claims in the United States. The government’s turnback policy was an illegal scheme to circumvent these requirements by physically blocking asylum seekers arriving at ports of entry and preventing them from crossing the border to seek protection. Vulnerable families, children, and adults fleeing persecution were stranded in perilous conditions where they faced violent assault, kidnapping, and death. We look forward to presenting our case to the Court.”

The American Immigration Council, the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies (CGRS), the Center for Constitutional Rights, Democracy Forward, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection serve as co-counsel.

She will give an oral statement in the House of Commons this evening and answer questions from MPs.

Let me say from the outset to those who are worried that we do not have any timescales for implementation or details of who will be affected (e.g. people who are currently waiting for a decision). Where it is indicated that changes will be consulted on or legislation will be brought forward, that obviously means that we will have a bit more notice before anything is implemented.

There are two forewords to the paper, from the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary. With no indication that she feels any sense of ownership for the situation, the Home Secretary states that “Over 100,000 people now live in asylum accommodation, funded by the taxpayer. Many refugees remain unemployed several years after being granted protection, depending on taxpayer funded benefits to live in the UK.” This is of course a result of slow and inaccurate processing of claims as well as a ban on work for those waiting in the asylum system for so long, which makes it more difficult for them to get their lives up and running again following a grant of status.

She states “In 2024, asylum claims in the UK rose by 18 percent, to a record high. Across Europe, meanwhile, claims fell by 13 percent.” Yet fails to mention that Germany (218,550) receives twice as many applications as the UK (109,343) which is in fifth place in Europe, also behind Spain (164,830), France (159,260) and Italy (151,525).

The paper is in three sections. Part I: Reducing arrivals, Part II: Increasing removals, and Part III: Safe and legal routes. I have looked at the details below.

Part I: Reducing arrivals

This section begins with an assertion that various factors are acting as “pull factors” for people to come to the UK. These include “the generosity of refugee protection in the UK”, “the extent of support provided” to those waiting for a decision and the ability to work without permission to do so.

Notably and predictably, there is no reference to the Home Office’s own research showing that “welfare policies and labour market access have little impact on migrant decision making”, or indeed, to any evidence at all. There are several proposals to address this.

Extension of period needed to reach settlement from five to twenty years and “safe return” reviews every two and a half years

By way of quick background, before 30 August 2005, settlement was granted to people when their asylum claim succeeded. On 30 August 2005 this was changed to an initial grant of five years, after which the person could apply for settlement. A “safe return review” whereby the Home Office would consider whether a person could return to their country of origin at the end of the five years instead of being granted settlement was announced in 2017 but not much seems to have come of this.

Then there was the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 which introduced the “two tier” system of refugee status whereby certain refugees (those deemed to have entered “illegally”) were granted two and a half years’ leave to remain. They would be eligible for settlement only under the normal long residence rules and after holding leave for ten years. Robert Jenrick MP closed this process in June 2023.

In the new policy paper, reference is made to the asylum system in Denmark throughout. It mentions that settlement can be obtained there after eight years of residence, subject to various requirements being met. The Home Office’s proposal is for there to be no path to settlement in a protection route until a person has spent twenty years in the UK. No explanation is provided as to why even Denmark’s eight year waiting period has been deemed too generous. This twenty year route is referred to as the “core protection” route.

Instead of five years, refugees will be granted leave for two and a half years and will have to keep renewing this. Each time the Home Office will only grant the extension if they accept that there is still a need for protection. If it is decided that there is no longer such a need, the intention will be to remove that person. So the plan is that people will spend twenty years of their lives here living in terror of being sent back to a country where the UK has accepted that they have previously been at risk of persecution in.

These short periods of leave and inevitably lengthy periods spent with section 3C leave will make it difficult for people to work and find homes, as we have already seen happening with Ukrainians. It will also be enormously damaging to people’s mental health. Inevitably, more people will need support from the state.

If eligible, people will be able to switch into a new “protection work and study route”. This will be available to people who “obtain employment or commence study at an appropriate level and pay a fee. Once on this route, they will become eligible to ‘earn’ settlement sooner than they would under core protection alone”.

Family reunion

It seems that the intention is that family reunion will only be available to those who have moved into the work and study route. Under core protection we are told that there will be “no automatic right to family reunion”. It will still exist, but “stricter requirements will apply”. Those in the work and study routes may be subject to the same requirements to bring dependants as in other routes, presumably such as Appendix FM.

Public funds

They have also trailed changes to benefits for refugees, stating that:

we are now exploring a change to taxpayer-funded benefits to prioritise access for those who are making an economic contribution to the UK. This could see additional criteria that migrants have to meet to receive benefits and actions they need to take in order not to lose them. A consultation on this question will take place in 2026.

Asylum support

The government will be revoking The Asylum Seekers (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2005 and the paper states that they “will restore a discretionary power to offer support”. It is unclear to me how much will actually change here. Section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1995 already says that the Home Secretary may provide support to people who appear “to be destitute or to be likely to become destitute”.

Even without these laws in place, people cannot simply be left without support where that would make them destitute. The “law of humanity” will still apply under the common law.

The paper goes on to say:

In doing so, we will deny support to those who have the right to work and could therefore support themselves. This would include those who enter the country on a work or student visa with permission to work before claiming asylum, or those granted permission to work where their claim has been outstanding for more than 12 months.

It is obviously much more difficult for people in that first group (with section 3C leave) to find work because employers do not know how long they will have that leave for, as it will only last until either their asylum claim is granted or once they are appeals rights exhausted.

People without leave who have claimed asylum are able to work only after they have been waiting for a decision on their claim for over 12 months and they have applied to the Home Office for permission to work and that request has been granted. Even then, they are only allowed to work in an extremely limited number of roles.

The Home Office cannot have it both ways and make it incredibly difficult for people to work and then withhold support from them if they are unable to do so.

The paper also says that support will be removed from those who “fail to abide by a removal direction”, work illegally, refuse to relocate to a different accommodation site or are disruptive in accommodation.

Removal of assets (aka “contributions mechanism”)

This proposal states that:

we will require individuals to contribute towards the cost of their asylum support where they have some assets or income, but not enough to support themselves independently. We will also take action to recover support costs in scenarios where any assets are not convertible into cash or declared at the point that asylum support is initially provided but become convertible or are discovered at a later date.

This wording looks fairly identical to section 31 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which provides for a “financial contribution by resident” of an accommodation centre. This section has not been brought into force but includes provision for the Home Secretary to make regulations to recover costs relating to accommodation and other facilities where the person has assets that can be converted into cash.

The Lords debate on removing that clause when it was still a bill is worth revisiting. Section 31 only covers accommodation centres, so the government’s proposal would presumably be to extend this to all types of support.

Large scale accommodation sites

This has already been announced and there are no new details here.

Illegal working

Again, nothing new here. Just mention of previously announced changes on expansion of right to work checks and the digital hostile environment.

Part II: Increasing removals

The paper says that the UK/France pilot will be continued, but with a “higher appetite” for removing people, apparently. It also says that removals to certain countries will be resumed and say that they have already started returning a small number of Syrians.

It refers to several European countries beginning “voluntary removals”, so presumably at this stage the UK has also just been helping those who wish to return. The paper goes on to say that they are “exploring resuming enforced returns” to certain countries, including to Syria.

Removing failed asylum seekers

The paper says that the UK/France pilot will be continued, but with a “higher appetite” for removing people, apparently. It also says that removals to certain countries will be resumed and say that they have already started returning a small number of Syrians.

It refers to several European countries beginning “voluntary removals”, so presumably at this stage the UK has also just been helping those who wish to return. The paper goes on to say that they are “exploring resuming enforced returns” to certain countries, including to Syria.

A consultation is to be launched on the enforced removal of families with children. This consultation will also include “commencing measures in the 2016 Immigration Act which will allow us to remove support from families who do not have a genuine obstacle to leaving the country”. Taking a quick look, this seems to mean sections 66 and 68 and schedules 11 and 12 of the Immigration Act 2016.

Visa penalties

This proposal formed part of the Conservative government’s New Plan for Immigration, eventually making its way into section 72 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 which provides for “visa penalties for uncooperative countries”. I don’t think it has ever actually been used, presumably because there are non-Home Office related reasons which make it sensible to maintain good relations with other countries.

Appeals reform

Yet again there are some fairly glaring omissions in the Home Office’s assessment of the situation regarding the appeals backlog. For a proper picture of what is going on, see my explanation.

The paper mentions increased judicial sitting days and statutory timelines, neither of which are new announcements. A new appeals body has also already been announced, although one welcome point to note here is the mention that “Early legal advice will be a core part of system reforms, avoiding delays and late claims, leading to better decisions”. Again, this needs to be present at application stage as well, so that many cases can avoid being wrongly refused in the first place, but any mention of the importance of legal advice is a positive.

There is also mention of accelerating certain cases, again this is a process that already exists in detained cases. They also mention “strengthening” the approach to certifying cases to remove the right of appeal. It is unclear whether anything new is being proposed here beyond further use of existing processes.

What is new is proposed legislation for accelerated appeals in “removable high-harm cases, foreign national offenders, and others who are detained and readily removable”, but no more detail than this is provided.

Legislation is also proposed “to enable an expedited appeal for first time late claims where someone is being removed but has not previously made a claim. This will ensure these claims do not suspend removal, as is all too often the case today”. I have addressed this situation previously, the system often operates to prevent people from being able to make these claims earlier.

Legislation is also to be made to ensure that a person does not accrue any private or family life rights if they do not leave the UK after an unsuccessful claim. This will presumably involve an amendment to section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as trailed in the immigration white paper in May).

Fresh claims will seemingly require a paid application, this is a bit unclear but seems to be saying where the fresh claim is based on article 8. It is unclear what the process would be if e.g. it was a sur place claim (where the need for asylum only arose later on because of a change of circumstances in the country of origin). This change will be made via the immigration rules.

Legal reform

As set out in the immigration white paper earlier this year, the government is unhappy with the number of families of British citizens and those who are settled here who are unable to meet the minimum income requirement, yet have the audacity to still want to live together.

The paper also mentions that 86% of people who raised rights based applications in detention awaiting removal were released. A significant factor in this which goes unmentioned will of course be the decimation of legal aid advice generally, but particularly the removal of article 8 cases from the scope of legal aid, meaning that people are unable to access their rights at an earlier stage.

In response to the above two “problems”. Again, several changes are proposed.

The first is to:

legislate to set out to Home Office decision makers, and the courts, how to properly balance the public interest against individual rights. This intends to narrow the circumstances in which an individual’s Article 8 rights would outweigh the public interest in removing them.

The second is to set out in primary legislation a more narrow definition of family, largely restricted to immediate family members, with limited exceptions. The second is to change the application process for leave outside the rules applications based on article 8. Applications to bring people from outside the UK will need to be submitted by the UK based family member.

For in-country applications:

we will prescribe how and when Article 8 claims can be made. This will prevent migrants from frustrating removal by making late human rights claims, avoiding fees and relying on the courts to remake Home Office decisions, or in some cases having the courts consider Article 8 claims that have not even been considered by the Home Office.

This doesn’t make much sense to me and I can’t really see a change in here.

The third proposed change is to work with other countries to limit the definition of “inhuman or degrading treatment” in article 3 claims.

Next, reform to the modern slavery system (which is very much not being abused). Here the paper mentions the guidance change on reconsiderations made in September. It also talks about improved screening processes, with no acknowledgement of the well known fact (contained in the Home Office’s own guidance) that survivors of modern slavery often have difficulty in disclosing their experiences. New legislation is mentioned, without any further detail.

Other barriers to removal

Here, we are told that the immigration rules will be changed to allow consideration and refusal of protection claims after the screening interview. It is unclear whether any form of longer screening interview will take place in these circumstances.

The paper states that this process will be used to “target citizens of manifestly safe countries”. I will raise my usual concerns here that generally when countries are deemed “safe”, the safety of LGBTQI+ people is not considered. This will be one to keep an eye on.

Apparently processes and systems will be improved to ensure that they do not miss opportunities to deport foreign national offenders waiting for trial on other more minor offences.

The use of AI in age assessments was announced back in July 2025 but is repeated here. Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit published a good response at the time.

There is already evidence of racial bias in AI. In Australia, there is evidence of this specifically in using AI to carry out age assessments (in the context of their social media ban for children, rather than for asylum). The trial was carried out by a UK based company and found that racial bias in the system meant that the tests were less accurate for certain groups.

Part III: Safe and legal routes

Unsurprisingly, this is the smallest section of the paper. Let me be clear from the outset, because I have already seen this argument being made a couple of times. There is no trade off which would make the above proposals for refugees in any way more acceptable. There are no circumstances in which it is okay to treat people like that, to forcibly separate families and to keep people living in limbo for decades. And what is on offer here is thin gruel indeed.

Let’s also remember that the context for this is that the past couple of years has seen the closure of “safe and legal routes”, namely the Ukraine, Afghan and family reunion schemes with little if any advance notice. The latter two closures have taken place under this government. Other routes still exist but seem to have stalled through government inaction on quotas.

All that the paper says is that:

To achieve this, we will:

reform refugee sponsorship to give voluntary and community sector organisations a greater role in resettlement through named sponsorship, within caps set by government

introduce a capped route for refugee and displaced students to study in the UK, helping talented refugees to continue their studies, realise their potential and be able to return to their country and help rebuild it as soon as circumstances allow

establish a capped route for skilled refugees and displaced people to come to the UK for work, building on the experience of the Displaced Talent Mobility Pilot

It is proposed that those arriving through these routes will have to wait ten years before they can settle, this will be subject to consultation. It is unclear whether they will also have to renew their leave every two and a half years and live under the threat of removal during that decade.

Conclusion

A bullet point summary of the proposals is available as an appendix to the paper. As I said at the outset, it is unclear what will happen when. Where it has been indicated that changes will be made to the immigration rules, this can potentially happen sooner that those subject to consultation and changes to primary legislation.

This is a shameful day for Labour. These proposals are cruel, unnecessary and perhaps most importantly for the two authors of the foreword, will have no impact on the desperate people who continue to make that dangerous journey across the Channel.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-Linked_Image___1948421727_11c577fdef_3k-min-edited-600x337.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:14.390765

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda.
It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens).
There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said.
Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration.","Many members of Colorado’s Latino community fear they could be arrested by federal immigration authorities and have changed their daily lives to avoid it, a recent poll found — even as Latinos remain predominantly focused on economic concerns ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

“In every aspect of life, Latinos have attenuated their normal behavior and avoided critical locations, like work and school, in order to stay clear of the immigration (enforcement) surge,” pollster Gary Segura told reporters upon releasing the results.

The issues identified more broadly in the Colorado Latino Agenda poll, which was released earlier this month, reflect a growing national consensus among all voters, not just Latinos. The overwhelming concern with affordability — respondents’ top four issues all related to the cost of living and the economy — shows that economic fears have endured through President Donald Trump’s first nine months in office, with recent elections across the country notching wins for Democrats who focused on the issue.

But the results also revealed mounting fear about an erosion of civil rights and discontent with the Republican president’s efforts to rapidly arrest and deport millions of immigrants without proper legal status.

Forty percent of the registered voters who participated in the survey said they or their communities feared that immigration authorities would arrest them, even if they’re U.S. citizens or have some kind of legal status. And 30% said they or their communities feared interacting with or calling the police, while 28% said they or their communities feared attending regular immigration proceedings because they could be arrested.

Asked whether civil rights had improved under Trump, 62% said they hadn’t, compared to 20% who said they had.

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda. Immigrants have repeatedly been arrested while attending regular immigration hearings, as advocates have said and court filings reviewed by The Denver Post have indicated.

ProPublica, a nonprofit news outlet, reported last month that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration authorities nationwide this year. Immigrants with legal status and work permits, like a Douglas County teacher arrested last month, have also been caught up in raids and arrests.

“The actions of the Trump administration are fundamentally changing the way that Latino citizens are interacting with their government,” said Phil Chen, a political science professor at the University of Denver who reviewed the poll. “A quarter of them say that they or their community are missing classes because parents are worried about being arrested driving to school. I read (those results) as deeply, deeply troubling.”

About 23% of Colorado residents are of Hispanic or Latino origin, according to the State Demography Office.

The poll was conducted by a bipartisan polling team last month. It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens). Its margin of error was plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

Concerns with Trump, Republicans

Latino Coloradans, who have tended to vote Democratic but not monolithically, also expressed mounting concerns with the Trump administration and Republicans who control Congress. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they were concerned that Congress wasn’t acting as a check on Trump. Asked who was to blame for the recent government shutdown, 61% said the president and his party, compared to 23% who blamed Democrats. Two-thirds disapproved of Trump’s performance in office.

There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said. More than a third of respondents said they’d voted for Trump in 2024.

The vast majority of that group — 80% — said they would vote for him again. But 13% said they wouldn’t, and the remaining 7% said they were unsure. Of those who supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, 91% said they would vote for her again, and the remaining share said they weren’t sure.

“When there’s a party that holds all of the levers of power in the federal government, (voters) are going to blame that party for things they think are not going well and probably give them credit for things that are going well,” Chen said. “This is the pattern we expect to find in every off-year and midterm election.

“So if you were (U.S. Rep.) Gabe Evans or the state Republican Party, I think it’s really important to start thinking about how you talk about issues around affordability — around housing costs, food costs, inflation, job opportunities, things like that.”

Evans, a Republican, represents the 8th Congressional District stretching from the northern Denver suburbs to Greeley, and it’s one of the most contested congressional seats in the country. Much of his successful 2024 campaign focused on immigration and public safety.

‘Latinos are looking for leadership’

Still, criticism of Trump doesn’t necessarily mean Latino voters are running straight into the arms of the Democratic Party, said Alex Sánchez, the president and CEO of Voces Unidas, which is part of the coalition that released the poll.

Fifty-two percent of self-identified independents surveyed in the poll said they either didn’t know which party they’d support next year or that they wanted to support someone else. (A plurality of independents, 35%, said they would support Democrats, compared to 12% for Republicans.)

“There are warning signs to both parties in the data,” Sánchez said in an interview. “While, yes, Colorado Democrats fare better … they’re not too far from the danger zone. That’s what we see in the data: a clear sign that Latinos are looking for leadership, are looking for results.”

He added about Latinos: “We are not brand loyal. We don’t carry the party loyalty the same way that other voters do. Latinas and Latinos historically vote based on value and vote based on results, instead of party sticker and party label.”

Despite the unpopularity of the Trump administration’s mass-deportation efforts, affordability concerns were still far and away the top concerns for voters. Forty-eight percent of respondents said the cost of living and inflation were their top priority.

Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration. More than half of respondents said it was most important for election officials to tackle either prices and affordability, or wages and good jobs.

That’s unsurprising, Chen said. Affordability was a dominant issue in elections elsewhere in the U.S. earlier this month, he said, and has remained a top issue for all Colorado voters for years.

With next year’s midterms approaching, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had begun floating new affordability ideas in recent weeks as it faces the reality that Americans are still pessimistic about the economy as they struggle with higher prices.

“You can think of (the immigration crackdown) as a problem. It can affect your impressions of President Trump,” Chen said. “But when it comes to how (Latinos) are going to vote, (they’re) going to vote on the thing that’s really affected me, which is the economy.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-L-immigrant-rights-RJS-13431.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:08.249902

Refugee and migrant rights are women’s rights.","Today (17th November 2025), the government has announced plans to rollback rights and protections for refugees and people seeking safety in the UK.

In a joint statement, Southall Black Sisters Hibiscus, End Violence Against Women Coalition and Latin American Women’s Rights Service responded to these plans.

We are outraged by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood’s announcement today introducing a sweeping roll-back of the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees seeking safety in the UK. These measures, described by the Home Secretary as ‘the most significant changes to our asylum system in modern times’, will have devastating and life-threatening consequences for women and children, particularly those trapped in cycles of abuse. They will further restrict women’s already limited ability to escape violence and exploitation.

These policies disregard the daily realities we as specialist ending violence against women and girls organisations witness firsthand on the frontline. We see, with painful clarity, that insecure immigration status is one of the strongest predictors of continued abuse, exploitation, and homelessness. When the state strips away human-rights protections, restricts family-life claims, renders refugees’ settlement temporary, and closes off safe routes to safety, the consequences fall most brutally on women and children who are already marginalised and least able to defend themselves.

The hostile environment, now intensified by these regressive reforms, is fuelling an already-burning fire. Women who have fled violence must now navigate not only abuse and precarity but also an increasingly punitive and unsafe public climate. Against this backdrop, the government’s reshaping of the immigration framework, including the erosion of Article 8 protections enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights, the removal of the statutory duty to support people seeking asylum, and the creation of ‘talent-based’ routes to safety, rings alarm bells for migrant victim-survivors and their children. These proposals should alarm anyone with any stake in women’s rights and human rights.

Refugee and migrant rights are women’s rights. We stand united in condemning these reforms and call on the government to immediately reverse course and adopt a genuine human-rights based approach to overhauling the UK’s immigration and asylum systems.",https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Refugee-and-migrant-rights-are-womens-rights.-1400-x-1434-px.png,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:22.296762

Many Republicans are expected to support a vote in the US House this week to force the justice department to release the files.
“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” he posted on his Truth Social network on Sunday evening.
For years, Trump’s Maga base, including people who now have prominent positions in his administration, have called for the release of the Epstein files, suggesting there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful.
“Releasing the Epstein files is the easiest thing in the world,” she told Politico on Friday.","Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to back the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, an abrupt reversal, is a rare instance of the president being unable to tame his Maga base and being instead forced to accede to it.

Many Republicans are expected to support a vote in the US House this week to force the justice department to release the files. Once the measure passes, it would still need approval in the US Senate, where 13 Republican senators would need to join with all 47 Democrats to approve it.

Trump spent last week aggressively squeezing allies in the US House, including Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, to back off in their support of releasing the files. Those efforts were unsuccessful, and when it became apparent the measure was going to pass, Trump backed it in an effort to salvage an embarrassing political loss. “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” he posted on his Truth Social network on Sunday evening.

For years, Trump’s Maga base, including people who now have prominent positions in his administration, have called for the release of the Epstein files, suggesting there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful. Trump supported the release as a candidate. But earlier this year, the justice department said it had reviewed the files and would not be releasing more documents. That set off more furor and pressure on Trump to release them.

The House oversight committee last week released a tranche of documents they obtained from Epstein’s estate, including messages in which Epstein wrote that Trump knew of Epstein’s conduct. The messages also show Trump ally Steve Bannon advising Epstein on how to rehabilitate his image. Epstein further corresponded with other prominent people, including the former treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers; the journalist Michael Wolff; and Kathryn Ruemmler, Barack Obama’s former White House counsel.

The release of those messages has only further increased scrutiny on Trump, and built the pressure to release everything the government still has on Epstein – which could be quite a lot, given the number of federal investigations conducted into him.

Some Maga influencers have sought to pivot the story away from Trump. Megyn Kelly, the conservative radio host, appeared to question whether Epstein really was a pedophile. “There’s a difference between a 15-year-old and a five-year-old,” she said on her podcast. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to one count of soliciting an underage prostitute and in 2019 faced federal sex trafficking charges for girls as young as 14. Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.

The issue has ignited a bitter split with Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House representative of Georgia, who has increasingly styled herself as someone in touch with the real Maga base and has refused to blindly back Trump through the Epstein saga. “Releasing the Epstein files is the easiest thing in the world,” she told Politico on Friday. “Just release it all, let the American people sort through every bit of it, and, you know, support the victims. That’s just like the most common sense, easiest thing in the world. But to spend any effort trying to stop it makes – it just doesn’t make sense to me.”

Trump repeatedly attacked Greene over the weekend, calling her a “traitor”, amid other insults. Greene decried the president’s rhetoric during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. “Those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” she said.

Later that evening she posted on social media that she and her family had started receiving hoax pizza deliveries, and that there had been a pipe bomb threat directed at her construction company. Pressed on CNN about why she was speaking out against the president’s rhetoric now, as she had not condemned his similarly viscous rhetoric in the past, she was evasive.

“I’m only responsible for myself and my own words and actions … and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” she said. “I really want to just see people be kind to one another.” She also stressed during the interview that she continued to support the president and his administration.

But whether Trump’s reversal will effectively quell the pressure from his base, or if he will continue to feel the heat – including from some of his otherwise staunchest allies – will be closely watched.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8667e758ebab167407a2be7c707c2d7a8eea33d8/1517_310_4872_3897/master/4872.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d07b473e69c0f29e23ea85b18507709e",N,,2025-11-17 13:57:23.160976

CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month.
Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits.
“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges.","This story was originally published by CalMatters on November 13, 2025. Sign up for their newsletters.

Seven detainees at an immigration detention center in California City have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks, infested with bugs and is denying people access to food, water and their lawyers.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California also claims detainees do not have appropriate clothing for the chilly desert nights, nor appropriate medical attention for life-threatening conditions. The lawsuit alleges detainees with mobility issues don’t have access to wheelchairs, and in some cases are unable to bathe or dress themselves.

The plaintiffs are seeking to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all detainees housed at the California City Immigration Processing Center, which is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield and run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

“In their haste to warehouse hundreds of men and women in this isolated facility, defendants have failed to provide for the basic human needs of the people for whose lives and wellbeing they are legally responsible,” the lawsuit alleges.

ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August. On average, there were about 480 people held in the detention center each day in September, and the facility has the capability to house up to 2,560 people. The lawsuit asserts 800 people are now housed there.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on the lawsuit for this story.

In September, a state disability rights group conducted a two-day inspection of the facility and found that its operators failed to distribute medication for life-threatening conditions and did not schedule timely surgeries for people that needed them.

CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month. Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, in a written statement at the time said the site provides robust medical care. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

The detention center’s accelerated opening was part of the Trump administration’s plan to execute the largest deportation program in U.S. history. California City’s mayor previously told CalMatters the federal government opened the facility without proper permits or a business license as required by state law.

“In the rush to expand capacity, ICE has cobbled together a patchwork system of county jails, private prisons, and newly converted facilities across the country. The rapid and haphazard growth of the detention system has outstripped any meaningful system of accountability or oversight,” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit was filed by Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP.

Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits. Counties in California have the option to inspect immigration detention facilities, although few do. Three of the four counties in California that host the facilities have not held inspections.

Seventeen people have died in ICE facilities this year, two in California. The agency’s official list of deaths in custody documents 15. Two subsequent deaths — one each in California and New York have not yet been added to the ICE list.

One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, alleged that he has been denied medication for a heart condition for days at a time. The lawsuit alleges the lack of medication led to him being hospitalized twice.

“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges. “Mr. Roque Campos has yet to see a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication.”",https://kcet.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bae653f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkcet-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F00%2F4f%2F36efe1f64c54a9b9873f68e7e1b4%2Fcalcity-detention-mv-cm-12.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:58:18.171450

end of list

The government’s proposals, to be unveiled on Monday, will have two main prongs. First, they would end the automatic path to settled status for refugees after five years. And second, they would remove state benefits from those who have the right to work and can support themselves.

After a summer of fierce protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers and an anti-immigration march in London, Mahmood also announced new plans to curb small-boat crossings from France as well as to return refugees to their home countries once it is safe to do so.

What are the current immigration numbers?

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that net migration – the number of people entering a country minus the number leaving – had hovered around 200,000 to 300,000 people per year since 2011.

However, after Brexit was enacted in 2020, there was a large increase in the number of undocumented immigrants entering the UK. Data from the ONS showed net migration climbed to 906,000 for the 12 months to June 2023.

But more recent figures showed those numbers have fallen dramatically since then. Net migration figures dropped by more than half in 2024 – to 431,000. This was largely owing to a decrease in the number of healthcare and student visas made available last year.

Meanwhile, despite a UK media focus on people arriving in small boats from France, this group makes up a small share of the overall number of people entering the country. In 2024, for instance, the Home Office found that 36,816 people who arrived in the UK came via small boats.

In total, 108,138 people claimed asylum last year. Of those, only one-third came via small boats. As such, most claims for asylum went through formal channels (and included some dependants of those people).

Despite the falling numbers, disquiet with the ruling Labour Party remains rife. In an August YouGov poll, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Reform UK, an anti-immigration party, would be more effective at handling asylum cases than Labour, who secured just 9 percent of the tally.

What changes is the government announcing?

Access to citizenship

On Monday, the government is expected to announce a shift from permanent settlement for refugees to a temporary-protection model.

Current rules stipulate that refugees granted asylum may remain in the UK for five years before being able to apply for an “indefinite leave to remain”, opening the door to citizenship.

But under the new plans, those who enter the UK through the asylum process could face up to 20 years before seeking permanent residency.

In addition, people granted asylum would have to renew their status every 30 months to see if the situation in their home country has changed such that UK residence is still required.

Access to social benefits

Mahmood said she intends to repeal the legal duty of the government to provide accommodation and basic financial support to all asylum seekers.

The government is expected to withdraw support from asylum seekers deemed able to work as well as from those people who commit offences, ignore removal orders or work illegally.

Asylum seekers may currently apply for permission to work if their asylum claim has been outstanding for 12 months or more and if the delay is not considered their fault.

What do refugee rights groups say?

Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council charity, said that instead of deterring migrants, the 20-year path to citizenship would “leave people in limbo and experiencing intense anxiety for many, many years”.

“We need a system that is controlled and is fair, and the way you do that is you make decisions fairly, in a timely fashion, and if someone is found to be a refugee, they go on and they contribute to our communities and they pay back,” he told the programme BBC Breakfast on Sunday.

Mahmood’s proposal for 30-month checks implies that refugees could be sent back to their home countries once the government believes conditions on the ground have improved – an approach inspired by Denmark’s much-debated policy.

Although research by the Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook has found that deterrence has limited influence on where asylum seekers travel to, a 2017 study did suggest that Denmark’s “negative branding” had led to fewer asylum applications.

How have others reacted to the proposals?

While Oxford University’s Migration Observatory said Mahmood’s overhaul would make the UK’s immigration system among the strictest countries in Europe, Matt Vickers, the opposition home office minister, said the government’s new plans to reform the asylum system contain “lots of gimmicks”.

He told the BBC that a “deterrent” is what is needed: “If people arrive in this country and know they’re going to get sent back, they won’t get in those boats in the first place.”

What other proposals is the UK government making?

Using artificial intelligence tools to assess age

The government wants to introduce artificial intelligence-based assessments to determine the age of people who arrive without documentation. Ministers said errors in the current system risk placing adults in children’s services or wrongly treating minors as adults.

Rights groups, however, warned that automated systems could entrench bias, wrongly classify children as adults and expose them to harm.

Earlier this year, Solomon told the BBC that he was “not convinced” that using AI tools was the government’s correct approach on age identification because he has concerns about children being put in unsafe situations. He added that “these [AI] technologies continue to raise serious questions about accuracy, ethics and fairness.”

Visa ban threat for three African countries

The Home Office has said visa applications from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be refused unless their governments improve collaboration with the UK regarding the deportation of their nationals.

In a statement, the department cited “unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive return procedures” as the reason for the potential penalty.

It said restrictions would apply “unless they agree to accept the return of their criminals and irregular migrants”.

Right to ‘family life’ claims to be checked

UK media are also reporting the government is set to limit how UK courts interpret the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in matters related to family life.

Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to a family and private life, will be reinterpreted “to better reflect the expectations of the British public”, the government is expected to say.

The new law would likely clarify that a “family connection” refers to immediate relatives only, such as a parent or child, and not to extended family members.

How will Ukrainian refugees be affected?

Asked about Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion, Mahmood said they would continue to be admitted on a “bespoke scheme” but would also be expected to return once the war ends. She stressed that many arrivals from Ukraine have expressed a desire to return home.

Under the current scheme, Ukrainian refugees have the right to live in the UK for up to three years with access to healthcare, education and benefits. As these visas are temporary, Ukrainian nationals are largely exempt from the new 20‑year settlement rules for asylum seekers.

Will there be new authorised pathways for asylum seekers to come to the UK?

Apart from Ukrainians, vulnerable people from Afghanistan are provided with legal residence, access to work, education and healthcare through the UK’s Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme.

In addition, the British national overseas (BNO) visa allows Hong Kong BNO status holders and their dependents the right to live, work and study in the UK, providing a pathway to settlement and eventual citizenship.

Mahmood also told the BBC that new “safe and legal” avenues will be introduced to try to reduce the number of people attempting perilous crossings of the English Channel.

Organisations such as Amnesty International have repeatedly highlighted that restrictive policies and limited visa schemes leave many people with no option but to attempt illegal entry.

Amnesty has called on Westminster to expand legal avenues – such as resettlement schemes, family reunification and community sponsorship – to reduce people smuggling and fatalities.

One option would be to allow individuals and charities in the UK to sponsor refugees, echoing the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which endows local communities with housing responsibilities.

The aim of these schemes, which would be for a limited number of people, is to give local areas more control to improve support.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-15T224658Z_1844714237_RC2Q1HA5XEDE_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-POLITICS-MIGRATION-1763379409.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-17 13:57:39.157285

The Trump administration has deployed a sweeping crackdown on immigration, launching ICE raids across the country and removing legal barriers in order to make deportations faster. The study found that while Democrats were largely consistent in their opposition to these immigration policies, Republican sentiment varied more, especially by age, gender and ethnicity.

“At least some subset of Republicans are seeing that these immigration strategies are a step too far,” said G. Cristina Mora, a sociology professor and co-director of the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, which administered the poll. The polling data were collected from nearly 5,000 registered voters in mid-August. Just over 1,000 of those surveyed were registered Republicans.

Latino Republicans, with whom Trump made historic gains during the 2024 elections, showed the highest levels of disagreement with the party’s aggressive stance on immigration. Young people from 18 to 29 and moderate women in the Republican Party also more significantly diverged from Trump’s policies.

The majority of Republican respondents expressed approval of Trump’s immigration strategy overall. However, the study found respondents diverged more from Trump’s policies that ignore established legal processes, including due process, birthright citizenship and identification of federal agents.

“On these legalistic issues, this is where you see some of the bigger breaks,” Mora said.

Of those surveyed, 28% disapproved of the end of birthright citizenship, which Trump is pushing for, and 45% agreed that ICE agents should show clear identification. Four in 10 Republican respondents also support due process for detained immigrants.

Young people, who make up about 15% of the party in California, were on average also more likely to break from Trump’s policies than older Republicans.

The analysis also found that education level and region had almost no impact on respondents' beliefs on immigration.

Latinos and women were more likely to disagree with Trump on humanitarian issues than their demographic counterparts.

Nearly 60% of moderate Republican women disagree with deporting longtime undocumented immigrants, compared with 47% of moderate men. 45% of women believe ICE raids unfairly target Latino communities.

The political party was most split across racial lines when it came to immigration enforcement being expanded into hospitals and schools. Forty-four percent of Latinos disagreed with the practice, compared with 26% of white respondents, while 46% of Latino respondents disagreed with deporting immigrants who have resided in the country for a long time, compared with just 30% of their white counterparts.

Trump had gained a significant Latino vote that helped him win reelection last year. Democratic candidates, however, made gains with Latino voters in elections earlier this month, indicating a possible shift away from the GOP.

The data could indicate Latino Republicans “are somewhat disillusioned” by the Trump administration's handling of immigration, Mora said. “Latinos aren't just disagreeing on the issues that we think are about process and American legal fairness. They’re also disagreeing on just the idea that this is cruel.”

Mora said the deluge of tense and sometimes violent encounters posted online could have an impact on Republican opinion surrounding immigration. A plainclothes agent pointed his gun at a female driver in Santa Ana last week, and two shootings involving ICE agents took place in Southern California late last month.

“You now have several months of Latinos being able to log on to their social media and see every kind of video of Latinos being targeted with or without papers,” Mora said. “I have to believe that that is doing something to everybody, not just Latino Republicans or Latino Democrats.”

More from James Baratta

AT&T has raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from its contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) since the early 2000s. Last year, the company inked a ten-year contract worth $146 million to “provide mission-critical communications services that support the agency’s national security and emergency preparedness mission,” a press release explains. (Verizon did the same, though its contract with DHS was valued at $176 million.)

But DHS is a very different animal during Donald Trump’s second term, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) conducting an unprecedented campaign of mass detention and deportation. In August, ICE sole-sourced an $11 million contract to AT&T for data analytics and support services. The company also received a $14 million payout from CBP in April for network-related services. Critics say AT&T does not need these rather modest contracts to remain profitable. For the past several quarters, the company’s revenues have consistently hovered around $30 billion, and its annual revenues have yet to fall shy of $120 billion.

“AT&T is enabling and profiting off of the invasion and defunding of our city and state,” said Will Tanzman, executive director of the People’s Lobby, a Chicago-based community advocacy group. “I think a lot of Chicagoans wouldn’t want to be supporting that.”

The Trump administration has sustained its assault on Chicago over the city’s sanctuary policies, threatening to withhold federal funding and deploying 200 ICE officers as part of Operation Midway Blitz in September. As my colleague Emma Janssen reported, federal immigration authorities have terrorized residents of the Windy City, killing a man in a suburb and firing pepper balls at peaceful protesters; immigration attorneys have struggled to track down their clients; and now, Chicagoans have set their sights on AT&T for “enabling and supporting the level of civil liberties violations and human rights violations that ICE is engaging in,” Tanzman told the Prospect.

The People’s Lobby and ONE People’s Campaign—member organizations of People’s Action, a national network of community activists—recently introduced a petition demanding that AT&T drop its contracts with DHS. In a joint statement, organizers criticized the telecom giant for “choosing to both collect money from customers who are in the crosshairs, and line its pockets with public dollars from DHS and ICE, whose agents are masked, unidentifiable, and operating without warrants as they terrorize members of the public in communities like Chicago.” The petition, which is addressed to AT&T CEO John Stankey, includes a pledge to “not buy or upgrade” the company’s products until it cuts ties with federal law enforcement agencies.

“We also see this as part of a larger strategy,” said Tanzman, an AT&T customer and proud Chicagoan. He expects the grassroots campaigns behind that strategy, which seeks to hold consumer-facing corporations accountable for “enabling and supporting” the Trump administration’s sweeping domestic agenda, to step up their organizing efforts in the near term. On Sunday afternoon, People’s Action organized protests at several AT&T stores throughout Chicago.

“This definitely is the season when a lot of people go out and spend money at retail establishments,” Tanzman told the Prospect. “I think this is a real opportunity for consumers to make some different decisions.”

The groundswell of grassroots organizing against consumer brands that have either supported federal immigration authorities as they ambush and kidnap immigrants at work and school, or done nothing to stop it, seems to be gaining traction. On August 12, organizers in Los Angeles coordinated a nationwide boycott of household names like The Home Depot that they say have been complicit in the federal immigration crackdown, and mobilized to support migrant workers and businesses. For their part, No Tech for ICE and adjacent campaigns have taken direct action to urge cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services to stop fueling Trump’s well-oiled deportation machine.

There is proof of concept here, as well. A similar mass subscription cancellation campaign prompted Disney to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show after he was suspended in an effort to appease the MAGA mob.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act unlocked unprecedented levels of funding for federal law enforcement agencies, with much of that funding going toward immigration enforcement, and set the table for the largest transfer of wealth to the rich in history. The People’s Lobby has been channeling the unpopularity of looming cuts to health care and food assistance programs into direct action, spending “a lot of this year pushing for the state of Illinois to tax some of the corporations that are benefiting from the big, ugly bill, so that our state can recoup some of that money in order to mitigate the negative impact,” Tanzman said. The economic fallout of that impact seems to be compelling more Americans to take a stand against consumer brands with ties to federal law enforcement agencies, which “are engaging in really reprehensible behavior that is becoming increasingly unpopular,” he told the Prospect.

“As we approach Black Friday, I think any company that has anything to do with ICE or the Trump regime is likely to see some significant backlash from consumers,” Tanzman continued. “People are likely to continue to organize more peaceful protests of those companies.”",https://i0.wp.com/prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25318635173472.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-17 13:57:52.007006

Many EOs followed regarding DOGE and its role in the government, but two in particular have been challenged heavily in the courts: EO 14219 and EO 14222.

Lawful Governance

EO 14219, signed on February 19, 2025, established the way DOGE would operate and the purpose behind the department’s responsibilities. According to the EO, one of the purposes of DOGE is to find and rescind unlawful regulations and regulations that undermine the national interest. Through this EO, President Trump allowed DOGE to begin the process of reviewing all regulations in consultation with the Attorney General’s office. Exempt from the EO are actions relating to the military, national security, foreign affairs, immigration, and homeland security, as well as the executive branch’s management of its employees and anything else exempted by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

This EO was meant to “commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome administrative state” and to focus the executive branch on ensuring regulations are fully constitutional and follow federal statutes. It requires DOGE to work with department heads in the process of reviewing, auditing, and deregulating areas that are not in line with the Trump administration’s agenda, the Constitution, and/or the national interest.

Cost Efficiency

EO 14222, signed on February 26, 2025, focused on transparency in the spending of the federal government relating to contracts, grants, and loans, with the goal of providing accountability to the American people. This EO orders that all agency heads should build systems, with the help of DOGE, to “seamlessly record every payment issued by the agency pursuant to each of the agency’s covered contracts and grants, along with a brief, written justification for each payment.” Once this is completed, there will be ongoing requirements for agencies and their employees to follow regarding spending by the agency and in the employees’ official capacities within the department.

The administration also ordered continued review of grants and contracts that require approval, justification of non-essential travel, and scrutiny of the government’s real property holdings. This EO also has broad exemptions, including law enforcement, homeland security, and classified information.

Attempts at Efficiency Lead to Extensive Litigation

Presently there are 11 court cases pending regarding EO 14222. Of those 11, four are still awaiting a court ruling, courts have issued temporary injunctions against the EO in six of the suits, and one has a pending appeal.

EO 14219 is the focus of eight lawsuits, and all eight of those court cases also list EO 14158 in their challenge. Two suits were consolidated in New Mexico et al. v. Musk, and in both cases, the plaintiffs’ motions for temporary restraining orders were denied. Four other cases are awaiting a court ruling, and two are pending appeal.

Some of the challenges raised surround the creation of DOGE and the appointment of Elon Musk in his role as the head of DOGE. Although Mr. Musk has since stepped away from the role, at the time, those challenging the EOs argued that since Mr. Musk was exercising significant government authority, he should have been approved through U.S. Senate confirmation. Since that did not happen, the cases raise the question as to whether he has the authority to be in that position and to exercise the control that President Trump has given him. In New Mexico et al. v. Musk, Joshua Fisher, the Director of the Office of Administration, submitted a declaration that explained that Mr. Musk is only an employee of the White House Office, with “no greater authority than other senior White House advisors,” and denying that Mr. Musk has any formal role with DOGE. Both complaints made in the originally separated cases ask that all action taken to date by Mr. Musk, as well as any future action he may take, be deemed to have no legal effect. The consolidated defendants’ motion to dismiss was denied in a May 27, 2025, memorandum opinion, with the exception of allowing President Trump to be removed as a defendant.

The lawsuits challenging these EOs focus heavily on blocking mass firings and limiting executive overreach, arguing that the separation of powers and checks and balances are sufficient. In the still-pending case State of Maryland v. Corporation for National and Community Service, filed on April 29, 2025, Maryland joined 23 other states and the District of Columbia to challenge AmeriCorps placing over 85 percent of its staff on administrative leave at the direction of President Trump’s administration. The plaintiffs argue that this bypasses Congress’ authority and “violates the Constitution’s separation of powers.” Similar layoffs, as well as budget cuts and other mandates, have occurred throughout other government agencies as DOGE continues to audit and monitor agency actions, as documented on its website and X account. DOGE is expected to continue its work until July 4, 2026.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-white-house-2186187195.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:58:24.332322

We affirmed the judgments of conviction for both Defendant and his company.

Defendant was the founder and CEO of a technology company. Defendant pleaded guilty, on behalf of himself and on behalf of his company, to 20 counts of wire fraud for fraudulently obtaining and reselling Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. After the guilty pleas had been entered, Defendant moved to withdraw them, arguing that intervening Supreme Court precedent invalidated the theory of prosecution for the wire fraud convictions. The district court denied Defendant’s motion. Defendant also maintained that the district court erred in failing to advise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea and that his counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of those consequences. Separately, Defendant’s company asserted that Defendant lacked the requisite authority to enter guilty pleas on its behalf.

Specifically, among other things, Defendant maintained that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the district court had failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(O). Although we agreed that the district court erred in failing to provide this warning, we found its failure to do so harmless. Defendant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Iran. Although Defendant was charged with criminal conduct that began prior to his naturalization, Defendant’s pre-naturalization conduct for which he was indicted, arrested, and convicted of after being naturalized could subject him to denaturalization.

The district court erred by failing to inform Defendant of immigration consequences if he entered a guilty plea as mandated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(O). Indeed, at oral argument, the Government agreed that the district court’s failure to read the warning was error. That did not end our analysis, however. If a criminal defendant demonstrates that the district court abused its discretion by failing to give a Rule 11(b)(1)(O) warning, the burden shifts to the prosecution to prove that the error was harmless. Here, the Government met this burden. The district court’s failure to provide the Rule 11(b)(1)(O) advice did not affect Defendant’s substantial rights. The text of the Rule references only immigration consequences for those individuals who are not United States citizens. At the time Defendant pleaded guilty, he was a citizen of the U.S., and he remains a citizen today. Thus, a warning meant for those who are not U.S. citizens would not have put Defendant on notice of the potential immigration consequences.

The Supreme Court agreed to review an effort by the Trump administration to limit asylum processing claims from immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in an order issued Thursday.

The key issue in the case, Noem v. Al Otro Lado, is over what constitutes ""arrival in the United States"" within the meaning of federal immigration law. The law provides that an alien who ""arrives"" may apply for asylum and must be inspected by an immigration officer.

The legal question, however, is over whether an immigrant ""arrives"" to begin the process for the asylum claim when meeting immigration officers on the U.S. side of the border or while still on the Mexican side.

The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court said someone ""arrives"" when they present themselves to an immigration official ""at the border,"" even if that meeting occurs on Mexican soil.

SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY

The lower court had ruled that ""metering,"" or turning away or delaying asylum-seekers because the port was deemed full, was unlawful.

The U.S. provided protection to 54,350 asylum seekers during 2023, according to data compiled by the Office of Homeland Security Statistics, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

BORDER CROSSINGS PLUMMET TO HISTORIC LOWS; TRUMP'S ENFORCEMENT POLICIES YIELD BIG RESULTS

That figure included 22,300 individuals who were granted asylum by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services within DHS and 32,050 individuals who were granted asylum defensively by the U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments next year with a ruling expected by early summer.

Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives will offer supportive opposition to the government's asylum reforms - but has said they're ""nowhere near enough"".","The government has just released a 32-page dossier outlining its reforms of the asylum system in full.

The lengthy document is topped by a foreword from the prime minister, who begins his contribution by stating that the ""world has changed"" and it is ""our responsibility to renew the application of those values as new challenges arise"".

Sir Keir Starmer added: ""It is more volatile and insecure, with increased conflict leading to a significant increase in the movement of people across the globe.

""Our asylum system was not designed to cope with this. Nor were our rules designed for the situation that sees asylum seekers travelling through multiple safe countries before seeking to cross the English Channel by boat.""

He says this has resulted in ""severe strain"" not only on the asylum system, but also on the ""wider social contract"".

The PM adds that the UK is a ""decent, compassionate, tolerant country"", but that the government must control the borders to maintain ""confidence in those values"".

He says the UK's current asylum regime ""is a significant pull factor"" and is ""more permissive than the European mainstream"".

This means, he explains, that the UK needs an ""approach with a stronger deterrent effect and rules that are robustly enforced"".

He concludes: ""The principle that people genuinely fleeing danger and persecution should be welcomed is one this government will always defend – an expression of the UK's values in action.

""But that principle depends upon social confidence that our asylum system is fair, effective and humane.""

You can read the document in full (if you really wish) here.

We'll bring you more of what we've learnt from it shortly.

A Labour MP has launched an attack on her government's asylum reforms, calling them ""dystopian"" and ""shameful"".

Nadia Whittome told the Commons: ""The Denmark-style policies briefed in the last couple of days are dystopian.

""It's shameful that a Labour government is ripping up the rights and protections of people who have endured unimaginable trauma.

""How can we be adopting such obviously cruel policies? Is the home secretary proud that the government has sunk to such depths that it's now being praised by [far-right activist] Tommy Robinson?""

Responding to her question, Shabana Mahmood said that she was ""disappointed at the nature of the question"".

She urged Whittome to look at ""the detail"" of the reforms and insisted she as home secretary has a ""moral duty"" to ""fix"".

""Our asylum system is broken. The breaking of that asylum system is causing huge division across the whole country.""

She insisted the changes she will set out later will fix the problem and ""unite what is today a divided country"".

Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives will offer supportive opposition to the government's asylum reforms - but has said they're ""nowhere near enough"".

The Tory leader told journalists that she does welcome the reforms and called them a ""small step in the right direction"".

But she insisted that her party wants ""to ban all asylum claims completely"" and leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

She said: ""We're going to work with them to try and get this through, because what I know is that a lot of Labour backbenchers hate this stuff.

""We are going to do everything we can to support her.

""Unless we leave the ECHR, I suspect Shabana Mahmood is going to run into the same legal problems that the Conservative government ran into.""

Badenoch criticised the decision to still offer asylum seekers a path to permanent citizenship (after 20 years), saying she would like to see everybody who arrives in the UK illegally ""gone within a week"".

""If you arrive in our country illegally, you need to be sent home,"" she added.

""If people know that they can get citizenship after arriving here illegally, they're going to encourage more and more people to come here.""

She also admitted that leaving the ECHR is ""not a silver bullet"" but is a ""measure necessary in order to do lots of other things"".

Badenoch also called for the creation of a removals force, the end of immigration tribunals, and the end of judicial reviews ""that mean that court cases go on and on"".

Labour MP Richard Burgon is the latest to speak out against the government's major reforms to the asylum system to make the UK much less attractive to illegal migrants, and speed up deportations.

The MP, who is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, labelled the announcement ""a further desperate attempt to outdo Reform and chase its voters"", and noted that Labour has ""moved a long way from the days when the prime minister promised 'an immigration system based on compassion and dignity'"".

Writing on X, Burgon said: ""We now have policies and briefings that seem to have been dragged from the moral sewer - and that are even being celebrated by far-right figures like 'Tommy Robinson'.""

He continued: ""This approach isn’t just morally wrong; it’s politically disastrous.""

He argued that the voters who have left Labour since the general election will not come back as a result of these policies, and most fled to progressive parties anyway.

Watch: Can the asylum plan unite Labour?

Burgon called on the government to focus on cost of living to ""win back voters"", and added: ""This failing Labour leadership is choosing to fight on terrain set by Farage. In doing so, it is paving the way for the first far-right government in our history.""

Ian Byrne, a fellow Labour MP who is also a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, has issued a similar statement.

The Liverpool West Derby MP wrote on X: ""The polls are clear, the cost of living crisis is what matters.

""That's where we should focus, and that's why I'm launching the Right to Food Commission today, while the leadership is fighting on ground chosen by Farage, paving the way for a dangerous far-right future.""

He also labelled the government's plans ""morally bankrupt and politically disastrous"".

Many Labour MPs have been left shellshocked after the chaotic political self-sabotage of the past week.

Bafflement, anger, disappointment, and sheer frustration are all on relatively open display at the circular firing squad which seems to have surrounded the prime minister.

The botched effort to flush out backroom plotters and force Wes Streeting to declare his loyalty ahead of the budget has, instead, led even previously-loyal Starmerites to predict the PM could be forced out of office before the local elections in May.

""We have so many councillors coming up for election across the country,"" one says. ""And at the moment it looks like they're going to be wiped out.

""That's our base - we just can't afford to lose them. I like Keir [Starmer] but there's only a limited window left to turn things around. There's a real question of urgency.""

Another criticised a ""boys club"" at Number 10 who they claimed have ""undermined"" the prime minister and ""forgotten they're meant to be serving the British people"".

We've heard a lot this morning about the government's plan to reform - toughen up - the rules around claiming asylum in the UK.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has called it a ""moral mission"", claiming how the UK is divided by the issue and how she wants to resolve this.

Central to the government's plans has been a look at the Danish model.

So, what is Denmark's record on immigration, and how does it all work?

Denmark has adopted increasingly restrictive rules in order to deal with migration over the last few years.

In Denmark, most asylum or refugee statuses are temporary. Residency can be revoked once a country is deemed safe.

In order to achieve settlement, asylum seekers are required to be in full-time employment, and the length of time it takes to acquire those rights has been extended.

Denmark also has tougher rules on family reunification - both the sponsor and their partner are required to be at least 24 years old, which the Danish government says is designed to prevent forced marriages.

The sponsor must also not have claimed welfare for three years and must provide a financial guarantee for their partner. Both must also pass a Danish language test.

In 2018, Denmark introduced what it called a ghetto package, a controversial plan to radically alter some residential areas, including by demolishing social housing. Areas with over 1,000 residents were defined as ghettos if more than 50% were ""immigrants and their descendants from non-Western countries"".

In 2021, the left of centre government passed a law that allowed refugees arriving on Danish soil to be moved to asylum centres in a partner country - and subsequently agreed with Rwanda to explore setting up a program, although that has been put on hold.

The government has come in for major criticism from some of its own backbenchers for the major reforms it is about to announce to make the UK much less attractive to illegal migrants, and speed up deportations.

Downing Street has defended its position, telling journalists that their policy ""reflects the mandate we have been given to secure our borders and deal with the asylum system that we've inherited"".

Asked whether it was chasing the hard-right, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are responding to the mandate we have been given, and the public can tell that the pace and scale of illegal migration is out of control, unfair and placing huge pressure on communities.

""And the prime minister wants to fix the chaos in the asylum system so we can move away from division and decline and build a Britain for all.""

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he said: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""

Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice held a news conference this morning to tout his party's work on reducing spending in local councils.

Our political correspondent Rob Powell asked why he thinks so many councillors have left their party.

Tice replied: ""Councillors come and go. We've welcomed lots of defections to Reform from all over the place.

""But ultimately, people have to abide by our principles and values. We are a team. We're a large family, and like all families, we have our debates, our discussions, our excitements.

""But those are always best played out behind closed doors. And when you've got 1,000 councillors give or take, just under - stuff will happen.""

Tice added that voters ""want more Reform, not less Reform"".",https://e3.365dm.com/25/09/1600x900/skynews-shabana-mahmood-hub_7014255.jpg?20250908115205,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:24.470936

Federal law requires the government to process asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry. But in 2018, President Donald Trump’s first administration began a policy known as “metering,” in which border agents simply turned back potential asylum seekers to Mexico before they entered the US.

An immigrant rights group, Al Otro Lado, and several asylum seekers filed a lawsuit in California challenging the policy. An appeals court based in San Francisco sided with the migrants, and the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in July.

The practical impact of the litigation, at least for now, is limited at best. The Biden administration rescinded “metering” and instead began requiring most people seeking asylum to make an appointment before arriving at a port of entry. Because of that, Al Otro Lado argued that the case “has almost no present implications, and likely no future implications either.”

But the Trump administration balked at that reasoning, telling the Supreme Court that “this administration and future administrations should retain the option of reviving that practice when border conditions justify doing so.”

In that sense, the fact that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case was already a win for Trump.

A divided 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal law requires border agencies to inspect asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry, even if they did not enter the country. In its appeal to the high court, the Trump administration argued that cannot be right.

“In ordinary English, a person ‘arrives in’ a country only when he comes within its borders,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court. “An alien thus does not ‘arrive in’ the United States while he is still in Mexico.”

But the groups supporting Al Otro Lado said that reading would make a mockery of the asylum process, empowering officials to render “inspection and asylum processing requirements wholly inoperable at ports of entry – the designated places where noncitizens may lawfully come into the United States – by simply blocking asylum seekers from stepping on U.S. soil.”

The court will hear arguments in the case next year and hand down a decision by the end of June.

A Councilwoman Intervened During an ICE Arrest. Then She Faced the Voters.

Months before the election, Etel Haxhiaj, a councilwoman in Worcester, Mass., was charged with assaulting an officer when she stood between the police and an immigrant family.

Nov. 17, 2025, 5:00 a.m. ET

Early on Election Day, Etel Haxhiaj pulled a campaign sign from the back seat of her car and found a spot on the sidewalk outside Blessed Sacrament Church, a polling place in Worcester, Mass. A cold wind tugged at the sign in her hands, threatening to blow it away.

Ms. Haxhiaj, 45, was a two-term city councilwoman in the city. By that night, she would know the fate of her campaign for re-election. Voters would judge her handling of everyday municipal business, but many would also consider a thornier question: Should Ms. Haxhiaj have intervened in an immigration enforcement action on a street in her district?

The encounter in May — a chaotic confrontation among residents, city police officers and federal immigration agents — had grabbed national attention after videos of it went viral. Ms. Haxhiaj had placed herself in the middle of it, standing between the police and an immigrant family. Six months later, she was fighting charges of assaulting an officer and interfering with the police. And she was facing a worrisome reality: Her actions in May could cost her the election, even in this diverse, immigrant-friendly, majority-Democratic city.

The controversy had brought new campaign donations and support. But it had also set off a fierce backlash. An angry man had accosted Ms. Haxhiaj outside a supermarket as she walked with her children. A bomb threat had been sent to her city email: “This is what you lunatic progressive get,” it said in capital letters. Days before the election, a local firefighters union had rescinded its endorsement of her after receiving complaints from its members.

Worcester is the second-largest city in Massachusetts, a liberal state where 61 percent of voters had supported Kamala Harris for president. But its politics are complicated.

Moderate Democrats have long held power, but since 2020, more socially progressive Democrats have run for office, Ms. Haxhiaj among them. An immigrant from Albania, she became the first Muslim on the council in 2022. Another progressive, an immigrant from Vietnam, became the first openly nonbinary member the same year.

As the newcomers pushed for racial justice, L.G.B.T.Q. protections and changes in policing, tensions ticked up. So did a perception among some voters that basic city business, like road repairs and snow removal, had taken a back seat.

In that unsettled atmosphere, Ms. Haxhiaj’s clash with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the police had the effect of a match on dry kindling.

Elsewhere in the lead-up to Election Day, progressive Democrats had big momentum. In New York, Zohran Mamdani led the race for mayor by a sweeping margin. In Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu would coast to victory unopposed. In Worcester, about 50 miles to the west, the picture was less clear. Would voters tolerate a council with diverse views and backgrounds, looser ties to business interests and vocal disagreements between members?

Outside the towering stone church where Ms. Haxhiaj stood waving at traffic on Election Day, a man in a passing truck appeared to glare at her. Seconds later, a car honked in support.

She had written two speeches: one for victory, another for defeat. There was little left to do but grip her sign and wait.

An Arrest on Eureka Street

Six days before the election, in a packed union hall, it was hard to tell which candidate was winning louder applause — Ms. Haxhiaj (pronounced HA-jee-eye) or her only opponent, José Rivera.

Moderators of the debate had waited only minutes before asking about the encounter with ICE in May on Eureka Street, in a residential neighborhood within the district. Ms. Haxhiaj remained unrepentant.

“We have all seen secret police snatching people off our streets,” she said. “My job as councilor is to protect my constituents, especially women and children.”

At least half the crowd roared in approval. But the cheering sounded just as loud when Mr. Rivera took the microphone and disagreed: A city councilor’s role, he said, was to defuse tensions, not elevate them.

“We are a country of law and order, and I think it’s important to show that we respect law enforcement,” said Mr. Rivera, 52, a court officer, former professional boxer and former Democrat who is no longer affiliated with a party.

It had never been in question that ICE would come to Worcester. President Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, had not attacked the working-class city of 200,000 like he had Boston. But Worcester had long been a destination for refugees and asylum seekers, with lower rents and a constellation of organizations to help them.

Liberal-leaning residents of Worcester had begun preparing for aggressive immigration enforcement even before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Some attended training on how to serve as so-called informed observers, documenting the actions of federal agents. They set up messaging groups to share updates on ICE’s movements in the city.

Ms. Haxhiaj, who works as a housing advocate, had not taken the training. But when friends texted her about a conflict that was unfolding after an ICE arrest on Eureka Street on the morning of May 8, she rushed to join them. Driving there, she felt nervous but determined.

“I kept thinking, something bad is happening to my constituents, and I need to be there to protect them,” she said.

Federal agents had detained a Brazilian woman who they said was in the country illegally. After Ms. Haxhiaj arrived, she stood by the woman and her daughters, one a teenager and the other holding a baby. Ms. Haxhiaj shielded them with her arms and demanded that the agents show a warrant. After the woman was placed in an ICE vehicle, her daughters clung to the car, trying to prevent it from leaving.

Ms. Haxhiaj declined to describe what happened on the street, citing her ongoing court case. But body camera footage from the incident shows pushing, pulling and moments of contact between civilians, ICE agents and police officers who had been summoned by ICE to clear the crowd. At one point, officers tried to lay hands on Ms. Haxhiaj’s arms, and she shook them off. At another, her hands flew out and appeared to make contact with an officer’s chest.

When federal agents finally drove away with the woman, her younger daughter ran after the car, crying and screaming. Police officers raced to stop her, and the teenager ended up on the ground. “She was just howling, ‘No, no, no,’” said Maydee Morales, a community activist who was there. “It’s a sound I will never forget.”

The ICE action did not result in a deportation. After four months in detention, the Brazilian woman was released and granted asylum. The police charges against her teenage daughter, for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, were dropped.

But soon after the incident, the local police union called for an investigation into Ms. Haxhiaj’s actions, citing her “reckless interference and agitation of that crowd.” In early June, the Worcester police announced they were charging her with assaulting an officer and interfering with the police, both misdemeanors. (The department did not respond to interview requests.)

“I did the humane thing,” Ms. Haxhiaj said when the charges were announced. “Nothing more, nothing less.”

She pleaded not guilty and asked a judge to dismiss the charges. The next hearing in her case is scheduled for Wednesday.

‘I Saw a Family in Distress’

On a bright Saturday morning in September, Ms. Haxhiaj parked on Eureka Street and studied a list of likely voters. She had been back there only once or twice since May. Several yards had signs for her opponent.

She had always considered neighborhood canvassing the most important kind of campaign work. “If you love this job, you love door knocking,” she said.

But now, approaching strangers’ doors felt dangerous. It was hard to forget the man who had called her ugly names outside a supermarket, or the man who had verbally assaulted her and another councilor as he followed them through a cemetery on Memorial Day, angry at her defense of what he called “illegals.”

Still, a sense of urgency drove her back to the streets of her district this fall. Two years ago, she had beaten Mr. Rivera by just 174 votes. This race could be even closer.

In some ways, the confrontation in May had brought her full circle. As a teenager, she had watched her home country, Albania, descend into violence. Her family fled to Greece as undocumented immigrants, hiding their nationality.

Her father had been arrested on a bus on his way to work one day and jailed for his immigration status. He was released just in time for the family’s green card interviews, after which they were granted the chance to start new lives in the United States.

Years later on Eureka Street, “I saw a family in distress,” Ms. Haxhiaj said. “My instinct was to use the power I’d been given to defend them from the things my family had experienced.”

She would do the same again, she said. But she had not realized how much it could cost her.

As she stood on Eureka Street again to knock on doors, a van rounded the corner. “Have fun in prison!” a man inside shouted at her through an open window.

A Hero to Some, Not All

Even before the events of May 8, Ms. Haxhiaj had been something of a lightning rod, beloved by some residents for her progressive approach to issues like housing, homelessness and zoning, but accused by others of using inflammatory rhetoric and spending too much time on polarizing national concerns.

She had alienated some Jewish voters in 2023 by opposing a council resolution that condemned Hamas, because it did not acknowledge Palestinian suffering. And she had angered the Worcester police force by pushing for reform after a damning Justice Department report last year on police misconduct.

After May 8, many liberal city residents criticized the police, infuriated by what they saw as collaboration with ICE on Eureka Street. Days after Ms. Haxhiaj was charged, a City Council meeting had to be adjourned when protesters packed the chamber, chanting “ICE out of Worcester now.”

Around the city, strangers thanked her. After she and her sons had finished lunch at a TGI Friday’s restaurant in July, the bill came with a handwritten note from their server. “We need more people like you,” it said. “Keep up the good fight.”

Criticism of Ms. Haxhiaj was quieter, but widespread. Steve Quist, who runs a Facebook page about city politics and lost to Ms. Haxhiaj in a past council race, said that her actions were “a step too far.” Even if she did not “slug” officers on Eureka Street, he said, “she kept pushing them away, and that’s assault.”

Mr. Quist predicted that Mr. Rivera would win the election, boosted by Ms. Haxhiaj’s “attack on public safety” and by voters seeking a return to “common sense” from “chaos.”

“We want leaders who talk about sidewalks, not national issues,” he said.

A Close Finish

At the polls on Election Day, a few voters shared their views: A pastor who said he voted against Ms. Haxhiaj because he opposes illegal immigration. Another man who said he did the same because he wanted councilors to prioritize problems they can fix.

There were also voters like Rob Tisdell, 37, who grew up on Eureka Street and cast his ballot for Ms. Haxhiaj because of what she did there.

“I was thrilled to see someone from government taking a stand,” he said.

After the polls closed, volunteers from Ms. Haxhiaj’s campaign headed to an African restaurant where a buffet of chicken, rice and plantains waited. Early vote tallies showed her barely leading. Then the count refreshed, and the crowd grew quiet: Mr. Rivera had surged ahead.

Huddled with family at her home nearby, Ms. Haxhiaj felt her heart sink as the gap widened. In the end, she would lose by 375 votes, 3,956 to 3,581.

“I let so many people down,” she thought on the short drive to the restaurant.

Speaking to her supporters just inside the door, her voice wobbled at times. She pledged to continue to “protect our neighbors” and “push for a better city.”

Through her tears, she had already begun to imagine how her loss would free her: to be better rested, more focused and fiercer, outside the confines of elected office. “An unleashed Etel is more powerful,” she said days later on a local podcast.

Reflecting on the outcome a week later, she saw low voter turnout as a factor, as well as a powerful police union that had mobilized against her and business interests that had backed her opponent. She also saw misogyny. But the shadow of Eureka Street, and the charges against her, had been critical obstacles, she thought.

Still, she could not accept the view that the ICE crackdown, and other federal actions in her district, were none of her concern, or the City Council’s.

“These are real people,” she said. “People who don’t want us to talk about it are either refusing to believe their neighbors are affected, or they are choosing to ignore them.”

Mr. Rivera, for his part, said he had already received a slew of emails from constituents seeking his help to get streets and sidewalks repaired.

“Independents, Democrats, Republicans all want the same things,” he said. “We all want a good city, so let’s unite and not be part of that divisiveness.”

Laws written for a twentieth-century industrial economy now regulate twenty-first-century enterprises, while enforcement has evolved into a data-driven, intelligence-based system. This mismatch — outdated law enforced through modern analytics and investigative capability — defines what has become the compliance paradox.

Traditional compliance models, which emphasize documentation and formality, were designed for a different era. For example, an employer might once have assumed that maintaining a complete set of forms and records — I-9s, petitions and audit files — satisfied its compliance burden. Today’s enforcement agencies can cross-reference data across systems, comparing visa filings to tax records or travel history. A process that appears perfect on paper can collapse under scrutiny if those systems do not align — proof that perfect files no longer protect an organization whose operations diverge from its legal representations.

Enforcement itself has evolved from a reactive audit model to a proactive intelligence function — one that measures not paperwork, but control. True compliance is a function of governance: the behaviors, systems and culture that ensure a company acts lawfully even when the rules no longer align neatly with modern business models.

These developments have accelerated in 2025 under the Department of Justice’s recalibrated enforcement priorities. Recent DOJ memoranda have expanded the use of criminal charging, whistleblower incentives and civil fraud mechanisms to reach corporate immigration practices that once would have been handled administratively. The policies now mandate centralized reporting from U.S. Attorneys’ offices and emphasize corporate accountability — including through voluntary self-disclosure regimes and the False Claims Act — effectively merging immigration enforcement with the tools traditionally reserved for white-collar crime.

The central argument of this blog is that immigration compliance must evolve into a strategic governance discipline. Employers who integrate legal, operational and reputational awareness into their compliance architecture will not only withstand modern enforcement but also demonstrate integrity in how they operate globally.

The compliance paradox has multiple dimensions. Programs that once sufficed no longer do — not simply because enforcement agencies now possess the analytic tools to see beyond paperwork, but because they can verify whether the evidence of compliance actually reflects what happens in practice. At the same time, business models have evolved far beyond the regulatory frameworks built to govern them, creating gaps between operational reality and legal form. Many employers still rely on compliance structures that were performative from the start — systems designed to document, not to control — or treat immigration compliance as a peripheral HR function rather than a strategic enterprise risk. The modern challenge is to reconcile these forces: to align outdated rules with modern operations, to ensure that documented compliance reflects real conduct and to build governance systems capable of monitoring, auditing and managing the gaps in between.

The Illusion of Compliance — Why Perfect Paperwork Still Fails

The first step toward reforming compliance thinking is recognizing how easily organizations confuse documentation with adherence. For decades, immigration compliance was built on the belief that tidy records equaled legal security. Employers assembled I-9s, maintained public access files and archived petitions, confident that a well-organized paper trail could withstand any inspection.

That assumption no longer holds. Regulators now look past documentation to the underlying conduct: whether employees perform the duties described in filings, whether wages and locations align with certifications and whether internal systems detect discrepancies. Enforcement has become a test of operational truth, not administrative neatness.

One common example of this misplaced confidence is E-Verify. Many employers assume that enrolling in the system, or using it to confirm new-hire eligibility, insulates them from risk. In practice, E-Verify is a useful verification tool but not a legal defense. Participation does not cure underlying errors in the Form I-9 process, prevent findings of document abuse, or preclude liability for discrimination under 8 U.S.C. § 1324b. E-Verify also does not guard against identify fraud because it only verifies that an identity exists. It does not guarantee that the individual presenting the identity is that identity’s true owner. Overreliance on E-Verify as a safeguard demonstrates diligence in form, but not necessarily conformity in substance.

This shift exposes the illusion of compliance. Paperwork demonstrates awareness, not conformity. The presence of a file does not mean the organization is acting within the law; it only means someone once intended to. Substantive compliance today requires governance — coordinated processes, technology, and accountability that ensure the company’s real-world practices match its representations to the government.

Substantive Risk and Operational Governance — Where Compliance Really Lives

This shift exposes a larger truth: paperwork demonstrates awareness, not adherence. The presence of a file — or an electronic confirmation — does not mean the organization is acting within the law; it only means someone once intended to comply. Even as the economy transforms, six enduring legal principles remain constant.

In the modern enterprise, however, these legal constants have become operational stress points — the junctions where governance either functions or fails.

Notice to U.S. Workers: Posting and transparency requirements under H-1B and PERM remain a key measure of labor-market fairness. In a hybrid world, ensuring postings are accurate and accessible requires coordination across HR, Legal, and business teams — not just checking a box.

Wages: Variable pay, equity compensation, and agile job structures make wage compliance an exercise in real-time financial control. Governance systems must link payroll, HR and immigration data to ensure prevailing wage obligations remain intact.

Location: As remote work blurs traditional “place of employment,” monitoring where services are performed becomes a data-governance issue. Employers must maintain systems that detect location changes that could invalidate labor condition applications.

Duration: Visa validity and work authorization often sit across disconnected systems. Without integrated monitoring, extension and amendment obligations can be missed, transforming a clerical lapse into a substantive violation.

Work Performed: As job roles evolve, duties can drift beyond those certified in filings. Embedding immigration awareness into workforce planning prevents that drift from becoming noncompliance.

Anti-Discrimination: Employers must ensure that hiring, promotion, and employment-eligibility verification practices do not disadvantage protected individuals based on citizenship or immigration status. The same statutes that govern verification also prohibit discriminatory treatment under 8 U.S.C. § 1324b, making training and consistent procedures critical to managing this risk.

Together, these constants represent the operational edge of governance — the points where outdated law meets modern work. Managing them effectively requires cross-functional collaboration and disciplined oversight. Failures here rarely stem from ignorance; they reflect breakdowns in systems or culture.

These six areas are the practical test of an organization’s compliance maturity. They reveal whether the enterprise can govern itself coherently when business innovation moves faster than the law.

Intersecting Domains and Enforcement Evolution — When Compliance Becomes Systemic

Immigration compliance does not exist in isolation. It intersects with employment verification, export controls, tax, and equal employment law — each with distinct enforcement priorities. The result is regulatory asymmetry: an action that satisfies one agency’s expectations can simultaneously expose an employer to another’s jurisdiction.

This asymmetry is especially evident in the labor certification process. Employers pursuing permanent residence sponsorship for foreign nationals through the Department of Labor’s PERM program must comply with detailed recruitment and posting regulations designed to protect U.S. workers. Yet an administrative court at the Department of Justice (DOJ) has held that those same recruitment activities fall under the antidiscrimination provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, at 8 U.S.C. §1324b, enforced by DOJ’s Immigrant and Employee Rights (IER) Section.

Here the compliance paradox takes on a tangible form: behavior that satisfies one regulator’s technical requirements can simultaneously violate another’s substantive mandate. The Department of Labor (DOL) rules compel employers to advertise roles in prescribed ways that demonstrate intent to hire through the PERM process. The IER’s position, however, is that how an employer chooses among its DOL-permitted recruitment options can be recruitment that restricts or discourages U.S. applicants and thus potential citizenship-status discrimination.

The consequences have been substantial. In recent years, high-profile settlements—exceeding tens of millions of dollars—have shown that procedural compliance with DOL regulations does not insulate an employer from liability under DOJ enforcement. PERM recruitment practices consistent with labor regulations were found by the IER to disadvantage U.S. workers.

Since immigration programs intersect with civil rights, labor and national security frameworks, actions taken to satisfy one obligation may trigger exposure under another. This same dynamic extends across the broader compliance landscape. The I-9 process implicates both the Department of Homeland Security and DOJ oversight. Export-control regulations enforced by the Commerce and State Departments can overlap with visa compliance for foreign engineers. Even routine business travel can create exposure across immigration, tax and employment law.

Since agencies now coordinate and share data, compliance failures in one domain rarely remain contained there. The DOJ’s new enforcement framework magnifies this risk. Under its 2025 “Corporate Enforcement and Voluntary Self-Disclosure Policy,” immigration-related violations can now trigger the same prosecutorial responses as anti-corruption or sanctions cases — including corporate monitorships and public declinations. The expanded whistleblower award program also creates new exposure: line supervisors, recruiters, or vendors who detect I-9 or visa irregularities can now earn financial rewards for reporting them. Combined with Attorney General Bondi’s charging directive to pursue “the most serious, readily provable offense,” these changes signal that immigration compliance is being treated as a matter of corporate integrity, not administrative housekeeping.

Initiatives such as DOL’s Project Firewall and the hiring of USCIS 1811-series investigators have enabled cross-agency, analytics-driven enforcement. Agencies now detect anomalies before a notice or subpoena is ever issued — a shift toward enforcement by inference.

To meet this new reality, employers must mirror that integration internally. Legal, HR, Mobility, Export Control, Finance, and Internal Audit must operate within a shared governance framework, supported by Government Affairs and Corporate Communications, which provide context and manage reputational risk.

Strategic Risk Management — Navigating Regulatory Lag

Even with strong systems, compliance is complicated by a structural reality: the immigration framework was built for another era. It assumes static job descriptions, fixed worksites and linear employment models. The technology and service sectors that dominate today’s economy operate through distributed teams, agile projects and constant change— realities the law scarcely contemplates. A software engineer may contribute to a single project from three countries and two U.S. jurisdictions in the same year, while legacy visa frameworks still presume one worksite and one job description. That mismatch creates compliance gaps that no checklist can close.

This regulatory lag has real consequences. When rules do not align with business models, some organizations treat compliance as a secondary concern, rationalizing deviations as necessary for competitiveness. But the rules remain enforceable even when they no longer make sense. Enforcement agencies have shown little tolerance for businessmodel justifications. That imbalance is real. Employers operate within a patchwork of outdated statutes and agency interpretations that change faster than formal rulemaking. But while the law’s inconsistencies are beyond their control, how organizations manage within that uncertainty is not.

Navigating this gap requires disciplined adaptability. Employers must identify where business imperatives collide with legal requirements, quantify the associated risks, and make deliberate, documented choices about how to proceed. This process must include Legal, HR, Government Affairs, and Corporate Communications to balance operational, legal, and reputational concerns.

Governance maturity lies in transparency and intent—in acknowledging when compliance requirements are misaligned with reality and managing that misalignment deliberately. Following the law blindly when it no longer fits the business model is not realistic; ignoring it outright is rash. The responsible path is structured decision-making — informed, documented and defensible.

The measure of compliance leadership, then, is not avoiding every gray area, but managing it with integrity.

Strategic Integrity — The Future of Immigration Compliance

Immigration enforcement now evaluates behavior through the lens of governance. The distinction between technical error and willful violation often depends on whether a company can demonstrate that its systems are designed to prevent and correct mistakes. Agencies routinely mitigate penalties where employers can show credible controls, self-auditing and remediation. Without such infrastructure, even minor discrepancies appear negligent.

Compliance has therefore become evidentiary. Employers must be able to prove the existence of a functioning compliance architecture — not just produce forms. But compliance governance does not require building new bureaucracies; it means designing proportional systems of accountability that fit the organization’s size and complexity. Even small employers can strengthen compliance simply by connecting immigration oversight to their existing governance or audit frameworks. For senior leadership, that means immigration compliance must be integrated into enterprise risk discussions, like cybersecurity, ESG or data privacy.

The compliance paradox will persist until the law itself evolves, but employers cannot wait for legislative reform. The task today is to modernize compliance to match enforcement — to govern strategically, make transparent decisions, and maintain documentation that demonstrates judgment as well as procedure.

Yet in many organizations, immigration compliance still sits apart from broader corporate governance and strategic planning. Senior leaders often view it as an operational or HR concern rather than a core enterprise risk. When executives overlook immigration risk in strategic planning, they not only expose the organization to enforcement, but also undermine its credibility with regulators, investors and employees who increasingly equate compliance discipline with corporate integrity. In reality, immigration compliance belongs at the same table as financial controls, data security and ethics — a strategic discipline that protects the organization’s license to operate globally.

That need has only intensified under DOJ’s current enforcement agenda. The integration of immigration violations into corporate fraud and civil rights frameworks means the government now assesses companies not just on whether they follow immigration rules, but on whether they govern those obligations with the same rigor applied to financial reporting or cybersecurity. For boards and executives, immigration compliance has effectively become a governance referendum.

Ultimately, immigration compliance is no longer about paperwork; it is about proof of governance. The companies that thrive are those that understand this reality and treat compliance not as an obligation, but as evidence of how responsibly they choose to operate.

If the United States kills someone, and if the intelligence provided facilitates that killing, the State sharing the intelligence is itself violating international law.","Several States have curtailed intelligence-sharing with the United States due to the continuing drug boat strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific that have killed 83 people to date. Notably, the United Kingdom, which maintains a significant presence in the Caribbean, has for years provided intelligence to support U.S. Coast Guard drug interdiction, in addition to conducting its own counter-narcotics operations. Concerned that the United States might use that support to unlawfully target drug boats, over a month ago, the UK suspended sharing intelligence. Asked about the CNN report that broke the story, Secretary of State Rubio labeled it “false,” without stating why.

Reports have also emerged that the Netherlands has curtailed intelligence cooperation due to fear that the United States might use it to support human rights violations or, a rather shocking concern, assist Russia.

Canada, which is conducting Operation Caribbe in coordination with the Coast Guard and 13 other nations, has likewise informed the United States that the information it provides is not to be used to facilitate the boat strikes. As a spokesperson for the Department of National Defence emphasized, “Canadian Armed Forces activities under Operation Caribbe, conducted in coordination with the United States Coast Guard, are separate and distinct from the activities you describe involving other branches of the United States military.”

And Colombia, which has long collaborated hand-in-glove with the United States on counter-drug operations, has similarly suspended intelligence sharing with U.S. intelligence agencies until the strikes end. Colombian President Gustavo Petro justified the decision by noting, “The fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people.” Mexico has also opposed the boat strikes, called on the United States to respect international treaties, and most recently announced an arrangement with the United States whereby the Mexican Navy will intercept boats near the countries’ coasts in order to prevent further lethal attacks in that area.

In recent days, E.U. leaders and member States, such as France, have told journalists that they consider the boat strikes flatly illegal. (France too has a significant presence in the region, including past work with U.S. counter-narcotics operations.) In response to such European legal concerns, Rubio quipped, because many of the shipments are bound for Europe, “Maybe they should be thanking us.”

Suspension of intelligence sharing is not new. For example, Germany and other European States froze intelligence following revelations of torture and rendition in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. And the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces motivated France to curtail intelligence cooperation on the basis that the invasion was unlawful.

The U.S. attacks on suspected drug traffickers are both short-sighted from a strategic policy perspective and morally questionable. Such concerns may have motivated the intelligence sharing restrictions that U.S. allies and partners have imposed. However, as we will explain in this essay, even setting aside those concerns, the decision to withhold intelligence and other cooperation that might contribute to the U.S. operations was a sensible decision from the perspective of international legal risk.

To understand why, it is necessary to assess both the legality of the strikes under international law and the relationship between them and the cooperation being withheld. If the operations are lawful (they are not), other States may lawfully contribute to them, barring any other applicable rule specifically prohibiting such contributions. However, if the U.S. operations are unlawful, this raises the urgent question whether support for them would itself violate international law. In other words, would a State sharing intelligence with the United States be complicit in the “internationally wrongful acts” of the United States? Accordingly, we first conduct a brief survey of the legality of U.S. strikes and then proceed to examine the possible complicity of third States.

The Legality of the Operations

Despite protestations from the Trump administration, and the very suspect claims by a Pentagon spokesperson that “lawyers up and down the chain of command have been thoroughly involved in reviewing these operations prior to execution” and “no lawyer involved has questioned the legality” of them, international law experts who have opined on the matter are nearly unanimous in their conclusions that the strikes clearly violate international law (see, inter alia, Just Security’s collection of commentary and this episode of EJIL: The Podcast!). However, there is some confusion among the broader public regarding why this is the case.

Inapplicable Law: UN Charter, Non-Intervention, and Laws of War

The U.S. operations do not violate the prohibition on the use of force found in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, for that rule only bars the use of force directed at other States. Thus, attacking a flagless (Stateless) ship on the high seas does not amount to a wrongful use of force under international law’s jus ad bellum. For the same reason, the strikes do not constitute unlawful intervention into the internal affairs of other States.

Nor do the operations violate the law of armed conflict (LOAC), as that law is inapplicable in this situation for reasons explained below. Nevertheless, the administration, in a notification to Congress and a statement to the United Nations Security Council, contends that the attacks are lawful on the basis that the United States is involved in a non-international armed conflict (NIAC) with drug cartels and that those killed were “unlawful combatants.” It is correct that civilians who directly participate in hostilities (so-called unlawful combatants) may be attacked for such time as they so participate. Moreover, in our view, members of the armed wing of an “organized armed group” (OAG) may be attacked at any time during a NIAC, so long as other targeting rules, such as the rule of proportionality and the requirement to take precautions to protect civilians in attack, are satisfied.

However, whether those aboard the boats fall into either of the targetable categories need not detain us here; LOAC rules are simply not relevant in this situation, since it does not qualify as a NIAC. A NIAC, as distinct from an armed conflict between States, requires protracted and intense armed violence between a State and non-State organized armed group, an explanation derived from the judgements of international tribunals and long-accepted by the United States (Tadić, para. 70; ICTR, Akayesu, para. 619; ICC, Bemba, para. 229; DoD Law of War Manual, § 17.1.1).

To begin with, drug trafficking as such has never been treated as “armed violence,” nor could it. Drug cartels sometimes use violence against a government, but it is that violence that can qualify the situation as a NIAC, not their drug activities. Moreover, the violence must be at a high level to distinguish a NIAC from “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence, and other acts of a similar nature” (DoD Law of War Manual, § 17.1.1). Examples include various situations in Mexico and Colombia, where cartels or armed groups such as Sinaloa and the FARC directed intense violence against the government in addition to producing and trafficking drugs.

Although there was no qualifying violence until the first strike, the more attacks the United States conducts, the more likely it is that this threshold will arguably be reached – despite the fact that the violence is one-sided (although some scholars believe there needs to be exchanges of fire from both sides). But even if the threshold is reached, the violence must be directed at an organized armed group. This requirement is not met simply because a group possesses weapons or sometimes uses violence to further its criminal ends, as many cartels do. To qualify, the group “must possess organized armed forces” (2016 Commentary to GC I, art. 3), which the targeted groups such as Tren de Aragua do not appear to field.

In short, neither the intensity nor the organization requirement for a NIAC has been satisfied in this situation. Thus, there is no armed conflict and, derivatively, no applicable LOAC rule to violate. It is essential to note that this is an objective assessment of the facts. These facts cannot be ignored simply because the U.S. President proclaims otherwise – which, from the recent reporting on Department of Justice memoranda justifying these operations, appears to be the sole basis on which the otherwise inexplicable U.S. legal claims are based.

Applicable Law: International human rights law (extrajudicial killings)

This being the case, the applicable body of law directly governing these uses of lethal force is international human rights law (IHRL). It is here that the international law violation is found. Importantly, even if, contrary to our view, the jus ad bellum prohibition on the use of force in Article 2(4) of the Charter did apply, but the United States was exercising the right to self-defense, U.S. defensive actions would still need to comply with IHRL since, as explained, the situation does not amount to an armed conflict triggering LOAC.

It has long been recognized that the arbitrary deprivation of life violates a State’s international human rights obligations (see, e.g., UDHR, art. 3). The right is found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 6(1), an instrument to which the United States is a party. There has long been a debate over whether the ICCPR generally, or Article 6(1) specifically, applies extraterritorially, an issue present in the boat strikes. The United States claims that it does not, although the prevailing view, illustrated by the UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comment 36, is that it does (¶ 63). As noted in that Comment, the right extends to persons “located outside any territory effectively controlled by the State whose right to life is nonetheless affected by its military or other activities in a direct and reasonably foreseeable manner.”

But in any event, the right to life is a customary right that applies extraterritorially, regardless of the U.S. interpretation of the ICCPR – a point that the United States has previously accepted, as explained by Ryan. This is also acknowledged in the 2024 U.S. Army’s Operational Law Handbook, which characterizes the prohibition of murder as a fundamental right, and explains that “[i]n contrast to fundamental human rights, […] non-fundamental human rights do not necessarily bind States during all operations inside and outside a State’s territory.” The implication is that a fundamental right, such as the prohibition on the arbitrary deprivation of life, does apply during all operations and extraterritorially (pages 98-99).

Moreover, there is extensive State verbal practice and opinio juris characterizing extrajudicial killings, including those committed abroad, as violations of the right. And in its recent UNRWA advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that State obligations under IHRL (including customary IHRL, which the Court discusses twice in the opinion) apply when a State exercises jurisdiction extraterritorially, particularly in, but not limited to, situations of occupation (¶ 151; see more here). To put this simply, there is no doubt in our mind that, were the ICJ to be confronted with a situation similar to the U.S. strikes against suspected drug boats, the Court would rule that the right to life, i.e., the prohibition on the arbitrary taking of life, applies even if the State concerned kills people outside its own territory.

Therefore, the question is whether these killings were “arbitrary.” The widely-accepted standard for arbitrariness prohibits the use of force likely to cause death or grievous bodily injury “except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives” (Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; see also U.N. Human Rights Committee, General Comment 36, para 12).

As reflected in the standard, a deprivation of life must be strictly necessary to be justified, as a measure of last resort – if a State can mitigate the imminent threat that an individual poses to others by non-lethal means, then those means must be exhausted first. It is manifest that the U.S. strikes do not satisfy this requirement. While countering drugs is a legitimate aim for State action, the fact that there are numerous operational means that the United States regularly uses to stop maritime drug-trafficking renders simply blowing the boats up unnecessary as a matter of law.

In short, there is absolutely no question that the U.S. lethal strikes on the boats are a violation of international human rights law. The violation of the right to life is as equally manifest as it would be if the United States started using drone strikes against suspected drug traffickers on its own territory. Such individuals, serious criminals though they may be, need to be arrested and put on trial, not summarily killed. We thus agree with the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, who labelled the strikes as “extrajudicial killings” – this is precisely what they are.

This legal point is very straightforward. Indeed, as a Senator, Marco Rubio sponsored legislation calling out the Philippines’ then-President, Rodrigo Duterte, for summarily killing people involved in the drug trade. The legislation stated: “Extrajudicial killings perpetrated by the Government of the Philippines as part of a government-directed antidrug campaign present the foremost human rights challenge.” Notably, the International Criminal Court approved an arrest warrant for Duterte for the crime against humanity, because a policy of such killings can eventually amount to a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population.

Support to the Unlawful Strikes by Other Countries

This then brings us to the question of the possible complicity of third States in facilitating the U.S. strikes in the Caribbean. As with complicity doctrines in domestic law, there are various ways in which States accrue legal responsibility by contributing to the “internationally wrongful acts” of other States (for a primer, see this Chatham House paper by Harriet Moynihan). Two are relevant here.

First, a State may be complicit on the basis of the general rule set out by the International Law Commission in Article 16 of its Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that a State that assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful act will be responsible for its contribution if it is bound by the same legal obligation as the assisted State, and if it provides the assistance knowing of the attendant circumstances. The ICJ has held that this rule reflects customary international law. Second, a State may be complicit based on rules that are specific to the various sub-branches of international law, like IHRL, which may set somewhat different standards than the general secondary rule.

There is no doubt that intelligence sharing can constitute such a form of wrongful facilitation, for it can causally contribute to a sufficient degree to the commission of the wrongful act (for an extended discussion, see this paper and this blog post series by Marko). Consider, for instance, the sharing of geolocational data about a boat in the Caribbean with the United States, or other information about the people on board and their activities. It is self-evident that the United States could use this information to conduct a lethal strike against the boat in question. Accordingly, the criterion of a causal contribution, which is essential to all complicity rules, could be met in such a scenario, depending on the nature and content of the intelligence shared.

The requirement that the same legal obligation bind the assisting State as the assisted State is likewise satisfied. All States partnering with the United States in intelligence sharing are bound by customary IHRL prohibiting arbitrary deprivations of life. Most are also parties to treaties that prohibit arbitrary deprivation of life. For instance, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are party to the European Convention on Human Rights, and Colombia and Mexico are bound by the American Convention on Human Rights (arts. 2 and 4, respectively). The five, as well as Canada, are parties to the ICCPR. They are all bound by the customary international law prohibition on arbitrary deprivation of life.

But whether States sharing intelligence would be complicit in the unlawful U.S. attacks depends primarily on the fault (subjective, mental, culpability) element of the given complicity rule. There has been much discussion of this issue in the literature, which we will not examine here (see Marko’s article). We would only make two points.

To begin with, under Article 16, the fault element would be met if the assisting State shared intelligence with the United States, knowing that the latter intended to conduct unlawful strikes and that the intelligence would facilitate them, and nonetheless decided to proceed (a form of oblique or indirect intent). After the United States has conducted 20 such strikes and has openly announced it would conduct more, no State sharing intelligence with the United States could plausibly argue that it lacked the requisite degree of knowledge. This is especially the case for intelligence that directly relates to the activities of boats or drug cartels in the Caribbean.

Under complicity rules specific to IHRL, the requisite fault standard might be lower still – mere appreciations of a level of risk (rather than certainty) that the United States would engage in arbitrary killings using the intelligence provided. This would be a fault standard akin to recklessness, that is, one of conscious risk-taking. As explained in Marko’s piece, and although this possibility is unsettled in IHRL, a lower standard would arguably be justified by the importance of the interest being protected – the right to life.

In short, in our view, any State sharing intelligence with the United States about boats or drug trafficking in the Caribbean exposes itself to a high degree of legal risk. If the United States kills someone, and if the intelligence provided facilitates that killing, the State sharing the intelligence is itself violating international law. This is true even if the relatively high fault standard in Article 16 ASR is applied, let alone under IHRL. After 20 such strikes, no State could plead ignorance here.

As an aside, for present purposes, we do not assess whether the U.S. boat strikes could constitute international crimes, nor do we examine the potential liability of other State officials under a theory of aiding and abetting.

Conclusion

Obviously, we have no way of knowing whether the decisions to suspend intelligence sharing were made after government ministers sought and obtained formal legal advice to that effect. The step could also have been taken prudentially, as a matter of policy. And, of course, it is politically problematic for partners and allies to publicly castigate the United States for engaging in unlawful attacks.

However, whatever the motivation for maintaining or suspending intelligence sharing, the law is clear. The only way in which States can avoid their own responsibility for facilitating attacks that qualify as “arbitrary killings” under international human rights law is to refrain from sharing intelligence that, in part, enables them.

The gathering will take up the 21st-century erosion of democratic norms in the New World, whether driven by left-wing regimes like Venezuela's, right-wing dictatorships like El Salvador's — or even, as the symposium warns, the increasingly authoritarian Trump administration in the U.S.

“For many years we’ve seen rising authoritarianism both in our own country and throughout the hemisphere,"" Caroline Bettinger-López, founding director of the UM law school's Human Rights Clinic, told WLRN.

""We’re hoping to elevate that issue and help people see the ways the Organization of American States and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights are able to uphold human rights and the rule of law — especially Americans, for whom these institutions are not household names the way they are for other peoples in the hemisphere.”

The IACHR is an arm of the Organization of American States, or OAS, which is the western hemisphere's de facto U.N.

Bettinger-López said it’s important conferences like these take place in Miami, especially since it receives so many exiles fleeing human rights violations.

Border Patrol official behind Chicago immigration crackdown defends tactics as President Trump cheers

SOPHIA TAREEN

Associated Press

Published: November 17, 2025

ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) — The Border Patrol commander leading an immigration crackdown in Chicago applauded his agents' aggressive tactics that have prompted resident backlash and lawsuits.

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation's third-largest city.

""I didn't have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it's far worse than I ever thought,"" Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since "" Operation Midway Blitz "" began in September as part of the Trump administration's push to target cities with "" sanctuary"" immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who've spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an ""invasion"" of ""criminal illegal aliens,"" how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

""We're what I call now sanctuary busters,"" he said. ""There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.""

Doubling down on chemical agents

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He's regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is ""far less lethal"" than what agents face.

""We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,"" he said. ""If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.""

Immigration agents' tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Praising a raid that amplified tensions

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. Recently a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration's use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because ""you have to get the people out.""

""I think (the raids) haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,"" Trump said in a recent CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that's had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

""A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?"" he said. ""I'm proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.""

Bovino said he hasn't seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents' accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Blaming elected leaders and activists

Bovino's presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker ""wildly misinformed"" while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor's appearance.

In response, Pritzker's office said that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino's ""publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.""

Bovino wouldn't say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

""We're going to be in Chicago a good while,"" he said. ""But you just never know.""

What will Shabana Mahmood announce for the asylum system?
In her speech in the Commons at around 3.30pm, Ms Mahmood is to unveil radical measures modelled on Denmark’s system that will tackle illegal migration.
Ms Mahmood will say, under her reforms, that refugees will be removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe.
Following days of media reports, there is wide-spread consternation among charities that support asylum seekers coming to the UK.","It’s a tough message Shabana Mahmood will hope will reach the disgruntled voter, the criminal gangs smuggling people on small boats, and even the would-be migrants on the northern shoreline of Pas-de-Calais 100 miles from Westminster.

On Monday afternoon, the home secretary will reveal sweeping reforms to the asylum system in an unprecedented bid to make it easier to remove migrants fleeing conflict and hardship and make the UK a less attractive destination.

Over a troubled first 16 months in power for Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour government, illegal immigration has been a hot button topic, with claims ministers have failed to control the country’s borders.

In the year to June, the UK received the highest number of asylum applications since 2011, while the number of people arriving via small boat crossings hit almost 20,000 in the same period.

Now, after attempts by Sir Keir to stem the flow - the targeting of people-smuggling gangs and then the “one in, one out” deal with France - Ms Mahmood, appointed home secretary in September, will introduce her own sweeping reforms.

The plans are said to be inspired by Denmark’s approach to asylum seekers, where the government transformed its own approach following an influx of people throughout the 2010s. Now, the Scandinavian country has one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.

But Labour’s policy changes come amid an outcry from some backbenchers, and human rights groups, who fear they will be a catalyst to further division in UK communities, while bringing disruption and harm to those seeking sanctuary.

What will Shabana Mahmood announce for the asylum system?

In her speech in the Commons at around 3.30pm, Ms Mahmood is to unveil radical measures modelled on Denmark’s system that will tackle illegal migration.

Arguably, the biggest change will be making the refugee status temporary, and subject to regular review.

Under current UK law, people granted status have the status for five years and can then apply for indefinite leave to remain and get on a route to citizenship.

Ms Mahmood will say, under her reforms, that refugees will be removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe. Meanwhile, the wait for permanent settlement will be quadrupled to 20 years.

This is similar to Denmark, where asylum seekers get a temporary residency permit for one or two years, which is subject to regular review, and can be revoked once their home country is deemed safe.

The home secretary will also say ministers will want to bring forward a Bill to change how Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) – the right to a family life – is interpreted by judges in migrant court cases.

She is expected to say that this could stop migrants “gaming the system”.

Also, the government’s legal duty to provide asylum-seeker support will be revoked, meaning housing and weekly allowances will no longer be guaranteed. And those who have the right to work and can support themselves, could also be denied benefits.

Failed asylum seekers will be limited to make one appeal against their removal, instead of having the ability to make multiple challenges on different grounds.

It also looks like Ms Mahmood will introduce a “jewellery law” that will allow officials to confiscate refugees’ valuables, to help pay for cost of their accommodation and living.

Meanwhile, new and legal routes to the UK will be introduced as a way to cut dangerous journeys in small boats across the English Channel.

Summed up by borders minister Alex Norris on Monday morning’s Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “If your intention is to come to the country illegally to have a claim assessed, and if you are successful then sit at home, not contribute, not learn English, integrate into the community, not to build a life away from the dreadful circumstances that you may have come from, then that is going to come with much greater checks.”

Which three countries face the threat of UK visa restrictions?

In a show of determination to make her plan work, Ms Mahmood will also ban three African countries from accessing UK visas if they fail to take back illegal migrants.

Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, will face visa sanctions, blocking their tourists, VIPs and business people from travelling to Britain if they do not co-operate more on the removal of illegal migrants.

The move was reportedly inspired by Trump administration homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, according to the Times.

Ms Mahmood said: “My message to foreign governments today is clear: accept the return of your citizens or lose the privilege of entering our country.”

The Independent has contacted the London-based embassies for each of the three countries.

Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics shows that the nationalities do not appear in the top 20 for small boat arrivals in the year up to June this year.

What have Labour MPs said about the proposals?

While many backbench MPs have so far remained silent, perhaps understandably, ahead of Ms Mahmood’s announcement, a couple have voiced their concerns this morning, among them Kent MP and former immigration lawyer Tony Vaughan.

Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Vaughan said that he accepted public trust in the asylum system was ebbing away, but said the measures were “taking the wrong turn”, with a particular concern being the idea to “kick refugees out despite having granting them protection”.

He said: “If the system has decided that someone should be granted asylum we should be welcoming, integrating and not creating this situation of perpetual limbo and alienation which doesn’t help the refugees, it doesn’t help society.”

Labour MP John McDonnell wrote on X: “Tony Vaughan is one of the new MPs elected for Labour last year & in his contributions to Commons debates has displayed a considered approach to issues.

“He’s certainly not what the media would call a usual suspect. I suspect he is reflecting here what many in the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] feel.

Mr Norris has urged his colleagues to wait before passing judgment, saying he disagreed with Mr Vaughan’s “characterisation” of the policy.

What have migrant charities said about the proposals?

Following days of media reports, there is wide-spread consternation among charities that support asylum seekers coming to the UK.

Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights director, said: ""Constantly demonising and scapegoating refugees in a hopeless and cruel attempt to deter people seeking asylum in the UK is causing social division while wrecking the asylum system – all to no good whatsoever.

“Sadly, this home secretary seems as determined to continue in precisely the same vein as the previous government – possibly now subjecting people granted asylum to decades of insecurity that will undermine their prospects of recovery and integration.”

Fizza Qureshi, chief executive of Migrants' Rights Network, said: “The Home Secretary is taking unprecedented and appalling steps to blame people for daring to come to the UK to seek sanctuary. Instead of upholding their rights to claim refugee protection she is making them out to be a ‘problem’ that needs to be solved through harsher anti-refugee measures.”

Lara Parizotto, chief executive of Migrant Democracy Project, said: “Ms Mahmood's is cementing a dangerous narrative of ""good"" vs ""bad"" refugees, is bending over backwards to change immigration rules to actually make claiming asylum illegal, which is not at the moment, and is washing her hands of responsibility by stating that it's local residents' responsibility to host refugees.”","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/17/11/58/SEI273322345.jpeg?trim=0,25,0,25&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-17 09:57:03.393244

In what the government says is the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

The government also threatened visa bans on Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo unless those countries accepted the return of illegal migrants and criminals.

TOUGHER STANCE ON ASYLUM

Immigration has become the most important issue for voters in recent months, with those arriving in small boats from France the most visible sign of illegal arrivals. The issue has helped propel Reform UK, led by veteran anti-EU campaigner Nigel Farage, into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Zia Yusuf, a senior member of Reform, said the public were sick of being told there was no way to prevent people from arriving illegally on beaches, but said existing laws and likely opposition from Starmer’s lawmakers meant Mahmood’s proposed changes were unlikely to ever happen.

Tony Vaughan, a Labour lawmaker and senior lawyer, was one of the first to publicly criticize the proposals, adding the rhetoric would encourage “the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

In the year to the end of March, 109,343 people claimed asylum in Britain, up 17 percent on the previous 12 months. Still, fewer people claim asylum in Britain than in its EU peers France, Germany, Italy or Spain.

Most migrants arrive legally. Net migration reached a record high of 906,000 in the year to June 2023, before it fell to 431,000 in 2024, reflecting tighter rules.

’DARK FORCES’ AT PLAY

Mahmood said Britain had always been a tolerant and welcoming country to refugees but she warned that “dark forces” were stirring up anger, after protests took place this summer outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.

The interior minister said that risked threatening social cohesion and turning anger against those whose families had lived in Britain for decades, saying “a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me.”

Mahmood’s parents moved to Britain from Pakistan in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Under her proposals, the government wants to change the interpretation of Article 8 of the ECHR, governing the right to a family life. It would make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from “using dubious connections to stay in the UK.”

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the “definition of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ has expanded beyond what is reasonable,” making it too easy to challenge deportations.

It did not go as far as to say it wanted to leave the ECHR, as Reform and some in the Conservative Party have advocated.

However, the government’s harder stance on immigration has been criticized by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the rules would “punish people who’ve already lost everything,” adding this is “not who we are as a country.”",,N,,2025-11-17 13:58:03.312639

The city is home to Charlotte Immigration Court and a large ICE field office, she said.
The New Orleans mayor’s office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.","With dozens of people arrested in North Carolina’s largest city during the Department of Homeland Security’s latest targeted immigration blitz, one question has emerged for many of its residents and leaders: Why Charlotte?

The city hadn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago and Los Angeles. It’s a Democrat-led city, but it’s hundreds of miles away from either the northern or southern border. And crime has dropped 8% from last year, with violent crimes down 20%, according to data released by the city in October.

Before it even started, the announcement that an immigration enforcement operation would arrive in Charlotte – right off the heels of a weekslong operation that led to hundreds of arrests and fierce protests in Chicago – provoked fear and anxiety in the city.

Democratic leaders in Charlotte have largely framed the operation – which came as a surprise to local officials – as a political distraction ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

“This administration ran on rhetoric that is anti-immigrant to score political points,” said City Council member Dimple Ajmera, a Democrat. “We have a very important US Senate race in 2026 coming up. And they want to score political points and use fear to divide our community.”

Democrats are hoping to flip one of North Carolina’s Senate seats after Republican incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis pulled out of the race following criticism from the president who threatened to back a primary challenger to Tillis’ seat. Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is widely popular across the state, launched his campaign in July.

Similarly, state Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat, characterized the operation as a Republican political stunt. “The truth is, this move from the federal government, and the silence from GOP state leaders enabling it, are part of the same political distraction,” he said in a statement to CNN. “They’re trying to shift attention away from their own failures, because they have no plan to lower costs, make housing affordable, or expand real opportunity for working people.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement the surge would “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

The agency claimed “nearly 1,400 detainers across North Carolina have not been honored – releasing criminal illegal aliens into North Carolina’s neighborhoods.” Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” but it is a “Certified Welcoming City,” a designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.

Immigration into the city has increased in recent years. Around 18.2% of the city’s population was foreign-born in 2023, according to US Census data, around double that of North Carolina at large. And there have been disagreements in the city in the past about immigration enforcement. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden ended the county’s decadelong 287(g) partnership with ICE in 2018, to the chagrin of Republican officials.

The city became a lightning rod for debates about policing and public safety in Democrat-led cities in September, after a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee was stabbed to death on Charlotte public transit by a man with a lengthy history of arrests and mental health problems.

Though the suspect arrested in that case is a US citizen, President Donald Trump seized on the killing as an example of what he framed as out-of-control crime, and he pledged to send the National Guard to blue cities across the country. Three Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation, who represent districts around Charlotte, asked the governor earlier this month to deploy the Guard to fight crime.

Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who is from North Carolina, has his own answer. In an Instagram post with a photo of a man he claimed was an “illegal alien with a violent criminal history,” he wrote, “This is why border security matters. This is why we’re in Charlotte.”

Weekend of turmoil

Border Patrol agents arrested 81 people in Charlotte on Saturday, Bovino said Sunday, in an operation DHS dubbed “Charlotte’s Web.” He didn’t specify the reasons for the arrests or the names of those arrested but said many had “significant criminal and immigration history.”

Bovino – who was criticized by a federal judge over his and his agents’ use of force in Chicago – was spotted on video during the detainment of a person outside a grocery store in Pineville, around 10 miles south of Charlotte.

A man with a REAL ID who says he became a US citizen in 2019 was caught in the fray. Federal agents smashed the car window of Willy Wender Aceituno Medina, a Honduran immigrant who lives in Charlotte, and then detained him before letting him go a little while later. Medina said he pleaded with federal agents to look at his ID after the arrest.

In a statement to CNN, a Customs and Border Patrol agent said that officers had “approached an individual who acted increasingly erratic. The individual escalated the situation and refused to comply to lawful commands by officers.”

Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson, in a Saturday interview with CNN, said there’s “fear and anxiety rampant” across the city.

The Carolina Migrant Network, a legal advocacy nonprofit, said it had seen federal agents in “camouflage and tactical gear operating out of unmarked vehicles” – a sight that has become characteristic of DHS’ operations across the country.

“We have also witnessed an escalation in hostile actions, including the arrest of U.S. citizens, physical assaults on community members, and the disruption of places of worship, businesses, and restaurants where people have been questioned about their immigration status,” said the group in a statement.

DHS did not respond to questions about the nonprofit’s claims but sent CNN a statement including the photos and names of people it said were immigrants with criminal histories released in North Carolina.

Protesters decrying the operation filled a Charlotte park Saturday, then marched through the streets of uptown.

Businesses close as Border Patrol agents arrive

Several businesses closed temporarily in the wake of the announced operation, among them a popular Colombian bakery that had closed its doors only once in the past 28 years.

Manuel “Manolo” Betancur closed his family bakery Saturday after men in green uniforms chased and tackled people outside the shop, he told CNN. He said he isn’t sure when he will reopen.

The officers emerged from unmarked SUVs Saturday morning, “jumping and taking people down in the street, just people that look like me,” Betancur said. He is a naturalized US citizen and said he’s started carrying his passport with him everywhere he goes, “because I don’t want to go through the trouble. I promised my wife and my kids I’m going to be back home tonight.”

Betancur said he doesn’t want his customers to risk a similar encounter with federal agents – not when they’re just trying to buy cakes or pastries.

A company that manages several bars and restaurants in Charlotte said it closed its properties Saturday night after DHS’s announcement. Dubai Nightlife Charlotte cited the “safety, peace of mind and protection of those who visit us” in making the “preventative” decision, according to a Facebook post in Spanish.

The Colombian American Chamber of Commerce of the Carolinas also announced it was postponing an event scheduled for Saturday “due to recent action to bolster immigration operations in several cities across the country.”

Deployment surprised local officials

The announcement that Charlotte would be the next city targeted by federal immigration officials was unexpected – including for local government.

None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of the plan.

City Council member Malcolm Graham, who said he was unaware of the planned operation before CNN called him, said, “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”

It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans. McFadden said Thursday afternoon two federal officials contacted him about the arrival of Border Patrol agents but said details on the federal operation had not been shared with the sheriff’s office and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.

Even the operation’s name has attracted controversy: Martha White, the granddaughter of “Charlotte’s Web” author E.B. White and his literary executor, decried it as an attempt to ride the beloved children book’s “coattails without permission” in a statement to CNN. Her grandfather, she said, “certainly didn’t believe in masked men, in unmarked cars, raiding people’s homes and workplaces without IDs or summons.”

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein noted in a statement on social media that Border Patrol has detained many people without criminal histories in Chicago. He urged residents to use their phones to record “if you see something bad happening.”

“Local law enforcement will be here protecting the people of this state long after these federal agents go on to the next place,” he said.

Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, suggested Charlotte’s growing immigrant population as a possible reason the city is being targeted. The city is home to Charlotte Immigration Court and a large ICE field office, she said. The move could also be seen as “retaliation” for the sheriff’s decision to end collaboration with ICE, she said.

“I think there’s a level of, ‘let’s add another city to a roster, create some havoc, and move on’ as well,” she said.

Republicans welcome surge

Some of the state and city’s Republicans, meanwhile, have welcomed the surge.

“We’re grateful to see these brave men and women in federal law enforcement following through on President Trump’s promise to remove violent criminal illegals from our country and those stoking fear about these targeted operations must stop at once,” NCGOP Communications Director Matt Mercer said in a statement.

Kyle Kirby, the chair of Mecklenburg County’s GOP, told CNN he believed Charlotte was targeted because of its large immigration court and the sheriff’s refusal to work with ICE. “When local leaders release individuals flagged for federal pickup back into the community, it simply forces federal agencies to step in,” he said.

At least one Republican had more mixed feelings. Ed Driggs, who, after Democrats flipped a seat in this month’s election, will be the lone Republican on Charlotte’s City Council next year, said early in the week he was surprised to learn it was Border Patrol being sent to Charlotte.

“I’m conflicted. I have a hard line on identifying and deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes, but I’m not sure this is the way to do it,” said Driggs. “That’s the right thing to do, deport violent criminals. But they are running over local government and it’s causing concern from legal people, legal Americans and legal immigrants.”

Driggs said if there were more local coordination ahead of time – instead of finding out through “anonymous media sources” – the Border Patrol operation may not have been met with such initial fear and confusion from the city’s residents.

“The involvement of people who are elected locally gives residents, legal residents, comfort. Otherwise this could feel like an invasion.”

New Orleans is next, sources say

Bovino’s crackdown on immigration is expected to continue apace in other Democrat-led cities after Charlotte.

The next stop: New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.

The president has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans, a Democrat-led city in a Republican-led state, as far back as September. He said the city has a “crime problem.” But the National Guard plan hasn’t materialized, as efforts to deploy the National Guard in Chicago and Portland have largely been stymied by the courts.

Neither have the president’s ideas to send troops to Baltimore and New York.

The New Orleans mayor’s office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.

Speaking to Fox News on Thursday from West Virginia – before the Charlotte operation was officially announced – Bovino floated a few cities that Border Patrol could head to next.

During the campaign, Sherrill declined to say if she would retain the policy, called the Immigrant Trust Directive, if elected governor, while her Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli vowed to scrap it.

In the days since the election, Sherrill has deflected when asked about the future of the policy under her administration.

“I am focused on keeping people safe here,” Sherrill told reporters Nov. 5, the day after her election victory, when asked about the policy. “I’m committed to making sure people feel safe,” she said. “That is what I’m going to do as governor.”

Separately, Sherrill did not commit in an interview last week with NJ Spotlight News in Washington to sign the policy into state law if legislation to do so cleared the Assembly and Senate.

“I’d have to look at what comes across my desk but I am supportive of most of it,” she said Wednesday night off the House floor. “The directive itself I like, but there’s some clarification on the whole I’d like to see.”

Enshrining the policy into New Jersey state law is a priority of immigration advocacy groups, who are pushing state lawmakers to pass legislation to do so during the remaining days of the administration of Phil Murphy, the outgoing governor.

In particular, groups including the ACLU-NJ and the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, are pressing state lawmakers to pass the Immigrant Trust Act, which would expand protections for immigrants to prevent data sharing that could alert authorities to someone’s immigration status.

That legislation (S3672/A4987) has not advanced since it was introduced in 2024.

“I’m thinking a lot about immigrants’ rights right now,” Amol Sinha, executive director of ACLU-NJ, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News, adding that about 25% of residents in New Jersey were born outside of the U.S., the second-highest percentage of all states.

“It’s crucial that we select an attorney general who will preserve the Immigrant Trust Directive,” Sinha said, alluding to the governor’s authority to appoint a state attorney general.

While campaigning, Sherrill said she would not retain New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin.

The Trump administration has made anti-immigration policy a centerpiece of its first year in office, directing the arrest and deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many of whom have minor or no criminal records.

In New Jersey, the administration has arrested more than 3,000 people, placing it among the top 10 states with the most arrests.

Immigration policy has not been a significant point of focus for Sherrill, a former prosecutor and four-term House member, during her time in Congress.

She first won in a congressional race in 2018. In the years since, Sherrill, a military veteran, has served on the House Armed Services Committee.

In what was likely her final House speech, Sherrill said she would resign from Congress this week.

The House is scheduled to vote this week on legislation to discharge records related to the federal investigation of deceased sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein.

Sherrill said she would vote for that legislation “if I’m here for that.”

In a bulletin posted last month, the bureau detailed several cases in which offenders identified themselves as immigration agents while wearing shirts or jackets marked with the ICE logo.

The Oct. 17 bulletin, first reported by WIRED and obtained by the transparency group Property of the People via a public-records request, describes multiple cases of criminals posing as ICE agents.

According to the FBI, victims have reported being threatened, robbed, kidnapped and even sexually assaulted by individuals posing as federal officers. Some of the incidents occurred in New York, Florida and North Carolina, the bulletin said.

WASHINGTON STATE MAN INVESTIGATED FOR THREATENING ICE AGENTS ONLINE, VOWING TO 'MAKE LIFE HARDER' FOR OFFICERS

""Due to the recent increase in ICE enforcement actions across the country, criminal actors are using ICE’s enhanced public profile and media coverage to their advantage to target vulnerable communities,"" the FBI said.

Officials say these impersonation scams are making it harder for communities to distinguish legitimate law enforcement operations from criminal activity — endangering both civilians and real officers. The FBI is urging local police departments to review identification protocols and reminding the public that impersonating a federal officer is a serious crime with significant penalties.

Retired FBI Special Agent Jason Pack, who spent more than two decades with the bureau, told Fox News Digital that the criminals behind these schemes are deliberately exploiting fear and confusion.

DHS WARNS OF ‘UNPRECEDENTED VIOLENCE’ AS DEATH THREATS AGAINST ICE OFFICERS SOAR 8,000%

""Let’s be honest about these crooks,"" Pack said. ""They are slicker than a boiled onion and about as trustworthy as a snake oil salesman. They hide behind fake badges and phony authority, hoping folks will be too scared to ask questions.""

""That kind of behavior tears down public trust and puts real law enforcement officers in harm’s way,"" he continued. ""Anyone caught pretending to be an officer should be prosecuted and put so far under the jail they’ll need sunlight mailed in, and I mean that in the most lawful sense.""

Pack explained that real federal officers carry both a badge and photo credentials — and will always show them, especially in non-arrest situations.

""During my 21 years as an FBI agent, I always identified myself before any conversation began,"" he said. ""In tactical situations where an agent’s face may be covered for safety, that agent still carries identification and will present it once the scene is secure. Real officers will never ask for money, gift cards or favors. They will not get upset if you ask to verify who they are. They want you to feel safe and know you’re dealing with the real thing.""

Pack encouraged the public to stay calm and confirm an officer’s identity before cooperating.

""If you’re ever unsure, take a breath and double-check,"" he said. ""Ask to see both a badge and a photo credential. Read the name and agency on the card. In most cases, there will also be a marked patrol car and a uniformed officer with the agents.""

Pack said those concerned can also look up the local field office number for that agency and call to confirm.

""There are a lot of federal agents deployed throughout the country, so checking which field office they’re assigned to helps verify who they are,"" Pack said.

He added that citizens should never go anywhere alone with someone whose identity they haven’t verified — and should never hand over money or personal information.

""Trust your instincts and call 911 or your local police if something feels off,"" Pack said. ""Real agents and officers will not be upset that you asked, they want everyone to be safe.""

Pack said impersonation crimes don’t just endanger victims — they undermine confidence in legitimate law enforcement.

""Public trust is what keeps the bond strong between citizens and the people sworn to protect them,"" he said. ""Every real officer I’ve ever known takes that responsibility to heart.""

Interior minister Shabana Mahmood will outline changes to how the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should be interpreted by courts to give the government greater control over who can remain in Britain, and who must leave.

“These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said in a statement.

In what the government says is the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

The government also threatened visa bans on Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo unless those countries accepted the return of illegal migrants and criminals.

TOUGHER STANCE ON ASYLUM

Immigration has become the most important issue for voters in recent months, with those arriving in small boats from France the most visible sign of illegal arrivals. The issue has helped propel Reform UK, led by veteran anti-EU campaigner Nigel Farage, into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Zia Yusuf, a senior member of Reform, said the public were sick of being told there was no way to prevent people from arriving illegally on beaches, but said existing laws and likely opposition from Starmer’s lawmakers meant Mahmood’s proposed changes were unlikely to ever happen.

Tony Vaughan, a Labour lawmaker and senior lawyer, was one of the first to publicly criticize the proposals, adding the rhetoric would encourage “the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

In the year to the end of March, 109,343 people claimed asylum in Britain, up 17 percent on the previous 12 months. Still, fewer people claim asylum in Britain than in its EU peers France, Germany, Italy or Spain.

Most migrants arrive legally. Net migration reached a record high of 906,000 in the year to June 2023, before it fell to 431,000 in 2024, reflecting tighter rules.

’DARK FORCES’ AT PLAY

Mahmood said Britain had always been a tolerant and welcoming country to refugees but she warned that “dark forces” were stirring up anger, after protests took place this summer outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.

The interior minister said that risked threatening social cohesion and turning anger against those whose families had lived in Britain for decades, saying “a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me.”

Mahmood’s parents moved to Britain from Pakistan in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Under her proposals, the government wants to change the interpretation of Article 8 of the ECHR, governing the right to a family life. It would make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from “using dubious connections to stay in the UK.”

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the “definition of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ has expanded beyond what is reasonable,” making it too easy to challenge deportations.

It did not go as far as to say it wanted to leave the ECHR, as Reform and some in the Conservative Party have advocated.

However, the government’s harder stance on immigration has been criticized by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the rules would “punish people who’ve already lost everything,” adding this is “not who we are as a country.”",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/11/17/4659034-1855157338.jpg?itok=sg4wo2KV,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:29.750535

Share

The Supreme Court made a fair amount of news last week, but I wanted to use today’s post to reflect upon a story that got swallowed up in the SNAP-related developments—comments made by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche at the Federalist Society’s National Lawyers Convention on Friday, November 7. Specifically, Blanche attributed the Trump administration’s myriad losses in the lower federal courts to “rogue activist judges,” claiming that these “liberals” are “more political or certainly as political as the most liberal governor or D.A.” As Blanche continued (with my emphasis), “There’s a group of judges that are repeat players, and that’s obviously not by happenstance, that’s intentional, and it’s a war, man.” (There’s video here.) Exhorting young lawyers and law students in the audience to come work for the Department of Justice, Blanche continued, “We need you, because it is a war, and it’s something we will not win unless we keep on fighting. It’s hard to get the media, it’s hard to get the American people to focus on what a travesty it is when you have an individual judge be able to stop an entire operation or an entire administrative policy that’s constitutional and allowed just because he or she chooses to do so. So, it’s a war.”

These remarks, of course, did not come entirely off the cuff (you don’t refer to something as a “war” three times by accident), nor did they take place in isolation. The Attorney General herself has filed a (frivolous) misconduct complaint against Chief Judge Boasberg on the D.C. district court; Stephen Miller keeps decrying each adverse ruling against the Trump administration as just part of a broader “judicial insurrection”; and, although the hearing has been postponed for now, the Senate Judiciary Committee had been set to convene tomorrow to hold a hearing on incredibly dubious claims of misconduct by two district judges (never mind that the impeachment power belongs to the House of Representatives).

It’s certainly not a coincidence that we’re seeing all of these spurious attacks on lower courts at the exact same time as they have continued to be the single most effective—and important—check on the lawless behavior of the current administration. But that’s exactly why these attacks are so worrisome. It’s not just that they are remarkably light on substance (and indifferent to the data of where these adverse rulings are coming from, about which more below); it’s not just that they are shamelessly hypocritical given both the behavior of right-wing lawyers during the Biden administration and the attacks directed against those who were themselves critical of that behavior; it’s that, unlike anything that happened between 2021 and 2025, here it’s the number-one and number-two officials in the Department of Justice publicly leading the charge.

Not only is this rhetoric and conduct unbecoming of anyone in the employ of the Department of Justice, let alone its top two officials, but it will surely lead to an increase in both (1) the very real threats that these lower-court judges are already facing; and (2) eroding public faith, at least among those who take Bondi and Blanche seriously, in the lower federal courts. It would be one thing if there were any substance to their charges, but there isn’t. And yet, you’d be hard-pressed to find any conservative groups, right-of-center law professors, or other right-wing commentators publicly criticizing these remarks or the broader attacks on lower federal courts emanating from this administration. I don’t say this lightly, but that is to their profound (and growing) discredit.

More on all of that below. But first, the news.

On the Docket

The Merits Docket

In addition to sitting for the second week of the November oral argument calendar, the Court in last Monday’s regular Order List added one more case to the docket for the upcoming term—agreeing to review a puzzling and controversial Fifth Circuit ruling that had held that federal law, by fixing Election Day as the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, bars states from accepting mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day even if they are postmarked on or before it. My own view is that this is—and should be—a “grant to reverse the Fifth Circuit” case, but either way, one can imagine justices from across the ideological spectrum wanting to at least settle that question well in advance of next year’s midterms.

The Emergency Docket

As has become the norm since this summer, most of the news the Court made last week came with respect to emergency applications.

First, with regard to SNAP, we had Tuesday’s extension (over Justice Jackson’s dissent) of Justice Jackson’s administrative stay—which I wrote about in some detail in Thursday’s bonus issue. As I predicted then, the Solicitor General withdrew the government’s application for emergency relief later on Thursday—after President Trump signed into law the bill reopening the government, which includes full funding for the Department of Agriculture for the rest of the fiscal year. Thus ends, at least for now, the SNAP-related litigation.

Second, the full Court also denied stays of execution to two death-row prisoners. The first came Wednesday when the justices, over no public dissents, cleared the way for Florida to kill Bryan Jennings. The second came Thursday in the case of Oklahoma death-row inmate Tremane Wood, this time over a public dissent from Justice Jackson (and with Justice Gorsuch not participating—presumably because he was involved in one of Wood’s appeals while serving on the Tenth Circuit).

Third, the Court on Thursday also denied emergency relief in the long-pending international child custody dispute, Castro v. Brito Guevara, over public dissents from Justices Sotomayor and Jackson. Given that Justice Alito had entered an administrative stay, and given how long the application was pending (it was filed on October 1; Alito entered his stay on October 2), I’m a bit surprised that no one wrote anything to explain their views. But … there’s a lot going on.

Finally, on Friday, Justice Sotomayor, acting by herself, vacated an administrative stay she had entered in a long-running suit by more than 9,000 Filipino victims of human rights abuses by former President Ferdinand Marcos. The applicants had obtained a $2 billion judgment against Marcos’s estate, which they are currently seeking to execute at least in part against $40 million of funds held in a New York bank account. Sotomayor’s order stressed that no stay pending appeal was needed because of the U.S. government’s “representation that it will not transfer the funds outside of the United States before the disposition of any petition for a writ of certiorari.” Sometimes, a party may seek emergency relief simply to extract such a concession from the government.

Ten years ago, this amount of emergency docket behavior would’ve been a story unto itself. In 2025, it’s just another week at the Court.

The Week Ahead

Turning to this week, we expect a regular Order List out of last Friday’s Conference at 9:30 ET. The Court is also scheduled to take the bench this Friday at 10:00 ET for a “non-argument session.” This has been on the calendar for some time, and is in no way a prediction that any decisions in argued cases are expected. Indeed, especially given all of the emergency docket activity, this strikes me as too early for any merits rulings. But a short, unanimous ruling from an October argument wouldn’t be beyond the realm of possibility; either way, we should get some indication of whether anything other than bar admissions is expected later in the week.

As for the emergency docket, we could see quite a lot of action this week—or not. The reply briefs in response to the Court’s supplemental briefing order in the Illinois National Guard case are due today, so we could see a ruling there later this week. Likewise, another pending emergency application from the Trump administration (the “is the Library of Congress an executive branch agency” case) has been ripe for a ruling since last Wednesday.

There’s also a new application from the Chamber of Commerce, represented by former Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia, asking the Court to issue its own injunction pending appeal of new California state-law requirements that, as of January 1, 2026, most companies doing business in the state make a series of public disclosures relating to climate change. Although the Chamber challenged those laws on First Amendment grounds, the district court denied preliminary injunctive relief, and the Ninth Circuit, although it has expedited the Chamber’s appeal, has yet to act on its request for an injunction pending appeal. I assume Justice Kagan (as Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit) will, as soon as today, order California to respond—although I suspect we won’t hear from the full Court until after Thanksgiving.

Miscellaneous

Finally, the Court last week issued the oral argument calendar for the January 2026 argument session—which includes the two cases about discrimination against transgender athletes (on January 13); and the emergency application in the Lisa Cook case on January 21. The session includes only seven arguments across 10 slots—which means, among other things, that the later-in-term argument sessions are likely to be … crowded.

The One First “Long Read”: “It’s a War, Man”

Even before Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s comments at the Federalist Society Convention on November 7, I had already been planning to devote an issue to the growing assault on lower-court judges from both the Trump administration and congressional Republicans. But Blanche’s incendiary remarks added both a sense of urgency and a specific claim against which it seemed worth pushing back—for at least three independent reasons:

First, it is just not true, by any remotely objective measure, that the rulings adverse to the Trump administration are coming from a small subset of “liberal” district court judges in a handful of district courts. Second, data aside, neither Blanche nor any of the other critics have offered any substantiation of their charge—e.g., by identifying some recurring error that district courts are generally making in these cases even after the Supreme Court has specifically held otherwise. And third, to whatever extent these charges might be legitimate if they had any quantitative or qualitative support (and they don’t), they are especially dangerous to both the safety of these judges and public faith in the judiciary at a time in which the lower federal courts have been the institution that has arguably done the most to serve its intended constitutional function. Of course, that may be the point of these attacks—but that’s all the more reason for folks from across the political spectrum who claim to take our legal institutions seriously to denounce them.

I. The Data

Let’s start with the easy part. Although you might see slightly different numbers elsewhere (there are some small variances in methodology), my own regularly updated data, compiled by two of my research assistants—Alyssa Negvesky and Grace Kiple—and me, identifies 204 distinct cases as of last Friday in which federal district courts have ruled one way or the other on requests for preliminary coercive relief against the Trump administration. In 154 of them, district judges granted either a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, or both. And those 154 rulings came from 121 different district judges appointed by seven different presidents (including President Trump) in 29 different district courts across 10 circuits. Indeed, 41 of those 154 cases with rulings adverse to the Trump administration were presided over by (30) Republican-appointed judges, fully half of whom (15) were appointed by President Trump. (This all assumes, of course, that the party of the President who appointed the judge is an accurate proxy for the judge’s ideological leanings. There are lots of reasons to dispute that framing, especially with respect to district court judges given the persistence of blue slips. But at least as generalizations, the data still has value, IMHO.)

Not surprisingly, the grant/deny rate varies a bit between Democratic appointees and Republican appointees; it’s 82% for the former (113/138) and 62% for the latter (41/66). But it’s still the case that more than a quarter of the cases in which there have been rulings adverse to the Trump administration have been presided over by 30 different Republican-appointed district judges; and that those judges are ruling against the Trump administration at a meaningfully higher clip than they are ruling for it.

Let me just say this one more time: It’s not just that rulings adverse to the Trump administration have come from 121 different district judges spread across the country in 29 district courts and 10 circuits; it’s that 41 of those cases have been presided over by 30 judges appointed by Presidents Reagan, George W. Bush, and Trump. All by itself, that total (41) would be an unprecedented number of rulings adverse to the federal government during the first ten months of any other presidency. If we just looked at those rulings, and no others, it would still be a remarkable story.

And although a visible subset of the total body of lower-court rulings have been “stayed” by appeals courts (including the Supreme Court), there are three points to make about the appeals: First, they’re still a significant minority of the total dataset. Counting the 22 distinct cases with stays from the Supreme Court and another ~20-25 from the courts of appeals, that’s still well more than 100 district court rulings that, at least as of today, remain in effect. Second, and speaking of the courts of appeals, it sure seems like any claims about “rogue activist judges” needs to account for the cases in which those courts are denying emergency relief—in which it’s not just district courts ruling against the Trump administration. One might also flag the handful of cases in which district courts had denied temporary relief but courts of appeals granted it (one especially visible example is the “is the Library of Congress an executive branch agency” case noted above). And third, although I’ve made this point before, it still seems kind of important to this narrative that, in the majority of these cases, the Trump administration either (1) has not appealed the adverse district court ruling at all; or (2) is appealing it without seeking emergency relief. In other words, it’s not just the data that overwhelmingly belies Blanche’s claims; it’s the Justice Department’s own behavior.

II. The Substance

Presumably, if one actually believed that these “rogue activist judges” were abusing their authority, one would have specific examples of analytical moves the judges keep making in these cases that are not just “wrong,” but that are indefensible. After all, in any large dataset of federal litigation, one can always find at least some rulings by district courts that are stayed pending (and reversed on) appeal. The question is not whether it’s possible to point to one or a handful of these 154 cases and find error; it’s whether there’s some broader pattern of behavior that is both (1) not surviving appeal; and (2) being followed by district courts even after the appeals courts or the Supreme Court have explained why that analysis is wrong.

Here, the biggest problem for those criticizing the lower courts is … the Supreme Court. Whatever else may be said about the Court’s refusal to provide full-throated explanations in most of its orders granting emergency relief to the Trump administration, one can hardly find in those cryptic missives any attempt to rein in particular analytical moves being made by lower courts. Indeed, the closest example—Justice Gorsuch’s separate opinion in the NIH case about which challenges to grant cancellations had to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims instead of ordinary district courts—is striking only in how unpersuasive it is; five justices disagreed with where Gorsuch thought the line was in NIH itself. Ditto district courts that at least initially enforced statutes protecting agency heads from being removed without cause; despite the tea leaves from the Supreme Court about overruling Humphrey’s Executor, Justice Kavanaugh himself has emphasized that district courts lack the power to overrule it first. It’s hardly “rogue activism” on the part of federal district judges to … enforce a squarely-on-point precedent from the Supreme Court when one of the key justices reiterates that they have no discretion to not do so.

Again, the story might be different if district courts in these cases were regularly finding, e.g., that plaintiffs have standing to challenge federal policies only to repeatedly be reversed by the Supreme Court (looking at you, district courts in the Fifth Circuit), or if they were regularly exercising jurisdiction in cases in which it is clearly foreclosed. But there is no evidence of any patterns along those lines—and, if there were, it would be easy enough for the Supreme Court to identify them.

The issue isn’t just that these patterns don’t actually exist; it’s that those criticizing the lower courts aren’t even bothering to identify what they think the patterns of allegedly bad behavior are. That’s critical because, as I’ve suggested in the past, I think there is a big difference between a specific, substantive criticism of either individual lower courts or patterns in lower-court decisionmaking and these kinds of handwaving complaints about “rogue activist judges” in contexts in which the only relevant criterion appears to be handing down rulings with which you disagree. The former is an essential part of a healthy discourse about the role of the judiciary in our constitutional system; the latter is not just lazy—it is affirmatively dangerous.

III. The Effects

In response to Blanche, the “Article III Coalition”—a group of 50 retired federal judges appointed by presidents of both parties—put out a remarkable statement, emphasizing that:

In the past year, federal judges have been the target of an unprecedented number of threats based on rulings that have been the subject of harsh criticism by senior public officials. The United States Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies have determined that many of these threats have posed a credible danger to the judges, their loved ones, and their court staff.

It shouldn’t be controversial to suggest that these kinds of attacks from Blanche and other senior Republicans will only increase the incidence of those kinds of threats—especially as they are, and continue to be, amplified on social media. That is, and ought to be, reason enough to repudiate them.

Nor should it be controversial to explain why these attacks fundamentally misapprehend both the role of the lower federal courts and the proper means for objecting to their rulings. As former Fourth Circuit Judge Allyson Duncan (a George W. Bush appointee) put it in a press release accompanying the Article III Coalition’s statement, “Our founders did not design a system of government built on warfare between branches. They built a system of deliberate tension—where courts, Congress, and the executive branch check each other. Calling judges ‘rogue’ because they apply the law in a politically unfavorable way is a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the judiciary in our constitutional structure.”

One might also point out the latent hypocrisy in these attacks. After all, it was at the exact same conference one year ago that Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones launched into an extended (and very personal) attack against me in response to my public criticisms of “judge shopping” in Texas district courts—in which plaintiffs, especially the State of Texas, kept steering nationwide lawsuits to single-judge divisions where they were guaranteed to be assigned to a specific federal judge. Among other things, Jones accused me of directly provoking death threats against Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk (based upon public comments criticizing litigants for repeatedly filing nationwide lawsuits in Amarillo). Even if one thinks the two types of criticisms are remotely identical (and there are a number of reasons why I think they very much aren’t), it’s striking that a single law professor’s comments warranted such a public response then, but these concerted attacks on a much larger number of district judges by senior executive branch officials have been met with … crickets … from the same cohort.

As I wrote then, the point is not that criticism of federal judges (or their critics) is illegitimate or per se harmful; it’s that there’s a critical distinction between criticisms that are founded in evidence and substantive arguments, on the one hand (which, in my view, are not only appropriate but vitally important), and those that are based upon handwaving and innuendo. If anyone would like to go through the rulings adverse to the Trump administration and explain how their analyses (as opposed to their results) reflect judges behaving badly, let’s have it. For now, it suffices to note that any such claim will depend upon much more than pointing to how many of these cases have been filed in Boston or San Francisco; or how often specific courts or judges have ruled one way versus the other. It depends upon identifying the legal points that these judges keep getting wrong—and explaining why no reasonable judge could make the same error.

I’m still not convinced that it would be appropriate for senior Justice Department officials to suggest that they are at “war” with the courts even in those circumstances—especially at the same time as the executive branch is engaged in what appears to be patently unlawful real warlike activity elsewhere. But until and unless the case is made that the courts are doing anything to warrant such a bellicose response, such overheated and incendiary rhetoric reflects little more than an effort to undermine the one institution that the current administration has not been able to steamroll, and for no other reason than because federal judges of every stripe keep enforcing statutory or constitutional constraints against the Trump administration.

In that regard, my exasperation stems not only from these attacks themselves, but from the continuing silence of so many groups, organizations, commentators, and academics to my right—who have, at plenty of other times, claimed to be invested in defending and/or protecting “judicial independence.” If you speak out in defense of judicial independence only to protect judges (or justices) who rule the way you want them to, then I respectfully submit that your definition of judicial independence is bollocks.

SCOTUS Trivia:

Congress Nudges Justice Moody to Retire

115 years ago this Thursday, Justice William Henry Moody retired from the Court—less than four years after his appointment by President Theodore Roosevelt. Shortly after his appointment, Moody had been stricken by severe rheumatism, and sat on the bench for the last time on May 7, 1909. But because of Moody’s age and brief service, he was not yet eligible for the judicial pensions for which Congress had first provided in 1869 (which required the recipient to have reached both 70 years of age and 10 years of federal judicial service).

Borrowing from an 1882 precedent (when Congress had passed a similar statute to nudge Justice Ward Hunt to retire), President Taft lobbied Congress to enact a similar measure for Justice Moody’s benefit. That statute was adopted in May 1910—and offered to extend the 1869 benefits to Moody if, but only if, he retired within five months. Three days before that period expired, on November 20, 1910, Moody stepped down.

For more on the Hunt/Moody statutes, the broader historical politics of the justices’ pensions, and how Congress in 1937, for better or worse, mooted the need for comparable one-off statutes, see this older post.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The U.S. Navy announced yesterday that the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean with its accompanying warships and attack planes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday that he would designate a Venezuelan group, Cartel de Los Soles, as a foreign terrorist organization, adding that the group is “headed” by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Also on Sunday, Trump told reporters, “We may be having some discussions with Maduro, we’ll see.” When Trump was asked if he would be interested in negotiations, Trump said “I’ll talk to anybody. I’ll talk to you.” He did not provide further details on potential talks. Yan Zhuang reports for the New York Times.

The U.S. military on Saturday killed another three people accused by the Trump administration of smuggling drugs by sea, the U.S. Southern Command said yesterday on social media. The post said that the strike had been carried out by a joint task force called Southern Spear at the direction of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Anushka Patil reports for the New York Times.

Trump’s aides are considering giving Maduro safe passage to another country if they succeed in ousting him, according to a U.S. official and two other sources. Others are suggesting placing Maduro under arrest and putting him on trial in the United States, a third source told POLITICO. Officials are also debating which sanctions to lift on Venezuela and when to do so once Maduro has left power, considering the role of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in rebuilding Venezuela’s economy. When asked about the extent of preparation, a U.S. official said, “We have the concepts of a plan.” Nahal Toosi reports.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

The U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday mandated a U.N. fact-finding mission working in Sudan to identify those responsible for the atrocities that occurred when the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary took over El Fasher. The decision was part of a resolution that condemned the widespread, ethnically motivated killings, rape, and torture during the conflict. “Much of El Fasher is now a crime scene,” Mona Rishmaw, a member of the U.N. mission in Sudan, told the council, adding that the mission is also investigating similar tactics in Kordofan, “where civilians are encircled, aid is blocked, and starvation is beginning to emerge.” Nick Cummings-Bruce reports for the New York Times.

UNHCR said on Friday that tens of thousands of people who fled El Fasher are unaccounted for. The U.N. has recorded that nearly 100,000 people fled the city since the RSF took over at the end of October, but only around 10,000 have been counted at arrival hubs such as Tawilia, UNHCR’s Head of Sub Office from Port Sudan said. “A significant number of people on the move [are] stranded somewhere, not able to move further.” Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The U.N. Security Council is set to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution on Gaza today, which now states that after reforms in Gaza the conditions “may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday pledged to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state. Hamas said yesterday that the U.S. proposal is biased towards Israel and deprives Palestinians of the right to manage their own affairs by imposing an international mandate on Gaza. Netanyahu said the proposal calls for Gaza to be demilitarised and noted that “either this will happen the easy way, or it will happen the hard way.” Melanie Lidman reports for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

China yesterday sent coast guard ships to patrol near islands claimed by both Beijing and Tokyo, escalating the current diplomatic feud with Japan. On Friday, the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo warned its citizens against travelling to Japan because of serious safety risks. China did not provide any evidence of such risks. Yan Zhuang reports for the New York Times.

“There is no undeclared nuclear enrichment in Iran. All of our facilities are under the safeguards and monitoring” of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told AP News yesterday, adding “there is no enrichment… because our facilities… have been attacked.” Araghchi said that Iran’s message on its nuclear program remains clear: “Iran’s right for enrichment, for peaceful use of nuclear technology, is undeniable.” Jon Gambrell reports.

A wall built by the Israeli military crosses the Blue Line, the de facto border separating Lebanon from Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, according to a survey conducted by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon last month. A spokesperson for the U.N. Secretary General said that the wall erected by the IDF has made more than 4,000 square metres of Lebanese territory inaccessible to the local population. UNIFIL informed the Israeli military of its findings and requested that the wall be removed. The Israeli military denied that the wall crossed the Blue Line. Lebanon will file a complaint to the U.N. Security Council against Israel for constructing the wall, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said on Saturday. Jasper Ward reports for Reuters; Laila Bassam reports for Reuters.

The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal today sentenced ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on charges of crimes against humanity for her crackdown on a student uprising last year that killed hundreds of people. The Tribunal also sentenced her former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan to death for his involvement. Hasina said today, “We lost control of the situation, but to characterize what happened as a premeditated assault on citizens is simply to misread the facts.” Julhas Alam reports for AP News.

South Africa is investigating a charter flight that unexpectedly landed in Johannesburg last Thursday with more than 150 Palestinians from Gaza. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said, “These are people from Gaza who somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi and came here.” After NGO intervention, most passengers were allowed entry, amid concerns that the secret operation was part of a broader Israeli effort to push Palestinians out of Gaza. Gerald Imray, Alfonso Nqunjana, and Julia Frankel report for AP News.

Colombian human rights ombudswoman Iris Marin said on Saturday that seven children were killed in an airstrike by the Colombian military against the FARC-EMC rebel group last week. Marin said the minors had been forcibly recruited by FARC-EMC and were being used as “human shields,” adding that “the armed forces must adopt precautions to protect children who have been forced to take part in hostilities.” Manuel Rueda reports for AP News.

The Islamic State-backed Allied Democratic Forces on Friday killed at least 17 people in an attack on a hospital in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, authorities said on Saturday. Justin Kabumba reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Alibaba provides tech support for Chinese military operations against targets in the United States, according to a White House national security memo seen by the Financial Times. The memo says that Alibaba shared customer data with the Chinese government and PLA, which includes IP addresses, WIFI information and payment records. The memo did not specify what the PLA is alleged to be targeting in the United States. Alibaba rejected the claims, adding that the intelligence being relied upon is “complete nonsense” and “this is plainly an attempt to manipulate public opinion and malign Alibaba.” Demetri Sevastopulo reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

“We told the Trump administration that the supply of F-35s to Saudi Arabia needs to be subject to Saudi normalization with Israel,” an Israeli official said. Trump told reporters on Friday that he plans to discuss the possibility of normalization with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, adding “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly.” Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

A panel of Brazil’s Supreme Court judges voted on Friday to accept charges of coercion against Eduardo Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro moved to the United States earlier this year and claimed credit for pushing the White House to raise tariffs on Brazilian goods to 50% in retaliation for the criminal case against his father. Reuters reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Homeland Security Department has diverted thousands of federal agents from their core missions like child exploitation investigations, counterterrorism, and human trafficking to focus on immigration enforcement, a New York Times investigation found. The investigation shows, for example, that Homeland Security investigators worked approximately 33% fewer hours on child exploitation cases from February to April compared to prior years, despite claims from officials that overall law enforcement and national security remain effective. The investigation is based on previously undisclosed DHS documents – including statistical reports about workloads, search warrants and arrests – and interviews with more than 65 officials. Nicholas Nehamas, Michael H. Keller, Alexandra Berzon, Hamed Aleaziz, and Zolan Kanno-Youngs report.

Border Patrol agents deployed across Charlotte, N.C., arrested 81 people on Saturday, Senior Border Patrol official Grego Bovino said on social media, adding that the mission was a “success.” An immigrant rights group said it was the largest number of immigrant arrests in the state’s recent history. Eduardo Medina and Sonia A. Rao report for the New York Times.

At least four people died and four others were taken to hospital after a boat capsized off the coast of Imperial Beach near San Diego on Friday night, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard said it was unclear where the boat came from, but said some of the survivors said they were Mexican nationals. Mark Walker reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Former Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler resigned in August amid scrutiny of her financial holdings, which appeared to violate the central bank’s ethics rules, according to a document released by the Office of Government Ethics on Saturday. The document shows that either Kugler or her husband bought and sold multiple individual stocks in 2024, a category of asset that senior Fed officials are not allowed to purchase. Victoria Guida reports for POLITICO.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and acting U.S. attorney Lindsay Halligan submitted written statements on Friday pushing back against a federal judge’s suggestion that records of grand jury proceedings in former FBI Director James Comey’s case were missing. Halligan said that the gap of more than two hours in the transcript “consisted solely of the grand jury’s private deliberations,” adding “there are no missing minutes, contrary to the suggestions raised by the court.” Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

DOMESTIC DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. MILITARY

The Pentagon is withdrawing hundreds of out-of-state National Guard troops from Chicago and Portland, Ore., according to two U.S. officials. The Guard troops arrived in these cities in early October but were never deployed onto the streets as a result of ongoing legal challenges. The Pentagon has not formally announced the withdrawal but the Northern Command indicated on Friday that changes to the federalized troop mission in those cities were imminent. Eric Schmitt reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump yesterday urged House Republicans to vote in support of a measure that would compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. Trump said on social media that Republicans should back the measure “because we have nothing to hide.” Ashley Ahn reports for the New York Times.

Trump on Friday directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI to investigate links between Jeffrey Epstein and notable democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, and former Harvard President Larry Summers, as well as the bank JPMorgan. “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his ‘Island,’ Trump wrote on social media. Bondi appointed Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to run the probe. Gregory Svirnovskiy and Erica Orden report for POLITICO.

Trump also on Friday pardoned Dan Wilson, a Jan 6. 2021 defendant, for the second time. Trump already erased Wilson’s felony conviction for his role in the Capitol riot, but he has now issued a “full and unconditional” pardon for Wilson’s other federal crimes, which include Wilson’s firearms case in which he pleaded guilty to two felony gun offences. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

Trump withdrew Donald Korb’s nomination to be chief counsel for the Internal Revenue Service at the end of last week. While Trump did not provide an explanation for the withdrawal, right-wing political activist Laura Loomer reposted Trump’s announcement on social media with the hashtag “LOOMERED.” Loomer had criticised Korb on Wednesday for praising Democrats and donating to them. Danny Nguyen reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge on Friday issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from coercing the University of California by threatening to cut its research funding in violation of the First Amendment. The judge also said that the government was forbidden from seeking payments from the university system in connection with civil rights investigations. Alan Blinder reports for the New York Times.

Then we analyzed those policy positions through a lens of the Constitution and civil rights and civil liberties, and talked about the way we would defend against those attacks.
Romero: The one I would add is that we bucket the current challenges to civil liberties into three large categories.
I think with birthright citizenship, which is now pending before the Supreme Court, almost assuredly we win, even with this court.
But our priority today is to stay focused on executing our mission to defend civil rights and civil liberties in this moment, no matter what may come.","Eight years ago, early in Donald Trump’s first term as president, I worked with Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on a story about the organization’s Strategic Affiliate Initiative, the ACLU’s multiyear program to bolster a select group of its state affiliates to advance civil liberties and defend voter rights against a multitude of threats in post-9/11 America. The initiative, launched in 2002, enabled the ACLU to respond quickly to the crackdowns on immigrants Trump executed in the first 24 hours after being sworn into office.

Trump is now back in the White House for a second term, with far greater executive power than he enjoyed in his first stint. Unopposed by Congress, enabled by a loyalist Cabinet, and buoyed by a Supreme Court that declared him immune to criminal prosecution for his actions, he has deployed National Guard troops to major US cities, along with a vastly expanded Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to further his plans for mass deportation. He has unilaterally gutted federal agencies without congressional approval and threatened legal action against foundations and nonprofits whose activities, though perfectly legal, he perceives as extreme. He has attempted to exert control over universities by freezing billions of dollars in research grants appropriated by Congress and threatening other penalties. He envisions, according to a September 30, 2025, speech he gave to a mass gathering of top officers of the armed forces at Quantico, Virginia, deploying active-duty military to “Democrat-run cities” as training grounds to fight a war against “the enemy within.”

That day, I had scheduled a time to speak to Romero to get an update on the ACLU’s response to Trump’s authoritarian gambit. He was joined by two senior leaders, A.J. Hikes and Aletheia Henry. The following transcript has been edited.—David V. Johnson

* * *

Johnson: Let me start by going back to 2017, the early days of President Trump’s first term. Anthony cowrote a cover story for us, titled “A Revamped ACLU Takes on Today’s Fights,” that addressed “the unconstitutional agenda that President Trump was initiating to undo many of the civil liberties gains of the past quarter century, from immigrants’ rights to reproductive freedom to LGBT rights.”

Around that time, Trump issued an executive order that banned the immigration of citizens from seven different Muslim countries. I remember how people flocked to airports at the time to protest.

Those days now seem quaint in comparison. We have masked agents arresting people off the streets without giving them access to a lawyer or to contacts, without giving them due process, and deporting them to third-party countries.

Where are we today, and how did we get here?

Anthony Romero: This is the most challenging time for civil liberties and civil rights in my tenure as the ACLU’s national executive director. In a conversation I was having with Aryeh Neier, who was my predecessor and the head of the ACLU during Vietnam and Watergate, he said that this is the most challenging time for civil liberties and civil rights that he has ever seen for the organization since its founding. What hang in the balance are nothing less than the basic rights and liberties that define how people live in free democracy and the functioning system of checks and balances that have come to define the United States as a nation committed to fairness and justice and rule of law.

Clearly, the ability for the Trump administration to enact an agenda that is so hostile to civil liberties and civil rights entails the assistance of Congress. This is not just the agenda of a president run amok; it’s really a much broader challenge to the functioning of our system of government than just one person getting elected.

A.J. Hikes: As a 105-year-old organization, we were not created for Trump, but we are built for this moment, and we certainly know how to play the long game. When you think back to that 2017 article and that time during Trump 1.0, we filed more than 400 legal actions against the administration, including against the Muslim ban that you mentioned, family separation policies, his proposed change to the US Census. We have really hit the ground running during this time: We have over 180 legal actions that we have filed so far this term, so we are certainly on track to surpass that 400 number from the first term.

Johnson: With so many different challenges, how do you figure out what to prioritize?

Hikes: We knew that the administration’s strategy would be to flood the zone, and certainly they’ve done that. They’ve been throwing nearly everything they can at the wall in an attempt to overwhelm the public. Very early on, Anthony encouraged us to exercise extraordinary discipline in our responses. So we had to think about the idea that we are not going to swing at every pitch that’s coming at us. What is in our strike zone as the ACLU? And so we think about urgency—the urgency of this moment, the urgency of this issue. Can we act quickly? We think about impact. We think about how we engage our audiences around this. Can we drive action on a set of issues?

And we think primarily about our lane. What is in our scope of expertise? And where are our partners? Is this core to civil liberties? That’s where you see us front and center on birthright citizenship and freedom of speech—the bread and butter of the ACLU. And then we also think about where our partners are leading. So, where do we lead and drive, and where do we support?

Johnson: How did you prepare for this moment?

Aletheia Henry: During this election, we took both candidates at their word. And just before the Republican convention and just before the Democratic convention, we publicly released Trump and Harris memos. We deeply read all of Project 2025, we looked at all of the promises that Trump was making on the campaign trail, and we took him at his word. Then we analyzed those policy positions through a lens of the Constitution and civil rights and civil liberties, and talked about the way we would defend against those attacks.

Once we were clear on the election outcome, we took those public-facing memos and turned them into 100-day action plans, and it allowed us to get a temperature check from the experts across the organization about which executive actions they believed would come first, and we leaned into that. We began lining up clients and preparing briefing materials and ensuring that we were ready to go, and we certainly were. We filed our first case in 90 minutes, on the first day that Trump was signing executive orders. That was the birthright citizenship case—that’s still ongoing.

My colleagues were fairly prescient. I don’t think that anyone could have quite predicted the speed or ferocity with which this administration has moved, but we took them at their word.

We’re in the process of going back to each of those issue teams and spelling out a longer-term, two-to-three-year strategy so that we can stay one step ahead continuously. In the immigration space, the Trump administration has done a lot of the things that were on our 100-day checklist that we predicted, and we want to make sure that we’re preparing for exactly what’s next.

Johnson: What issues would you say are priorities for you, other than birthright citizenship, which you mentioned?

Henry: I would say immigration across the board. It’s not just the birthright citizenship case. It’s the raids and deportation response, the Alien Enemies Act, all the violations of due process in the Fourth Amendment that we’re seeing over and over again in those cases.

There’s a cross-section there with freedom of speech, which has obviously come to the forefront, and we’ve been in the lead on a lot of those attacks on freedom of speech for individuals who are here on visas or some other [immigration] status within the country. But we see the President branching out in his attacks on freedom of speech, so that is at the forefront. And voting rights continue to be at the forefront of our thinking, almost always.

Romero: The one I would add is that we bucket the current challenges to civil liberties into three large categories. Those are the key priorities or the challenges we’re confronting in this political moment.

In the first bucket, we identify the attacks on individuals and institutions who are ideologically opposed to the Trump agenda. These are the attacks on universities, on law firms, on activists like Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, who are our clients. It’s like a modern-day McCarthy—if you don’t agree with the government, you’re in the government’s crosshairs, and it’s playing out in real time, whether it’s in the attacks on [former FBI Director] Jim Comey or the investigations of the Open Society Foundations. And that’s a place of enormous concern and energy for us as an organization that is fundamentally dedicated to the rights of individuals to speak their minds and associate freely. When the government attacks individuals who disagree with it, that raises it to the highest level of priority for us.

The second bucket has to do with the attacks on vulnerable individuals and communities as a way to score cheap political points with the MAGA base. And here, you can look at the attacks on immigrants, the deportations, the raids. You can also look at the attacks on transgender communities. It’s another way to rile up and throw red meat to the Trump supporter base.

In the third bucket would be the attacks on the rules, the norms, and the system of checks and balances that undergird our democracy. And here again, it’s the attacks on a free and open media, the lawsuits against the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, the squeezing of ABC News because of Jimmy Kimmel through the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] licensing process, or the attacks that some members of the Trump administration will levy against judges who rule against them. It’s about the attacks on the structures that are a bulwark against government overreach and government abuse.

Those are the three big areas of work, and within it, we do work on immigrants, we work on voting—voting is one of the systems of our government that you have to defend, especially if they try to subvert the outcome of the election during the midterms.

When it’s other topics, like the firing of federal government employees, the shrinking of the federal workforce, and others that are not civil liberties issues, per se, other organizations carry the ball. Groups like Democracy Forward, Democracy Defenders Fund, Public Citizen, and others have done an amazing job leading on many of the challenges to our country that are not core civil liberties or civil rights issues. So, it’s really important that we have discipline to focus on the issues that are in our lane and allow other groups to lead on issues that are outside our remit.

Johnson: You mentioned Congress and its lack of action in defending civil liberties, but there are also the courts, and you’ve mentioned the many lawsuits that you’ve filed. And it seems the dynamic we’re seeing is that lower courts rule in your favor and maybe issue an injunction against certain conduct by the federal government. And then, in many cases, the Supreme Court has on appeal, via shadow docket, removed the injunction and overruled judges at the district level. What do you make of the role of the judiciary and the Supreme Court in this, and the dynamic you’re seeing right now in many of these cases?

Romero: I think we need to parse it more carefully than just characterize the role of the courts with broad sweeps.

Most cases never get up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decides only 60 to 80 cases in a year, so if there are hundreds of cases filed in a particular year, there’s only a small number of them that will end up before the Supreme Court and on review. And so that’s why we think it’s essential to continue to use the federal courts. There are over 1,100 judges who handle over 300,000 cases in the district courts. Over 300 judges handle 50,000 cases in the courts of appeal. And nine Supreme Court justices handle fewer than 100 cases each year. There are 400-plus cases filed against the Trump administration, so the bulk of these cases will be decided at the district court level, the courts of appeals, and that’s it.

All you have to do with the Supreme Court is count to five. And I actually think in the birthright citizenship case, you might get to seven.

I think it’s also important to parse out how the court has decided some of the matters on the shadow docket. To be clear, there have been great disappointments. The Supreme Court’s decision in our case coming from the ACLU affiliate in Los Angeles on racial profiling, where we had obtained a stay at the lower court level, was lifted by the Supreme Court, with unfortunate language from Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh. But we live to fight another day. We will be able to develop the record, look at the facts, and ultimately, when the case ends up back in front of either the court of appeals or the Supreme Court on the merits, we’re hopeful that with a more fulsome record we’ll be able to strike down the government’s targeting of individuals based on what it perceives to be the characteristics of an undocumented person.

I don’t write off the Supreme Court on most of the major issues just yet. I think with birthright citizenship, which is now pending before the Supreme Court, almost assuredly we win, even with this court. All you have to do with the Supreme Court is count to five. So we’ve got three. Can you get two more? And I actually think in the birthright citizenship case, you might get to seven.

On the Alien Enemies Act litigation, we’ve had to file multiple cases in different jurisdictions, also based on a decision from the Supreme Court requiring us to file in different jurisdictions and making sure that you couldn’t bring just one case. The fact that we won in the Fifth Circuit, a very conservative jurisdiction, makes me feel that when we ultimately get before the Supreme Court on the merits of the Alien Enemies Act case—whether this 1798 statute is properly invoked in this alleged war against the drug cartels and against gangs—ultimately we will succeed at convincing the Supreme Court on the merits.

We’ve been also tracking our own batting average on the shadow docket thus far. Aletheia, do you want to talk through how our report card stacks up?

Henry: What’s important to know is that in 80 percent of the cases where we’ve requested emergency relief, we’ve received it. And of the cases that we have directly brought to the Supreme Court in the past year, 80 percent of them have been decided either in our favor or with a mixed ruling. Rulings aren’t always a clean win-loss, but we’re doing pretty well.

We’re also adapting really quickly. When the Supreme Court issued its ruling striking down nationwide injunctions, we were ready to file a class-action lawsuit. That means that to this day, not one US-born child has been denied their citizenship under Trump’s executive order.

We walked into this understanding that litigation was going to be one tool for the ACLU in this fight. We will see you in court, for sure. But we’re also going to see you in the state house, we’re going to see you in Congress, we’re going to see you in the streets, because it’s going to take all of those mechanisms to defeat this administration and what it’s attempting.

Johnson: In terms of strategy, one thing that I’ve read is your initiative Firewall for Freedom. Can you tell me more about that and how it’s going so far?

Hikes: What’s exciting about Firewall for Freedom is that it’s proactive. Our affiliates are really on the front lines of this. Our goal with Firewall for Freedom is to let local and state government officials know that they can say no to Trump’s extremist policies.

The planning and preparation for Firewall for Freedom started well over a year ago. Over the summer, we worked with our state affiliates to develop a strategy playbook for disrupting this radical agenda that we knew was going to be coming in the second term. The playbook outlines tools across our issues, such as immigration, reproductive rights, free speech, so that these municipalities can uphold rights in their cities.

Here’s where we are now: The campaign is in 43 states. In those states, you see some legislative, some executive, and some advocacy campaigns. We have 15 state legislatures who have already passed 30 different laws protecting our rights. We have 24 pieces of guidance that have been issued by a dozen state officials that tell state agencies how they can safeguard our information, our data, our families. We have three governors who’ve already issued executive orders, and five municipalities who’ve taken action.

Just last week, Delaware Gov. [Matt] Meyer signed HS 119 and SB80 into law—two powerful laws protecting our rights to learn and to dissent. In August, we had Gov. [Maura] Healey in Massachusetts acting to protect and enshrine gender-affirming care and abortion rights into state law. And earlier this year, Washington Gov. [Bob] Ferguson signed a bill that restricted out-of-state armed forces from entering Washington. We have been seeing this escalation of federal troops on the ground in American cities, and we know that’s a cornerstone to Trump’s abuse of power agenda. This law makes it clear that almost any mobilization of the National Guard into the state requires the governor’s permission, and it also has to align with Washington’s core values to protect immigrant communities.

So, those are just a few examples of the ways that Firewall for Freedom is proactively protecting our local communities. It’s been powerful, and we’ve been very lucky to have many state and city officials be our partners in this work.

Romero: The theory of change behind Firewall for Freedom is to use our federalist system as a way to deploy both a sword and a shield against the Trump administration’s policies on civil liberties and civil rights. If you can convince governors, attorneys general, mayors, and city councils to enact policies that stand in the way of government overreach, then that provides some meaningful protection against the worst abuses.

Johnson: You mentioned Trump’s threats to crack down on foundations like the Open Society Foundations (OSF), on universities, and law firms. At SSIR, we represent the social sector and the people who work at such organizations. What do you make of how the organizations, philanthropies, nonprofits, and universities are responding?

Hikes: We should start by saying that the attack on OSF is baseless and a challenge to the values that make this country great. And Anthony mentioned this modern-day McCarthy moment that we’re in. That is exactly what this feels like, turning the whole weight of the DOJ [Department of Justice] against organizations that are speaking out against this administration’s un-American agenda.

We have to remind folks that the President can’t rewrite the Constitution via a memo. And I think we’ve seen real strength in numbers.

Just last week, we saw a presidential memorandum authorizing the government to investigate nonprofits, activists, and donors; and using this overbroad label of terrorism and conspiracy against rights; and targeting individuals, institutions, and communities to score political points, disrupting checks and balances, and consolidating power. It’s all a part of a larger strategy and agenda, and it’s shameful and dangerous.

We have to remind folks that the President can’t rewrite the Constitution via a memo. And I think we’ve seen real strength in numbers. We see coalitions in the philanthropic sector coming together. We see the same thing with our nonprofit communities. We see it as well with corporations and law firms coming together, standing up, and saying that we will not stand for this. We know that this administration is sending up test balloons to see what will actually fly. It’s really imperative in this moment that we are coming together and building those kind of coalitions to push back and draw the line.

On a personal point, when it comes to the ACLU, we are well aware that we may be targeted by this administration. We’ve been preparing for that moment. And we have plans internally and externally. But our priority today is to stay focused on executing our mission to defend civil rights and civil liberties in this moment, no matter what may come.

Romero: There is a sense of real solidarity in the nonprofit sector. Unlike what you saw with some of the nation’s largest law firms just capitulating to Trump’s extortionist policies, or the universities, some of which settled claims against them, the nonprofit sector has been much more unified in its response, and I think we’ve learned from the mistakes of the universities and the law firms that didn’t stick together. There’s been a real effort to make sure that nonprofits across areas and across the political spectrum stay together as one. [Former Associate Attorney General] Vanita Gupta has organized a NATO for nonprofits, and the sector has really come together.

We recently organized a conference call with Public Citizen and Democracy Defenders Fund for nonprofits in the wake of the executive orders that were signed by the President allowing them to investigate domestic terrorist groups. We had 7,000 nonprofits show up on that call. I am proud of the way in which the nonprofit sector has understood that we are in this together. There are lines of communication that I have not seen in 24 years as CEO of a major nonprofit. I have never seen this level of alignment of sharing of information, of referring donors, of dividing work, of providing support and assistance and advice, and that’s because the nonprofit sector realizes what we’re up against is going to require a much more coordinated response. Collective solidarity is key to our individual success.

Johnson: I am also curious about public sentiment. Back in 2017, after Trump was first elected, the ACLU netted a huge windfall of donations from a public worried about civil liberties. Do you feel like the public is again energized? What are you seeing from your supporters and from people at large?

Romero: In 2017, I think there was a response from the public that was largely driven by surprise and shock. Folks rushed to the airports on the Muslim ban weekend. We saw these large spikes of contributions to our website around the Muslim ban and family separation. With Trump’s reelection, we don’t see those crescendo points like we did the first time around. We see a more steady increase of concern, building off where we were at the end of the Biden administration.

I also think some people are turned off by politics in this moment, and tired of the acrimony and divisiveness. Some people just want to put their heads in the sand. Some folks are feeling that it’s not a surprise that Donald Trump is president. Trump represents larger portions of public sentiment. And at the same time, there are many more people who are trying to figure out how to make a difference in this time. You may not see the large women’s marches that you saw in 2017, but there’s much more activism happening at the state and local levels. There are people who are taking action, going to local rallies, signing up to be monthly contributors, because they understand that there’s not one flashpoint and there’s not one silver bullet. They realize that you have to stay on this like water on stone. There’s real, growing activism that we ought not to overlook or downplay.

Henry: What we have seen is people being willing to give more of their time to this effort. So, we’ve had tens of thousands of people attend our Know Your Rights trainings. We have hundreds of thousands of active volunteers. These aren’t people sitting on an email list; they’re the folks working beside us to pass those Firewall measures that AJ was talking about. They’re hosting education events in their communities so that folks understand the impact. They’re engaging with their members at town halls and other events locally. And I think that that’s really important.

Erica Chenoweth and the Crowd Counting Consortium at Harvard University have measured an increase in crowds showing up to demonstrate in comparison to the last Trump administration. It just doesn’t look like the Women’s March. There are more events across more places, and so it’s more of this local activism. The No Kings rallies back in June are a great example of this: Five million people rallied at over 2,000 events across the country. And so that’s 100,000 people in Philadelphia, and 200,000 in New York, and 500,000 in Boston, but it’s also 400 people in Pentwater, Michigan, where the population size is 800. So you get half the town showing up to condemn President Trump’s escalating abuses of power.

We’re taking to the streets again on October 18 with our partners across the country in a similar show of condemnation of this president’s ongoing abuses.

Romero: Sometimes people ask me, “Are we in a constitutional crisis? Is everything lost?” And my answer is, we are in a constitutional crisis if we accept it, and we’re not in a constitutional crisis if we resist it. We need to give people a sense of agency, turn them into protagonists, rather than spectators. That’s critical for groups like ours, and that’s why we work really hard to find meaningful ways for folks to make a difference. If you tell them, “Call your member of Congress” or, “Write a letter to your member of Congress,” people’s eyes immediately roll. They don’t think that Congress is terribly functional or relevant at the moment. But if you tell them, “Let’s stiffen the spine of your local attorney general or your governor, let’s make sure that we eliminate the programs that allow local officials to work with federal immigration enforcement, let’s get the city council to enact laws that protect immigrants and that make the local prisons and jails off-limits to federal immigration enforcement,” then you give them something meaningful to do that they feel is worth their time, energy, and sweat equity.

This momentum is building as people increasingly realize just how far the Trump administration is pushing its agenda. On the issue of immigration, the public opinion was much more with President Trump at the beginning of his first year than it is now. He promised to deport the criminals, the drug dealers, the cartels. Now they see that he’s deporting good folk, people who are the members of our local communities, not the criminal aliens that he promised. And I think that’s creating a backlash to some of the very policies that they are beginning to scale up. Public response and engagement will scale up in response.

Having a strong, local infrastructure among our state affiliates is critical to fighting off the worst of the abuses of the Trump administration.

Johnson: You mentioned your affiliate network—the ACLU has affiliates in all 50 states, in Puerto Rico, and in DC. The cover story you cowrote, Anthony, back in 2017, talked about the ACLU’s Strategic Affiliate Initiative (SAI), where you devoted financial support to select states in an overall strategy to protect civil liberties. Could you update us on the initiative?

Romero: Thank God we launched the Strategic Affiliate Initiative. To do organizational development, you have to do it over the long term. When we first launched our initiative, we realized—and we realize even more so now—that the locus of activity for the battle for civil liberties and civil rights plays out in local communities. The deportations happen in local communities. The abridgment of freedom of speech happens in local communities. The deployment of the National Guard or federal forces happens in cities like Portland [Ore.]; Chicago; Washington, DC; Los Angeles; Memphis [Tenn.]. And so having strong, local infrastructure among our state affiliates is critical to fighting off the worst of the abuses of the Trump administration, because that’s where the rubber’s hitting the road.

Over the past several years, we have consciously focused on growing our Southern affiliates. That is the most recent iteration of our Strategic Affiliate Initiative. Increasingly, you see these issues play out in Texas—for instance, the redistricting battle to try to redraw the maps of Texas’ congressional districts to put their thumb on the scale in the midterm elections. It’s critically important that we be strong in a place like Texas. In Florida, we’re holding off the worst of the abuses. The head of our Florida office, Bacardi Jackson, says that the nation’s going in the same direction that Florida’s been heading in for years. And so it’s really important for us to be able to fight off some of those challenges in Florida. Alligator Alcatraz, for instance: Our legal challenge to the creation of that prison camp for immigrants has met with success. If we didn’t have the boots on the ground to be able to challenge that in real time, we’d be struggling to do it from afar in New York City or Washington. The Strategic Affiliate Initiative was exactly the right investment so that we could not just enact policy reforms like Firewall for Freedom but also fend off the worst of the civil liberties violations in really difficult states, like Florida or Texas or Alabama.

What was it that you told me the other day, Aletheia, about the Census on the South?

Henry: I read reporting recently that the 2030 Census is going to demonstrate a population shift to the South. States like New York and California are losing population relative to the South, and we will be redistricting accordingly, so it’s good that we have these strong, sustainable affiliate organizations built there for the future fights.

I think it’s really interesting that the Southern Collective, the third iteration of our SAI, was born from the affiliates themselves. In 2019, these 12 affiliates came together and lifted up the challenges that they were having and asked for national investment. What started as a $15 million investment in the Southern Collective has now become a $51 million, five-year investment in the South. And because voting rights is a generational struggle in the South, a lot of our work has focused on voting rights. We were able to partner with our Alabama affiliate on our Allen v. Milligan case that made it up to the Supreme Court—a redistricting case under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

Across the South now, we have these data dashboards that have demographic voting and turnout patterns for our southern states. In Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia, we’re monitoring voter-roll purges so that we can see when they’re trying to force people off the rolls and get them back on quickly. And in Florida, we’ve built on those demographic dashboards to track inclement weather that may affect polling locations, to track social media reports of violent groups that may be attempting to target those locations, so we can do that rapid-response voter-protection work when the time comes.

Romero: In order to be ready for a moment like the one we’re in, it takes years of planning and preparation, of anticipating where you think the challenges will go. We have 2,200 staff nationwide at the ACLU, and 1,600-plus of them are in the state offices. That reflects a conscious decision that the only way you can be effective is to be proximate to the problems. And so you have local lawyers, local activists, local organizers, people who are embedded in these communities, helping solve the problems that manifest in their communities.

Johnson: One last question about the midterms next year: How worried are you about free and fair elections in our country? And what do you have planned for the midterms?

Henry: I don’t think we ever stop thinking about how to protect the people’s voice, and certainly, given Trump’s voting executive order, this midcycle redistricting, his targeting of mail-in voting, and other efforts of the Trump administration, we’re monitoring and responding to all of that. We’ve had success in blocking many of these attempts in the past. We have a playbook, and we have been involved in election protection in many states for years now, and I mentioned a lot of our work in the South. Our first call with our affiliates on having a plan to safeguard the election is tomorrow [October 1, 2025]. So we are preparing for the fights ahead. We certainly will be involved in the 2025 cycle, even though it’s a lighter election year, just to make sure that voting is as free and fair as possible, but we are ramping up all those efforts for 2026 and 2028. And it’s not just us: We have a whole network of groups that we work very closely with.

Romero: And our work to secure the right to vote and to defend the franchise is not animated by a desire to help one party or one candidate get elected. We are agnostic about the outcomes. Our sole goal is to ensure that people cast an informed vote. We will inform them about the records and the history and the backgrounds of candidates. But we never tell people who to vote for. We want voters to be informed, and if they wish to cast a vote, our job is to make sure it is meaningfully counted.

In one of the voting rights challenges we had during the first Trump administration, they were trying to shut down drive-through polling booths in Harris County, Texas. Our lead plaintiff was a Republican. Shutting down drive-through voting affects Democrats as much as Republicans, and our goal was to make sure that voters were able to cast their votes. It’s the same thing with mail-in ballots. A lot of elderly people vote by mail. And they vote Republican, and they vote Democrat, and it doesn’t matter which party they vote for—they should just be able to cast their vote. That is the animating principle for us: making sure that government officials don’t cynically try to shave off certain types of voters who they don’t believe vote for their party or their candidates. We believe that the voters should pick our elected officials, not that the elected officials should pick the voters.",https://ssir.org/images/articles/winter-2026-feature-aclu-737x737.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:57:11.111251
,Policy,2025-11-17 13:02:22+00:00,Canon City Daily Record,"Affordability, immigration crackdown are concerns to Colorado Latinos - Canon City Daily Record",Seth Klamann,,,,,https://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/2025/11/17/colorado-latinos-poll-immigration-crackdown-trump-affordability/,"The issues identified more broadly in the Colorado Latino Agenda poll, which was released earlier this month, reflect a growing national consensus among all voters, not just Latinos.
Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda.
It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens).
There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said.
Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration.","Many members of Colorado’s Latino community fear they could be arrested by federal immigration authorities and have changed their daily lives to avoid it, a recent poll found — even as Latinos remain predominantly focused on economic concerns ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

“In every aspect of life, Latinos have attenuated their normal behavior and avoided critical locations, like work and school, in order to stay clear of the immigration (enforcement) surge,” pollster Gary Segura told reporters upon releasing the results.

The issues identified more broadly in the Colorado Latino Agenda poll, which was released earlier this month, reflect a growing national consensus among all voters, not just Latinos. The overwhelming concern with affordability — respondents’ top four issues all related to the cost of living and the economy — shows that economic fears have endured through President Donald Trump’s first nine months in office, with recent elections across the country notching wins for Democrats who focused on the issue.

But the results also revealed mounting fear about an erosion of civil rights and discontent with the Republican president’s efforts to rapidly arrest and deport millions of immigrants without proper legal status.

Forty percent of the registered voters who participated in the survey said they or their communities feared that immigration authorities would arrest them, even if they’re U.S. citizens or have some kind of legal status. And 30% said they or their communities feared interacting with or calling the police, while 28% said they or their communities feared attending regular immigration proceedings because they could be arrested.

Asked whether civil rights had improved under Trump, 62% said they hadn’t, compared to 20% who said they had.

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda. Immigrants have repeatedly been arrested while attending regular immigration hearings, as advocates have said and court filings reviewed by The Denver Post have indicated.

ProPublica, a nonprofit news outlet, reported last month that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration authorities nationwide this year. Immigrants with legal status and work permits, like a Douglas County teacher arrested last month, have also been caught up in raids and arrests.

“The actions of the Trump administration are fundamentally changing the way that Latino citizens are interacting with their government,” said Phil Chen, a political science professor at the University of Denver who reviewed the poll. “A quarter of them say that they or their community are missing classes because parents are worried about being arrested driving to school. I read (those results) as deeply, deeply troubling.”

About 23% of Colorado residents are of Hispanic or Latino origin, according to the State Demography Office.

The poll was conducted by a bipartisan polling team last month. It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens). Its margin of error was plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

Concerns with Trump, Republicans

Latino Coloradans, who have tended to vote Democratic but not monolithically, also expressed mounting concerns with the Trump administration and Republicans who control Congress. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they were concerned that Congress wasn’t acting as a check on Trump. Asked who was to blame for the recent government shutdown, 61% said the president and his party, compared to 23% who blamed Democrats. Two-thirds disapproved of Trump’s performance in office.

There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said. More than a third of respondents said they’d voted for Trump in 2024.

The vast majority of that group — 80% — said they would vote for him again. But 13% said they wouldn’t, and the remaining 7% said they were unsure. Of those who supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, 91% said they would vote for her again, and the remaining share said they weren’t sure.

“When there’s a party that holds all of the levers of power in the federal government, (voters) are going to blame that party for things they think are not going well and probably give them credit for things that are going well,” Chen said. “This is the pattern we expect to find in every off-year and midterm election.

“So if you were (U.S. Rep.) Gabe Evans or the state Republican Party, I think it’s really important to start thinking about how you talk about issues around affordability — around housing costs, food costs, inflation, job opportunities, things like that.”

Evans, a Republican, represents the 8th Congressional District stretching from the northern Denver suburbs to Greeley, and it’s one of the most contested congressional seats in the country. Much of his successful 2024 campaign focused on immigration and public safety.

‘Latinos are looking for leadership’

Still, criticism of Trump doesn’t necessarily mean Latino voters are running straight into the arms of the Democratic Party, said Alex Sánchez, the president and CEO of Voces Unidas, which is part of the coalition that released the poll.

Fifty-two percent of self-identified independents surveyed in the poll said they either didn’t know which party they’d support next year or that they wanted to support someone else. (A plurality of independents, 35%, said they would support Democrats, compared to 12% for Republicans.)

“There are warning signs to both parties in the data,” Sánchez said in an interview. “While, yes, Colorado Democrats fare better … they’re not too far from the danger zone. That’s what we see in the data: a clear sign that Latinos are looking for leadership, are looking for results.”

He added about Latinos: “We are not brand loyal. We don’t carry the party loyalty the same way that other voters do. Latinas and Latinos historically vote based on value and vote based on results, instead of party sticker and party label.”

Despite the unpopularity of the Trump administration’s mass-deportation efforts, affordability concerns were still far and away the top concerns for voters. Forty-eight percent of respondents said the cost of living and inflation were their top priority.

Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration. More than half of respondents said it was most important for election officials to tackle either prices and affordability, or wages and good jobs.

That’s unsurprising, Chen said. Affordability was a dominant issue in elections elsewhere in the U.S. earlier this month, he said, and has remained a top issue for all Colorado voters for years.

With next year’s midterms approaching, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had begun floating new affordability ideas in recent weeks as it faces the reality that Americans are still pessimistic about the economy as they struggle with higher prices.

“You can think of (the immigration crackdown) as a problem.

The UK Home Secretary has announced a series of sweeping measures, including:

Temporary rather than permanent refugee status, ending automatic settlement for those granted protection.

Tighter family reunion rules, raising age, income, and integration requirements.

Changes to human rights law, limiting the use of Article 8 and reviewing application of Article 3

Stronger and faster removal powers for failed asylum seekers.

Responding to the proposals, Sabir Zazai, CEO of Scottish Refugee Council said:

“We can have a firm, fair asylum system without abandoning our humanity. It is entirely reasonable that if someone’s asylum claim is refused after full consideration, they return home. But the way we speak about people seeking sanctuary matters just as much as the policies we design.”

Dr Zazai warned that political rhetoric has become increasingly dehumanising — and that adopting the tone of the far right is both morally wrong and socially dangerous.

“People fleeing war, persecution and trauma are not a burden. They are not a threat. They are human beings. Yet too often, the way we talk about them strips away their dignity. When politicians use language that echoes the far right, they don’t defeat extremism — they legitimise it.”

“Imagine arriving here with nothing, being placed in cold, overcrowded accommodation, and surviving on just a few pounds a week. Then imagine being told your right to remain may be denied simply because your family doesn’t meet new thresholds.

“We can protect our borders without undermining our humanity. We can enforce rules without embracing rhetoric that divides. The UK must show that firmness and compassion can go hand in hand — and that the dignity of every person remains at the heart of our asylum system.”

“People in Scotland want an asylum system that is controlled, that they have confidence in, and that shows compassion. The Home Secretary’s planned announcement does none of these things.

Government plots human rights overhaul to speed up deportations

Caitlin Doherty

Monday 17 November 2025 04:34 EST

Labour plans to overhaul human rights laws to facilitate the deportation of foreign criminals and small boat migrants, aiming to strengthen border security.

The government intends to change how UK judges interpret the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 8 (right to family life) and Article 3 (prohibition of torture), to prevent asylum seekers from using these rights to avoid deportation.

Proposed measures include tightening family connection rules for Article 8, updating modern slavery laws, restricting illegal migrants to a single appeal route, and potentially making refugee status temporary.

Visa sanctions will be imposed on Angola, Namibia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo if they do not cooperate with the repatriation of illegal migrants.

Critics, including human rights charities, warn that these changes will punish vulnerable individuals, drive asylum seekers underground, and undermine fundamental human rights protections.

The organization notes that FCI Dublin was closed in 2024 after federal investigations confirmed ongoing patterns of correctional officers sexually assaulting incarcerated women.
“As a resident of the Tri-Valley for over 35 years, I am opposed to reopening FCI Dublin as an ICE detention facility in our community,” said resident Dan Morley, according to CCIJ.
Organizers warn a new ICE detention hub in Dublin would worsen these conditions and further isolate mixed-status families.
The organization warns that reopening FCI Dublin would recreate the same harmful conditions that led to the facility’s closure.","DUBLIN, CA – Dublin residents and immigrant justice advocates are urging the Dublin City Council to reject any attempt to reopen the former Federal Correctional Institution Dublin as an immigration detention center, according to the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice (CCIJ).

Community members are expected to gather for a vigil outside the Dublin Civic Center at 6:30 p.m. on Nov. 18 before giving public comment at the council meeting at 7 p.m.

CCIJ reports that early 2025 filings revealed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is considering reopening FCI Dublin to expand immigration detention, alarming survivors and advocates because of the facility’s documented history of widespread staff sexual abuse.

The organization notes that FCI Dublin was closed in 2024 after federal investigations confirmed ongoing patterns of correctional officers sexually assaulting incarcerated women. Many survivors were undocumented, which advocates argue made them more vulnerable to threats of deportation.

“These guards abused us because we were immigrants. They told us they could do whatever they wanted, because we were going to be deported,” said one anonymous survivor. According to CCIJ, she reported being regularly subjected to racist slurs and told to “go back” to her country.

CCIJ reports that survivors also described dangerous conditions inside the facility, including mold, asbestos and deteriorating infrastructure, which contributed to the prison’s closure.

Community opposition has grown across the Tri-Valley as residents continue urging officials to block ICE from reopening a site associated with severe human rights violations, according to the organization.

CCIJ warns that reopening the facility under the Trump administration could escalate mass deportation efforts, widen arrest dragnets and increase the risk of wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens. The group adds that detention and deportation have long-term effects on family stability, mental health and industries dependent on immigrant labor.

“As a resident of the Tri-Valley for over 35 years, I am opposed to reopening FCI Dublin as an ICE detention facility in our community,” said resident Dan Morley, according to CCIJ. He stated that reopening the site would “stoke fear in the daily lives of so many of our immigrant neighbors.”

CCIJ claims that the Nov. 18 actions are part of a broader movement led by the ICE Out of Dublin Coalition, the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity and other community partners working to stop the facility from reopening. The coalition includes survivors, faith leaders, residents, labor groups and civil rights organizations.

The organization argues that FCI Dublin’s legacy as a site of systemic abuse makes it especially inappropriate for detaining immigrants. CCIJ emphasizes that many survivors still live in the Bay Area and continue to experience trauma tied to the facility.

CCIJ reports that unsafe infrastructure, toxic materials and deteriorating buildings would require major investment to make the prison habitable, raising further concerns about holding vulnerable individuals there.

The coalition fears reopening the facility would heighten fear among immigrant communities already worried about workplace raids, surveillance and traffic-stop enforcement, according to CCIJ. Organizers warn a new ICE detention hub in Dublin would worsen these conditions and further isolate mixed-status families.

CCIJ reiterates that faith leaders throughout the East Bay have joined the opposition because they believe the use of a site known for abuse violates core religious values.

The organization warns that reopening FCI Dublin would recreate the same harmful conditions that led to the facility’s closure.

According to CCIJ, while the City Council cannot directly prevent federal authorities from leasing the prison, large-scale public opposition could influence political decisions and pressure federal officials to abandon the plan.

CCIJ concludes that organizing will continue until ICE publicly commits to not reopening the facility, and they encourage residents to attend the vigil, speak during public comment and urge elected leaders to oppose detention expansion at the site.

In a statement on their Facebook page, Northfield Police Chief Jeff Schroepfer stated that ICE had not contacted the department before the incident. Furthermore, while Northfield Officers were called to the scene by bystanders, it is not a Northfield Police Department case or investigation. “The department was not involved in the contact or any related arrests and has not been provided details regarding the circumstances or reasons for ICE’s actions.”

The police chief noted that it is the policy of the Northfield Police Department not to participate in or assist with immigration enforcement actions and that they do not have the authority to interject themselves into a federal investigation.

Will be working in the coming days to gather and provide any additional as we have it, and will update you on-air and online.

Statements from Local Leaders:

Northfield Mayor Erica Zweifel:

I have viewed the video circulating showing federal agents detaining one of our neighbors in Northfield. These actions have traumatized the community and left a family without their father and husband. The City of Northfield values the safety and well-being of all residents. We value our local law enforcement officials. Our focus at the City level remains on fostering a safe, inclusive community for all residents, ensuring local law enforcement operates transparently and professionally, and providing support for families affected by incidents within our jurisdiction.

Because this is a Federal matter, the City has no authority to intervene in or direct ICE actions, and there are no local mechanisms to require identification or prevent the use of masks by Federal agents acting under Federal authority. Any questions regarding the procedures or accountability of ICE agents should be directed to the agency itself. To be clear, this is not a Northfield Police Department investigation, and the department had no role in the detention or any enforcement actions. Local law enforcement and city officials do not have authority over Federal investigations or the actions of Federal agents. I support the Northfield Police Department in fulfilling its duties responsibly and in accordance with the law.

That said, it would be irresponsible for us not to express some concern about the approach the current Federal administration is taking regarding the freedoms and civil rights that every resident of our community deserves. We fully acknowledge that we do not know the complete circumstances around the current issue at hand. However, we are fully committed to the U.S. Constitution and the laws of our land which include due process and protection under the Bill of Rights.

We call on our Federal leaders in Congress, in the White House and in the Supreme Court to uphold their oaths to the Constitution while ensuring that everyone on U.S. soil is afforded the human and civil rights that we would all want for ourselves.

Many residents have asked what they can do in the face of such uncertainty. I have reached out to Senator Tina Smith, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Representative Angie Craig to express my deep concern about how this incident unfolded in Northfield and the delay of information regarding this community member’s location, status, or charges. Issues of transparency, oversight, and communication fall squarely within federal authority, and I am urging our congressional delegation to seek answers on behalf of the community. I encourage residents to join me in sharing these concerns with their federal representatives.

In Northfield we will continue to support one another, stay in dialogue with our local police, and engage with our elected officials. The Community Action Center has established the Northfield Supporting Neighbors Fund, donations can be made at www.northfieldsupportingneighbors.org These funds are made available to families in need for legal assistance.

Together, we can stand with this family and uphold the values of care, dignity, and accountability that define Northfielders.

State Representative Kristi Pursell (DFL-Northfield)

Yesterday’s actions by federal law enforcement were unnecessarily extreme. The disappearing of one of our community’s valued Northfielders has left us scared and angry, but we are not deterred.

I’ve been in touch with his family, community groups, and local leaders to offer my support in any way I can as we respond to this unconstitutional act. Right now we are united as a community in grieving, but we will move forward together. We must continue to speak up and speak out against unconstitutional actions like these.",https://i0.wp.com/kymnradio.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/KYMN_square.png?fit=32%2C25&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:09.971796

The 36,000-square-foot detention and processing center is planned to serve as a central hub for southeastern Wisconsin, holding people before deportation or transfer to other detention centers.
In a empty parking lot nearby, several deputies appeared to be packing away equipment in the trunk a Milwaukee County Sheriff’s vehicle.
The facility will be used to process ICE detainees, as well as immigrants who must come in for regular check-ins.
“It’s 2025, and this is completely unacceptable to be running an ICE facility like this, and be deporting people illegally, without due process.","Activist groups and community members gathered Saturday morning to denounce the construction of a new federal immigration enforcement detention facility on Milwaukee’s Northwest Side. Renovations at the property, located at 11900 W Lake Park Drive, were clearly underway, with construction equipment sitting behind new fencing, piles of dirt and stacks of building materials visible through the building’s dark windows. Outside, protesters marched in the street and delivered speeches.

The 36,000-square-foot detention and processing center is planned to serve as a central hub for southeastern Wisconsin, holding people before deportation or transfer to other detention centers.

“You may be here, but you are not welcome here,” said Ald. Larresa Taylor — who represents the district where the facility will be located. Although the city cannot prevent ICE from taking over the facility, Taylor said that this “doesn’t mean that we are going to accept it laying down.”

Activists from Voces de la Frontera, Comité Sin Fronteras, the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Never Again Action–Wisconsin, the Party for Socialism & Liberation, and the Wisconsin Coalition for Justice in Palestine picketed outside the building for close to two hours. Towards the end of the event, a drone was seen flying overhead, which was not operated by any of the activist groups who held the rally. In a empty parking lot nearby, several deputies appeared to be packing away equipment in the trunk a Milwaukee County Sheriff’s vehicle. The Sheriff’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment on whether its drone team was flying over the Saturday protest.

Opponents of the facility say that its opening moved forward without community input or consent, and that it will perpetuate troubling uses of force and arrests in cities nationwide including Chicago. The facility will be used to process ICE detainees, as well as immigrants who must come in for regular check-ins.

Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, applauded Taylor, calling her “the first person to sound the alarm months ago about the expansion of this detention center, and to call attention and condemn what was happening in our city.” The building is privately owned by Milwaukee Governmental LLC, which originally requested modifications to the property (something Taylor learned about in December). The LLC is linked to the Illinois-based WD Schorsch LLC, which owns properties leased to federal government agencies.

“It’s not an accident what is happening, where this facility is being chosen to be built,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “It’s part of a long-term pattern of discrimination and marginalization, and criminalization of working class people of color.” Neumann-Oritz said that instead of spending “millions” on the facility, “that money should be used to pay for FoodShare, BadgerCare, and our public schools.”

Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC), said, “We are not free, until we are all free.” Lang added that Black communities “know what it’s like to be ripped away from our families and locked away,” and that people are concerned about federal agents’ behavior in cities like Chicago. “And we have been worried for months, if not years, ‘is this going to happen to Milwaukee?’”

Over recent months months, videos have suggested an escalating patter of force from federal agents including shooting people in the head with pepper balls, placing protesters in chokeholds, deploying tear gas in crowded neighborhoods in broad daylight, arresting and attacking journalists, arresting parents in front of their children, and having unprofessional verbal exchanges with citizens.

Although Milwaukee hasn’t seen protest-related clashes, ICE stirred anxiety and condemnation earlier this year after arresting members of families with mixed-immigration status at the Milwaukee County Courthouse as they attended court hearings. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was also arrested and criminally charged after the federal government accused her of attempting to hide a person sought by ICE who’d attended a hearing in her courtroom. Dugan is expected to go to trial in federal court in December. Other high profile arrests and deportations of community members have also occurred in Milwaukee during the first six months of the second Trump administration.

Conor Mika, a student activist at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) condemned what he said is a lack of transparency and accountability for his school’s relationship with ICE, which has been using a university building for operations in Milwaukee. “It’s time MSOE takes a stand. It’s on MSOE to slow down ICE’s operations, and protect its students by removing ICE from this building, and refusing any future collaborations with these agencies conducting mass deportations in our city.”

Leah Janke and Tanya Brown both attended the rally Saturday, and told the Wisconsin Examiner that it was important to make their voices heard. “I think it’s important that people here know that we don’t want this,” said Brown. “It’s not just a small community that doesn’t want it, it’s everybody. We don’t want it.” Janke said. “It’s 2025, and this is completely unacceptable to be running an ICE facility like this, and be deporting people illegally, without due process. This is insanity. It doesn’t feel right in any way.” Janke added, “I’ve seen a lot happening in Chicago, and that’s my fear…that’s my biggest fear.”

Besides attending rallies, Janke has been making “whistle kits” filled with whistles and information about reporting ICE, or alerting the community if an arrest is happening. “Be safe out there,” said Janke. “Because honestly, it’s scary and people are getting hurt.”

Raúl Ríos, an activist with both Comité Sin Fronteras and Party for Socialism and Liberation, said it was important to rally people on Saturday both on the North and South Sides of Milwaukee, especially since the city is one of the most segregated in America. “Most people that I’ve heard, not only today but previously, had said that they had no idea that this was even being constructed, and that it’s going to be used as the main facility for southeast Wisconsin,” Rios told the Examiner.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0106-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:34.932820
,Human Rights,2025-11-17 10:58:18+00:00,www.bbc.com,Fast-track deportations to be announced as part of asylum reforms - BBC,Jennifer McKiernan,,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn97ryvelz0o,"The changes aim to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals, as well as make it more difficult for successful asylum seekers to remain.
Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.
The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year.
Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.
Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""","The changes aim to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals, as well as make it more difficult for successful asylum seekers to remain.

Mahmood told the BBC on Sunday: ""This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.""

She said the ""pace and scale"" had been destabilising and that to ""maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control"".

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.

The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year. The government sees overhauling the system as crucial in order to rebuild public confidence that it can stem the numbers coming to the UK.

Under the plans, which have been criticised by some Labour MPs as well as opposition parties, people will be restricted to arguing their grounds for appeal within a single appeal and if a case fails, they will be deported.

The government will argue that these restrictions would give room to create new safe and legal routes for refugees through work and study routes.

The government will follow the Danish model of creating an independent body to fast-track the deportation of foreign criminals and cases with little prospect of success through the appeals system.

Tighter restrictions would be placed on successful asylum seekers, who will have their case reviewed every two and a half years - and if their home country is considered safe they will be returned.

A refugee will have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

The home secretary is also expected to announce another Danish-inspired move, which is to take possessions and savings to pay for accommodation, including cars and e-bikes - although unlike in Denmark this will not include jewellery and sentimental items like wedding rings.

The Home Office says this is because some asylum seekers are getting gifts of money from relatives at the same time as living in free accommodation and receiving a small financial allowance from the UK government.

Mahmood also wants to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied - only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

And the UK will join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

The government believes this has been used to support unreasonable claims, including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their healthcare needs cannot be met.

As first reported in the Times, the threat of visa bans for Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo comes after thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from the three nations were said to be in the UK.

A Home Office source said the countries were being targeted ""for their unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive returns processes"".

Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the plans were ""a small step in the right direction"" and her party would work with the government to get them through Parliament.

However, she added that the proposals were ""nowhere near enough"" and called on the government to go further, including by leaving the ECHR and removing everyone who arrives in the country illegally.

The plans have prompted criticism from some Labour MPs, including the MP for Folkestone Tony Vaughn, who said he agreed action needed to be taken ""to regain public trust"" in the asylum system but opposed the idea of temporary asylum ""on principle"".

""A particular problem that I have is around the idea we should be trying to kick refugees out despite having granted them protection,"" Vaughn, who is an immigration barrister, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""I think the idea is we review their status after two-and-a-half years on a rolling basis and then hopefully at some point their country will be safe and we can deport them - I think that's completely the wrong position in principle.""

Vaughn said the proposals risked creating ""limbo and alienation"" and called on the government to instead clear the asylum appeals backlog, make decisions on claims more quickly, and ramp up the France-UK returns deal pilot.

Speaking on the same programme, Asylum and Border Security Minister Alex Norris said the 20-year rule would only apply to new arrivals, but he said he did want to tackle the 50% of refugees who ""end up on benefits"".

Norris said: ""If your intention is to come to this country illegally... sit at home, not contribute, not learn English, integrate into the community, not to build a life... then that's going to come with much greater checks.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cdcf/live/51572e20-c385-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:14.414601

Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the effort launched on Saturday is to protect the public from “dangerous criminal offenders who are in the country unlawfully,” adding that additional DHS workers were deployed to Charlotte.

Gregory Bovino, who led hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in a similar effort in Chicago, said that 81 arrests were made Sunday.

Nearly 1,400 ICE detainers across North Carolina have not been honored — releasing “criminal illegal aliens” into North Carolina’s neighborhoods, DHS said Saturday.

Some of the arrests and agent encounters were caught on video — with many shocking audiences.

On Sunday, ICE officials said the driver of a van went off-road, driving around agents in Charlotte in the University City area near UNC-Charlotte.

DHS officials said an officer was injured when the van driver — a U.S. citizen — led them on a high-speed chase and later tried to ram law enforcement vehicles.

When the driver was arrested, a firearm was found in the vehicle, according to DHS.

Also on Sunday, a video sent from a WJZY viewer showed about a dozen agents out in northeast Charlotte just before noon, with a large crowd around the agents.

Some people were recording video and others were annoyed by the agents at the Compare Foods grocery store near the intersection of Sugar Creek Road and Tryon Street in Charlotte.

An early sighting of agents Saturday was near Baleada Bar and Grill, less than a mile from where a group of agents was caught on video getting into two unmarked Ford SUVs along South Boulevard.

There were tense moments as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents smashed the window of a Honduran-born U.S. citizen in a Charlotte strip mall parking lot.

Willy Aceituno recorded video of the second stop when his red Ford pickup truck window was smashed. He says once the video cut away — the agents dragged him out and threw him to the ground.

Aceituno was released once he was able to show documentation that he was a U.S. citizen. But he was also shaken up with some cuts to his arms from the broken glass and he later filed a report with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police.

The incident with Aceituno was also caught on video from another angle, showing the agents holding him to the ground.

The agents drove off in a light-colored unmarked Ford Expedition SUV.

A video captured by a man driving in a parking lot also showed U.S. agents with two people on the ground across the street. Johny Martinez Gonzalez cursed at the agents on video as they led the pair of detainees away.

Also Saturday, a video showed federal agents putting a woman’s hands behind her back as she can be heard yelling.

Video captured by Paula Walker Coleman showed the woman screaming, “I am a US citizen!”

According to WUNC, agents were seen making arrests in “Charlotte’s immigrant-heavy Central Avenue and South Boulevard corridors.”

Also Saturday, U.S. Border Patrol agents were seen roaming an east Charlotte neighborhood in a dark-colored unmarked minivan.

Video showed masked agents approaching two men using a ladder to hang Christmas lights in a front yard.

One agent tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, homeowner Rheba Hamilton said. The workers did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

Also Saturday, a detention was caught on video.

Border Patrol agents were spotted arresting a man at an immigrant shopping center in east Charlotte around 10:15 a.m. Saturday.

The man was grabbed at the corner of Rosehaven Drive and Central Avenue, according to WFAE. Agents chased the man into a laundromat, then take him into custody, according to WFAE which captured the video.

Meanwhile, a bakery in Charlotte decided to close indefinitely while the ICE crackdown was underway.

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

Manolo Betancur owns Manolo’s Bakery — a popular Latin bakery in East Charlotte — said he decided to close after watching raids in the parking lot Saturday.

“I have seen these people in SUVs, cars that are not marked with their faces covered — throwing immigrants to the floor and taking them away,” Betancur said.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/11/video-ice.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:43.438204

Earlier this month, District Judge Karin Immergut ruled in favor of Oregon and found that Trump exceeded his authority by deploying hundreds of Oregon and California National Guard troops to, in part, protect federal staff and property at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in South Portland.

""The court acknowledged large-scale violent protests in June, but treated them as irrelevant to the President's determination just a few months later,"" the federal government wrote in its motion.

PAST COVERAGE | Trump administration appeals court ruling blocking troop deployment to Portland

On Saturday, the number of Oregon National Guard troops remaining on standby to deploy was reduced to 100, according to ABC News.

The troops are scheduled to remain under federal control until Nov. 26, ""but the Department of War intends to extend this mobilization,"" according to the federal government's newest court filing.

In its new motion to stay the district court ruling, the Trump administration argued that in mid-June, approximately 450 protesters engaged in activities such as starting fires, assaulting officers, blocking traffic, and vandalizing the ICE facility.

The protests and demonstrations, according to the appeal, made it difficult to carry out immigration laws.

The appeal says the Department of Homeland Security sought assistance from the Department of War to safeguard federal personnel and facilities in Oregon, and President Trump granted the request, directing the federalization of a small number of Oregon National Guard members.

The administration claims that the President's determination was lawful under laws that allow federalization when regular forces are unable to execute U.S. laws or when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion.

However, the district court's ruling, presided over by Judge Karin J. Immergut, permanently barred the administration from deploying troops to Portland, stating that the ""facts on the ground"" showed the protests did not prevent federal agents from carrying out immigration laws and their duties.

Portland Police only designated a gathering at the ICE facility as a riot on one occasion this summer, in June.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield responded to the administration's appeal on Friday, stating, ""The district court’s ruling made it clear that this administration must be accountable to the truth and to the rule of law."" Rayfield's office has not yet responded to the Trump administration's motion to stay.

And last week, Lewis & Clark College law professor Tung Yin commented on the ruling, saying, ""It's not that they can't win an appeal, but they would have to get a legal rule that essentially says, the president's determination is conclusive when the president says, my people can't enforce federal law.""

The Trump administration is requesting an administrative stay by Nov. 21 to prevent the defederalization of Oregon Guard members, citing harms and alteration of the status quo caused by the injunction. The appeal contends that threats against federal officials are often crimes and that officials cannot know in advance which threats will materialize.",https://kfoxtv.com/resources/media/1583f77f-2d26-431a-8e45-c2ead2d0f231-ICEPortlandDMorrison_21.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:56:46.078916

He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” he explained.
“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said.
As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center for assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer.
KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.","A 45-year-old Riverside County man, who reportedly works as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, is accused of illegally detaining a minor at gunpoint while off duty last week.

The Nov. 10 incident, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, played out at around 10:30 pm outside a home in the 32000 block of Daybrook Terrance in Temecula.

Lawyer Greg Kirakosian, who represents the boy and his family, told KTLA that the 17-year-old was driving home after dropping a friend off down the street when he saw the suspect, identified by investigators as Gerardo Rodriguez, pointing a gun at his vehicle, demanding he pull over.

“In the moment, I think he was just scared for his life. He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” he explained. “Then that same person came up to his driver’s side door and pulled him out at gunpoint.”

In footage of the incident obtained by KTLA, the 45-year-old is seen pulling a gun from his waistband as he walked up the street, pointing it at the teen’s truck and demanding he stop the vehicle while reportedly brandishing his badge.

“Freeze, police,” Rodriguez shouts. “Put the car in f****** park. Get out of the car. Turn it off, get out. You’re speeding in the f****** neighborhood. Come over here, sit down, get your a** down. You have a driver’s license?”

The 45-year-old, who is known to residents on the street as an ICE agent and also reportedly told the boy he worked for ICE, then began interrogating the Mexican American teen, asking him who he was, where he is from and demanding documentation, eventually drawing the attention of others who live on the street.

“By the time our client’s parents showed up, the neighbors had essentially come to the rescue and stopped him from doing what he was doing, calming him down and forcing him to go back inside his house and leaving the boy alone,” Kirakosian said.

The teenager’s parents had been alerted by a friend to what was happening, prompting them to rush over from their home with their son’s passport, fearing the incident could be some type of immigrant enforcement operation. They called 911 after they arrived.

Responding deputies turned the investigation over to RCSD’s Investigation Bureau, who contacted Rodriguez later that same night, arrested him and conducted a search of his house “where evidence related to the investigation was collected,” the department said in a news release.

“I think right now a lot of Mexican Americans, whether they are in a situation like this or not, who are angry upset and scared and this just really came close to home for them,” Kirakosian said when asked how the family was doing after the harrowing ordeal.

The L.A.-based civil rights attorney added that he believes the 45-year-old has become emboldened by what he does and sees other ICE agents doing on a day-to-day basis.

“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said. “I don’t know how much worse the situation is going to get, honestly. This kid could’ve been shot.”

This incident comes after several others where federal law enforcement agents have pulled their firearms on citizens.

On Nov. 9, video captured a ICE officer pointing his gun at a woman behind him in an intersection in Santa Ana, which was witnessed by a Fullerton police officer returning from the Santa Ana Jail facility, who refused to get involved if no crime had been committed.

Federal officials later claimed the woman was following the agent.

On Oct. 30, a 24-year-old Ontario man was shot by a federal agent who was reportedly trying to notify officers involved in an enforcement operation that there were children across the street.

In that instance, federal officials claimed the agent fired “defensive shots” while fearing the 24-year-old was attempting to run over officers.

As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center for assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer. Jail records show he posted bond and was released the same night.

KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it,” and for the last decade the battle over immigration has been turbocharged. Now’s the time to step back and realize this isn’t a so much contest between how many immigrants the country wants or needs or the cultural impacts of mass migration so much as an issue of control of immigration. But under the Constitution, Congress, accountable to the voters, ultimately controls.

“Control Is a Tough Nut”

The newly installed Pope, Leo XIV, was recently asked to name his favorite movies.

Of the four he named, three were what you would expect the pontiff to enjoy: The Sound of Music (1965), a semibiographical account of a novice nun who leaves the cloister to care for a large, motherless family; It’s a Wonderful Life (1946), a tale of despair, self-sacrifice, and redemption; and Life Is Beautiful (1997), a story about a father who “uses a perfect mixture of will, humor and imagination to protect his son from the dangers around” the concentration camp to which they’ve been sent.

The fourth, however, is telling: Ordinary People (1980). If you’ve never seen it, the IMDb summary tells you all you need to know: “The accidental death of the older son of an affluent family deeply strains the relationships among the bitter mother, the good-natured father and the guilt-ridden younger son.”

It’s dark, and even the “happy” ending leaves little resolution as the mother (Beth Jarret, played by Mary Tyler Moore), leaves the son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), and father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland) just when Conrad accepts that he’s not to blame for his brother’s death.

That it beat Raging Bull for the best picture Oscar tells you more about America pre-Reagan than it does about artistic merit, but in any event, the whole movie is about control: Beth can’t accept that fate derailed her overweening efforts to create the perfect family, and responds by trying to control her husband and son.

The story begins after Conrad attempts suicide, and his parents send him to a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch). Berger eventually gains Conrad’s trust and tells the doctor he wants to be “more in control”. Berger admits that he’s “not big on control”, but agrees to help because “control is a tough nut”.

That the spiritual leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics would “enjoy” a grueling, quarter-century-old flick about the challenges of control says much about the burdens of the papacy but also a lot about the world outside of the Vatican’s walls.

Because much of our current angst stems from a belief that we are increasingly losing control.

Few can understand, let alone control, AI; it promises incomparable change, but we don’t know whether it will be calamity (The Terminator) or some form of salvation (Interstellar).

AI is also driving stock markets, but is it a bubble or a boom? Having lived through downturns in 1987, 2000, and 2008, I have my thoughts, but regardless, it’s the difference between eating chateaubriand at retirement or roasting squirrels over a trash-can fire, though there’s little we can do to control it.

Why are Democratic Socialists like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on the ascent even though we all know how socialism ends? Because Gotham is the most chaotic place in the world, both good and bad, and he promised to control it in favor of the proletariat.

Or consider Covid, when billions sacrificed their liberties for what they were told was the common good. “Covid Karens” who snitched on those who broke nonsensical rules were the spiritual heirs to the hundreds of thousands of East German civilians who were “occasional” Stasi informants, in that while neither could control their government, at least they could control their neighbors.

Shifting Fronts in the Battle over Control of Immigration

Then, there’s immigration.

The battle for control over the subject has stirred up popular resentment in the Western world, with clashes following the “Unite the Kingdom” march in London in September and hundreds of thousands taking to German streets to protest a proposed bill to crack down on illegal migrants in February.

Each is a physical manifestation of a political opinion — both for and against immigration — in the face of a government and “elite” that doesn’t share the protesters’ views — in other words, a battle for control.

The First Trump Term

Nowhere, however, have the fronts in that battle shifted as they have in the United States since Donald Trump descended the golden escalator at his eponymous NYC tower on June 16, 2015, to announce his campaign for the 2016 presidential election.

In a seemingly unscripted address that day, he attacked one of his Republican opponents, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), as “weak on immigration”, promised to end President Obama’s “illegal executive order on immigration” (DACA), asked “when do we beat Mexico at the border?”, and vowed to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and “have Mexico pay for that wall”.

Trump’s campaign was derided as a ”publicity stunt” until his opponents realized — too late — he was serious, but more importantly that he had tapped into a desire by Americans to control immigration.

His rhetoric alone quickly triggered a “Trump effect”, with an initial downturn in illegal entries at the Southwest border once he took office and a slowing of new migration over his first term.

The cartels and smugglers quickly reasserted control, however, as waves of illegal migrants (mostly families) exploited loopholes the new president was powerless to fix without congressional help, and immigrant advocates vied for control using the courts to stymie Trump’s immigration and border policies.

Trump, likely to his detriment, failed to highlight his immigration successes on the 2020 presidential campaign trail, even as a largely supine media echoed claims by his opponent, Joe Biden, that the incumbent “separated children from their parents at the border”.

“Biden’s Border Fiasco”

Once Biden took over, the gains of Trump I were lost, as the border descended into disaster in response to the new president’s “catch-and-release” policies and major cities began falling off fiscal cliffs in an effort to accommodate hundreds of thousands of improperly released migrants.

Biden’s supporters in the press downplayed the burgeoning migrant tsunami and did their candidate no favors once the sheer magnitude of the surge made its way into the public sphere. By August 2022, the editors at Bloomberg Opinion were warning that “Biden’s Border Fiasco Is Expanding”, while calling for “leadership” on the issue.

That leadership never appeared, and a last-ditch effort to blame Trump’s opposition to a deeply flawed and poorly understood 2024 “Senate border bill” fell on the deaf ears of an electorate that wanted control of the border, to the degree it became increasingly dour on “immigration” itself.

Trump redux found his old immigration script, and though Democratic party elites swapped Biden for his Vice President, Kamala Harris, as their 2024 presidential candidate, Harris couldn’t escape the stigma of having been the president’s “border czar”.

“Voters Were Fed Up Over Immigration”

Consequently, as a New York Times headline the day after the 2024 election explained: “Voters Were Fed Up Over Immigration. They Voted for Trump.”

In other words, the electorate wanted control over the entry and removal of aliens in the United States, and when they didn’t get it from one side, they picked the other.

The Trump II administration has viewed the election as a mandate to undo the harm of the Biden years by answering “mass migration” with “mass deportations”.

That has required a huge influx of additional manpower and detention resources for ICE and CBP, which Congress provided in H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”.

It has also prompted a reassessment of whether aliens who entered illegally but are present in the United States are eligible for bond.

Trump’s DHS has pointed to the detention mandates for alien “applicants for admission”, i.e., aliens who haven’t been formally admitted, in section 235(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in concluding illegal entrants present here cannot be released on bond, and DOJ’s appellate immigration tribunal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has agreed.

Immigrants and their advocates have pushed back against that interpretation in demanding bond release hearings, and as Politico reported on October 31, “More than 100 federal judges have now ruled at least 200 times that” the administration’s interpretation of the law is in error.

You can add Judge Jeffrey Cummings of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to that list. In a November 13 order, he directed the government to release 615 aliens who were detained during DHS’s Chicago-area “Operation Midway Blitz” on bond under a different provision, section 236(a), of the INA.

Advocates’ efforts to retake control of the immigration issue through the courts harken back to Trump I, with the differences being (1) Trump II has “flooded the zone” by engaging in different enforcement efforts in various ways, and (2) this time around, Trump rolled out his initiatives quickly, giving his DOJ time to seek judicial review (Judge Cummings’ order is on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, for example).

The Protestors’ Veto

But not all of the opposition has involved legal niceties. Protestors countered Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts more directly, impeding ICE from arresting aliens by blocking immigration facilities, ramming federal vehicles, and (allegedly) doxxing officers. DHS claims there’s been an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against ICE, and a tenfold increase in assaults.

I’ve omitted the assassination attempts at immigration facilities in Dallas, Alvarado, and McAllen, all in Texas.

The protestors’ implicit argument isn’t that certain aliens should be protected from deportation, but that no alien should be removed, so long as they have made it here.

On November 12, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) joined that chorus, issuing a “Special Message” on immigration, which stated: “We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people.”

To say many of the factual assertions they make in that message, including their plaints about “the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care” and “that some immigrants in the United States have arbitrarily lost their legal status”, beg the question would be an understatement. The letter is replete with talking points, not facts, and many are questionable if not wrong.

Regardless, it raises the question of how the bishops think the Trump administration should respond to the millions of aliens who came here illegally between 2021 and January 20, 2025.

The bishops make clear that they “advocate for a meaningful reform of our nation’s immigration laws and procedures” (read: “amnesty”), but they never say what they would reform, how that reform would work, or whom they would allow to stay.

In any event, if amnesty were popular, it would have happened under Obama when Democrats held the House and White House and had a supermajority in the Senate. It’s beyond a non-starter after the past four years of non-enforcement.

And while the bishops “recognize that nations have a responsibility to regulate their borders and establish a just and orderly immigration system for the sake of the common good”, they never explain how the United States can fulfill that obligation without deporting those here illegally.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Capitol-social.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 03:56:19.817261

Clergy representing Catholic, Jewish, Episcopal and interfaith coalitions gathered Friday morning to demand an end to workplace raids and mass detentions. The protest escalated when officers ordered the group to disperse; several faith leaders refused, kneeling in the street in prayer before being taken into custody, according to Reuters. Organizers say at least one of the arrestees was a 72-year-old priest who has participated in immigration vigils for more than a decade.

The arrests come just weeks after a separate incident in Chicago in which a Methodist minister was struck in the head by a pepper-ball projectile during a police response to a protest outside a migrant intake center. Earlier this fall, a group of faith leaders including priests and nuns were detained after being refused admission inside to administer communion, an essential element of a Catholic’s faith life. Immigrant-rights groups say the pattern reflects a broader escalation in the policing of clergy-led actions, many of which have historically been peaceful.

Legal experts note that faith-led protests often invoke First Amendment protections for both free exercise of religion and free assembly, making these clashes particularly sensitive. While authorities argue that restrictions are tied to safety and facility security, civil liberties groups warn that aggressive enforcement, especially when directed at clergy, can have a chilling effect on religious and political expression.

ICE officials said the Broadview arrests occurred only after “multiple lawful orders were ignored.” Organizers counter that civil disobedience is central to their mission and vowed to continue holding weekly vigils outside the facility, calling the arrests a sign that we are in “a spiritual emergency.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2235816386.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:54.801252

""There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens. President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't.""

NPR also reached out to the Defense Department for comment but has not received a response.

Here is what to know about military operation names.

Naming military operations is not new. Neither is criticism of names

Code names for U.S. military operations date back to the World War II era and began for security reasons, according to Lt. Col. Gregory C. Sieminski in the article ""The Art of Naming Operations,"" in The US Army War College Quarterly: Parameters. The names were based on colors at first, such as Operation Indigo, but as World War II spread, military officials switched to a name-based system that included projects and locations.

After the Vietnam War, military officials started using a computer system to reconcile nicknames and code words, called the Code Word, Nickname, and Exercise Term System, or NICKA.

Routine military exercises use the NICKA system for naming operations, according to Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Highly visible operations generally get two-word names chosen outside the system, such as operations Just Cause in Panama, Iraqi Freedom, and Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Cancian told NPR.

""The ones that are chosen are chosen for a reason to project a message,"" Cancian told NPR. ""So, going back to Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, the message is freedom. With the recent ones, Midnight Hammer and Southern Spear, the message is lethality.""

Although DHS is not considered part of the U.S. military, using the name ""Charlotte's Web"" could also have been chosen because ""you've got the spider's web that catches people,"" but it could also be the administration trying to be ""tongue in cheek,"" he continued.

And other military operations have received backlash and criticism in the past, including what is now known as Operation Enduring Freedom. It was first called Operation Infinite Justice, but was changed after backlash that it was offensive to Muslims.

""The fact that these names get scrutiny is not unusual,"" Cancian said. ""Now, I think in this case, given the administration's aggressive rhetoric, I think that inspires maybe pushback, but it's not unusual that names get a lot of scrutiny.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x576+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2F23%2Fa86dcca248fc8f30447dbf9531f4%2Fgettyimages-2244880522.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:57.365321

Mahmood's torrent of new policy announcements in recent days are certainly bold - from limiting refugees to temporary stays, to overhauling human rights law to help increase deportations, and threatening countries with visa bans unless they accept the return of criminals and illegal immigrants.

But the plans are controversial too. The Refugee Council, which supports asylum-seekers, says making refugee status temporary is both ""highly impractical"" as well as ""inhumane"".

The home secretary's team are delighted at the newspaper headlines and TV coverage their announcements have secured in recent days, yet they know that was the easy bit.

Persuading Labour MPs from all wings of the party to vote en masse for the plans is a far bigger challenge.

Backbench frustration over winter fuel payments and welfare reform led to embarrassing government U-turns. Will restive Labour MPs try to shift government policy yet again?

That may depend on whether a politician's constituency is under threat from Reform UK and Conservatives on the right, or the Liberal Democrats and Greens on the left.

Some ministers are already raising concerns about Mahmood's proposals in private, and sceptical MPs have started to speak out in public.

Rachael Maskell, a prominent critic of the government's botched welfare reforms, told me many of her colleagues are ""seriously concerned"".

She said the government is going in ""completely the wrong direction"" on immigration and its plans to change how human rights law is applied in the UK are a ""step too far"".

Another sceptical Labour MP, Brian Leishman, told me he had ""big reservations"" about the proposals, and cautioned ministers against ""trying to copy Farage and Reform who only want to demonise people"".

To minimise the prospect of parliamentary opposition, Mahmood has been meeting groups of Labour MPs in recent weeks to make what her allies call ""the persuasive moral case for reform"".

But privately they concede that it will be a difficult balance.

Partly because many in Labour are uncomfortable with both these policies and the accompanying rhetoric.

Both the Conservatives and Reform can sense those tensions and both are trying to capitalise on them.

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage even put out a statement to say something he knows Labour MPs won't like - ""The home secretary sounds like a Reform supporter"".

Farage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch both doubt these plans will even get through the Commons.

The government is billing these changes as the most significant reforms to the asylum system since World War Two.

Oxford University's Migration Observatory says Mahmood's overhaul will make the UK's immigration system amongst the strictest countries in Europe.

But that doesn't mean the number of small boat arrivals will come down.

""This won't be the silver bullet and I think the government recognises that"", argues Dr Peter Walsh, a senior researcher at the organisation.

""It is taking a broader approach, focusing on enforcement and return deals. Will people know about restrictions enough to deter them? We will have to wait and see.""

Reducing ""pull"" factors and making the UK less attractive to migrants is a massive long-term battle.

In this fight the government is up against sophisticated people-smuggling gangs who have shown they can adapt fast.

The home secretary will be hoping her ""throw the kitchen sink at it"" approach gradually reduces arrivals and increases deportations.

Mahmood believes community cohesion across the country depends on it.

But so does her future and that of her government.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04d7/live/88733380-c395-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:58:44.172718

Many of those arrested have reported encountering Vietnamese officials inside jails or immigration detention facilities and during check-in meetings with Thai immigration authorities.
Vietnamese Authorities Harassing Refugees in Thailand Several Hmong and Montagnard refugees who were held in Thai immigration detention in February through May, as well as refugees who spoke with detainees held there through August, said that Thai authorities allow Vietnamese police to visit detainees.
They’ll tell the Thai police to arrest us.” In April, Vietnamese police pulled aside some Montagnard men during their check-in sessions with Thai immigration authorities.
Some former detainees said that during visits to Thai detention, Vietnamese officials said that they had requested that Thai immigration authorities continue their detention until they agreed to return to Vietnam.","Increased cooperation between Thai and Vietnamese authorities is putting Vietnamese refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand at heightened risk of forcible return to Vietnam, Human Rights Watch said last Friday (14 November). By facilitating Vietnamese cross-border abuses, known as transnational repression, Thai authorities are violating international refugee law protections.

Thai police have carried out several large-scale operations in 2025 detaining scores of Vietnamese nationals, many of whom are recognized by the United Nations as refugees and asylum seekers. Many of those arrested have reported encountering Vietnamese officials inside jails or immigration detention facilities and during check-in meetings with Thai immigration authorities.

“Vietnamese exiles are facing increased insecurity in Thailand,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Thai authorities should immediately stop detaining refugees and stop cooperating with Vietnamese police seeking their return.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 34 Vietnamese refugees and asylum seekers in Bangkok from July through October 2025, including 7 people previously involved in human rights activism in Vietnam, 3 relatives of current political prisoners, as well as over 20 ethnic Montagnards and Hmong facing persecution in Vietnam for their religious beliefs or involvement in protests. Nearly all have been recognized as refugees by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) or are registered with the UN as asylum seekers and are awaiting interviews to determine their status.

Most of the exiled Vietnamese interviewed said fears of arrest, abduction, or extradition to Vietnam have grown in the past two years due to increased visits by Vietnamese authorities to Thai immigration detention centers. They also cited the April 2023 abduction of dissident journalist Duong Van Thai, 42, a UNHCR-registered refugee who had fled Vietnam in 2019 and was awaiting resettlement to a third country. Unidentified men forcibly took him to Vietnam, and in late October 2024, after a closed one-day trial, a Vietnamese court sentenced him to 12 years in prison for publishing information “aimed at opposing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.” Exiles’ apprehension increased further after Thai authorities, assisted by Vietnamese security personnel, arrested the dissident Y Quynh Bdap in June 2024. The Vietnamese government has labeled Bdap’s human rights group, Montagnards Stand for Justice, as a “terrorist” group.

In 2025, Thai police have carried out multiple operations targeting Vietnamese exiles, including in February, March, April, July, and October. Many of those arrested are ethnic Montagnards or Hmong from Vietnam’s Central Highlands, most of whom are recognized by UNHCR as refugees or asylum seekers with applications in process. Several Montagnards and Hmong detained in February through April gave consistent accounts after their release of Vietnamese police in Thai facilities pressing them to agree to return to Vietnam and later harassing them during check-in sessions with Thai immigration authorities.

Many refugees said Vietnamese police had visited their relatives in Vietnam in the last year, telling them that the police had located their relatives in Thailand and were arranging to have them returned.

Several human rights groups in Thailand have interviewed detainees and released exiles who corroborate these findings and have sent private reports to UN officials with allegations about cases of abuse.

Thai police regularly detain UNHCR-recognized refugees—including from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar—and hold them until they pay a bail bond, which most refugees and immigration advocates consider to be bribes. Human Rights Watch reported in July that Thai police routinely arrest and solicit bribes from Myanmar asylum seekers and migrants. Another Human Rights Watch report documented Thai authorities assisting foreign governments to target refugees.

The Thai government is obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, or non-return, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture or other serious ill-treatment, a threat to life, or other comparable serious human rights violations. Refoulement is prohibited by the UN Convention Against Torture, to which Thailand is a party, as well as customary international law. The prohibition on refoulement is incorporated in Thailand’s 2023 Act on Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearances.

Vietnam and Thailand appear to have agreed to cooperate more closely and exchange information about Vietnamese refugees, especially those in detention, since early 2024 when the two countries began negotiating an extradition treaty. In May 2025, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Thailand’s then-Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra signed a Comprehensive Agreement in which they “agreed to enhance legislative and judicial cooperation and committed to effectively implementing signed agreements between the two countries on preventing and combating crime, transferring sentenced persons, and cooperating in the enforcement of penal sentences.”

In July, several UN human rights experts sent letters to the governments of Vietnam and Thailand requesting information about many of these cases. The UN experts stated that “[t]here are concerns that the Government of Viet Nam may be exchanging information with the Government of Thailand to identify Vietnamese Montagnard refugees in Thailand for their possible forced repatriation to Viet Nam, including those recognized as refugees by the UNHCR and being considered for resettlement in third countries.”

The experts also expressed alarm about the reported incidents of “reprisals and intimidation” against exile human rights defenders in Thailand and “the undue restrictions” imposed on diaspora organizations, which they determined were “designed to further discourage cooperation with the United Nations” and prevent people from providing information to the UN.

Countries that have previously resettled Vietnamese refugees, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, and other European states, should consider increasing their resettlement of those at serious risk, Human Rights Watch said. The US has all but suspended refugee resettlement programs, including for refugees in Thailand.

“Thailand is now cooperating and is complicit in Vietnam’s transnational repression of exiles in Thailand,” Sifton said. “Outside governments need to expedite resettlement of refugees at risk in Thailand and urge the government to prevent Vietnam’s interference in refugee cases.”

Thailand-Vietnam Cooperation, Pressure on Refugees

Immigration Raids

Thai authorities for years have carried out sweeps to detain migrants and immigrants, many of them refugees or asylum seekers from Myanmar, Vietnam, and elsewhere in the region. Those arrested are typically charged for entering Thailand illegally or working without a valid visa. Asylum seekers and refugees registered with UNHCR are generally not authorized to work under Thai law.

Those arrested are usually held short term in Thai jails. Some obtain release after paying what authorities call fines, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 Thai baht (US$30 to $150) each. Detainees unable to pay or otherwise obtain release from jail are then usually transferred to immigration detention centers, where they are held until they can post a bond, typically 50,000 baht (US$1,500), and demonstrate that they have obtained a Thai guarantor. In some other cases, they are deported or later resettled as refugees to third countries.

On February 23, 2025, in Nonthaburi province, just outside Bangkok, Thai police detained over 60 Montagnard people, including several UNHCR-recognized refugees, according to witnesses and UN reporting. Most were convicted of “illegal entry and stay” and sent to jail. Detainees subsequently were placed in immigration detention centers, women with children were transferred to an immigration detention center in Bang Khen in Bangkok, while others were sent to the Suan Phlu center. Police in May also detained several other Montagnard refugees and asylum seekers in and around Bangkok.

In other raids in March, April, and July, Thai police arrested dozens of Hmong refugees and asylum seekers. Some were able to pay fines or post bail to be released, but many Hmong people detained from early 2025 remained in detention as of early November.

In a more recent operation in Nonthaburi on October 29, Thai police detained 70 Montagnards in an early morning raid. According to local sources, those detained included 42 people whom UNHCR had determined were refugees or who were awaiting processing of their asylum claims. Several had been detained in the earlier raids.

The authorities soon released 20 of them, who had previously been released on bail, and took the rest to the Suan Phlu immigration detention facility. A member of the Montagnard community in Nonthaburi said that the next day, the Thai authorities fined the remaining detainees 5,000 Thai baht (US$150) each, indicating that they would be released on payment of the fine.

Threats to Families in Vietnam

Human Rights Watch interviewed over a dozen men and two women in Thailand from the Montagnard community in Bangkok who had fled Vietnam at various times from 2015 to 2023. Several said that government officials had regularly visited the exiles’ relatives in their home districts in Vietnam’s Central Highlands in recent months and urged them to tell their exiled family members to return. A Montagnard man in his 30s said police went to his village in February and told his parents that they knew where her son was and that they should tell him to come home, saying that if he returned, “there will be less trouble.”

Some refugees said that relatives arrested during the immigration raid in Nonthaburi province in April and May told them by telephone that Thai authorities had allowed two Vietnamese police officials to interrogate them in detention soon after their arrest. The police, their relatives said, threatened several of them with forced repatriation, demanding that they sign documents in which they would agree to be returned. Some said that while they were detained, Vietnamese police visited their families in Vietnam and attempted to coerce them to convince their relatives to return.

Several Hmong refugees reported similar incidents and trends. A Hmong woman, whose husband was a leader of an unregistered Christian church and who had fled with him and the rest of their family in 2022, said the police now regularly visit her parents and parents-in-law in Vietnam.

“They came on August 1 [2025] and told them, ‘We have an agreement with the Thai police to bring him back,’” referring to her husband, who had been in Thai immigration detention. They told them, “We’re going to put him in jail for his anti-state activities.” The woman said she believed the police were suggesting that if his parents and parents-in-law helped convince her husband to return voluntarily, he would be rewarded with some leniency.

Nguyen Viet Dung, a former political prisoner convicted in 2018 for conducting “propaganda against the state,” who fled Vietnam after his release in late 2024, said that his relatives in Vietnam had faced growing intimidation. He provided multiple examples of Vietnamese police visiting his parents and sister in 2025. He expressed concern that Vietnamese authorities would seek his arrest in Thailand because he was on still on parole from his 2018 conviction when he fled Vietnam, making his departure illegal.

An asylum seeker who fled in 2023, Hoang Hao, whose brother Hoang Duc Binh is a political prisoner in Vietnam, said the authorities have frequently harassed his sister in Vietnam. He said they press her to speak with him by telephone and urge him to return, while suggesting that they will otherwise compel Thailand to have him returned. Two other Vietnamese refugees gave similar accounts.

Vietnamese Authorities Harassing Refugees in Thailand

Several Hmong and Montagnard refugees who were held in Thai immigration detention in February through May, as well as refugees who spoke with detainees held there through August, said that Thai authorities allow Vietnamese police to visit detainees. With the involvement of Thai officials, they have repeatedly sought to convince or compel detainees to sign documents agreeing to return to Vietnam, which detainees have refused. And in March 2024, several Montagnards said Vietnamese police visited their community near Bangkok accompanied by Thai police, pressured them to return to Vietnam, and questioned them about other Montagnards who they said were wanted for arrest in Vietnam.

Several Montagnards described their interactions with Vietnamese police in detention or during check ins. “First they say they’ll be more lenient if you agree to return,” one said. “Of course we don’t believe them. They have been harassing our community for a long time.” Another said a Vietnamese police officer pulled him aside from the others when he had his monthly check-in with Thai immigration officials: “‘You’ve been here [in Thailand] for a long time, and still not been resettled to the United States. When are you ever going to get to go?’ They said, ‘If you stay here and the government here makes problems for you, then you can call us, and we’ll help you.’ The meaning to me was a threat. They’ll tell the Thai police to arrest us.”

In April, Vietnamese police pulled aside some Montagnard men during their check-in sessions with Thai immigration authorities. “They took some of us aside and yelled at us,” said a Montagnard Christian. He said that the police officer threatened them: “All Montagnards here are terrorists. We’ll tell them [Thai police] that you’re terrorists, and if you worship together [in church], the Thai police are to arrest you.”

After the arrests of scores of Montagnards in February, immigration lawyers successfully posted bail for most detainees, but Thai authorities rejected bail for two of them, Y Phuong Enuol and Y Duong Bkrong, reportedly because of warrants for their arrest in Vietnam, said advocates familiar with their case. UN rights experts noted in their July letter to the Thai government that Vietnamese officials in March visited these detainees, who, the experts said, “have expressed a fear of persecution by the Vietnamese authorities.”

Separately, Thai authorities in February through April arrested over a dozen Hmong men registered as refugees with UNHCR. Family members and rights advocates said most were affiliated with the Hmong Human Rights Coalition, a civil society group that monitors and reports on human rights violations against Hmong people in Vietnam. Vietnamese officials visited these detainees on multiple occasions in late April and early May at the Suan Phlu immigration detention center. They encouraged detainees to voluntarily return to Vietnam and to sign forms to facilitate their repatriation. None agreed. Most of the men remain in detention as of November 2025.

Thai authorities have detained Giang A Au, a Hmong Christian pastor who fled Vietnam with his family 10 years ago, with his wife and daughters several times, including as recently as April. His son, Giang A Nanh, 25, told Human Rights Watch in August that his father called him from immigration detention in early May and told him that he had been visited by a Vietnamese official, who identified himself as “Mr. Hung,” who had the father’s Vietnamese passport and national ID card, confiscated by Thai authorities during his arrest.

Giang A Nanh said that Hung told his father: “You and your family have been in Thailand for nearly 10 years. Vietnam has changed a lot. The United States has also closed its doors to refugees. There is no place left for you to go. Now you must return to Vietnam.” Giang A Au refused, and Hung said: “Remember, you have children waiting for you outside. You also have relatives in Vietnam, we know them all.” Hung then said that even if Giang A Au obtained bail, Thai police would rearrest him and that he would not be able to work in Thailand. If he tried to work, Hung said, Thai police would arrest him again.

Human Rights Watch learned in November that Thai authorities in late September had arrested the son, Giang A Nanh, and sent him to a Thai jail. After a month, the authorities transferred him to Thai immigration detention, where he has been held with his father and mother along with other Vietnamese detainees. His younger sisters, 18 and 21, are now the only adult caregivers of his younger brothers, ages 11 and 14.

The wives of five other detained Hmong activists said that their husbands had told them by telephone in April through July that Vietnamese security officials had visited them in detention and attempted to compel them to sign papers agreeing to be repatriated to Vietnam. The men refused, aware that the government considers them to be dissidents who have broken the law.

Vietnam state-run media have repeatedly broadcast reports that Hmong dissidents who left Vietnam without permission and criticized the government were criminals. A June 2024 broadcast on the government ANTV State Security Television featured a report on some of the 13 Hmong men arrested in March 2025, including Ma Seo Chang, Ma A Dinh, and Ma A Sinh.

The report said they had “illegally emigrated” to Thailand and claimed that the men were “defaming the policies of the [Communist] Party and Vietnamese State, fabricating false accusations about democracy, human rights, or religious freedom is the way these expatriates make a living.” Ma A Dinh and Ma A Sinh, who later obtained bail, said that the government considers them and other Hmong men arrested in March “enemies of the state.” ANTV again focused on the three men in April 2025, just after their arrest in Thailand, and in July 2025, and mocked their views.

Another Hmong activist, Lu A Da, a coordinator with the Hmong Human Rights Coalition in Thailand who fled Vietnam in 2020, said that he also encountered Vietnamese authorities twice after he was arrested and placed in Thai immigration detention in December 2023. His arrest had occurred just two weeks after he had spoken virtually on a UN human rights panel addressing discrimination against Indigenous groups in Vietnam.

Lu A Da said a Vietnam police official visited him in detention and that the official’s attempts to pressure him suggested to him that the Vietnamese government had sought his arrest. The official attempted to convince him to return to Vietnam, saying he would quickly process paperwork before the upcoming Lunar New Year. Lu A Da said, “When I refused his offer, he threatened me, warning, ‘You may do whatever you want in Thailand, but think about your family in Vietnam,’ This was intended to intimidate me into stopping my human rights work.”

Immigration Detention as Possible Vietnamese Proxy Detention

Several refugees and immigration and human rights advocates in Bangkok expressed concern that the Vietnamese authorities effectively made use of Thailand’s immigration detention system to incarcerate and punish prominent Montagnard and Hmong exiles, as well as to exert pressure on them and their communities to return to Vietnam.

Some former detainees said that during visits to Thai detention, Vietnamese officials said that they had requested that Thai immigration authorities continue their detention until they agreed to return to Vietnam.

In at least one case, the Thai authorities rebuffed a Vietnamese government request after the UN intervened. Lu A Da, of the Hmong Human Rights Coalition in Thailand, said that Vietnamese authorities, after pressing him to return when he was in Thai detention in late 2023, were subsequently unable to have his detention extended, after the UN officials secured his release. The Vietnamese government then ramped up their public campaign against him and other Hmong exiles, labeling them criminals.",http://prachataienglish.com/sites/default/files/styles/super_cover_upload/public/files-super-cover/2025/2025-11/54889889535_9c9d08e8e8_k.jpg.webp?itok=YITPFM_p,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:42.188065

Steven Fazzari, the Bert A. and Jeanette L. Lynch Distinguished Professor of Economics, and Chris Varvares, the regional director for the Americas at the Economist Intelligence Unit and a WashU alumnus, were invited to discuss the impact of President Donald Trump’s economic policies.

The event, titled “High Stakes, Uncertain Gains: Trump’s Economic Experiment So Far,” was hosted by the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy. Both panelists invoked the Center’s late founder and namesake Murray Weidenbaum, a former WashU professor and economist who served in the Nixon and Reagan administrations.

“I think to a large extent, he would be appalled,” Fazzari said of Trump’s economic policies, adding that this year has seen the “most unusual” economic agenda of his lifetime.

Varvares identified some of the key areas of what he called a “smorgasbord” of economic policies pursued by the Trump administration, which included tariffs, immigration, industrial policy, energy production, and regulation reduction. He added that the administration’s proposed tariff rates would raise domestic prices and increase costs for Americans.

“It’s like a tax on consumers, because ultimately firms will pass [tariff costs] forward into final goods prices,” Varvares said. “And so it acts almost like a sales tax. It raises the cost to consumers.”

Both Varvares and Fazzari also attributed instability in the economy to the White House’s unpredictable announcements implementing and retracting various tariffs.

“The chaotic rollout of these tariffs has created a huge amount of uncertainty,” Varvares said.

Varvares said that the economic uncertainty produced by the administration is contributing to companies’ decreased investments and job offerings.

“If you drive into a fog bank, what’s the first thing you do? You slow down,” Varvares said. “And so that lack of visibility of exactly what was going to happen was anticipated to lead firms to pull back on investment, either scale back or delay decisions, but also to reduce hiring, not knowing exactly whether the demand was going to be there for their products.”

Varvares also criticized the White House for “strong-arming” private firms and foreign governments into increasing their investment in the United States.

“This is actually a type of governmental extortion where ‘If you want this lower tariff rate, you must invest in our country,’” Varvares said.

Varvarves did acknowledge the positive revenue effects of the tariffs, which he said could increase annual revenue for the federal government by as much as 300 billion dollars. He also said that while inflation had not increased as much as some expected after the tariff announcements, he still forecasted a bump in inflation in the next couple of financial quarters.

Fazzari said that a recession seemed likely earlier in the year after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, which the White House dubbed “Liberation Day.” He attributed the more modest economic damage so far to a lack of retaliation from other countries, with China being a notable exception, and the administration repeatedly cancelling its own tariffs after previous announcements.

“What [the tariffs] means in the long term could easily be that other countries say we really can’t rely on the United States, as we did before, and we should decouple our economy from the U.S.,” Fazzari said. “You see some of that already happening, but at least in the short term, we’ve seen less retaliation than we might have expected.”

Varvares pointed out that while one of the administration’s goals in implementing new tariffs has been to incentivize more domestic manufacturing, manufacturing jobs have decreased over the past few months. Fazzari said that advances in technology and automation will continue to reduce manufacturing jobs regardless of where products are produced.

While the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), previously spearheaded by Elon Musk, drew headlines earlier this year for its cuts to federal programs and jobs, Fazzari said that most of its efforts were “theater” that had little effect on the overall economy.

Both panelists also panned the administration’s interference in independent federal agencies. Varvares criticized Trump’s “jawboning” of the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and for threatening the independence of the Fed. Fazzari also expressed concern that Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after July jobs reports and revisions to previous reports indicated a weakening labor market.

“[McEntarfer was fired] for not any particular reason, except the president didn’t like the numbers,” Fazzari said. “That was controversial and upsetting to economists that really rely on good data coming out of these very professional institutions in the federal government that put together our data.”

Fazzari and Varvares both objected to the administration’s cuts to research and universities, saying that both are critical to producing new technologies that improve economic growth and productivity over time.

“It’s very disturbing in terms of the longer-run prospects to see the U.S. government cutting back on science and technology and hammering universities,” Fazzari said. “Universities are a source of a lot of the new ideas that find their way into new technologies and find their way into economic growth.”

Varvares added that the administration’s deportations and restrictive immigration practices would impede population growth and therefore slow future economic growth.

Fazzari noted that large investments in artificial intelligence have stimulated economic growth and financial markets, offsetting negative economic impacts from policies like tariffs.

“Without that, many analysts say the economy may well have been in a recession now, but we have this kind of offsetting effect that’s coming from the AI,” Fazzari said. “There’s, of course, a fear that’s a bubble. There’s a fear that that might all collapse and that we could have a problem.”

Despite their criticisms, both panelists emphasized the uncertainty around the future and that many of the administration’s economic policies will take time before we see their real effects.

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein on Sunday sharply criticized the tactics of federal immigration agents operating in Charlotte, saying masked officers in unmarked cars were racially profiling residents and targeting American citizens, undermining rather than enhancing public safety.

""We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling, and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks,"" Stein said.

The Guardian says the home secretary's plans to overhaul the asylum system have prompted ""significant unease"" among senior Labour aides and ministers, with at least one on ""resignation watch"". Party insiders have told the i Paper that the success - or otherwise - of the changes will determine whether or not Labour wins the next general election. The Times describes the plans as a ""significant escalation"" of government action against illegal immigration. But the Daily Mail claims that Labour backbenchers and left-wing lawyers are poised to defeat them.

The Sun's editorial also sounds a note of scepticism about the likely success of Shabana Mahmood's plans. It says they are ""doomed to failure unless she takes the only step that deep down she must know will end the crisis - quitting the flawed and outdated European Convention on Human Rights"". The Telegraph focuses on the government's plan to stop issuing UK visas to people from three African countries which refuse to take back failed asylum seekers. The paper says the bans mirror a policy introduced by Donald Trump, and could in the future be applied to Iran, Bangladesh, and Somalia.

There is still plenty of pre-Budget speculation. The Times claims a new tax will be levied on tourists, which will allow metropolitan mayors to raise hundreds of millions of pounds for local services. The Telegraph claims a tax on milkshakes is being lined up, to make the public healthier.

The Mirror says all plaques bearing the name of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor have been removed from the Falkland Islands. It says he was once hailed as hero there, but he has now been ""erased"" because of his links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The Times thinks there are signs that striking resident doctors in England are turning against their union, the BMA. It quotes a letter to hospital chiefs from the NHS chief executive, which says ""there have been fewer doctors striking"" in this walkout than in any of the 12 previous rounds of industrial action. The BMA has said striking is a last resort.

Public records hand Justice Department, FBI two black eyes

The Justice Department’s case against former FBI director James Comey hinges in large part on an assertion that Comey authorized someone “at the FBI” to engage with the media about the bureau’s investigation into Hillary Clinton. Lawfare’s Anna Bower dug through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act records, recently released in response to a 2018 FOIA lawsuit brought by The Daily Caller and posted in the FBI’s online FOIA library, “The Vault,” and discovered evidence that appears to undermine Justice’s case against Comey. The public records show that the person “at the FBI” — Daniel Richman — wasn’t a bureau employee during the communications cited by prosecutors.

Considering the possible implications for the Comey case, my big question is: How long will it take FBI director Kash Patel, who is already allegedly furious that his public flight schedules revealed he was abusing government property to visit his girlfriend and visit a place called “Boondoggle Ranch,” to try and take down politically inconvenient documents from The Vault?",https://media.freedom.press/media/images/26250149848_380687e3a3_b.original.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 00:57:02.426748

Enriquez’s organization, Little Village Community Council, saw its volunteer walking group which escorts children to school, grow from 13 to 32 students.
Federal agents visited his home and questioned family members.","CHICAGO -- Baltazar Enriquez starts most mornings with street patrols, leaving his home in Chicago’s Little Village on foot or by car to find immigration agents that have repeatedly targeted his largely Mexican neighborhood.

Wearing an orange whistle around his neck, the activist broadcasts his plans on Facebook.

“We don’t know if they’re going to come back. All we know is we’ve got to get ready,” he tells thousands of followers. “Give us any tips if you see any suspicious cars.”

Moments later, his phone buzzes.

As an unprecedented immigration crackdown enters a third month, a growing number of Chicago residents are fighting back against what they deem a racist and aggressive overreach of the federal government. The Democratic stronghold’s response has tapped established activists and everyday residents from wealthy suburbs to working class neighborhoods.

They say their efforts — community patrols, rapid responders, school escorts, vendor buyouts, honking horns and blowing whistles — are a uniquely Chicago response that other cities President Donald Trump has targeted for federal intervention want to model.

“The strategy here is to make us afraid. The response from Chicago is a bunch of obscenities and ‘no,’” said Anna Zolkowski Sobor, whose North Side neighborhood saw agents throw tear gas and tackle an elderly man. “We are all Chicagoans who deserve to be here. Leave us alone.”

Perhaps the clearest indicator of Chicago’s growing resistance is the sound of whistles.

Enriquez is credited with being among the first to introduce the concept. For months Little Village residents have used them to broadcast the persistent presence of immigration agents.

Furious blasts both warn and attract observers who record video or criticize agents. Arrests, often referred to as kidnappings because many agents cover their faces, draw increasingly agitated crowds. Immigration agents have responded aggressively.

Officers fatally shot one man during a traffic stop, while other agents use tear gas, rubber bullets and physical force. In early November, Chicago police were called to investigate shots fired at agents. No one was injured.

Activists say they discourage violence.

“We don’t have guns. All we have is a whistle,” Enriquez said. “That has become a method that has saved people from being kidnapped and unlawful arrest.”

By October, neighborhoods citywide were hosting so-called “Whistlemania” events to pack the brightly colored devices for distribution through businesses and free book hutches.

“They want that orange whistle,” said Gabe Gonzalez, an activist. “They want to nod to each other in the street and know they are part of this movement.”

Even with its 2.7 million people, Chicago residents like to say the nation’s third-largest city operates as a collection of small towns with Midwest sensibilities.

People generally know their neighbors and offer help. Word spreads quickly.

When immigration agents began targeting food vendors, Rick Rosales, enlisted his bicycle advocacy group Cycling x Solidarity. He hosted rides to visit street vendors, buying out their inventory to lower their risk while supporting their business.

Irais Sosa, co-founder of the apparel store Sin Titulo, started a neighbor program with grocery runs and rideshare gift cards for families afraid of venturing out.

“That neighborhood feel and support is part of the core of Chicago,” she said.

Enriquez’s organization, Little Village Community Council, saw its volunteer walking group which escorts children to school, grow from 13 to 32 students.

Many also credit the grassroots nature of the resistance to Chicago's long history of community and union organizing.

Trump's “border czar” Tom Homan said Chicago area residents were so familiar with their rights that making arrests during a different operation this year was difficult.

So when hundreds of federal agents arrived in September, activists poured energy into an emergency hotline that dispatches response teams to gather intel, including names of those detained. Volunteers would also circulate videos online, warn of reoccurring license plates or follow agents' cars while honking horns.

Protests have also cropped up quickly. Recently, high school students have launched walkouts.

Delilah Hernandez, 16, was among dozens from Farragut Career Academy who protested on a school day.She held a sign with the Constitution's preamble as she walked in Little Village. She knows many people with detained relatives.

“There is so much going on,” she said. “You feel it.”

More than 3,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws have been arrested during the so-called “ Operation Midway Blitz.” Dozens of U.S. citizens and protesters have been arrested with charges ranging from resisting arrest to conspiring to impede an officer.

The Department of Homeland Security defends the operation, alleging officers face hostile crowds as they pursue violent criminals.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who’s brought controversial tactics from operations in Los Angeles, called Chicago a “very non permissive environment.” He blamed sanctuary protections and elected leaders and defended agents’ actions, which are the subject of lawsuits.

But the operation's intensity could subside soon.

Bovino told The Associated Press this month that U.S. Customs and Border Protection will target other cities. He didn't elaborate, but Homeland Security officials confirmed Saturday that an immigration enforcement surge had begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

DHS, which oversees CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has said operations won't end in Chicago.

Alonso Zaragoza, with a neighborhood organization in the heavily immigrant Belmont Cragin, has printed hundreds of “No ICE” posters for businesses. Organizers in Oregon and Missouri have asked for advice.

“It’s become a model for other cities,” Zaragoza said. “We’re building leaders in our community who are teaching others.”

The turnout for virtual know-your-rights trainings offered by the pro-democracy group, States at the Core, doubled from 500 to 1,000 over a recent month, drawing participants from New Jersey and Tennessee.

“We train and we let go, and the people of Chicago are the ones who run with it,” said organizer Jill Garvey.

Enriquez completes up to three patrol shifts daily. Beyond the physical exertion, the work takes a toll.

Federal agents visited his home and questioned family members. A U.S. citizen relative was handcuffed by agents. His car horn no longer works, which he attributes to overuse.

“This has been very traumatizing,” he said. “It is very scary because you will remember this for the rest of your life.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/be83d873-9bdc-4037-8614-ae28334d13bc/wirestory_df72b2ba4e57befc085d692d227363b8_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:39.156637

Britain will overhaul its approach to human rights laws to make it easier to deport migrants who arrive in the country illegally as part of a major shake-up of asylum policy to be set out on Monday.

Interior minister Shabana Mahmood will outline changes to how the European Convention on Human Rights will be interpreted by courts, the government said.

""These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here,"" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.

In what the government claims to be the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

Britain's Labour government is taking a tougher stance as it struggles to curb clandestine migration, particularly via small boat crossings. Polls indicate immigration is a top concern of voters, and the populist Reform UK party has a commanding lead in polls.

TOUGHER STANCE

The government said Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a family life, was being misused by migrants to delay their removal from Britain.

It wants new laws to make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from ""using dubious connections to stay in the UK"".

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the ""definition of 'inhuman and degrading treatment' has expanded beyond what is reasonable.""

The government has said it wants to remain in the European Convention on Human Rights, amid calls from Reform and some in the Conservative Party for Britain to leave it altogether.

However, the government's harder stance on immigration has been criticised by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

""These proposals will punish people who've already lost everything,"" said Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture. ""Stripping away protections that prevent people being sent back to their torturers is not who we are as a country.""

Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said Britain was a ""fair, tolerant and compassionate country,"" but that in a more volatile world ""people need to know our borders are secure.""

The government added that there would also be reforms to streamline the appeals system, to fast-track the deportation of criminals and to prevent against misuse of modern slavery laws to impede removals.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:41.821972

On Monday, Mahmood will announce controversial new laws to overhaul refugee status, which must be reassessed every two years, as well as curbing asylum appeals and toughening the approach to rights to family life.

The home secretary warned in an article for the Guardian that anger about illegal migration could turn on second-generation immigrants such as her and rupture community relations.

“I know that a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me,” she said.

But the Guardian understands the harshness of Mahmood’s plans has led to significant unease among senior Labour aides and ministers, with at least one on resignation watch. Two said they were particularly concerned about the plans to ramp up deportations of refugee families, including those with children.

Charities warned it would risk “another Windrush scandal” and leave refugees in near-permanent limbo, with children liable to be unrooted from schools and adults unable to build careers, and make integration harder.

The home secretary will announce three new safe routes for refugees to legally come to the UK from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Eritrea, but even the status of those refugees will be under constant review.

Mahmood confirmed on Sunday that refugees would be liable to be returned if their country was no longer deemed dangerous, with their status reviewed every 30 months, including families with young children in school.

The government will announce that it will legislate to toughen how courts apply the European convention on human rights (ECHR) regarding family life, enabling more deportation of people with family members still in the UK.

On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.

The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.

In her article for the Guardian, Mahmood said she knew the changes would “face opposition” but said the alternative would risk public support for all refugees collapsing.

“Dark forces are stirring up anger in this country, and seeking to turn that anger into hate. We must take the opportunity we have to stop that from happening. And I know we can,” she wrote.

“The true nature of this country is openness, tolerance and generosity. We want to provide sanctuary to those in danger. We want to be a Greater Britain, not a littler England. To do so, we must restore order and control.”

Mahmood will announce three “modest” routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan, Palestine or Eritrea to come if they are students and those seeking to work in certain professions, as well as those sponsored by community and voluntary organisations who support them when they arrive. Refugees arriving via those routes will not be given permanent settled status.

Other key measures to be announced on Monday include:

Restricting asylum seekers to one single appeal rather than different appeals on multiple grounds.

Creating a new body for fast-tracking cases for dangerous criminals and those with little hope of success.

Legislating to restrict last-minute modern slavery claims

Joining other countries in seeking reform of ECHR article 3 rights, to more narrowly define the risk of torture and degrading treatment.

Changing the Home Office’s duty to provide support to asylum seekers to a discretionary power, enabling them to potentially be removed from accommodation.

Several senior aides are understood to have severe reservations about how that would affect school-age children and MPs are understood to be particularly concerned about Ukrainian refugees, many of whom brought young children who have now fully integrated into British life.

“These sweeping changes will mean that a child who is settled at school, studying hard for their GCSEs, will be uprooted and forcibly removed, possibly being put in detention as part of that process,” the Refugee Council’s Enver Solomon said, likening it to how long-settled people were treated under the Windrush scandal.

Mahmood is also understood to be seeking to legislate to change the way the ECHR is interpreted by UK judges. Asylum seekers often use its provisions on right to family life in order to stay in the UK.

The effect of the changes could mean many more people are deported from the UK even if they have young children living here. Judges will be required to prioritise “public safety” over family rights. A Home Office source suggested this would be more likely to apply to extended family.

On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.

The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.

Mahmood is to warn concerned Labour MPs that the changes are necessary to address public concern about the levels of migration as well as counterattacks from Reform UK.

“Unless we act, we risk losing popular consent for having an asylum system at all. In a country that is seeing division stirred up on our streets, we will not bring unity unless we restore order to our borders,” she wrote in the Guardian.

“My goal is to ensure there are legal routes into this country for those who are truly fleeing peril, and for whom this is the first safe country they have encountered.”

The Home Office has briefed widely that Mahmood has been inspired by the Danish system, which has much tighter rules on family reunions as well as on refugee status.

Mahmood’s predecessor, Yvette Cooper, temporarily suspended new applications in September from a family reunion route that allowed those granted asylum in the UK to bring their family.

Home Office sources have suggested the asylum changes will have far wider effects than anything brought in by the Conservatives.

Almost 40,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats to claim asylum in the UK so far this year and the number of asylum applications in the UK is at a record high. Government figures show 111,084 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to June 2025.

Both the Conservatives and Reform UK have said they would leave the ECHR in order to undertake more severe measures to cut migration. Mahmood has said she will not leave the ECHR, but there are likely to be significant legal challenges to what she is proposing on Monday.

The Conservatives have suggested the party could support the plans brought forward by Mahmood if she faces a rebellion from Labour backbenchers.

But the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, criticised the plans as “very small steps in the right direction with a few gimmicks”.

He told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme: “We want no illegal immigration whatsoever. We need to have a cap on legal inward migration each year, so the numbers are very, very dramatically lower.”

Several loyalist MPs told the Guardian they were deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of disrupting the lives of settled refugee families if their countries became safer to return to. At least one minister is understood to have severe reservations.

The Labour MP Tony Vaughan urged the government to “think again” on the changes. “The prime minister said in September that we are at a fork in the road. These asylum proposals suggest we have taken the wrong turning,” he posted on X.

“The idea that recognised refugees need to be deported is wrong. The rhetoric around these reforms encourages the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

The Labour MP Stella Creasy wrote in the Guardian that leaving refugees in a state of “perpetual limbo” for 20 years was economically as well as morally damaging. “If we want to stop the boats we need to stop the BS when it comes to what is generating refugees or how to respond to them,” she said.

“If you can’t stabilise your status, you will always struggle to get a job, a bank account or a mortgage, making it more likely you will be dependent on state or voluntary support.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0306afc05b3889975ec0cccb99b6e3b7b91945a/556_190_3808_3046/master/3808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57c95e34d7dea960e716f67ac913f689",N,,2025-11-16 18:56:45.797224

Under sweeping reforms unveiled by the home secretary, the government will attempt to change the way the European Convention on Human Rights is interpreted by UK judges in a bid to stop asylum seekers using their rights to a family life to avoid deportation.

Home Office officials have claimed the ECHR “is allowing large numbers of people to stay in the UK, against the public’s wishes”, and that new legislation will allow Britain to ramp up the number of removals.

The radical measures are part of much-publicised reform of the asylum system, billed by the government as “the most sweeping reforms in modern times”, as Labour looks to see off the threat of Reform UK and Nigel Farage.

But critics have hit out at the proposals, warning any move to alter how the UK interprets the rules will drive asylum seekers underground and leave them vulnerable to exploitation.

Sile Reynolds, the head of asylum advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the changes “will punish people who’ve already lost everything”, adding: “Either we all have human rights, or none of us do.”

The measures could also spark discontent on the backbenches, with one Labour MP accusing the party leadership of “chasing Reform”. They told The Independent: “The dehumanisation of people in desperation is the antithesis of what the Labour Party is about.”

Announcing the changes, Sir Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said they will “block endless appeals” and “stop last minute claims”.

He said: “Britain has always been a fair, tolerant and compassionate country – and this government will always defend those values.

“But, in a more volatile world, people need to know our borders are secure and rules are enforced.

“These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here.”

Shabana Mahmood will set out plans to rewrite how Britain grants refuge to those fleeing conflict and upheaval on Monday, drawing heavily on ideas used in Denmark, where Home Office officials were dispatched last month to study its border control and asylum policies.

Under the proposed changes, ministers want to bring forward a Bill to change how Article 8 of the ECHR – the right to a family life – is interpreted by judges in migrant court cases a bid to stop migrants “gaming the system” and to “rebalance public interest tests in favour of the British people’s expectations”.

The home secretary also wants to tighten up rules on family connections so that only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay in future.

Rules will also be updated to change modern slavery laws, which officials claim are being abused by “bogus” claims, while the appeals process will be updated to restrict illegal migrants to a single route of appeal to stop them “chancing their arm with challenge after challenge”.

The UK will also be working on further reform around Article 3, which relates to the prohibition of torture. Officials have claimed the definition of inhuman and degrading treatment “has expanded too far”, citing cases where serious criminals have remained in the UK after claims their healthcare needs could not be met in their homeland.

Ms Mahmood teased the changes on Sunday, telling Sky News that ministers want to “constrain in legislation the way that that is applied in immigration cases”, when it comes to Article 8.

She said it is the “right thing to do, because we've seen an expansion of the way that that right is applied in a way that is designed to frustrate the removal of those that, under our immigration rules, would not have the right to be in this country”.

But the Refugee Council, a charity advocating on behalf of refugees, warned that watering down these laws risks chaos and will drive desperate people underground, leaving them prone to exploitation.

Following the home secretary’s comments on Sunday morning, Enver Solomon, the charity’s chief executive said: “After the horrors of the Second World War, Britain helped draft the European Convention on Human Rights as part of our collective vow of ‘never again’. Its purpose was to protect all of us from atrocities and ensure people who come to our country seeking safety get a fair chance to apply for asylum.”

He described the UK’s legal system as “the difference between life and death for many” and added: “The government has a choice to make: we can build a fair and compassionate asylum system that determines who qualifies for protection and who does not. Or we can water down laws that protect us all and risk chaos: desperate people would still arrive on our shores, but be driven underground and left vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.”

Ms Reynolds accused political parties of being in a “race to the bottom – trying to outdo one another in cruelty towards refugees”.

She said: “Every day we see the trauma of people who have survived torture in countries like Syria, Eritrea and Sudan for standing up for the same freedoms we cherish in Britain. Instead of offering safety, political parties are locked in a race to the bottom – trying to outdo one another in cruelty towards refugees.

“These proposals will punish people who’ve already lost everything, cutting them off from safety and hope. But either we all have human rights, or none of us do.

“Stripping away protections that prevent people being sent back to their torturers is not who we are as a country. This is a cynical attempt to scapegoat vulnerable people to win political points. We can and must do better.”

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has said it is “welcome that Shabana Mahmood is finally talking seriously about tackling illegal migration”, but added: “As we saw with Keir Starmer’s lamentable U-turn on modest welfare cuts, the prime minister always folds in the face of opposition from his left-wing backbenchers.

“If the home secretary actually wants to cut illegal immigration, she should take up my offer to sit down with her and work on a plan that will actually stop the boats, rather than a few weak changes that will meet the approval of Labour MPs.”

Other changes expected as part of the raft of measures are the removal of the automatic right to housing and financial support for asylum seekers, and changes to refugee status which will make it temporary and subject to review every two-and-a-half years. Those who arrive in the UK via means such as a small boat or lorry also face a 20-year wait to stay in the country permanently.

Jennifer McKiernanPolitical reporter

Plans to fast-track the deportations of illegal migrants as part of a sweeping reforms of the UK's asylum policy are to be announced by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.

In a statement to MPs on Monday she will outline plans to end multiple appeals against removal and for an overhaul of legislation on human rights law.

For those granted asylum they will only be given it on a temporary basis and will be returned home if their country is at any time deemed safe. They will have to wait 20 years to apply to settle permanently.

Mahmood is also warn the UK will stop granting visas to people from three African countries if their governments do not improve co-operation on removals of illegal migrants.

Mahmood told the BBC on Sunday: ""This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.""

Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said he would go further and deport failed asylum seekers ""within a week"".

The plans have prompted criticism from some Labour MPs, including Rachael Maskell, who said the government was going in ""completely the wrong direction"" on immigration.

The government wants to reduce the number of people arriving to the UK on small boats and the reforms aim to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals as well as make it more difficult for successful asylum seekers to remain.

Under the plans people will be restricted to arguing their grounds for appeal within a single appeal and if a case fails, they will be deported.

The government will follow the Danish model of creating an independent body to fast-track the deportation of foreign criminals and cases with little prospect of success through the appeals system.

As part of the reforms, Mahmood wants to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied in migration court cases.

Only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

The UK will join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

The government believes this has been used to support unreasonable claims, including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their healthcare needs cannot be met.

Similarly, the Home Office said the Modern Slavery Act will be tightened up to prevent last-minute claims to block removal.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the reforms would stop ""endless appeals"" to increase the removals of ""those with no right to be here"".

Mahmood said the reforms recognised the ""pace and scale"" of immigration had destabilised and divided communities and would allow the government to ramp up the removal of those with no right to be in Britain.

She continued: ""To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.""

Earlier the home secretary told the BBC she would create new safe and legal routes for refugees through work and study routes.

Under the new measures there will be tighter restrictions placed on successful asylum seekers, who will have their case reviewed every two and a half years and if their home country is considered safe they will be returned.

A refugee will have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

They will not be able to bring family members to join them unless they are immediate relatives, including parents and children, while housing and weekly allowances will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

'Years of limbo'

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.

The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year.

There has also been criticism of the proposed reforms from within Labour, with Maskell saying lots of her fellow MPs were ""really concerned"".

She said it was important to have a robust human rights framework and described ""reordering our relationship with the ECHR"" as a ""step too far"".

Reform leader Nigel Farage said the home secretary ""sounds like a Reform supporter"".

""It's a shame that the Human Rights Act, ECHR and her own backbenchers mean that this will never happen,"" he added.

Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson said the government should ""focus on processing claims quickly, getting them right first time, and swiftly deporting people with no right to be here"".

Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said rather than deter migrants, the 20-year time frame would ""leave people in limbo and in tense anxiety for many, many years"".

As first reported in the Times, the threat of the visa ban for Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo comes after thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from the three nations were said to be in the UK.

A Home Office source said the countries were being targeted ""for their unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive returns processes"".

Both have been blamed for hindering Britain’s ability to remove illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers.
Even in her constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, one of the most diverse areas of the country, Mahmood said that migration was causing problems.
“I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country … I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.” Mahmood added: “What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system.
A plan to convert the Crowborough camp into accommodation for asylum seekers was rejected by the last Tory government due to safeguarding concerns.","Under the present system, introduced by the last Labour government in 2005, refugees can apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after five years, providing access to benefits and public funds and a route to citizenship.

The new 20-year qualifying period will apply to those who arrive illegally, such as in small boats or in lorries, and claim asylum, or those who overstay their visas and then claim. It will be the longest route to settlement in Europe; Denmark is second, with an eight-year pathway.

The changes, hailed as the largest overhaul since the Second World War, will apply only to new arrivals.

In the year to June, a total of 111,000 people claimed asylum in the UK. In the year ending March, 172,798 people were granted ILR under the process.

There will be some mitigations for skilled refugees, enabling them to truncate the 20-year qualification period by going into “specific” work or study routes. “It will be essentially a system whereby the more you contribute, you can bring forward that [20-year] period,” Mahmood said.

A ten-year pathway will also be created for those who arrive in the UK legally, under new specific refugee settlement routes to be announced by Mahmood on Thursday.

The plans are modelled on reforms in Denmark, which has reduced the number of asylum applications to a 40-year low, with 95 per cent of applicants rejected.

Mahmood will also revoke the statutory duty to provide support for asylum seekers. The government intends to use legislation to repeal a European Union directive that underpins the requirement.

‘We want them to work’

Housing and weekly allowances will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to. Those who break the law will also face having their support withdrawn.

Mahmood said: “Before that directive, we actually had a much more discretionary power that we could use, where we could make our own decision about whether we are going to offer someone asylum support or not. The reason we’re doing that [reverting to the previous powers] is that there are some people who currently receive asylum support who can work, who have the right to work, and we want them to work.”

She will also announce reforms to the application of key elements of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), including article 8, the right to a family life. She is expected to raise the need for international reform of article 3, covering torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. Both have been blamed for hindering Britain’s ability to remove illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers.

‘Our fundamental nature is generous’

The home secretary believes the changes are necessary to address voters’ sense of unfairness when asylum seekers are treated more generously than economic migrants who arrive on visas, despite the fact that the latter group must meet strict financial and integration requirements.

Even in her constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, one of the most diverse areas of the country, Mahmood said that migration was causing problems. “I think that people rightly feel that the pace and the scale of what we’ve seen is out of control. It’s putting a huge amount of pressure on communities,” she said. “My patch is 70 per cent non-white, but immigration is something that’s causing just as much concern here as it does all across other parts of the country.

“I think our fundamental nature as a people is that we are open, tolerant and generous,” she said, but the “precondition of unlocking the full extent of that openness is order and control”.

President Trump told GB News on Friday that Sir Keir Starmer “better do something on immigration”, describing some of those who arrived on small boats as “bad people” and warning: “If you don’t get them out, you’re not going to have a country left”.

Mahmood argued that the changes would make it both easier to remove illegal immigrants already in Britain and deter those considering crossing the Channel in small boats. “I can see a system that is out of control, I can see a system that is unfair and I can see a system that’s putting huge pressure on communities, including my own,” she said.

‘It’s designed to say: Do not get on a boat’

Her reforms would seek to “change the assumptions” about what it means to be a refugee, while also changing the “calculus and the thinking” of those people who are risking their lives on small boats by reducing the so-called pull factors that are drawing illegal immigrants.

This will include ending the “automatic path” to settled status after a refugee has been in Britain for five years. That will rise to 20 years and will have certain conditions attached, such as having no criminal record.

“That is designed to essentially say to people: do not come to this country as an illegal migrant, do not get on a boat,” she said. “I think it’s important that we send a very clear signal to those people who are currently trekking across multiple safe countries across Europe looking to get on a boat in the north of France: this is not a journey worth making.”

President Macron of France has called on the UK to address the pull factors behind small-boat crossings. Germany is already committed to working with the UK on the issue and Mahmood is understood to be in “embryonic talks” with Belgium and the Netherlands.

Mahmood, the eldest daughter of immigrants from the Pakistani side of Kashmir and a devout Muslim, said that she knew the reforms would be a hard sell to some in her party, who are concerned that Labour is trying to mimic Conservative and Reform policies.

Some Labour MPs on the left have branded the reforms as “racist”, including Nadia Whittome, the member for Nottingham East, who accused the government of pursuing the “policies of the far right”.

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, called the plans “harsh and unnecessary”, arguing they “won’t deter people who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars”.

Mahmood said she rejected “entirely” suggestions that her policy change was racist, pointing out that her parents came to the UK legally in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

“This is a moral mission for me,” she told Sky News on Sunday. “I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country … I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.”

Mahmood added: “What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system. It’s not right-wing talking points or fake news or misinformation that is suggesting that we’ve got a problem..”

She said that the Home Office would “bring order and control back” into the asylum system while also creating new safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to enter the UK.

The government announced last month that two army barracks, one in East Sussex and one in Scotland, would be used to house asylum seekers from December, as ministers seek to end the use of hotels within a year.

This month, a leaked Home Office document suggested that the government had identified at least 14 sites that could host up to 10,000 migrants.

On Sunday, about 2,000 people marched through the streets of Crowborough, East Sussex, to protest against plans to house 600 lone male asylum seekers in a nearby army camp.

The Crowborough site and Cameron Barracks in Inverness are the only two to have been publicly announced so far.

A plan to convert the Crowborough camp into accommodation for asylum seekers was rejected by the last Tory government due to safeguarding concerns.

Mahmood is seen as a rising star and has hinted that she may harbour leadership ambitions. Last week, Mahmood, who is one of Starmer’s closest allies, pledged her support to the prime minister and chancellor, adding: “I know that they will put the best interest of the whole country absolutely first and foremost as they make the difficult choices that are needed to get the budget to balance.”

However, she will know that if they fail, she could soon be in a new job and it will be her facing all the difficult choices — and not just how to stop the boats.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fe2ca745c-962c-4a02-9b0c-35bbf0b16603.jpg?crop=4236%2C2383%2C1374%2C492&resize=1200,N,,2025-11-16 20:56:55.091827

The U.S. Border Patrol found the vessel in the surf off Imperial Beach late Friday night. Six people were found on the beach just before midnight, one of whom was pronounced dead and another who was rescued after being found under the boat.

About two hours later, authorities received a report of someone in the water near Imperial Beach Pier. A Coast Guard crew responded and found three people in the ocean, all dead.

The Coast Guard said Saturday that it was continuing to search for others who may have been on board.

Several of the survivors claimed Mexican nationality, while others remained unidentified, the agency said. One person was turned over to the Department of Homeland Security.

“Our crews and partner agencies responded immediately, but this case demonstrates the severe risks posed to aliens attempting to enter the United States by sea in unstable vessels,” said Coast Guard Capt. Robert Tucker, Sector San Diego commander.

A strong storm system hit Southern California over the weekend, prompting warnings of flash flooding and mudslides. The vessel was a panga — single- or twin-engine open fishing boat that is also commonly used by smugglers.

Migrants are increasingly turning to the risky alternative offered by smugglers to travel by sea to avoid heavily guarded land borders, including off California’s coast. Pangas leave Mexico in the dead of night and sometimes chart hundreds of miles (kilometers) north.

There have been several incidents in recent years of migrant vessels capsizing en route to California.

In May, at least three people died when a panga flipped off the coast about 35 miles (56 km) north of the U.S.-Mexico border.

In 2023, eight people were killed when two migrant smuggling boats approached a San Diego beach in heavy fog and one of them capsized in the surf. It was one of the deadliest maritime smuggling incidents in waters off the U.S. coast.

A federal judge sentenced a San Diego man to 18 years in prison in 2022 for piloting a small vessel overloaded with 32 migrants that smashed apart in powerful surf off the coast, killing three people and injuring more than two dozen.

Conclusion Massey v. Computershare reinforces a fundamental rule of federal adjudication: final judgments are final.","Introduction

In Massey v. Computershare Limited (Nos. 24-1095 & 24-1445), decided November 13, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed a District of Colorado judgment dismissing pro se plaintiff James Harrison Massey’s tort claims as barred by res judicata, upheld an award of $85,624.33 in attorney’s fees, and sustained tailored filing restrictions against further pro se litigation related to the same controversy. The court also denied Massey’s motions to file an overlength amended opening brief to introduce new evidence and expressly deemed the appeals frivolous.

The litigation traces to a lost cashier’s check that Massey alleges he sent to pay off a home equity line of credit (HELOC) serviced by Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC (SLS), affiliated with Computershare. Following SLS’s request that he stop payment and reissue funds (with assurances to honor the original payoff quote and reimburse associated costs), Massey refused, defaulted, and then embarked on serial litigation. A first federal suit in the Western District of Kentucky (Massey I) ended in dismissal; he did not appeal. He later filed anew in Colorado (Massey II) against SLS, Computershare entities, and Bank of America asserting substantially the same claims. The district court dismissed on claim-preclusion grounds, denied his collateral attack on the Kentucky judgment, awarded fees, and imposed pre-filing restrictions.

On appeal, Massey’s central theory was not a direct challenge to the Colorado court’s res judicata analysis, but a collateral attack: he argued the Kentucky judgment was void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (and related Uniform Commercial Code contentions), which, in his view, would also void the Colorado judgment, the fees, and the filing injunction. The Tenth Circuit rejected that strategy and reinforced bedrock preclusion and finality principles.

Summary of the Opinion

Affirmed: The Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal based on res judicata (claim preclusion) was proper. Massey’s claims in Colorado arose from the same nucleus of operative facts as his earlier Kentucky case, Massey I.

Affirmed: The district court correctly refused to declare the Kentucky judgment void; federal courts may not entertain collateral attacks on final federal judgments’ subject-matter jurisdiction.

Affirmed: The award of $85,624.33 in attorney’s fees and the imposition of targeted pre-filing restrictions comported with applicable standards; Massey did not advance specific, meritorious challenges to those rulings.

Denied: Motions to file an overlength amended opening brief to add “new” extra-record evidence were denied because appellate review is confined to the district court record and the evidence was immaterial to the dispositive issues.

Frivolousness: The court held the appeals were frivolous because the issues were obvious and the arguments wholly without merit. It warned that continued frivolous filings may trigger sanctions or appellate filing restrictions.

Notably, the panel emphasized that even challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be raised collaterally after a judgment has become final on direct review; they must be raised on direct appeal in the original case (here, in the Sixth Circuit). The order and judgment is nonprecedential, except under law-of-the-case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, but may be cited for persuasive value under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.

Analysis

Precedents Cited and Their Influence

The court anchored its disposition in longstanding Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit authority on finality, preclusion, and vexatious litigation controls:

Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bailey and Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank: These cases establish that a federal court’s determination of its jurisdiction, while reviewable directly, is not open to collateral attack later. Once final, a judgment is res judicata even if the court arguably lacked jurisdiction.

Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee: Principles of res judicata apply to jurisdictional determinations. Parties who had an opportunity to litigate subject-matter jurisdiction cannot reopen it collaterally.

Kontrick v. Ryan (footnote): Reinforces the prohibition on collateral attacks even when the attack concerns subject-matter jurisdiction.

Campbell v. City of Spencer; Thomas v. Kaven; Day v. Moscow: Together set the standards for de novo review of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals and confirm that res judicata can be resolved on a motion to dismiss when the defense is apparent from the record.

Malloy v. Monahan: Attorney’s fee awards are reviewed for abuse of discretion, with legal predicates reviewed de novo.

Tripati v. Beaman: The right to access courts is not absolute; courts may impose reasonable filing restrictions on abusive litigants, provided due process and narrow tailoring.

Committee on Conduct of Attorneys v. Oliver; Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux & Janer: Courts may relax pleading standards for pro se filings, but not for practicing lawyers; all litigants must follow the rules, and abusive filings are unacceptable. The panel opted to construe Massey’s papers liberally while insisting on proper procedure.

Regan‑Touhy v. Walgreen Co.; Singleton v. Wulff: Appellate review is confined to the record below; new issues or evidence may be entertained only in rare, compelling circumstances not present here.

Sawyers v. Norton; Braley v. Campbell: Arguments inadequately developed in the opening brief are waived; an appeal is frivolous when the result is obvious or the arguments wholly without merit.

These authorities directly shaped the court’s rejection of Massey’s collateral attack on the Kentucky judgment, its affirmance of dismissal on claim-preclusion grounds, and its endorsement of sanctions and filing controls in the face of repetitive litigation.

Legal Reasoning

Claim Preclusion Applied to Massey II:

The Colorado action arose from the same transactions underlying Massey I—namely, the alleged mailing and loss of a payoff cashier’s check and the resulting default and dispute over the HELOC. The district court dismissed claims tied to pre–May 12, 2020 facts with prejudice and later dismissed the repleaded Second Amended Complaint with prejudice, finding no meaningful differentiation from Massey I beyond references to later monthly statements.

On appeal, Massey did not attack the elements of res judicata. Instead, he argued that Massey I was void, which, if accepted, would undermine preclusion. But because that argument is a prohibited collateral attack on a final federal judgment, the claim-preclusion dismissal stands.

No Collateral Attack on Subject‑Matter Jurisdiction:

Massey contended the Kentucky court lacked diversity jurisdiction and that UCC principles extinguished his HELOC obligation when SLS allegedly received the check, rendering the case moot. The panel held it had no authority to entertain a collateral attack on the Kentucky court’s jurisdictional determination. Such challenges must be made by direct appeal in the rendering circuit (the Sixth Circuit), which Massey did not pursue in Massey I. Therefore, neither the Colorado district court nor the Tenth Circuit could declare the Kentucky judgment void.

The court noted that “rare” exceptions permitting collateral challenges to jurisdiction were neither raised nor applicable.

Vacatur Denied; Jurisdictional Arguments Were Conclusory:

The district court rejected Massey’s effort to vacate both the Kentucky judgment and the Colorado dismissal order. With respect to the Colorado case, the court observed that Massey himself invoked diversity jurisdiction and that his contrary assertions were conclusory. The Tenth Circuit affirmed.

Attorney’s Fees and Filing Restrictions Upheld:

Applying an abuse-of-discretion standard (with de novo review of the legal basis), the court affirmed the fee award and filing restrictions. Massey offered no targeted, meritorious arguments against these rulings. The injunction narrowly requires leave of court before any new pro se action in the District of Colorado against SLS or Computershare defendants on the same subject matter, and before additional post-judgment filings in the case—well within Tripati’s framework.

No Expansion of the Record on Appeal:

The panel denied motions to file an overlength amended opening brief to add a post-judgment bank “notarized statement” concerning the cashier’s check. Appellate review is generally limited to the district-court record, and the proffered document was immaterial to the dispositive ground of affirmance (the foreclosure of collateral attacks and the independent res judicata ruling).

Frivolous Appeals and Warning:

The court declared the appeals frivolous because Massey did not meaningfully challenge the dispositive rulings and his arguments were wholly without merit. It cautioned that continued frivolous filings may prompt sanctions or pre-filing restrictions at the appellate level.

The court also rejected as inadequately developed Massey’s accusations of judicial misconduct and corruption, reiterating that liberal pleading rules are not a license for abusive filings or ad hominem attacks on the trial judge.

Impact and Prospective Significance

Although issued as a nonprecedential order and judgment, the opinion has substantial persuasive value in several areas:

Finality of Federal Judgments: The decision robustly reaffirms that once a federal judgment becomes final on direct review, parties cannot collaterally contest the issuing court’s subject-matter jurisdiction in a subsequent case. This constrains forum-shopping and serial litigation designed to circumvent adverse outcomes.

Cross‑Circuit Preclusion: A judgment entered in one federal circuit (here, the Sixth Circuit’s district court) precludes relitigation in another (the Tenth Circuit) where the claims arise from the same operative facts, underscoring nationwide respect for federal judgments.

Vexatious-Litigant Controls: The affirmance of tailored filing restrictions and fees sends a clear signal that district courts may, and should, deploy these tools to protect judicial resources and defendants from repetitive, meritless suits, provided the restrictions are narrow and procedurally proper.

Appellate Practice Discipline: The denial of leave to append extra-record materials and exceed word limits highlights the strictures of appellate review: parties must fully develop their record and arguments below, and extraordinary circumstances are required to deviate from that principle.

Pro Se Treatment for Former Attorneys: The court’s choice to liberally construe filings from a formerly licensed attorney, while emphasizing adherence to procedural rules and civility, offers practical guidance on calibrating pro se leniency without enabling abuse.

For litigants and counsel, the case is a cautionary tale: challenges to jurisdiction must be timely raised in the original case via direct appeal; efforts to relitigate by collateral attack will fail and risk fee-shifting and filing injunctions.

Complex Concepts Simplified

Res judicata (Claim Preclusion): If you sue and lose, you generally cannot sue again later over the same set of facts against the same parties (or their privies), even if you present new legal theories. Final judgments close the door to re-litigating the same dispute.

Collateral Attack on a Judgment: Trying to invalidate a final judgment in a new lawsuit instead of by appealing in the original case. Federal courts do not permit this, even when the target is the original court’s subject‑matter jurisdiction.

Subject‑Matter Jurisdiction: A court’s legal power to decide a type of case (e.g., diversity jurisdiction over disputes between citizens of different states with more than $75,000 in controversy). Jurisdictional issues must be raised on direct appeal; they cannot be re-litigated later in a different court after judgment is final.

Pre‑Filing Injunction: A court order requiring a litigant to obtain permission before filing new cases or documents, used to curb abusive or repetitive litigation. Such orders must be narrow and afford due process (notice and an opportunity to be heard).

Standards of Review: On appeal, dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) and res judicata are reviewed afresh (de novo). Fee awards and filing restrictions are reviewed for abuse of discretion, with underlying legal issues reviewed de novo.

Record on Appeal: The appellate court normally considers only what was presented to the district court. New evidence is rarely allowed and only in extraordinary, outcome‑critical circumstances, which were absent here.

Frivolous Appeal: An appeal is frivolous if the outcome is obvious or the arguments are wholly without merit. Frivolous appeals can trigger sanctions and filing restrictions.

Conclusion

Massey v. Computershare reinforces a fundamental rule of federal adjudication: final judgments are final. Parties cannot evade adverse judgments by re-filing in new forums and recasting arguments as jurisdictional defects; such collateral attacks are foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. The Tenth Circuit’s affirmance of claim preclusion, fees, and pre-filing restrictions, coupled with its refusal to expand the record and its declaration of frivolousness, collectively underscore the judiciary’s commitment to finality, efficiency, and civility.

Several church members doing yard work at a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting the church's pastor.

""We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,"" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.

Officials said there are ""a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters"".

The DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to ""sanctuary policies"".

Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a ""certified welcoming city"". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.

""President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,"" the DHS said.

Charlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to Data US.

DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing.

Earlier in the week, US Representative and Democrat, Alma Adams, said she was informed of the operation and was ""extremely concerned"" about Border Patrol and ICE agents coming to North Carolina.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The departure comes two months after DHS first secured the property to support “Operation Midway Blitz,” President Donald Trump’s escalated deportation campaign in the Chicago area.

At the time, the Sun-Times reported that the command center would provide office space, parking spots and portable laundry units to the federal agents. It has also functioned as a training and storage facility.

But this week, law enforcement sources told the Sun-Times that U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and many of his agents had left Chicago but could return next spring for an expanded operation.

The departure also comes after a clash between local law enforcement officers and protesters, including faith leaders, outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in Broadview led to 21 arrests.

On Saturday, federal officials confirmed that a surge of immigration enforcement in Charlotte, North Carolina’s largest city, had begun as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

“I do believe we need to act if we are to retain public consent for having an asylum system at all.” The Labour government’s proposed changes emulate a much tougher asylum policy put in place by Denmark.

Under the new rules, drafted by the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, people granted asylum status would have to wait 20 years, rather than the current five, before they can apply to settle permanently in Britain.

The government plans to review the status of these migrants more regularly, and if it determines at any point that their countries have become safe, they will be ordered to return home. Asylum seekers will also no longer be entitled to automatic aid, including housing and weekly allowances. Those who have a right to work in Britain will be expected to find jobs while their claims are being considered, something they are not allowed to do under the existing rules.

“Illegal migration is causing huge divides here in our own country,” Ms. Mahmood said in an interview Sunday with the BBC. “I do believe we need to act if we are to retain public consent for having an asylum system at all.”

The Labour government’s proposed changes emulate a much tougher asylum policy put in place by Denmark. The Danish system, devised like that in Britain by a center-left government, grants asylum seekers residence permits of only one or two years, with no guarantee of permanent residence. To gain permanent status, new arrivals must learn Danish and find work.

Since the rules were tightened, the number of people granted asylum in Denmark has plummeted, ending an influx of migrants, mainly from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other once war-torn countries.

Denmark’s policies have been criticized by human rights groups and challenged by the European Court of Human Rights. Its system has nevertheless become a model for other European governments, which are struggling with what many citizens view as uncontrolled immigration. Britain’s home office, which polices borders, said it had sent a delegation to Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital, last summer to examine the Danish system.

But the British government’s proposals got a mixed reaction at home, where immigration has again become a salient issue in the years since Britain left the European Union. The government said that, since coming into power in July 2024, it had deported 50,000 people who had entered Britain illegally.

Nigel Farage, the leader of the anti-immigrant party Reform U.K., had rare praise for Ms. Mahmood’s tough tone. But he said the new policies would have little effect if, as he predicted, British judges and the European Court of Human Rights uphold legal challenges to deportation orders. Reform has used its anti-immigrant appeal to establish a double-digit lead over Labour in the polls.

“Labour won’t stop the boats,” Mr. Farage posted on social media on Friday, as word of the plans began leaking out.

For the government, the new proposals underscore how swiftly the political landscape has changed. Prime Minister Keir Starmer once cast the flow of asylum seekers as primarily a law enforcement problem, vowing to break up the gangs that traffic people across the English Channel from France.

Now, though, the government is pledging to overhaul the asylum system, which handles those who land on its shores, arguing that it has turned the country into a magnet for people.

The home office said that from 2021 to 2025, asylum claims dropped across much of Europe but increased in Britain. Yet Britain continues to receive fewer claims than its European counterparts: 109,343 in the year ending in March 2025, compared with 218,550 in Germany, 164,830 in Spain, 159,260 in France, and 151,525 in Italy, according to statistics released by the British government.

Europe remains a favored destination for people fleeing war, political instability, economic deprivation and other hardships. In Britain, Pakistanis are the largest group of those seeking asylum.

Critics of the government’s plan said it echoed the language of far-right parties. Clive Lewis, a Labour member of Parliament, told the BBC the plan might drive left-wing voters to the Green Party. But with the Labour Party’s huge majority in Parliament, there is little doubt that it will become law.

Ms. Mahmood, 45, a rising star in the government who became home secretary in a cabinet shake-up in September, emphasized her immigrant roots in promoting the policy. Born in Birmingham to parents with Pakistani roots, Ms. Mahmood studied law at Oxford University and worked as a barrister.

“Immigration is absolutely woven into my experience as a Brit, and also that of thousands of my constituents,” she said on the BBC program “Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.”

“This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/16/multimedia/16int-uk-immigration-02-ckfv/16int-uk-immigration-02-ckfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 14:56:38.969589

President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

It is the latest step in the Trump administration’s strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of several large, Democratic-run cities. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who lack legal status to be in the country, and sparked a number of lawsuits.

Here’s what to know:

Why send agents to Charlotte?

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina’s two U.S. senators are Republican and Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.

Crime was down this year through August, compared with the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.

But the Trump administration has seized upon the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with that murder.

There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.

How have locals reacted?

Critics have characterized the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the agents “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They are also informing immigrants of their rights.

“We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.

Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully” and “reduce panic.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in such operations.

Is the National Guard involved?

There is no sign that the guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation have urged Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to request it.

The governor’s office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe.

The Trump administration has deployed the guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. Courts have blocked the guard from operating so far in the Chicago area and in Portland, Oregon.

Crackdown, inspired by Denmark's policy, draws criticism from charities, rights groups

Britain said it would make refugee status temporary and the wait for permanent settlement would be quadrupled to 20 years under the country's most sweeping overhaul of policy on asylum seekers in modern times.

The Labour government has been hardening its immigration policies, above all on illegal small-boat crossings from France, in efforts to stem the soaring popularity of the populist Reform UK party, which has driven the immigration agenda.

The government said it would take inspiration from Denmark's approach. Its policy has been widely criticized by rights groups and is one of the toughest in Europe — where growing anti-immigrant sentiment has led to increased restrictions in many countries.

As part of the changes, the statutory duty to provide support to certain asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances, will be revoked, the Home Office (interior ministry) said in a statement issued late on Saturday.

The department, led by Shabana Mahmood, said the measures would apply to asylum seekers who can work but choose not to and to those who break the law. It said that taxpayer-funded support would be prioritized for those contributing to the economy and local communities.

The Home Office also said that protection for refugees would ""now be temporary, regularly reviewed and revoked"" if the home country was deemed safe.

""Our system is particularly generous compared to other countries in Europe, where, after five years, you're effectively automatically settled in this country. We will change that,"" Mahmood told Sky News on Sunday.

She added that under the changes, a refugee's status would be reviewed every 2½ years, during ""a much longer path to permanent settlement in this country of 20 years.""

Mahmood said she would provide further details of the changes on Monday, including an announcement on Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.

The government has said it wants to stay in the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR) but change how the Article 8 provision, covering the right to a family life, is interpreted.

Mahmood said it was being ""applied in a way that is designed to frustrate the removal of those that, under our immigration rules, would not have the right to be in this country.""

The government's tougher approach has drawn criticism. More than 100 British charities wrote to Mahmood urging her to ""end the scapegoating of migrants and performative policies that only cause harm,"" saying such steps are fueling racism and violence.

Polls suggest immigration has overtaken the economy as British voters' top concern. Over the summer, protests took place outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.

A total of 109,343 people claimed asylum in the U.K. in the year ending March 2025, a 17 per cent rise on the previous year and six per cent above the 2002 peak of 103,081.

Mahmood said the government would look to open more ""safe and legal"" routes for asylum seekers, as she believed Britain should play its part in helping those fleeing danger.

Looking to European countries

The Home Office said its reforms would look to ""match and in some areas exceed"" the standards of Denmark and other European countries, where refugee status is temporary, support is conditional and integration in society is expected.

Asylum seekers are granted temporary residence permits under Denmark's approach, usually for two years, and they must reapply when these expire. They can be repatriated if their home country is deemed safe, and the path to citizenship has also been lengthened.

The Home Office said Denmark's more restrictive immigration policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the deportation of 95 per cent of rejected applicants.

Denmark's reforms, implemented while it remains a signatory to the ECHR, have drawn sharp criticism. Rights groups say the measures foster a hostile climate for migrants, undermine protection and leave asylum seekers in prolonged limbo.

Britain's Refugee Council said on X that refugees do not compare asylum systems while fleeing danger, and that they come to the U.K. because of family ties, some knowledge of English or existing connections that help them start anew safely.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-16 12:57:18.499903

This is the latest city to unwillingly receive federal agents in President Donald Trump’s illegal immigration crackdown.

The federal government hasn’t provided a full explanation for why this began or how many people have been detained, but DHS blamed the operation in Democratic-led Charlotte on state officials, saying illegal immigrants fled there because of sanctuary policies they believed would protect them.

A DHS press release included a list of migrants the agency called “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” who they say were released onto North Carolina streets because of those policies.

The department has not linked the operation to any single event. However, the fatal stabbing of a 23-year-old Ukrainian on Charlotte’s light rail train has brought heightened national attention to the city in recent months, although the suspect was an American.

Amid the recent enforcement, a Honduran-born United States citizen, Willy Aceituno, was pulled from his vehicle by agents after they smashed his window. He was later released without charges.

“When you have fentanyl being trafficked in cities, when you have Charlotte, North Carolina, a hub of human trafficking, what better tool to put on the ground than the people who are tasked with federal law enforcement in doing exactly what they’re doing,” said Republican Chairman Addul Ali, who represents North Carolina’s 12th congressional district, on NewsNation Saturday.

DHS has not said how long the operation will last, but it comes as federal agents are pulling out of Chicago.

Across the city this weekend, the mood has shifted from confusion to fear. City and county leaders have called the federal raids unnecessary, saying they’re creating panic, not promoting safety.

Immigrant-owned stores shut down, streets were quiet and people avoided daily tasks out of fear they could be targeted.

The moves – to be announced on Monday – are part of the Home Secretary’s overhaul of the asylum system, which will force refugees who enter the UK illegally to wait 20 years before they can apply for permanent settlement.

Ms Mahmood will end what she claims is the “golden ticket” of Britain’s “excessively generous” immigration system, which currently guarantees migrants permanent residency and unconditional access to benefits after they have spent five years in the UK.

She will tell MPs that refugee status will become temporary and reviewed every 30 months. If an asylum seeker’s country is deemed safe at any time, they will be immediately returned.

Migrants granted temporary asylum will no longer be able to automatically and unconditionally bring their spouses or children to the UK.

They will only be allowed to do so if they meet the same financial conditions and standards of English as Britons or migrants on skilled work visas. Britons seeking to bring partners to the UK have to show a combined income of £29,000.

They will also only be entitled to permanent settlement if they meet the same conditions as other migrants, including being in work and paying NI, not claiming benefits, a spotless criminal record, a high standard of English and contribution to British society.

Under the present system, introduced by the last Labour government in 2005, refugees can apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after five years, providing them with access to benefits and public funds and a route to citizenship.

Under new legislation, migrants who arrive illegally either on small boats across the Channel or in lorries, or those who overstay their visas and then claim asylum, will instead have to wait 20 years to secure permanent settlement.

There will be some alternative routes for skilled refugees, enabling them to reduce the 20-year qualification by going into specified work or study routes.

Ms Mahmood will also create shorter, 10-year pathways to permanent settlement for genuine refugees who arrive in the UK legally via three new “safe and legal” routes. These will be designed for asylum seekers who are seeking to work or study in Britain or, like the Homes for Ukraine scheme, are sponsored by local UK communities.

Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, the Home Secretary denied that the crackdown – which also scraps automatic state handouts to thousands of asylum seekers – was “racist”.

Challenged by Sky presenter Trevor Phillips that Labour had been “panicked” into a “racist” immigration policy, Ms Mahmood said: “I reject that entirely. I am the child of immigrants. My parents came to this country legally in the late 60s and the early 70s. This is a moral mission for me.

“I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country. I can see that it is polarising communities across the country. I can see that it is dividing people and making them estranged from one another. I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.

“What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system. It’s not Right-wing talking points or fake news or misinformation that is suggesting that we’ve got a problem. I know because I have now seen this system inside out. It is a broken system. We have a genuine problem to fix.”

Ms Mahmood previously branded Nigel Farage “worse than racist” after the Reform UK leader said he would reassess the migration status of people already granted the right to settle in Britain. Speaking in September, she said Mr Farage had “blown a very, very loud dog whistle to every racist in the country”.

The reforms, hailed as the biggest overhaul since the Second World War, are modelled on Denmark, which has reduced the number of asylum applications to a 40-year low, with 95 per cent of applicants rejected.

High-achieving refugees could bring forward their 20-year qualification date but sources said a refugee who arrived illegally would still face a “penalty” delay even if they were a doctor earning £100,000 a year.

The Home Office is also devising three capped routes for genuine refugees. One would enable talented refugees to come to the UK to study, a second would be for skilled asylum seekers to work in Britain and a third would enable voluntary and community organisations to sponsor refugees.

“I’m sending a clear signal to people: Do not get on a boat. Do not seek to come into this country illegally. That pathway is much more difficult,” said Ms Mahmood.

The Home Secretary will also revoke the statutory duty to provide support for asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances of £49 a week.

Under the changes, the support will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to do so. Those who break the law will also face their support being withdrawn. There are currently an estimated 8,500 people in asylum accommodation on visas with the right to work.

Ms Mahmood said: “Just under 10 per cent of the people that are currently in asylum accommodation, primarily in hotels, but also in housing as well across the country, have the right to work.

“At the moment, there is no expectation that despite having that right to work, that those individuals do, in fact, find work and support themselves. There is also no expectation that people have to obey rules in order to retain their asylum accommodation.

“There’s also no expectation that if you break the law of this country, you will lose your accommodation. That actually places those individuals in a better position than most British citizens in social housing in this country.”

Other changes expected to be announced on Monday include requiring judges to prioritise public safety over migrants’ rights to a family life, or the risk that they will face “inhuman” treatment if returned to their home country.

Some 39,075 people have arrived in the UK after making the journey so far this year, according to the latest Home Office figures.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, described the Government’s plans as “very small steps in the right direction with a few gimmicks”. He claimed that the Government would make little progress in reducing illegal migration without quitting the European Convention on Human Rights.

He told Sky News: “We want no illegal immigration whatsoever. We need to have a cap on legal inward migration each year, so the numbers are very, very dramatically lower.”

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “These harsh and unnecessary plans won’t deter people who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars. Instead, they are more likely to force them into destitution and sleeping rough on the streets.”

“We see every day in our services how refugees go on to contribute as doctors, nurses, carers, entrepreneurs and valued members of their communities, but some will need an initial safety net to get to that point.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2025/11/16/TELEMMGLPICT000449323813_17632917818220_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbFS4ctvTRCv11iMWUZHtVhhEnL4rsjDuMz0rfzZf-J8.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-11-16 12:57:29.447809

It announced ""Operation Charlotte's Web"" on Saturday, saying ""criminal illegal aliens"" would be targeted in the Democratic-run city.

Local officials, including Mayor of Charlotte Li Vyles, released a joint statement criticising the operation, saying it was causing ""unnecessary fear and uncertainty"" in the community.

Since Trump's return to office he has deployed troops to Washington DC, Los Angeles and Chicago to deliver on his promise of ""the largest deportation programme"" in US history.

""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

Armoured vehicles and special operations teams could be involved in the North Charlotte crackdown, according to internal government documents seen by the BBC's US partner, CBS News.

Several church members doing yard work at a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting the church's pastor.

""We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,"" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.

Officials said there are ""a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters"".

The DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to ""sanctuary policies"".

Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a ""certified welcoming city"". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.

""President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,"" the DHS said.

Charlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to Data US.

DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing.

Earlier in the week, US Representative and Democrat, Alma Adams, said she was informed of the operation and was ""extremely concerned"" about Border Patrol and ICE agents coming to North Carolina.

The next city on Trump's list is set to be New Orleans, according to CBS, and that as many as 200 agents could be deployed to the city.

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw “a lot of Latinos running,” chased by “a lot of Border Patrol agents.” Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents.
Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the “significant border patrol activity” was seen Saturday.

(AP) — Federal officials confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city has begun, as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”

Local officials including Mayor Vi Lyles criticized such actions, saying in a statement that they “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

“We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,” the statement said. It was also signed by Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.

Crime is down in the city this year through August, compared with the same months in 2024. Homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts fell by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics.

But President Donald Trump's administration has seized upon the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with the woman's murder.

The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden said this week that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw “a lot of Latinos running,” chased by “a lot of Border Patrol agents.”

Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.

“I told them, ‘I’m an American citizen,’” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn’t believe I was an American citizen.”

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.

Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

“Basically what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said.

Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the “significant border patrol activity” was seen Saturday.

“Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them ‘fishing,’” Asciutto said.

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton’s front yard in the morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

“This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we’ve got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They’ve broken no laws, and that’s what concerns me,” said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.

“It’s an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,” the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.

“Half an hour later, he’s in our yard, he’s working and Border Patrol rolls up,” she said. “They’re here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there’s just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.”

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

“This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?” he said. “This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for U.S. citizens.”

Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and “We’re brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don’t know how long this is going to last.”

The Trump administration has defended unprecedented federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials “have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order” and are “demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.”

“Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,"" Kirby said in a statement. “Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.”

But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” and notify local law enforcement.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has emphasized that it is not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Why it matters: The high-profile operations have led to surges in arrests. But they've also galvanized local resistance efforts, and created a playbook for activists in other cities when ICE comes to town.

""In Chicago, we pushed back as hard as we could,"" said Brandon Lee, of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

""We're going to work to make sure that the local leaders in North Carolina and wherever else they take their road show of terror after this are as prepared as can be for what's coming.""

The big picture: Operation Midway Blitz, which targeted undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, resulted in 3,000 arrests, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Oct. 30.

The operation in Chicago mirrored prior activities in Los Angeles, where Border Patrol also joined ICE on its mission.

President Trump told ""60 Minutes"" in a recent interview that he wants to see more aggressive tactics in operations across the country, but blamed ""liberal judges"" for restricting immigration agents.

White House Deputy Chief of staff Stephen Miller set a 3,000 arrests per day goal in May. The latest public data shows that even with these targeted operations, the agency is falling short.

Zoom in: In Chicago, activists set up a rapid response team of volunteers, and rallied support from local elected officials, business and faith leaders.

Documenting enforcement: Part of the rapid response volunteer network's role was to film officers making arrests, so they could document any potential excessive uses of force or other violations.

Targeted demonstrations: At least one demonstration blocked the entrance at the Broadview processing facility that was holding immigrants for extended periods of time before they were transferred to permanent detention facilities.

Legal challenges: In the court room, litigators sued the administration over the use of tear gas in the city, the detention conditions at Broadview and for how federal agents made arrests. One case, over warrantless arrests, led to a judge ordering the release of more than 600 people on bond.

Between the lines: Sanctuary cities and jurisdictions are top targets for the immigration crackdown, White House Border Czar Tom Homan has said in multiple interviews.

But resistance to these raids is growing beyond activists and civil rights lawyers. Local business leaders and clergy have joined in calls to halt the aggressive enforcement tactics.

""At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

What's next: ""What we've seen in Los Angeles, what we've seen in Chicago are forces violating people's constitutional rights and wrecking havoc on entire communities,"" said Liz Barber, director of policy and advocacy at the ACLU of North Carolina.

President Donald Trump's administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina's largest city had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

It is the latest step in the Trump administration's strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of several large, Democratic-run cities. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who lack legal status to be in the country, and sparked a number of lawsuits.

Here’s what to know:

Why send agents to Charlotte?

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina's two U.S. senators are Republican and Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.

Crime was down this year through August, compared with the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.

But the Trump administration has seized upon the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with that murder.

There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.

How have locals reacted?

Critics have characterized the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the agents “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They are also informing immigrants of their rights.

“We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.

Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully” and “reduce panic.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in such operations.

Is the National Guard involved?

There is no sign that the guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina's congressional delegation have urged Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to request it.

The governor's office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe.

The Trump administration has deployed the guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. Courts have blocked the guard from operating so far in the Chicago area and in Portland, Oregon.

Maryland counties opted to let ICE collaborate with local law enforcement

In the last eight months, five new Maryland counties have opted in to the 287(g) program that allows collaboration between ICE and local law enforcement.

The new legislation would prevent that, meaning local resources will not be allowed to be used as an extension of ICE if it becomes law.

One Marylander and a member of CASA says the government is being used as a weapon against immigrant communities.

""Where infants are being ripped away from their parents and torn to the side, leaving them behind and grappling with the trauma, ICE is manufacturing a crisis in our communities and that is impacting the lives of thousands of Marylanders,"" said CASA Baltimore and Central Maryland Director, Crisaly De Los Santos.

The new legislation is through the launch of the Brave of Us campaign, which is calling on leadership in the state to help protect immigrants against what they call an authoritarian regime.

""DHS will not be deterred""

While Baltimore County has not opted into the collaboration program, it did recently sign a memorandum of understanding with ICE.

In a statement to WJZ in response to the legislation, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, called out state democrats:

Trump’s demand that he be compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm"".
While Florida law has a two-year limit, bringing a defamation case in America will mean Trump faces a tougher legal standard.
Legal experts say that the BBC could show that Trump was not harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.
If Trump sues in Florida, he would need to establish that the BBC Panorama documentary was available there.","Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to sue the BBC over an edited speech despite the corporation's apology.

Although the BBC apologised and retracted the episode, it refused to compensate Trump, who claims the edited version of a 2021 speech broadcast by Panorama caused him major financial and reputational harm. He intends to seek $1–5 billion in damages.

The prospect of a multi-billion-pound lawsuit is a daunting one for the BBC and the British government, but the president faces legal hurdles on both sides of the Atlantic.

Why is Donald Trump suing?

The dispute was sparked by an edition of the BBC’s flagship current affairs series Panorama, titled Trump: A Second Chance? broadcast days before the 2024 US presidential election.

The third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell"".

Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.

Trump’s demand that he be compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm"".

What do the BBC say?

According to BBC News, the broadcaster set out five main arguments in its letter to Mr Trump’s legal team as to why it did not believe there was a basis for a defamation claim.

It said the BBC did not distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels and was restricted on iPlayer to viewers in the UK; that the documentary did not cause Mr Trump harm as he was later re-elected; that the edit was not done with malice and was designed to shorten a long speech; that it was not meant to be considered in isolation but as part of an hour-long programme; and that an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.

Chairman Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House to apologise for the editing, and lawyers for the corporation have written to the president’s legal team, strongly disagreeing that there was a basis for a defamation claim.

The broadcaster said it will not air the Panorama episode Trump: A Second Chance? again, and published a retraction on the show’s webpage on Thursday.

Where could a case be heard?

Trump also said the lawsuit would “probably” be filed “someplace in the US”, but commented that litigation in the UK “moves a little bit quickly”.

However, deadlines to bring the case in English courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed £100,000, expired more than a year ago.

While Florida law has a two-year limit, bringing a defamation case in America will mean Trump faces a tougher legal standard.

What would Trump need to prove?

Trump would need to prove three major components - that the content published was factually false in a defamatory way; that he suffered harm due to the false and defamatory coverage; and that the media organisation knew it was false and acted with ""actual malice"".

Legal experts say that the BBC could show that Trump was not harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.

If Trump sues in Florida, he would need to establish that the BBC Panorama documentary was available there.

Because the documentary was not shown in the US, it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of the president because of a programme they could not watch.

Mark Stephens, a solicitor at Howard Kennedy, said he thinks it is ""virtually impossible for Donald Trump to win against the BBC"".

It is ""virtually impossible"" for Trump to win against BBC, solicitor Mark Stephens tells ITV News

""Of course he can start a court case, but you've then got to have legal merit, you've got to have cogent evidence, and the programme just wasn't broadcast in America,"" he told ITV News.

""And for a libel claim to succeed even in America, harm must occur where the case is brought. So it's hard to argue reputational damage in a jurisdiction where the content wasn't aired.""

Mr Stephens added that even if a court in the US were to award a million dollars, British courts will only enforce compensatory damage for reputational loss.

He continued: ""And in this case, that's going to be no more than £100,000. So even if he gets a billion dollar judgement, it's not going to be enforced in the UK, and indeed it's not going to be economic to have brought the case.""

Trump's previous media wins

Although experts doubt the strength of his case, Trump has previously secured multimillion-dollar settlements from major US media companies, including Paramount and ABC News, over claims of misleading or inaccurate broadcasts.

He even told GB News he has had “a lot of success” litigating against news organisations.

In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.

Trump told GB News in an interview on Friday night: “I think that was worse than the Kamala (Harris) thing with CBS and 60 Minutes.”

That settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.

Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her.",https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/3w5WSaXT0LdQDvYkZ3QzxO/21e7edf9fdaf95c5fa1c863eadaff2db/trumpbbc.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80,N,,2025-11-16 09:56:27.765781

RELATED STORY | US Border Patrol agents will be sent to Charlotte, local sheriff says

The federal government hadn't previously announced the push. But Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden confirmed earlier this week that two federal officials had told him that Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino — a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte — said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents pulling people over since Friday.

""Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,"" Garcia said. ""I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and border patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.""

Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work when he saw Border Patrol agents chasing people.

""I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,"" he said.

Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he himself was stopped twice by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground.

""I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,"" he told The Associated Press. ""They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.""

Finally, he was allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Local organizations responded by having trainings, trying to inform immigrants of their rights, and considering peaceful protests. President Donald Trump's administration has defended federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

But Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said Friday that the ""vast majority"" of those detained in these operations have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.""

He urged people to record any ""inappropriate behavior"" they see and notify local law enforcement about it.

Ali Faqirzada, 31, tapped out a message that he had passed a crucial screening, putting him on track to become a U.S. citizen.

An asylum official, he told them, had determined that he would be in danger if he returned to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where he had worked for U.S.-backed organizations and a group that supported women’s education.

But then came another text moments later: “They are detaining me.”

The circumstances of Mr. Faqirzada’s detainment by immigration officials have become increasingly common as President Trump uses more aggressive tactics to expel immigrants, including those like Mr. Faqirzada who have followed legal procedures to gain citizenship. While some immigration cases have been thrust into the limelight, tens of thousands of migrants have wound up in federal facilities and been quietly deported without their stories spilling into public view.

But Mr. Faqirzada’s detainment has led to a flurry of activity to free him, set in motion by two powerful New York institutions: Bard College and the Episcopal Diocese of New York.

Those involved see his case as particularly compelling. In their view, the country owes him for his work in Afghanistan. In the course of helping him, they say a kind of blueprint is emerging for trying to free detainees caught in the Trump administration’s crackdown: make the case visible, work every connection, don’t engage in partisan tactics.

""There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens, and President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won’t.”

The arrival of federal agents comes as President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown expands to more Democratic-run cities, including Charlotte, led by Democratic Mayor Vi Lyles.

In response to DHS's efforts, the city of Charlotte's government shared a statement on Nov. 15: ""The expected U.S. Customs and Border Protection's operations are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty in our community as recent operations in other cities have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.""

Additionally, the city's government said in its statement that anyone who needs ""the police, don't hesitate to call 911. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department does not participate in Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations and is not involved in the planning or execution of any federal immigration enforcement activities.""

The city also asked community members who want to make their voices heard, ""do so peacefully,"" as local officials ""do not want to see violence like many witnessed in other cities.""

What is DHS doing in Charlotte?

Before the announced deployment, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden said on Nov. 13 that federal officials had not disclosed any specific details about DHS's operation, including how many agents would be sent to the city or what their mission would entail. The sheriff added that his agency would not be ""involved with any measures regarding enforcement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP.""

Charlotte, the largest city in North Carolina, is a Democratic stronghold in a state that Trump won during last year's presidential election. In Mecklenburg County, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris received 66% of the vote while Trump won the state by four percentage points.

Lyles, in a Nov. 13 X post, said local officials didn't know what immigration authorities were planning to do in Charlotte, but she asked residents to remain calm.

""I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community,"" Lyles said on X. ""Everyone in our community deserves to feel secure and I am committed to doing all that I can to inform our community, help make sure everyone feels safe, and understands their rights.""

According to the Charlotte Observer, ""masked federal agents"" made their presence known Saturday, Nov. 15, including at a church in east Charlotte.

“Right now, everybody is scared. Everybody,” the church's pastor, who did not want to identify himself to the outlet, said. “One of these guys with immigration, he say he was going to arrest one of the other guys in the church. He pushed him.”

Which other cities have federal agents been deployed to?

While McLaughlin did not elaborate further on DHS's operation, the ""surge"" into Charlotte comes after federal agents have been deployed to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland. The deployments of federal agents and National Guard troops have been challenged in court and have drawn criticism over officers' use of force and what's been seen as increasingly aggressive tactics by the Trump administration.

Late last month, Trump threatened to send “more than the National Guard” to ""troubled"" U.S. cities. At the time, he didn't identify which cities he intended to send troops to.

“We’re sending in our National Guard and if we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard because we’re going to have safe cities,” Trump said Oct. 28 at a U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, during his weeklong Asia trip. “We’re not going to have people killed in our cities. Whether people like that or not, that’s what we’re doing.""

""A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,'” Falk explained to Al-Jazeera in a Saturday interview from Ottawa in the wake of the incident that happened at the international airport in Toronto ahead of the scheduled event.
He told media outlets that he and his wife, also an American, were held for over four hours after their arrival in Toronto.
Clearly, the international repression of the Palestinian cause knows no bounds.""

""A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,'” Falk explained to Al-Jazeera in a Saturday interview from Ottawa in the wake of the incident that happened at the international airport in Toronto ahead of the scheduled event.

“It was my first experience of this sort–ever–in my life,” said Falk, professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University, author or editor of more than 20 books, and formerly the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories.

Falk, who is American, has been an outspoken critic of the foreign policy of Canada, the United States, and other Western nations on the subject of Israel-Palestine as well as other issues. He told media outlets that he and his wife, also an American, were held for over four hours after their arrival in Toronto. They were in the country to speak and participate at the Palestine Tribunal on Canadian Responsibility, an event scheduled for Friday and Saturday in Ottawa, the nation's capital.

The event, according to the program notes on the website, was designed to ""document the multiple ways that Canadian entities – including government bodies, corporations, universities, charities, media, and other cultural institutions–have enabled and continue to enable the settler colonization and genocide of Palestinians, and to articulate what justice and reparations would require.""

In his comments to Al-Jazeera, Falk said he believes the interrogation by the Canadian authorities—which he described as ""nothing particularly aggressive"" but ""random"" and ""disorganized"" in its execution—is part of a global effort by powerful nations complicit with human rights abuses and violations of international law to “punish those who endeavour to tell the truth about what is happening” in the world, including in Gaza.

Martin Shaw, a British sociologist and author of The New Age of Genocide, said the treatment of Falk and Elver should be seen as an ""extraordinary development"" for Canada, and not in a good way. For a nation that likes to think of itself as a ""supporter of international justice,"" said Shaw, ""to arrest the veteran scholar and former UN rapporteur Richard Falk while he is attending a Gaza tribunal. Clearly, the international repression of the Palestinian cause knows no bounds.""

Gregory Jackson, chief of staff to North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr., said the city received notification DHS vacated the property on Friday afternoon.

The naval station provided support for Homeland Security agents during Operation Midway Blitz, the immigration enforcement operation to ""target the criminal illegal aliens"" in the Chicago area. It remains unclear how DHS' departure from Naval Station Great Lakes will impact the ongoing immigration crackdown.

In recent days, there have been signs the federal immigration surge may be slowing down in Chicago.

Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino left the city, and on Saturday, federal officials confirmed immigration enforcement had begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In an interview on Fox News on Thursday, the Border Patrol commander said he was in West Virginia.

Two days ahead of Bovino's departure from Chicago, a spokesperson challenged reporting from multiple outlets that he and numerous federal agents were preparing to leave the city.

Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for Homeland Security, disputed reports that operations would be wound down in Chicago in a social media post.

“We aren’t leaving Chicago,” she said, not referring to Bovino by name. She made similar remarks on Fox News Tuesday.

McLaughlin cited statistics showing crime had decreased in the city during the ramped-up federal intervention, but it was unclear how those statistics were calculated.

She reported the following since the start of Operation Midway Blitz:

Homicides down 16%

Shootings down 35%

Robberies down 41%

Carjackings down 48%

Transit crime down 20%

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office blasted the statistics cited by McLaughlin in her social media post, calling the assertion that DHS has helped lower crime rates “a slap in the face” to Chicago police.

According to data provided by Chicago police, homicides were down 29% year-over-year in the city. Robberies were down 35% year-over-year, motor vehicle thefts dropped by 23%, and shootings decreased by 36%.

Thousands of arrests were reported during the federal operation in Chicago, which has sparked multiple court challenges.

WASHINGTON – Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced DHS law enforcement is surging resources for Operation Charlotte’s Web in North Carolina.

What are they (Border Patrol) here for?”","Following the arrival of the U.S. Border Patrol in Charlotte Saturday morning, hundreds of protesters gathered at First Ward Park in the afternoon and marched through uptown, delivering a clear message to federal agents: “Get out.”

Rosa Ramirez attended the emergency protest with her mother, Martha Ramirez, who held a sign saying, “Stop kidnapping our neighbors.” There have been many reports around the Charlotte region of federal police — their identities shielded with masks and license plates covered — detaining people.

“They’ve been doing terrible things in Chicago, and we’re not happy that they’re bringing it here to North Carolina,” Martha Ramirez said.

As the daughter of a father from the Dominican Republic, Rosa Ramirez said she feels that the immigrant community is being racially profiled, especially after hearing about a U.S. citizen in Charlotte who was pulled out of his truck after agents broke the window.

“None of us have any real feeling of safety,” Rosa Ramirez said. “I’m here to use my voice and to use the rights that I hopefully still have to defend those who don’t have their papers and documents at this moment.”

The U.S. Border Patrol has not disclosed how many agents were sent from Chicago to the city, nor how long they intend to remain. Their activities began in the morning, but it’s unclear which federal other agencies are involved in this operation.

In recent developments, at least 200 U.S. Border Patrol agents were stationed in Chicago, assisting the Trump Administration’s efforts to address illegal immigration.

Since September, the agency reports arresting 1,500 individuals, according to CBS News. Federal agents have made arrests across Chicago and surrounding suburbs, questioning residents and, at times, using tear gas on both civilians and local law enforcement.

“Immigrants are an integral part of our community and our workforce,” Martha Ramirez said, noting labor needs and contributions such as helping western North Carolina rebuild after Hurricane Helene and other natural disasters. She said she believes migration is a human right.

“We should be welcoming those folks here, and those folks aren’t asking for anything but the privilege to work and to contribute to our economy in the same way that any other American citizen does,” she said.

Community organizations led protesters with loud chants against Border Patrol agents being in Charlotte. Some of the participating organizations included Seeking Justice, Poor People’s Campaign, Housing Justice Coalition, Blakk Liberation, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation.

Kass Ottley of Seeking Justice said she liked seeing the large crowd but encouraged more people in the region to get involved and push racial differences aside.

“We have to come together,” she said. “That’s the only way we’re going to win.”

Joel Simpson of the Poor People’s Campaign spoke against the Trump Administration’s budget boosts for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He said that money could go towards other needs, such as healthcare or food programs to help people.

“We know that this is an attack on people’s dignity and humanity,” Simpson said. “It’s an attack on our constitutional rights, and we won’t be silent about it.”

Alison Yanez and her sister, Danna Yanez, said they’re not going to be quiet either. Their family came to America from Honduras for a better life.

“I feel bad for the families that fear coming out to the streets and speaking for themselves,” Alison Yanez said. “I’m here today to speak for those who can’t.”

“They’re just grabbing people out of their cars ... they’re just harassing them,” Danna Yanez said about the treatment. “But we’re all humans, and we’re all on stolen land.

Federal agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection are expected to arrive in the Charlotte area within days, local officials confirmed this week amid growing friction between Washington’s immigration enforcement priorities and Democratic-run cities.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday that it had been notified of the impending federal presence but emphasized that it has not been asked to assist or participate in any operations. A department spokesperson told Fox News Digital Friday that the sheriff’s office had ""zero involvement or participation in any CBP immigration enforcements or operations.""

The impending immigration enforcement in North Carolina comes as Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has sought to maintain open communication with federal agencies while distancing his department from federal immigration enforcement.

GOP URGES DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TO CHARLOTTE AS CRIME SURGES

Charlotte’s anticipated CBP deployment is the latest in a series of similar moves by the federal government to extend border-security operations to other parts of the country.

In recent months, CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have sent personnel to major metropolitan areas including Chicago and Washington, D.C.

Those operations have sparked protests from anti-immigration activists. In Portland, Oregon, protests have flared since June. Anti-ICE graffiti has been scrawled outside of detention centers, and demonstrations have become violent at times between protesters and federal agents.

WATCH: Federal immigration agents dodge bullets, speeding cars in CA

Federal officials have described the deployments as part of an expanded effort to disrupt smuggling networks and track illegal aliens.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: ""Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.""

Local pressures mount

The timing of the announcement comes as Charlotte faces intensifying scrutiny over violent crime.

Homicides and aggravated assaults have risen sharply this year, prompting Republican lawmakers to urge Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard. For now, the governor has resisted that call from Republican lawmakers, and local officials have argued that public safety remains a local responsibility.

""Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,"" a letter from a trio of Republican lawmakers said. ""According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.""

MAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK

According to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte’s current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions.

On Aug. 22, the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska garnered attention after her killing was captured on surveillance video while she was commuting home from her pizzeria job. The footage captured the 23-year-old cowering as her alleged killer leered over her with a folding knife seconds before the attack.

Police revealed that her accused killer was identified as Decarlos Brown Jr., a repeat offender with a lengthy rap sheet.

'Committed to transparency'

In his earlier statement Wednesday, McFadden sought to reassure residents that his office ""remains committed to transparency"" and that any coordination with federal agencies will be limited to information-sharing, not enforcement.

""We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,"" the statement said. It was also signed by Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.

Crime is down in the city this year through August, compared with the same months in 2024. Homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts fell by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics.

But President Donald Trump's administration has seized upon the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutskaha on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with the woman's murder.

Enforcement begins after rumors

The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden said this week that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw ""a lot of Latinos running,"" chased by ""a lot of Border Patrol agents.""

Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.

""I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,'"" he told The Associated Press. ""They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.""

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.

Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

""Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,"" Garcia said.

Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the ""significant border patrol activity"" was seen Saturday.

""Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them 'fishing,'"" Asciutto said.

Encounter in a front yard

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton's front yard in the morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

""This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we've got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They've broken no laws, and that's what concerns me,"" said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.

""It's an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,"" the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.

""Half an hour later, he's in our yard, he's working and Border Patrol rolls up,"" she said. ""They're here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there's just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.""

Some businesses close

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

""This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?"" he said. ""This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for U.S. citizens.""

Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and ""We're brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don't know how long this is going to last.""

The Trump administration has defended unprecedented federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials ""have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order"" and are ""demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.""

""Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,"" Kirby said in a statement. ""Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.""

But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any ""inappropriate behavior"" and notify local law enforcement.

Home secretary Shabana Mahmood will indicate a move away from EU law as she announces plans to scrap the UK’s statutory duty to provide support to asylum seekers – with migrants also facing stricter requirements to receive and retain benefits.

It is part of a major overhaul of the immigration system, inspired by the Danish model, and comes as Labour battles to restore public trust in the asylum system to see off the threat of a Reform UK government. But Ms Mahmood may face objections from some Labour backbenchers, with immigration reform seen as a divisive issue within the party.

Ahead of a speech by the home secretary laying out the reforms on Monday, the Home Office said that support will “no longer be a given” for asylum seekers, vowing that automatic handouts for those seeking refuge “will end”.

The announcement is being billed by the government as the largest overhaul of asylum policy in modern times and a move to “restore order” to the rules.

Ministers hope it will reduce the incentive for small boat migrants to claim refuge in the UK, with Home Office officials insisting Britain will no longer be a “magnet for illegal migrants” seeking to benefit.

Outlining her changes, Ms Mahmood said the “pace and scale of migration” is putting “immense pressure” on communities.

She said: “This country has a proud tradition of welcoming those fleeing danger, but our generosity is drawing illegal migrants across the channel.

“The pace and scale of migration is placing immense pressure on communities.

“This week I will set out the most sweeping changes to our asylum system in a generation. We will restore order and control to our borders.”

The legal duty to provide asylum-seeking support was introduced in the UK in 2005 under EU law.

Currently, support includes the right to somewhere to live, as well as a weekly payment of £49.18 per person in each household to cover costs of items such as food, clothing and toiletries. If the accommodation provides meals, each person gets £9.95 per week instead. There are small increases for pregnant women and young children.

Under Ms Mahmood’s plans, those who can work, have assets, fail to comply with removal directions, engage in criminality, disrupt accommodation settings or work illegally could have their support removed, the Home Office said.

The changes are set to apply to people who are already in the asylum support system, as well as anybody who arrives and applies in the future – meaning those already in the UK could have their support taken away.

Meanwhile, officials have also said that taxpayer-funded benefits will be prioritised for people who are “making a contribution to the economy and communities”.

Among the changes expected to be unveiled on Monday is a move requiring judges to prioritise public safety over a migrant’s right to a family life, as well as a push to scrap permanent asylum in Britain.

Under current rules, those granted refugee status can apply for indefinite leave to remain and have refugee status for five years. But, under the expected proposals, refugees will be removed as soon as their home country is deemed safe.

It comes after officials in the Home Office visited Copenhagen as part of their attempts to learn about Denmark’s asylum policy, where a strict asylum approach has been taken by a government with similar political alignment to the Labour Party.

The country is also a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been criticised in the past for blocking or slowing efforts to deport illegal migrants.

The Scandinavian country has reduced the number of asylum applications to their lowest level in 40 years, and removed 95 per cent of rejected asylum seekers, according to the Home Office.

The Tories have said that some of the new measures are “welcome” but they “stop well short of what is really required and some are just yet more gimmicks – like the previous ‘smash the gangs’ gimmick”.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: “The truth is this Labour government is incapable of getting any real change past their left-wing backbenchers, especially after the weak example they set with the debacle of their botched welfare reforms.”

Labour is coming under pressure on immigration as Reform’s poll numbers continue to surge.

Nigel Farage’s party is sitting at 26 per cent in the latest YouGov Westminster voting intention figures from this week, with Labour lagging behind on 19 per cent, just ahead of the Tories on 18 per cent.

This is the latest in a series of crackdowns, including the immigration white paper earlier this year, designed to slash legal migration.

Under those plans announced in May, legal migrants will have to spend 10 years in the UK before applying for citizenship, and language requirements will be upped for all routed into the UK.

The number of asylum applications in the UK is at a record high, as the latest Home Office figures show 111,084 people applied for asylum in the year to June 2025.

This is the highest number for any 12 months since records began in 2001.","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/17/PA-82143799.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-15 19:56:49.428217

I’d point to three fundamental ingredients, each of which is now being weakened. When I think of the historical legacies of our generation and of President Trump, I wonder if they will be less about the political battles in the headlines and more about the slow shriveling of America’s global standing.

Patriotism is less about waving flags and more about defending these three forces that over two centuries have made America pre-eminent:

A commitment to education at every level, resulting in global leadership in science and technology.

I believe the answer to almost every question is education — the highest-return long-term investments are often in human capital. Yet throughout the ages there have always been those eager to execute Socrates, to subject Galileo to the Inquisition, to ban books.

America became the world’s leading nation largely because of its emphasis beginning in the 19th century on mass education when other countries educated only a sliver of elites, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz argued in their landmark 2008 book, “The Race Between Education and Technology.”

The United States helped pioneer public elementary schools and widespread high school and college attendance; later, American research universities became global leaders and nurtured technology hubs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Thus the United States boasts the Magnificent Seven technology companies, while there isn’t anything comparable in Europe. America’s scientific and technological excellence arises in part because of a symbiotic partnership between universities, the federal agencies that fund research and the private companies that commercialize that knowledge.

America’s educational supremacy arguably began slipping decades ago, as some East Asian countries eclipsed us in high school graduation rates and in science and math skills among young people. But Trump is adding to the pressure by gutting the Department of Education, including research and data collection that show how we can improve outcomes. Even worse, he is waging war on America’s most eminent universities.

American excellence in science drives economic competitiveness and well-being. Yet Trump is winding down mRNA vaccine programs that are full of promise in tackling cancer and has slashed investments in medical research.

Any president should be proud of universities like Harvard and Columbia, not attempt to crush them. We stand up to China with not only aircraft carriers but, even more, by educating our own young people and leading in research in artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and materials science. Yet by some reckonings, China has already surpassed the United States in emerging technologies.

So we should be doing what we did after Sputnik in 1957, recommitting this country to science and education. Instead, the Trump administration’s hostility to great universities seems to reflect a larger scorn for science in fields from vaccines to climate change. It is the latest flowering of an anti-intellectualism that goes back to China’s first Qin emperor burying scholars alive and, in this country, to the Scopes trial, the Joseph McCarthy hysteria and the 2017 tax on university endowments.

An inclination toward free markets and free trade, supported by the rule of law.

This is the pillar that Trump is most respectful of. He mostly believes in capitalism and free markets — probably more than many Democrats — but has led a rapid retreat from free trade. His tariffs are the highest since the 1930s. Trump has also systematically chipped away at some of the underpinnings of a market economy. Markets thrive with prudent fiscal and monetary management, yet his tax cuts lead to soaring debt even as he tries to crush the independence of the Federal Reserve. Corruption is a bane of capitalism, yet his family has seemed to use the presidency as an A.T.M.

And the rule of law? England was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution partly because of a legal system that offered protection and predictability. In contrast, Trump has periodically defied lower courts and used the Department of Justice to punish his political opponents. Mark L. Wolf, a federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan, announced this month that he was resigning to be able to speak openly about the Trump administration’s “assault on the rule of law” and the way that it poses an “existential threat to democracy.”

Immigration and the absorption of some of the brightest minds from around the world.

My dad, an Armenian refugee from Eastern Europe, arrived in the United States in 1952. Soon after, his landlady returned his rent, saying, “I can’t take money from a refugee.”

Such a welcoming spirit, while far from consistently applied, has enormously enriched the United States. Four of the Magnificent Seven tech companies are led by immigrants, and 46 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, according to the American Immigration Council.

These three factors are not a complete recipe for America’s greatness. The sheer physical size of our domestic market helped, along with democracy and the ease of interstate commerce. And even on those three, we’ve repeatedly fallen short.

Yet I see these three factors as central to America’s rise as the world’s leading power today. And these strengths are now being systematically undermined, especially universities, trade, the rule of law and recruitment of the world’s best minds.

The risks to America’s global pre-eminence get less attention than Trump’s White House ballroom, the government shutdown and his ugly statements about his opponents. But I’d argue that his most important legacy may be the damage he is doing to the underpinnings of our economic engines.

The Nobel in economic science went this year to three scholars who illuminated how innovation drives economic growth. They emphasized that this arises from immigration, from great universities, from openness to the world and to ideas — and consequently warned of “dark clouds” ahead.

Throughout history, we’ve repeatedly seen how great nations sometimes lost their energy and drive, slipping because of what Jawaharlal Nehru described in the context of India as a “gradual oozing out of hope and vitality.” In the year 1000, the greatest city in the world was Kaifeng in China, then the most important country in the world — but China and Kaifeng then lost ground for most of the next millennium before reviving in recent decades.

The United States may or may not experience such decrepitude, but decline seems to me more likely if America chokes trade and immigration while stifling universities. Without its secret sauce, America would be just one more tired old nation watching other, more youthful countries race past it. Those are the stakes.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/16/multimedia/16kristof-wbjt/15kristof-wbjt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 19:56:53.968714
