Now is the time to stand up - The Guardian,"Guardian staff, Kica Matos",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/03/trump-us-immigration,"But for those of us on the frontlines of the fight to protect immigrants’ rights, it signaled the further entrenchment of an authoritarian regime being created on the backs of immigrants.

He called it “beautiful”. I would call it a grave and existential threat to our already precarious democracy.

Perhaps the biggest headline to emerge from this bill is that it tears giant holes into our social safety net to ensure our nation’s wealthiest could benefit from additional tax breaks. But for those of us on the frontlines of the fight to protect immigrants’ rights, it signaled the further entrenchment of an authoritarian regime being created on the backs of immigrants. Irrespective of our immigration status or views on immigration, we should all be concerned because we will all be affected: the sheer quantity of resources set aside for immigration enforcement will turbocharge the militarization of our country.

History has taught us that social justice movements can play a significant role in protecting democracies when they are at risk from authoritarian regimes. This bill should be a wakeup call for us all to step up in defense of our democracy before it is too late. Here is what we should anticipate.

The law hands over a staggering $170bn to the Department of Homeland Security to ramp up this administration’s brutal immigration enforcement agenda. Among the direct beneficiaries of this largesse is Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Even without these resources, Ice has already been responsible for outrageous and unconstitutional acts that are hacking away at our democracy. It is Ice agents in masks who are kidnapping our neighbors, snatching them off the streets, at courthouses or their workplaces, shoving them into SUVs, and taking them to detention centers. Many have been deported without even being given the right to go before a judge.

Ice agents are using unimaginably harsh tactics. They are violently smashing car windows, ripping parents away from their kids, and targeting children at school. The audacity of their lawlessness and cruelty – often on public display – is unprecedented.

The Trump administration has shown a willingness to crack down violently on those who speak out against its immigration policies. Even public officials have been caught in this dragnet, including California senator Alex Padilla, New Jersey congresswoman LaMonica McIver, Newark mayor Ras Baraka, and New York City mayoral candidate Brad Lander. Every one of these violent encounters has been caught on film.

With this new and massive infusion of resources now being handed over to the DHS and Ice, we will soon see many more abductions on our streets, more family separations, and more brutal crackdowns on dissenters. We are also likely to see the widespread militarization of our communities, consistent with what has already transpired in parts of California: heavily armed military officers in battle fatigues carrying out violent raids with the use of tear gas and rubber bullets; the storming of public venues such as MacArthur Park in Los Angeles for no reason other than to instill fear and intimidation; and government-sanctioned attempts to silence and intimidate public officials and activists through arrests, violence, criminal sanctions and prosecutions.

As scenes previewed by militarized Los Angeles become commonplace in cities across the country – in blue states, to make an example, and in red states eager to collude – many more Americans will perhaps come to realize the full impact of this bill and recognize that the same system that cages immigrants closes rural hospitals. The same ideology that justifies family separation does not flinch when taking away food from the hungry. A government that disappears immigrants to foreign torture prisons without a day in court cannot be trusted to uphold your rights either. The machine of state violence, once built, expands.

So, what are we to do? How do we move forward?

It is incumbent on all of us to double down and meet the moment with the urgency it demands. That means committing to doing what we can to protect the most vulnerable amongst us and hold public officials accountable. We must be loud in our opposition to the attacks on our democracy and actively exercise our freedoms to protect it. We must contact our members of Congress to demand that they uphold the rule of law and take on those actively working to undermine our system of checks and balances. We must join the protests and the growing movement of people from all walks of life who are actively fighting authoritarianism. We must do everything we can to support our immigrant friends, neighbors and community members whose lives are being torn apart by this administration.

Finally, we must also vigorously reject the paralyzing lure of fatalism – that the future will merely be an extension of our present rather than something we can build together. If our government can pour boundless resources into hurting people, there is nothing radical or unrealistic in insisting that those same resources could be used to better all of our lives.

At the National Immigration Law Center, we will continue using every tool at our disposal to fight back against Trump’s attacks on our communities. We are clear eyed about how we got here and what the stakes are. Just because this moment demands defense, it will not stop us from standing firm in the declaration that a pathway to a better world still exists.

What’s giving me hope now

What’s giving me hope now is the number of people who are joining a rapidly growing movement fighting back against this administration’s authoritarian plans. They include courageous immigrants who refuse to be silenced or dehumanized; retirees who are spending time being of service to impacted immigrants, engaging elected officials and/or attending rallies and town halls; courageous young people who refuse to accept the status quo and are putting their bodies on the line; and entire communities who are speaking out and doing everything possible to protect their neighbors.

All of us have a role in upholding justice and preserving our democracy. I’m heartened to see people from all walks of life determined to do their part and remain optimistic that this movement will get bigger and stronger over time.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c7658655f6cb35abcb42bc59a67f290b8f3cbb/901_0_5921_4737/master/5921.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0aff57e5e6fe9ad900a141098341a756",N,,2025-08-04 01:56:31.814652

A mere four days after Boasberg raised his concerns to fellow federal judges, the Trump administration defied his order against the deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador.
“The Trump Administration has always complied with all court orders,” wrote Bondi in her complaint against Boasberg.
And now he has trained his sights on the independent judiciary urging punishment of judges who thwart his agenda.
“Federal judges have lifetime tenure.","Last week, Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi, who shows more fealty to President Trump than to the U.S. Constitution she swore to uphold, filed a complaint against the only federal judge who has initiated contempt proceedings against the government for defying his orders.

U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, she alleged, had undermined the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary by making “improper public comments” about Trump to a group of federal judges that included Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.

What is Boasberg alleged to have said?

No transcript has emerged, but according to Bondi’s complaint, at a March session of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Boasberg is alleged to have expressed “a belief that the Trump Administration would ‘disregard rulings of the federal courts’ and trigger ‘a constitutional crisis.’ ”

The Judicial Conference is the perfect place to air such concerns. It is the policy-making body for the federal judiciary, and twice a year about two dozen federal judges, including the Supreme Court chief justice, meet to discuss issues relevant to their work. Recently, for example, they created a task force to deal with threats of physical violence, which have heightened considerably in the Trump era. But nothing that happens in their private sessions could reasonably be construed as “public comments.”

“The Judicial Conference is not a public setting. It’s an internal governing body of the judiciary, and there is no expectation that what gets said is going to be broadcast to the world,” explained former U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Fogel, who spent seven years as director of the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, a kind of think tank for the judiciary. I reached out to Fogel because he is part of a coalition of retired federal judges — the Article III Coalition of the nonpartisan civic education group Keep Our Republic — whose goal is to defend the independence of the judiciary and promote understanding of the rule of law.

Bondi’s complaint accuses Boasberg of attempting to “transform a routine housekeeping agenda into a forum to persuade the Chief Justice and other federal judges of his preconceived belief that the Trump Administration would violate court orders.”

You know how they say that every accusation is a confession in Trump World?

A mere four days after Boasberg raised his concerns to fellow federal judges, the Trump administration defied his order against the deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador.

You probably remember that one. A plane carrying the deportees was already in the air, and despite the judge’s ruling, Trump officials refused to order its return. “Oopsie,” tweeted El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele after it landed. “Too late!”

Thus began the administration’s ongoing pattern of ignoring or flouting the courts in cases brought against it. It’s not as if the signs were not there. “He who saves his Country does not violate any law,” Trump wrote on social media in February, paraphrasing Napoleon Bonaparte, the dictatorial 19th century emperor of France.

In June, Erez Reuveni, a career Department of Justice attorney who was fired when he told a Maryland judge the government had deported someone in error, provided documents to Congress that implicated Emil Bove, Trump’s one-time criminal defense attorney, in efforts to violate Boasberg’s order to halt the deportation of the Venezuelans. According to Reuveni’s whistleblower complaint, Bove, who was acting deputy attorney general at the time, said the administration should consider telling judges who order deportations halted, “F— you.”

Bove denied it. And last week, even though other Justice Department whistleblowers corroborated Reuveni’s complaint, Bove was narrowly confirmed by the Senate to a lifetime appointment as a federal appeals court judge.

“The Trump Administration has always complied with all court orders,” wrote Bondi in her complaint against Boasberg. This is laughable.

A July 21 Washington Post analysis found that Trump and his appointees have been credibly accused of flouting court rulings in a third of more than 160 lawsuits against the administration in which a judge has issued a substantive ruling. The cases have involved immigration, and cuts to the federal funding and the federal work force. That record suggests, according to the Post, “widespread noncompliance with America’s legal system.”

Legal experts told the Post that this pattern is unprecedented and is a threat to our system of checks and balances at a moment when the executive branch is asserting “vast powers that test the boundaries of the law and Constitution.”

It’s no secret that Trump harbors autocratic ambitions. He adores Hungarian strongman Viktor Orbán, who has transformed the Hungarian justice system into an instrument of his own will and killed off the country’s independent media. “It’s like we’re twins,” Trump said in 2019, after hosting Orbán at the White House. Trump has teased that he might try to seek an unconstitutional third term. He de-legitimizes the press. His acolytes in Congress will not restrain him. And now he has trained his sights on the independent judiciary urging punishment of judges who thwart his agenda.

On social media, he has implied that Boasberg is “a radical left lunatic,” and wrote, “This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!”

Some of Trump’s lapdogs in the House immediately introduced articles of impeachment (which are likely to go nowhere).

Roberts was moved to rebuke Trump: “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” he said in a statement. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”

Some described his words as “stern.” I found them to be rather mild, considering the damage Trump’s rhetoric inflicts on the well-being of judges.

“It’s part of a longer term pattern of trying to … weaken the ability of the judiciary to put checks on executive power, ” Fogel told me. He is not among those who think we are in a constitutional crisis. Yet.

“Our Constitution has safeguards in it,” Fogel said. “Federal judges have lifetime tenure. We are in a period of Supreme Court jurisprudence that has given the executive a lot of leeway, but I don’t think it’s unlimited.”

The agency has invoked an exception to public records disclosure that allow for documents to be withheld if their release would interfere with law enforcement proceedings.

With the public records requests, it’s possible that US federal authorities could still successfully cite the investigation exemption and keep documents out of pubic view.","On the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed that his administration would release a tranche of documents in the criminal investigation into disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

But since Trump returned to the White House, his promises have fallen flat, with few documents released – and backtracking about releasing more records. The lack of disclosure has prompted not only dissatisfaction among those seeking information about Epstein’s crimes, but political flak Trump can’t seem to deflect, especially about his own relations with the convicted sex trafficker.

But where political pressures have so far failed, legal pressures that have largely sailed under the radar of the fierce debate about Epstein’s crimes could yet succeed and bring crucial information in the public eye.

Several court cases provide some hope that even if Trump’s justice department fails to make good on calls for transparency, potentially revelatory records about Epstein, his crimes and his links to some of the most powerful people in the US might still see the light of day.

Moreover, it is possible that the justice department’s unusual request to unseal grand jury transcripts, in Epstein and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal cases, could also undermine opposition to it releasing records.

One lawsuit brought by the news website Radar Online and investigative journalist James Robertson stems from their April 2017 public records request for documents related to the FBI’s investigation of Epstein. This request came years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state-level crimes in Florida for soliciting a minor for prostitution – and before his 2019 arrest on child sex-trafficking charges in New York federal court.

Radar and Robertson filed suit in May 2017 after the FBI did not respond to their request; the agency ultimately agreed that it would process documents at a rate of 500 pages per month, per court documents.

“Despite the FBI identifying at least 11,571 pages of responsive documents, 10,107 of those pages remain withheld nearly 20 years after the events at issue,” according to court papers filed by Radar and Robertson.

Although Epstein killed himself in custody awaiting trial, and Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence, the FBI is fighting release of more documents. The agency has invoked an exception to public records disclosure that allow for documents to be withheld if their release would interfere with law enforcement proceedings.

The Manhattan federal court judge overseeing this public records suit sided with the FBI’s citation of these exemptions, but Radar is pursuing an appeal that could be heard in the second circuit court of appeals this fall.

“In court, they insist that releasing even one additional page from the Epstein file would hurt their ability to re-prosecute Ghislaine Maxwell in the event the supreme court orders a new trial,” a spokesperson for Radar said.

“It’s a flimsy rationale and we are challenging it head on in the court of appeals. Our only hope of understanding how the FBI failed to hold Epstein accountable for over a decade – and preventing future miscarriages of justice – is if the government releases the files.”

It’s also possible that the justice department’s request to release grand jury transcripts in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases could bolster arguments for the release of records.

“The DoJ’s core argument against disclosure for the past six years has been that it would jeopardize their ability to put – and keep – Ghislaine Maxwell in prison. They say that releasing even a single page could threaten their case,” the Radar spokesperson said. “Naturally, any support they offer to release material undermines their claims.”

Separately, developments in civil litigation involving Epstein and Maxwell could also potentially lead to the disclosure of more documents surrounding their crimes.

A federal judge in 2024 unsealed a cache of documents in the late Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre Roberts’s defamation case against Maxwell. Some documents were kept under seal, however, and journalists pursuing release of documents appealed against that decision.

On 23 July, the second circuit decided that it found “no error in the district court’s decisions not to unseal or make public many of the documents at issue”, but it also ordered the lower court to review possibly unsealing them.

Robert’s attorney Sigrid McCawley reportedly said she was “thrilled with the decision” and also said she was “hopeful that this order leads to the release of more information about Epstein’s monstrous sex trafficking operation and those who facilitated it and participated in it”, according to Courthouse News Service.

Others who have represented Epstein victims have called for disclosure of public records – and voiced frustration about being stonewalled in their pursuit of documents.

Jennifer Freeman, special counsel at Marsh Law Firm, who represents Epstein accuser Maria Farmer, previously told the Guardian she had made a public records request for information related to her client, with no success.

Spencer T Kuvin, chief legal officer of GoldLaw and an attorney for several Epstein victims, hopes that public records battles could help pull back the veil on Epstein information.

“I think that the Foia requests will absolutely assist in the disclosure of information. The DoJ has made blanket objections citing ongoing investigations, but through Foia litigation the courts can test those objections by potentially reviewing the information ‘in camera’,” Kuvin said. “This means that an independent judge may be appointed to review the information to determine whether the DoJ’s objections are accurate or just a cover.”

Roy Gutterman, director of the Newhouse School’s Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University, cautioned that calls for disclosures – and even government requests to release some files – might not be a panacea for access to extensive documents.

“This case is already complicated, and there were already too many cooks in the very crowded kitchen, and it’s getting more crowded as more public interest grows in the grand jury materials as well as the now-settled defamation case,” Gutterman said.

But stonewalling could also continue. With the public records requests, it’s possible that US federal authorities could still successfully cite the investigation exemption and keep documents out of pubic view.

“Using Foia for FBI and law enforcement materials related to this case, might be a creative newsgathering tactic, but the law enforcement exemption the government is citing might be legitimate because some of the materials are grand jury materials and some other materials might include private or unsubstantiated allegations,” Gutterman said.

“The reporter in me thinks there is an important public interest in revealing these documents, but the law might end up keeping most material secret. Even with the widespread and growing public interest, it might be too big an ask to unseal a lot of this material.

“Practically speaking, the DoJ might also be very selective in which materials it would want to release as well because of the political element involved here, too.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a374b0faf9fbc85a4ee28c28cd4f577198adb2/239_0_2393_1916/master/2393.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=42568eda41e06f20fc44a68254508565",N,,2025-08-04 01:56:45.604495

Immigrants are law-abiding: One of the big fears often stoked about immigrants is crime, and accusations that those seeking asylum or citizenship are violent criminals.
According to a report by Pew Research, immigrants in the US illegally contribute more than $12 billion annually in state and local taxes.
The average estimated tax rate of unauthorized immigrants is 8 percent, while the wealthiest one percent of Americans pay just over 5 percent.
Approximately 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants contribute to Social Security—a benefit they are not even eligible to receive.","AT THE RECENT graduation ceremony for Northern Essex Community College’s Center for Adult Education, we celebrated the accomplishments of 24 students who had completed their high school equivalency exams, dozens more who finished English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs, 15 inductees into the National Adult Education Honor Society, and six newly naturalized citizens of the United States, who, waving American flags, treated the crowd to a surprise performance of “God Bless America.”

Adult education programs like these are offered by community colleges, school districts, and non-profit organizations across the country, and are in high demand by people seeking a second chance at improving their lives through education; by employers looking for talented, credentialed workers in a tight labor market; and by immigrants drawn to the promise of America.

Recently, these programs seemed to be at risk, as the Trump administration announced that $716 million in adult education program funding that was supposed to be distributed to states by July 1 was being withheld. The administration said the freeze on these funds was due to a wider review of resources allocated to education, under suspicion that, according to a spokesperson at the Office of Management and Budget, “Many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”

Last week, facing mounting criticism, the Trump administration said that it will release the adult education funds – along with more than $4 billion in other funding for K-12 schools and higher education that had also been held back.

That news was a huge relief. Still in place, however, is a directive in letters sent by the US Department of Education to colleges rescinding guidance that had been in place since 1997 that allowed federal funds to be used for undocumented residents in some adult education programs. The letters notified them the “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders” executive order signed by President Trump in February is intended to “prevent spending of American taxpayer dollars on Federal assistance for illegal aliens,” and therefore, colleges should no longer admit undocumented students into these programs.

While the focus in these recent announcements is on ending federal support for undocumented residents, it is clear from other White House communications and actions that the broader agenda is to practically eliminate immigration into the United States entirely.

In both of his terms in office, the Trump administration has taken aim at each of the principal ways that people from other countries can become naturalized United States citizens, including:

Family-based sponsorship: A way for a US citizen or lawful permanent resident to sponsor close relatives for a green card that President Trump has derided as “chain migration,” and vowed to curtail by reducing the categories of eligible family members, increasing income requirements, and imposing stricter, more time-consuming vetting processes.

Employment-based sponsorship: A way for an employer to sponsor a foreign national for a green card with a qualifying job offer that Trump is aggressively trying to limit through stricter interpretation of H1-B visa requirements, setting higher wage requirements for work visas, and enhanced vetting of visa applications, which slows processing time and presents barriers for employers seeking to fill vacant positions.

Refugee or asylee status: A process used to recognize individuals fleeing their home country because of a fear of persecution that the Trump administration has nearly eliminated by suspending the US Refugee Admissions Program, suspending asylum applications for anyone attempting to cross America’s southern border, and ending Temporary Protected Status designations for asylees from Afghanistan, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and other strife-torn nations.

These steps are in addition to the Trump administration’s attempts to end birthright citizenship, which has been guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution since 1868; and severely limit the number of international students studying at American universities through travel bans, suspension of visa interviews, social media vetting, and other steps designed to dissuade aspiring scholars from other countries from considering American higher education.

Despite this array of restrictions on everyday people attempting to emigrate to the United States, Trump has proposed, and even set up a web site for wealthy foreigners interested in applying for, the “Trump Card,” which offers US citizenship to anyone willing to pay $5 million for the privilege.

The president is not alone in pursuing these immigration restrictions. Although it passed by the narrowest possible margin in Congress, the recently enacted “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” contains a number of provisions, like a 300 percent increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), $45 billion for construction of ICE detention facilities, and $46 billion for border wall construction, designed to deter would-be immigrants to America.

Taken together, Trump’s executive orders since January and his signing of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” Act represent a radical shift in federal policy toward immigrants, based largely on myths and misinformation, like claims that immigrants are overrunning the US population, are more prone to committing violent crime, and are taking American jobs or relying on welfare assistance. In fact:

The proportion of foreign-born residents of the US is the same today as it was in the early 1900s. While the share of the population made up immigrants has increased in recent decades, it is now same as it was at the turn of the 20th century. According to the Migration Policy Institute, in 1910, 14.7 percent of US residents were born in other countries. Today, that figure is slightly lower, at 14.3 percent.

Immigration is stabilizing our population. Massachusetts has experienced a net migration of native-born citizens out of the state each year since 2011, and we have slipped from 9th to 16th place in population size. Immigration has been the only way we did not actually lose population overall. And the same is true across New England, which has the oldest average population of any region in the country and, as the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has noted, is being reenergized through immigration. The consequences of losing population are significant, and include a smaller workforce, fewer consumers, and fewer representatives in Washington.

Immigrants are educated: According to the Migration Policy Institute, 48 percent of recently arrived immigrants have a college degree, compared to only 38 percent of native-born Americans.

Immigrants are law-abiding: One of the big fears often stoked about immigrants is crime, and accusations that those seeking asylum or citizenship are violent criminals. But numerous studies over the years have demonstrated conclusively that immigrants commit fewer crimes and have lower rates of incarceration than native-born US citizens.

Immigration improves our economy: According to a study from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, “Most economists agree that the effects of immigration on the US economy are broadly positive,” and include:

Increased wages: Immigrants often do not compete for the same jobs as native US citizens, putting minimal downward pressure on wages. Rather, immigrants’ consumer needs increase the demands for goods and services, and studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers over the past few decades.

Improved innovation: Immigrants account for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity.

Higher tax revenue: Contrary to one often expressed belief, most immigrants, including those in the country without authorization, pay significantly more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. According to a report by Pew Research, immigrants in the US illegally contribute more than $12 billion annually in state and local taxes. The average estimated tax rate of unauthorized immigrants is 8 percent, while the wealthiest one percent of Americans pay just over 5 percent. Approximately 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants contribute to Social Security—a benefit they are not even eligible to receive.

Saving retirement: The US population is getting older. In 1990, there were five workers in America for every retiree. Now, there are only three. Without immigration, by 2030 that ratio will fall to only two—not enough to sustain our population of retirees.

Over the past few national election cycles, our nation has seemingly swung from one extreme to another as each party has sought to impose its vision for immigration on a population that appears equally divided over which way to turn.

A few years ago, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, ever the pragmatist, suggested that what we really need is “A high wall with a big gate,” an approach that would balance our very real need for national security and social cohesion with our equally compelling need for shoring up our aging, birth-rate-declining population with the energy and vibrancy of immigrants seeking a better way of life.

The last time Congress passed meaningful comprehensive immigration reform that moved us in that direction was nearly 40 years ago, when President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which imposed penalties on employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants and increased funding for border security, but also provided amnesty and a path to citizenship for nearly three million undocumented immigrants.

President Reagan, and indeed leaders of both political parties until recently, recognized the importance of immigration to the very essence of what it means to be an American.

In his final speech as president, which is worth taking a few minutes to watch as a reminder of why he was called “the great communicator,” Reagan noted, “We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people—our strength—from every country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation.”

Then he cautioned, “If we ever close the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost.”

Four decades later, under the policies being implemented by the Trump administration, we are rapidly spiraling in the direction Reagan feared for the nation.

In a 37-page opinion Thursday blocking the administration from ending Temporary Protected Status for Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua, she accused officials of “racial animus” based on their statements about criminal migrants.

“By stereotyping the TPS program and immigrants as invaders that are criminal, and by highlighting the need for migration management, [Homeland] Secretary [Kristi] Noem’s statements perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population,” Thompson wrote in her opinion.

Thompson wrote in her rejection that she “shares” the “concern” of those suing the Trump administration regarding the president’s ability to end TPS at his discretion. The Biden-appointed judge added that her court “does not forget that this country has bartered with human lives” and included a lengthy footnote discussing the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

“The emancipation of slaves saw the same pattern, but in reverse. Many whites were uncomfortable with the idea of free non-white people in their communities, even if they had lived in the United States for generations,” Thompson wrote in her opinion. “Plaintiffs’ allegations echo these same traditions.”

Thompson also alleges that ending TPS for the three countries and requiring those who had the temporary status to return to their home country is the equivalent of freed slaves being removed from the U.S. and sent to Africa.

Earlier this year, Judge Edward Chen, an Obama appointee on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, blocked the Trump administration from ending TPS for Venezuela and accused the Trump administration of similar claims of racial animus in his 78-page opinion.

“Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes,” Chen wrote in his March order.

The Trump administration’s official reasons for ending the Temporary Protected Status for the countries have been that the reasons outlined for initially granting TPS are no longer applicable, and conditions have improved.

Other decisions bring emotional responses

While many dramatic opinions from federal judges blocking the Trump administration’s policies have come in TPS lawsuits, judges have also made fiery accusations in other issues. A ruling by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday made another unfavorable comparison about the Trump administration’s policies.

Judge Jia Cobb, a Biden appointee on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, compared the president’s policies blocking the administration from rapidly deporting people who had previously been paroled into the country to the countries that illegal immigrants have fled in her order.

“This case’s underlying question, then, asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their case within a system of rules,” Cobb wrote. “Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country that, as they are swept up at checkpoints and outside courtrooms, often by plainclothes officers without explanation or charges … may look to them more and more like the countries from which they tried to escape?”

Among the various rulings against the Trump administration in district courts, a case regarding the administration’s cancellation of diversity, equity, and inclusion grants at the National Institutes of Health brought another dramatic racial discrimination claim.

“I’ve never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,” U.S. District Judge William Young said in his ruling in June. “I’ve sat on this bench now for 40 years. I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether the raids would continue.
""This is a victory for Los Angeles, and this is a victory because the people of Los Angeles stood together,"" Bass told reporters Friday night outside Getty House, the mayor's official residence.
U.S. officials have denied the presence of a quota.","LOS ANGELES — U.S. immigration officials continue to release the names and alleged criminal histories of some people detained in recent illegal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, even as the patrols have been effectively halted by a lawsuit challenging their legality.

Among the detentions made by ICE Los Angeles and announced by Homeland Security Investigations are the following:

Alejandro Torres-Rivera, 29, of Mexico. Torres allegedly has previous charges for obstructing and resisting an officer, possession of unlawful paraphernalia and use/being under the influence of a controlled substance.

Jesus Sanchez-Avila, 39, of Mexico, arrested July 31. Sanchez allegedly has previous charges for robbery, carjacking, assault with a firearm and was sentenced to 19 years in prison for gang-related crimes.

Jose Antonio Meneses-Hernandez, 52, a Mexican national, arrested July 31. Meneses-Hernandez allegedly has previous charges for DUI, possession of a controlled substance and trespassing.

One post by ICE took issue with the city of Los Angeles' so-called sanctuary policy, in which local officials are largely forbidden from cooperating with the U.S. government to enforce immigration laws.

Alongside a photo of a detainee, ICE posted the following on Sunday:

""This Mexican criminal alien sexually abused a child under 14 in Vista, Calif. His name's Juan Ocana-Sanchez and ICE Los Angeles got him off the streets because he's a CONVICTED child sex offender. LA sanctuary policy defenders: This is who you protect. Meanwhile, sanctuary policies put the public and VICTIMS at risk.""

Attempts to reach the office of LA Mayor Karen Bass for comment were not immediately successful Sunday. The offices of Council members Hugo-Soto- Martinez, Eunisses Hernandez and Nithya Ramen, who championed the 2024 ordinance that formally established LA as a ""sanctuary city,"" also did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The 2024 ordinance closed loopholes in previous policy prohibiting city resources or personnel from being used to help federal enforcement of immigration laws.

On Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Trump administration's bid to stay a temporary restraining order halting the government's roving enforcement patrols. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ruled July 14 that the patrols were illegally conducted, largely based on targets' race and without reasonable suspicion.

U.S. Department of Justice Attorney Jacob Roth insisted that the immigration stops -- which began June 6 in the Los Angeles area -- were perfectly legal, carefully targeted and conducted with probable cause to make arrests.

""The officers are instructed to find reasonable suspicion before an arrest,"" Roth told the panel, adding that Frimpong's restraining order ""is fundamentally flawed on multiple levels.""

However, the three-member Court of Appeals panel, all Democratic appointees, appeared skeptical during last Monday's oral arguments, and that was borne out by Friday's ruling.

""If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion ,"" the panel wrote.

An eventual appeal to the Supreme Court is expected, where six of the nine justices were appointed by Republican presidents.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson took issue with the ruling.

""No federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy -- that authority rests with Congress and the president,"" Jackson said in a statement to City News Service. ""Enforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview or jurisdiction of any judge. The Trump administration looks forward to continuing to implement its immigration policies lawfully.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether the raids would continue.

Bass praised the ruling.

""This is a victory for Los Angeles, and this is a victory because the people of Los Angeles stood together,"" Bass told reporters Friday night outside Getty House, the mayor's official residence.

""I think the administration might have believed that this was going to divide our city, that our city was going to go at each other in division, but we did not. We stood strong, and I am very happy to say that us standing strong ... gave the court the resolve to uphold this decision.""

The rulings stem from Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, a lawsuit filed July 2 by five individual plaintiffs and four plaintiff organizations, the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center. The plaintiffs allege that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is operating a program of ""abducting and disappearing"" community members using unlawful arrest tactics, then confining detainees in illegal conditions while denying access to attorneys.

The suit also claims that federal officials have unconstitutionally arrested and detained people in order to meet arbitrary arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.

U.S. officials have denied the presence of a quota. Trump administration officials have defended the raids, pointing to the president's many statements during the 2024 campaign pledging to carry out mass deportations of those here illegally, and touting the alleged criminal records of some detainees.

It was in 1993, at the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, when the catchphrase “women’s rights are human rights” gained global prominence.
Women and girls fleeing gender-based violence were considered outside the bounds of protection.
The court recognized that claims of gender-based violence could qualify under the “particular social group” category.
Our refugee laws should protect women, because women should not be subject to gender-based violence.","The U.S. has been waffling for decades over whether women have a right to refugee protection when fleeing gender-based violence. Under different administrations, the Department of Justice has established and reversed precedents, issued and repealed rulings. But the latest flip-flop by the Trump administration is not just another toggle between rules.

In July, the Trump administration’s high court of immigration, the Board of Immigration Appeals, issued a deeply troubling decision. The ruling held that a “particular social group” — one of the five grounds for refugee protection — cannot be defined by gender, or by gender combined with nationality. The ruling, in a case known as Matter of K-E-S-G-, is binding on all adjudicators across the country.

The legal reasoning is both unpersuasive and alarming. It seeks to return refugee law to an era when violence against women was dismissed as a private matter, not of concern to governments or human rights institutions. It is part of a broader, ongoing assault by the Trump administration on women’s rights and immigrant rights — in this case, attempting to turn back history to 1992.

It was in 1993, at the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, when the catchphrase “women’s rights are human rights” gained global prominence. This was a response to the long-standing focus on the violation of civil and political rights by governments, while much of the violence against women was committed by nonstate actors. Women and girls fleeing gender-based violence were considered outside the bounds of protection. But the Vienna Conference marked a turning point, leading to transformative change in how governments and international bodies addressed gender-based violence — because much of the violence in this world is targeted at women. Laws and policies were adopted worldwide to advance women’s rights, including for those seeking refugee protection.

Under international and U.S. law, a refugee is someone with a well-founded fear of persecution linked to that person’s “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” which are commonly referred to as the protected grounds. Gender is not explicitly listed, and as a result, women fleeing gender-based forms of persecution, such as honor killings, female genital cutting, sexual slavery or domestic violence, were often denied protection, with their risk wrongly categorized as “personal” or “private,” and not connected to one of the protected grounds.

To address the misconception that women are outside the ambit of refugee protection, beginning in 1985 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees issued a series of guidance documents explaining that although “gender” is not listed as a protected ground, women could often be considered a “particular social group” within a country. The commissioner called on countries that were parties to the international refugee treaty — the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol — to issue guidance for their adjudicators to recognize the ways in which gender-based claims could meet the refugee definition.

The United States was among the first to respond to the call. In 1995, the Department of Justice issued a document instructing asylum officers to consider the evolving understanding of women’s rights as human rights. The following year, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued a watershed decision, granting asylum to a young woman fleeing genital cutting. The court recognized that claims of gender-based violence could qualify under the “particular social group” category.

Yet the path forward was anything but smooth. In 1999, the same court denied asylum to a Guatemalan woman who endured a decade of brutal beatings and death threats from her husband, while the state refused to intervene. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno found the decision to be so out of step with U.S. policy that she used her authority to vacate it. And so women remained eligible to be considered a “particular social group” when seeking refuge in the U.S. The view was affirmed by a 2014 case recognizing that women fleeing domestic violence could indeed qualify for asylum.

But that progress was short-lived. In 2018, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions took jurisdiction over the case of Anabel, a Salvadoran survivor of domestic violence to whom the top U.S. immigration court had granted asylum.

Sessions ruled that domestic violence is an act of personal or private violence, rather than persecution on account of a protected ground. This characterization of the violence as personal or private was in direct repudiation of the principle that women’s rights are human rights, deserving of human rights remedies, such as asylum.

The Biden administration sought to undo the damage. In 2021, Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland vacated that ruling and reinstated the 2014 precedent, restoring a measure of protection for gender claims.

Now comes the recent ruling from the immigration court under the Trump administration. Going beyond Sessions’ determination that gender violence is personal, the court is striking at the heart of the legal framework itself by barring gender or gender-plus-nationality as a valid way to define a social group. This erects an even higher barrier for women and girls fleeing persecution. It is a transparent attempt to roll back decades of legal progress and return us to a time when women’s suffering was invisible in refugee law.

The implications are profound. This ruling will make it far more difficult for women and girls to win asylum, even though their claims often involve some of the most egregious human rights violations. But it does not foreclose all claims — each must still be decided on its own facts — and there is no doubt the precedent will be challenged in federal courts across the country.

Another reversal is now sorely needed, to get the struggle for gender equality moving in the right direction again. Our refugee laws should protect women, because women should not be subject to gender-based violence. That is, in fact, one of our human rights.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a1a85b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4064x2134+0+285/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2F0f%2Fc0795c6449d89da5a102ef8a337f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F525623964,N,,2025-08-04 01:56:57.048284

Rowley is a former national editor and foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune.","Six months into Donald Trump’s second term, a lawless president is solidifying his law enforcement powers to create something most Americans didn’t vote for and don’t want: a police state increasingly robbing residents of their rights and due process.

Unaccountable, masked immigration agents, many in plainclothes, are arresting farm workers in fields, raiding Home Depots and car washes, hunting unauthorized workers “like animals,” and grabbing immigrants in courthouses, mothers and children in their homes, high school soccer stars and kids at baseball practice.

Even U.S. citizens have been rounded up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, including children, and other children here legally seeking refuge, some of them sick, along with their parents in the country without legal permission. Many people snatched are quickly deported without due process. Some are “disappeared” into detention facilities or shipped abroad before they can get legal representation.

This hellscape of fear and chaos does not match up with Trump’s campaign promise to mass-deport criminals and arrest “the worst of the worst.” Residents here without legal authorization with no criminal records pleading their cases dutifully in court have been abducted by agents at courthouses. It is a shameful showcase for the cameras, an authoritarian regime running roughshod over constitutional rights, immigrant rights and human rights.

Trump is improperly using the military on U.S. streets, defying court orders, caging detainees in deplorable gulags and dispatching ICE agents to grab anyone they can to meet arbitrary White House quotas of 3,000 a day. He makes a mockery of the rule of law by arresting Americans.

Trump is escalating his war on immigrants as poll numbers on his immigration policies hit a record low. Six months in, the executive orders, court challenges, crypto corruption, firings and budget cuts seem bottomless, as well, and now he is grappling with the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.

And he’s just getting started. Brace yourselves. It’s going to get worse before it gets better. Look for the National Guard or the Marines coming next to Chicago.

Recently, the GOP-led Senate narrowly confirmed Trump’s former criminal defense lawyer, Emil Bove, to a lifetime appointment on the federal appellate bench after he was accused of defying the courts. Bove denied it, but one whistleblower said he told fellow Justice Department officials to ignore court orders if necessary to make sure deportation flights took off, alleging: “Bove stated that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts ‘f––– you’ and ignore any such court order.”

To be clear, Republicans and Democrats both agree that illegal immigration needs to be controlled. A bipartisan effort came close to finding a longer-term solution last year until Trump killed the comprehensive reform bill to weaponize the issue against Democrats in the Nov. 5 election. The question is how to do deal with illegal immigration legally and humanely.

Americans voted to get the border under control, and to be fair, Trump’s administration has done that. Crossings and apprehensions have slowed to a trickle. But they didn’t vote for, nor do they support, what he is doing now: lawless crackdowns leaving migrants and Americans alike living in a republic of fear, danger and violence.

“Show me your papers” used to be the catchphrase for villains in World War II movies. Now, it’s the harsh reality for many legal residents. Migrants who may have crossed the border illegally but are now going through the court system to plead their cases can be swept up and disappeared before their day in court.

Worse, Trump and his top White House anti-immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, deliberately appeal to white nationalists and white grievance, leaving the feeling among immigrants that they are targeted in a deportation war aimed mainly against people of color.

His administration has attacked diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and ICE agents have been accused of racially profiling immigrant communities. ICE denies this, but how many white European immigrants do you see in their detention centers? We have seen this pattern before, when whole groups of people are targeted — such as Japanese Americans sent to internment camps during World War II. The inhumane immigration detention center in the Everglades is Exhibit A.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem insists her immigration agents are behaving legally and building cases correctly. She denies racial profiling: “It’s been done exactly how law enforcement has operated for many years in this country, and ICE is out there making sure we get the worst off the streets,” she said.

It’s not hard to do this legally. Barack Obama and Joe Biden, when they were president, fought illegal immigration within the law. In fact, Obama upset many Democrats by being the “Deporter-in-Chief,” deporting more immigrants at a higher rate than Trump has — and he did it legally.

But Trump’s lawlessness and authoritarian conduct goes way beyond immigration, and it has provoked sustained nationwide protests since he took office. He has threatened a number of law firms into submission, tried to quell free speech and dissent at universities, attacked the media with frivolous lawsuits to try to bend them to his will and silence his critics in the entertainment world.

But his police state tactics are causing blowback too. Americans who care about their democracy must continue to rally to defend it. Only people power and voters can stop a criminal president.

Even his unprecedented weaponizing of the Department of Justice to target perceived enemies has caused revulsion among the ranks over abominations such as his attempt to restrict birthright citizenship. The unit that prosecutes those cases has lost nearly two-thirds of its staff as DOJ attorneys leave rather than further his corrupt attempts to tear down the constitutional system.

Trump’s approach toward immigratioin has squandered his support. Many MAGA supporters still approve of his actions, but a majority of Americans in a recent CBS poll now see his deportation program as a net negative.

Moreover, more Americans now see the value of immigration way more than they did a year ago, with the share wanting immigration reduced dropping from 55% in 2024 to 30% today, according to a recent Gallup Poll — and a record-high 79% of U.S. adults now say immigration is a good thing for the country.

Clearly, the police state tactics aren’t working, and that’s a good thing for America.

Dangling bonuses of up to $50,000, federal officials are launching a massive recruitment campaign to hire more than 14,000 immigration agents, attorneys and other workers to help execute President Donald Trump's border crackdown. The president is newly flush with billions in funding and wants to deport 1 million people annually with the help of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

""America needs you,"" reads one of the ICE recruiting ads, featuring a finger-pointing Uncle Sam, evoking WWI recruiting posters. ""America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.""

The federal spending plan funds the hiring of 10,000 new ICE agents, making ICE the single-largest law enforcement agency in the country, larger than the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies combined. For comparison, the FBI only has about 13,700 special agents, according to the Department of Justice.

Even before the new hires take their posts, the dramatic expansion of public ICE operations has upset communities from coast to coast, and raised questions about the tactics agents have used as they've chased suspects across Home Depot parking lots, farm fields and into medical buildings.

The aggressive recruitment efforts have also angered local sheriffs worried that deputies in already understaffed offices will be lured away by the big bonuses and higher pay.

""It is tone deaf and reflects a total lack of judgment and character on their part,"" Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriff's Association, said of a recruiting offer emailed to local deputies nationwide. ""This is either galactically stupid or purposefully malicious. You're just robbing Peter to pay Paul. And in this case, you're robbing the poorest of Peter to pay the richest of Paul.""

Massive media blitz, incentives and job offers

Bolstered by new staffing, federal officials have promised to further flood Democrat-run cities with deportation officers in response to a lack of cooperation in executing Trump's get-tough approach that has targeted undocumented immigrations with or without criminal records.

The Department of Homeland Security has already begun hiring for the new jobs. Federal officials are planning a massive social media blitz to reach recruits, potentially advertising on YouTube and SnapChat, but also on connected TVs via Hulu and Amazon Prime.

In addition to the signing bonuses, ICE is offering up to $60,000 in student loan forgiveness, although applicants don't need to have college degrees to be considered for some of the jobs.

ICE officials on July 31 announced they've made 1,000 job offers since Trump signed the funding law. Among those receiving job offers are retired ICE agents who quit during the Biden administration, said acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons in a statement.

""They couldn’t do the jobs they signed up to do,"" Lyons said. ""Now, people are lining up to work with us because they know our officers and agents are allowed to enforce immigration law fairly and across the board, and that’s a cause people really believe in.""

Applicants 'should expect a certain level of risk'

White House officials say there's been an 830% increase in assaults against agents through July 14th, compared with the same period last year, and the recruiting materials say applicants ""should expect a certain level of risk,"" but that they will be trained to take ""every precaution"" in remaining safe.

How quickly ICE can bring aboard the new employees remains uncertain. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has long struggled to hire Border Patrol agents, who typically take more than 300 days to bring aboard, according to a 2024 GAO study.

Joe Gamaldi, the national vice president of the Fraternal Order of Police union, said he suspects ICE will face the same recruiting challenges as local departments. He said years of demonizing law enforcement by some politicians, activists and media has created a ""toxic cocktail"" that will make hiring challenging.

""Truth be told, all police agencies are competing for a small pool of people who are still willing to serve and literally die for their communities,"" he said. ""Bonuses and better pay will help, but ultimately police officers, and those interested in police work, want to serve for an agency and communities that appreciate them and don’t treat them like scum.""

Local sheriffs furious about ICE recruitment efforts

The aggressive hiring efforts have frustrated local law enforcement leaders who worry their officers will flock to better-paying federal jobs. Without telling local sheriffs in advance, ICE officials directly emailed recruitment offers to hundreds of deputies across the country.

Thompson, of the National Sheriff's Association, said sheriffs feel betrayed by the move. Thompson said sheriffs agreed to send deputies to special immigration enforcement training designed for local police, only to then have ICE try to simply poach them away.

""It's become a wildfire of discontent, and not how partners treat partners,"" he said. ""This is an embarrassment to this president, and it's sad.""

Thompson said some sheriff's offices currently have vacancies of 40% and predicted the ICE hiring spree could further winnow the ranks of local law enforcement.

Other policing experts have raised concerns about the risks of hiring so quickly.

National-security expert and commentator Garrett Graf, who investigated Border Patrol hiring surges after 9/11, said in a Substack post that ICE risks a surge of applications from Americans ""specifically attracted by the rough-em-up, masked secret police tactics, no-holds-barred lawlessness that ICE has pursued since January.""

Graff added: ""If you’re excited to dress up like you're taking Fallujah for a raid of hard-working roofers in the Home Depot parking lot, working for ICE or CBP shouldn't be for you.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/01/USAT/85475880007-20250522-t-014713-z-1096702972-rc-2-lmeauymdc-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpmigrationarrestsphoenix.JPG?crop=1712,963,x0,y0&width=1712&height=963&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-03 07:56:40.223109

Flowers adorned the fence outside Federal Plaza Immigration court as religious and city leaders beat the drums in support of loved ones detained by ICE agents.

One of the latest -- 20-year-old Yeonsoo Go, the daughter of beloved Episcopal priest Kyrie Kim and a graduate of Scarsdale High School in Westchester County. The South Korean native moved to New York in 2021 with her mother.

A lawyer close to the case says Go had an application to extend her current visa, which was set to expire in December. She was ordered to appear in court on Thursday for a procedural hearing on the application. According to the lawyer the judge gave Go a date to return to court in October, but ICE agents met her outside the building.

""She was with her mother. She was heartbroken. And when she called me at night, later that day, she was breaking down,"" said her boyfriend, Leo Chu.

Go spoke to her boyfriend and her friends before the hearing.

""She has been like a little nervous...given the climate and recently so and now her fears have come true,"" added her friend, Gabriella Lopez.

""Her mother gets regular calls from Yeonsoo and she's staying at 26 Federal Plaza, which, as we know is not actually a facility that has showers or beds or hot food. And so the detentions here are not only illegal, but they're immoral,"" said Rev. Matthew Heyd of the Episcopal Diocese of New York.

Immigration Coalition says these incidents are happening more and more and is giving advice for people with upcoming hearings.

""I think it's critically important that anyone who needs to go to an immigration court hearing call the New York State Office of New Americans and their hotline"" said New York Immigration Coalition President and CEO Murad Awawdeh.

It is also important to make sure you create a family preparedness plan and if possible, work with a lawyer to set up a virtual hearing.

Eyewitness News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security regarding the case, but have not heart back.

In the meantime, community members hope their demands to release Go echo throughout Federal Plaza.

Guatemala’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that 14 of its citizens are in the facility, which is surrounded by mangroves and swamps and accessible only by a single road.

The Guatemalan consular network in the United States requested permission from U.S. authorities to visit the detainees “to identify, interview, and learn firsthand about their situation and conditions,” the ministry said in a statement.

Access for Guatemalan officials to the Everglades facility—named after the national park that surrounds it—”was confirmed and is scheduled for August 7,” the statement added.

The construction of the facility on an abandoned airport in that part of Florida has sparked outrage among critics of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, calling it inhumane, as well as protests from environmentalists because of its proximity to a protected nature reserve.

LIZ REINER PLATT: Right.
She has just released a new report, which isso important, Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past andFuture Claims.","REV. PAUL BRANDEIS RAUSHENBUSH, HOST:

Elizabeth Reiner Platt has been leading the Law, Rights andReligion Project since 2015. Her publications have included the report Who'sFaith matters? The Fight for Religious Liberty Beyond the Christian Right -what a good title - which is just incredibly relevant today, as we know. Liz isa legally trained scholar and advocate who leads efforts to reframe religiousliberty in the United States, especially in relation to gender justice,reproductive rights and racial equity.

Just last month, the Law, Rights and Religion Project moved from ColumbiaLaw School to Union Theological Seminary in New York - my alma mater.

And this week, it published the latest comprehensive report titled,Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past and Future Claims.If you have heard Elizabeth Reiner Platt on our show before, you know how goodshe is at humanizing complex policy and legal abstractions. And that's going tocome in useful today as we look at this urgent topic area.

So, Liz, welcome back to the State of Belief!

ELIZABETH REINER PLATT, GUEST:

Thank you so much. I'm very glad to be back.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

This is exciting. It's exciting for all the wrong reasons in someways, that you're putting out this incredibly important report right now, ReligiousLiberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past and Future Claims. I haveto tell you, we're all going insane right now with what we're seeing all acrossthe board about immigration in this country. And it's just disgusting. And forme, you know, I'll just, I know I shouldn't start out with a rant, but I'mgoing to start out with a rant.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Go for it.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

You know, as a pastor and as someone who's just looking at, caresabout our society and cares about people, seeing these masked men abductingindividuals -just terrifying. And so anyway, what you've offered here in thisreport that I really want everyone to know about and to feel like they canaccess is an accessible understanding of the legal aspects of what is happeningright now. And it's a resource for the laypeople, like most of us, but also forlawyers and faith leaders and others. So let me just say, first of all, thankyou for all the hard work this represents. And maybe we can just start out withyour own understanding of the landscape into which this report is dropping.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Absolutely. So the report, it really is about the ways in which,despite the administration's rhetoric on religious liberty, its activities inthe immigration sphere are really attacking people of faith and communities offaith. You know this well with the work you do starting on day one of the Trumpadministration: the revocation of the sensitive locations policy that for 30years said, you know, very basic protection, you can't do ICE enforcementiInsideor right outside of a house of worship or a religious ritual, protectingpeople's right to feel safe practicing their faith, to his attacks on BishopMariann Budde for her very modest plea for…

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

Can we say how modest that was? I mean, it wasn't courageous. Itwas important, but it wasn't like she was being some sort of crazy, unhinged,radical. She was actually just preaching what most would call the Christian Gospel.So, yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt your flow.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

No, no, absolutely. And another thing that you've worked on atInterfaith Alliance, the letters that nonprofit organizations have receiveddemanding information and documents about anything they've ever done related toimmigration, to picking up and abducting, as you said, people on churchproperty, arresting religious refugees, including Christians from Iran,arresting faith leaders… It's horrific.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

It’s shocking. And here's the other really interesting piece ofthis, is going after, literally in the first couple of weeks, going after theCatholic bishops saying they were padding their bottom line - just for thestuff that they've been doing since the beginning, which is caring for refugeesand immigrants. This is not new activity.

But it's really interesting for JD Vance, who apparently is moreCatholic than the pope, to tell the Catholic bishops that they're moneylaundering, that they're padding their bottom line by doing this, the work thatthey're carrying out. It's religious freedom work, which is doing their work.And so I appreciate so much the way you're framing this. All of that should beunder the rubric of religious freedom that is being abrogated by thisadministration.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Absolutely. And, you know, faith communities have, of course, longbeen a huge part of the movement for immigration justice, going back to before this, but notably inrecent history, the Sanctuary Movement of the 1980s, in which congregationsworked with secular activists across the country to protect refugees coming tothe US from El Salvador, were prosecuted for those activities…

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

And even before that, HIAS, for those who don't know, HIAS, it wasstarted by Jewish organizations trying to bring persecuted Jews from around theworld to America. It's a refugee policy. In more recent years, it's beenincredibly important in bringing people of all faith traditions to the UnitedStates. It's completely broadened to all faith traditions. And HIAS, as youmentioned, is one of those groups that has been attacked specifically by theadministration, targeted for its its work, a Jewish-led organization targetedfor its immigration work.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Absolutely. So what the report tries to do is, tell just a smallpiece of that history; but also really talk about how, in addition to the waysthat religious communities have always shown up for immigrant justice throughthe power of the pulpit, through legislative advocacy, through doing that kindof on-the-ground resourcing, providing legal services, social services forimmigrants.

In addition to all those things that we've seen for a very longtime, there seems to me to be an increase in litigation tactics that rely onthe expansive right to religious liberty that has been created under theRoberts Court in cases that you've covered: Masterpiece Cake Shop, CatholicCharities.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

All these cases. This is really an important point, is that thiscourt has really just said, okay, well, basically, religious - and we talkedabout this, I think, the last time we talked was I think the cake, was it…

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Masterpiece Cake Shop.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

That's right. The cake shop. And I was just like, well, where doesit stop? And the idea that, basically, religious freedom has been so expandedthat it's become almost a get-out-of-jail-free card, for some things. I mean, thereinlies the rub.

Okay, Roberts Court, if you want to really expand the idea ofreligious freedom, what are we going to start including in that, and whosereligious freedom is it? Only this thin slice of radical Christian right thatwe're talking about? Or is it really everybody's religious freedom to live outtheir the mandates of their faith? And so I think that's a really importantpoint, because the landscape, technically, should be favorable to this, even ifthe administration is resistant to it.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Right. And, you know, I think it's a hard line to walk between - Idon't want to be Pollyannish and say that claim means advocating for religiousfreedom from a claimant who says that deportation would violate their religiousright to be part of their faith community, for example. I don't want to beoverly-ptimistic about how those places might fare in court. But I also don'twant to be under-optimistic.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

I think we don't want to leave tools on the table, is what I thinkyou're saying. I mean, like, okay, if this is the reality, if you've said thesetools are available to us, we're going to employ those tools. And the test willbe how - and this is, of course, me pretending to be a lawyer because I have alot of lawyers in my family - but, how consistent will you apply the law, ifyou say “religious freedom”? is that is that a fair part of what we're gettingat here?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

That's right. I think some of it is just a commitment to saying, ifnothing else, these laws, religious freedom, should be applied neutrally toeveryone. And it could be applied broadly, it could be applied narrowly, but wecan't treat only some people as legitimately religious. And so I think that's apart of it.

But I also think there are success stories here. There have been acouple really interesting and, to some people, I would say unexpected winsrecently in religious right to abortion litigation, for example. But in theimmigration context, we highlight the case of several volunteers during thefirst Trump administration, volunteers with the organization No More Deaths inArizona, who were arrested for leaving water in the desert for migrants to tryto prevent people from dying from dehydration. They were arrested for thoseactivities, and they successfully brought a religious liberty defense. so, youknow, again, I'm not trying to be Pollyannish, but I also think some of theseclaims do have legs.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

Let's talk a little bit about, there has been litigation in the - Ialmost called it Trump 2.0, which sounds a little too cutesy - in this recenthorror show that is the Trump administration. You know, the law has beenemployed in many ways. And what are some of the ways that you've seen religiousliberty, efforts that do show up, actually, in this report? Because I do thinksometimes there's so much information coming at us and so much news all thetime, and the legal landscape seems just like, there’s so much effort. So it'shelpful to pull out some of the ways that the law has been employed in - andspecifically religious freedom claims has been employed - as it relates toimmigration.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Sure. So I think one of the topics that's gotten the most presscoverage, I'll say, is there are now four lawsuits challenging that version ofthe sensitive locations policy that I mentioned up top.U p until, I think, thefourth one was filed yesterday, right as we were going to print, and I said,you know, “Stop the presses! There's now four!” So we did.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

There's no way to be endlessly current. But yeah. Okay, good.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

So there are now four challenges to that as a violation ofreligious liberty, saying, basically that people have the right to go to theirhouse of worship without being afraid of getting arrested.

There have been a host of cases on just, actually, a reallyincredible range of topics. So there have been two challenges that I know ofsaying that this horrific practice of holding people in third countriesindefinitely violates religious liberty, because as horrible as immigrationdetention is within the United States, there are theoretically legalprotections for religious practice. Those don't exist when you're being held ina third country. So we've seen those challenges.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

Let me just go back quickly to the sensitive spaces, because Ithink this is really also interesting. Some of the litigants in one of thefirst cases that was filed with Democracy Forward included the CooperativeBaptists who - along with the Sikh Coalition and the Friends, Quakers - theyhad never done anything like that before. But they realized that this is theirpeople, right? If you actually believe that you're a pastor, if you actuallybelieve that you're caring for a flock, these are your people who are beingpicked off by masked men and abducted.

And it is a terrible chilling effect on the practice of religionbecause people won't show up for faith, they won't show up to worship. And italso is just really a direct attack on the people that - you know, these arenot super-liberal organizations. These are religious organizations that feelthey have a religious mandate, which allows you, but it also demands that youcare for these people. And I just want to make sure that that sinks in: thatthere are legal things at play here, and underneath those legal things - andwhen we talk about religious freedom, those are commandments.

And in some ways they are, for Christians - in my tradition, it'sdescribed differently in other traditions - but in my tradition, if you'rewelcoming the stranger, you're actually welcoming Jesus. This isn't aperipheral idea; this is a central idea to what it means to actually be aChristian. And so I'm sorry to interrupt, but I do think it's important whenyou talk about sensitive spaces for lawsuits, that's a really important thingbecause this gets to the core of what it means to have the ability to practicereligion.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

And, you know, I think those cases, they talk about the violationof the religious liberty rights of the house of worship, the kind ofcorporation Itself, and saying we are forced to choose between our commitmentto being open and welcoming everyone and our commitment to keeping ourcongregations safe: we can either turn people away and close our doors and say,you're not allowed; or or we can put people at risk. So it talks about thereligious right of the house of worship, but it also talks about the religiousright of the congregants themselves, the immigrant congregants, who, again, theirown personal religious faith is being chilled.

You mentioned these are not extremely liberal congregations. I'llnote that two dioceses of the Catholic Church issued statements basicallytelling immigrant congregants that they don't have to go to mass. you don't getmore of an overt chilling of…

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

It shows you the radical reality of the situation. This is notnormal. This is not okay. I'm so grateful that you're putting out this report. I'mgoing to name it: Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Pastand Future Claims, because it's being put out into a moment that is, Iwould say a crisis for American legal community, religious community andself-understanding of what it means.

So, sensitive spaces, and then also the right to being able topractice your religion when you're incarcerated is, of course, completely gonewhen you're in a gulag in El Salvador. It’s incredible.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Right. Not to mention allyour other rights. I mean, religion just being one of them. But there wereclaims related to land use with Trump's efforts to build a border wall acrossthe southern border and across, again, certain religious spaces, including aCatholic diocese, La Lomita Chapel in Texas, and a sacred Native American siteas well. So there were two cases we highlight there, again, cases of people offaith being charged with harboring, under both federal and state harboring laws,just for their efforts to prevent people from dying in the desert: leavingfood, cooking for people, giving someone a place to spend the night.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

When people talk about, oh, I wish religious folks would do goodfor the community - that's what this is all about. And yet it's being attacked.It's being penalized there.

I don't know if you get into this because it may not directly apply,but for those of us who were watching what was happening in LA, there was a lotof religious activity. I'm sure you noticed that: there were lines of religiousleaders standing up. They were kind of putting themselves in between the policeand National Guard and Marines or whatever and the people.

There was also an incident of ICE stepping onto a church's parkinglot and being located there. And there was this pastor was just like, you can'tbe here. You are on private land, you're on my church's land, and I say, youcannot be here. Those may not immediately be litigatable, but it feelsimportant as far as our abilities to show up and to say what we need to say asfaith leaders.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

I think that kind of situation goes at the heart of the claims thatthey're making in the sensitive locations policy. So in that way it is litigatable.I'll just say the church communities and the religious communities I'm talkingto, like you said, they're terrified. they're terrified of that. I've gottenquestions: Can we keep opening our soup kitchen? Can we keep providing ESLclasses?

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

And they're worried because it looks like they're fostering positiveimmigration locations for people who want to learn English and want to actuallydo well in this country. It's really outrageous.

One of the things that's come up lately is our clergy themselvesbeing arrested. I don't know if you've seen any of those cases and what itmeans to have clergy start to be targeted in - whether it's the chaplain inCincinnati or other faith leaders who are, all of a sudden, being either hauledoff or being interrogated. Have you seen any of that?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

So the the chaplain case I think you're referring to, that makes methink of a couple different kinds of cases that we outlined in the report. Andone of them are incidents of people, both citizens and non-citizens, who werespecifically targeted by the administration, again in its first term, becauseof their faith-based activities.

So one of them is, there was a case by, four women who lived insanctuary churches. These are four undocumented women who were leaders in the NewSanctuary Movement, and themselves had taken sanctuary to protect themselvesand their families. And they were hit with outrageous civil fines for,essentially, failure to self-deport. and the claim they made was, we werespecifically targeted because of our faith-based activities, and this isactually intentionally trying to chill our religious exercise. Now, therewasn't a decision in that case because, thankfully, the civil fines weredropped with the change of the administration.

But there was a second claim that did win, actually, by a UScitizen pastor, Rev. Kaii Dousa. She is a pastor who's worked closely with theNew Sanctuary Coalition in New York, has traveled to Mexico several times tominister and to provide marriage ceremonies for migrants waiting to go into theUS. And she was specifically targeted by the administration. The administrationactually sent an email to the government of Mexico saying, don't let thisperson back in if she tries to enter Mexico again. She argued that, again, thisviolated her religious liberty rights. And she won. So, I think that thosecases come to mind saying that we have a religious right to practice our faithwithout being intentionally targeted.

But there have also been a handful of really interesting claims,none of which we've had decisions in, so it's kind of an open question how farthey could go, but basically saying that deportation itself is a violation ofcertain people's right to religious liberty. So, for example, there was a Seventh-DayAdventist man whose wife and children made a claim that our religious beliefsbelieve in family unity with the man as the spiritual head of the household,and that deportation of him, of their father and husband, would actuallyviolate their religious liberty rights.

So those are kind of two different ways, either the targeting orjust saying, I actually have a religious right to stay in my religiouscommunity in the United States. And we'll just have to kind of see where thosekinds of claims go.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

This is all so important. I want to just invite you to offer areflection, more broadly, on how you understand religious freedom now inAmerica - because what we're talking about is kind of saying, okay, religiousfreedom claims have just radically expanded. And we're going to say, okay,there's consequences to that – meaning, we're going to invite ourselves intothat.

But what are we seeing? The use of religion by this administrationis so toxic to me. Andthe idea of, okay, we have an anti-Christian bias task force that's going to goin, and anybody who says anything against any… And the worst kind of religiousproselytizing, who's using their faith to say, I don't want to serve the LGBTQpeople or whatever. That's really what they're talking about. They can use thisreligious freedom card and they can say, well, we're allowed to do this.

And it's tricky, because we want people to have free exercise. Wewant people to feel free to practice their religion. But often, there issomeone at the receiving end of this, and the consequence of someone saying,oh, well, I don't have to serve you because of my religion. I don't have to beinvolved with you because of my religion. I mean, let's remember, theprohibitions against intermarriage and the segregation of lunch counters. Theywould point immediately to the Bible for that. So, where are we with religiousfreedom in America? I know you think about this too much. I know I’m phrasingit in such a, you know, dumbed down version.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

What a big and important question. So, a huge amount of litigationthat is taking place right now on religious freedom is being litigated,actually, not under the Constitution, but under a statute called the ReligiousFreedom Restoration Act. and what that statute says is that you have a right toa religious exemption from an act of the federal government that substantiallyburdens your sincere exercise of religion, unless the government can show thatthe burden it's placing on you is necessary to advance compelling governmentinterest. And each little piece of that test I just laid out can be kind oflitigated and argued about, but basically, overall, that test should have roomto consider the harms that your requested religious exemption is going toimpose on other people.

We would hope that the government would, for example, find thatthere is a compelling government interest that is narrowly tailored toenforcing major anti-discrimination laws on people. That's not how it's alwaysshaken out in courts, but that there should be room in the test that I justlaid out to consider harms. And I think we absolutely should consider the harmsthat requested religious exemptions across the theological and politicalspectrums might impose on third parties.

But I think the reality is that most of these claims - you know, givingwater to people crossing the desert doesn't impose any of the kinds of horribleharms that we're seeing in some of these other cases. And actually, if there'sa really powerful decision in one of those No More Deaths cases where thegovernment tried to argue, oh, no, no, we have to prosecute these peoplebecause we have this compelling interest in protecting the border. You know,everything you might imagine.

And the court, the judge,said, you're trying to argue that you have a government interest in a policy ofdeterrence by death. That was the court's words. And they said that that'shorrific. and I thought that was really powerful, because it wasn't about, youknow, we can't consider harms on third parties. It was saying, you're trying totell me, government, that you have an interest in people dying of dehydration.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

That's powerful. You've really laid it out clearly, and as yousaid, each one of those words - I've heard the question of sincerely heldbeliefs - that's also like, okay, who gets to say this is sincerely held? So again,how does all of this talk about religious freedom and rights intersect with agovernment that is, by extension, an effort at promoting a certain kind of WhiteChristian Nationalism? You and I have talked about these kind of issues before,but you and I have not talked since this administration took power.

And I do think, it is shocking the level of - I don't know. It's notlack of awareness. It's a very aware intention. I use the phrase, this is themost anti-religious administration we've seen in years, because any religionthat is not in lockstep with their political aims is suspect. And the only oneswho are given this freedom to their religion are those who are viewed as alliesof the administration.

And so it it undermines the very idea of religious freedom as aconcept that is embedded in the First Amendment, and something that we shouldall be grateful for because I am grateful for it. But the way I see religionwielded by this administration has been horrific. You're in the center of it,really looking at the legal aspect of it. And your jaw must be on the floor, aswell.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

It's horrible. And it's also been a very long process. You know,one thing I think a lot about is, the Trump administration obviously has andwields an enormous amount of power; but they also have an enormousinfrastructure and base of this Christian conservative legal movement that hasbeen working for a very long time. I think a lot about resources, and I think alot about the long game. And one of the things that I think our center wasfounded to do and that we try to do is, if you are one of these folks who'strying to find a lawyer to say, I have a religious right as a teacher to misgendermy students, you're going to find it very easy to find a big, well-funded lawfirm to represent your case.

If you are someone who's saying, you know, I have a religious rightto help migrants, to welcome the stranger - there isn't that enormous legalinfrastructure to help you. And so we really - we're a very small shop, but wetry to be very practical in creating legal tools in a very complicated area ofthe law for faith groups that aren't going to be welcomed by, just to name it, AllianceDefending Freedom and the other big Christian right legal players.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

I am so glad you brought this up. And you're absolutely right. Youknow, long game resources - this has been built. I mean, all of it has beenbuilt. The Roberts Court has been built. Absolutely did not come out ofnothing. It came out of an intention. It came out of massive amounts ofinvestment, and a long game plan.

When did, what is it, Alliance Defending Freedom, is that theireuphemism? When were they founded? Do you know, is it like 30 years?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

I believe it's 1993.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

That’s so interesting. So this is also when Ralph Reed, PatRobertson, Jerry Falwell - I mean, that's actually exactly when we were foundedat Interfaith Alliance, recognizing the moment not as a legal organization, butthey were kind of like, okay, how are we going to make sure that, legally, weget what we want? And, and what they want is not what the American people want,but it's where a thin slice of the American people are getting power and theability to wield religion. And it's very frustrating, because I actually thinkwhen you put across the broad understanding of what religious freedom can be,most people get it and they want it, but what they don't like is this idea of, Iget to invade your public school. That is just the craziest thing for me.

I'm not sure that you all do as much in that area, but the wholeencroachment of religion into public schools and kind of dictating a religious normto the rest of the religious community and saying, oh, no, that's justcultural. America was built on that. No, no, no. And I'm just mystified, as apastor and as a parent of kids in public school: you really want some randomperson interpreting the Ten Commandments? All right. Let's have the teacher whogoes through and says, as an exercise today, kids, we have the Ten Commandmentson our wall. Let's go through and see all the ones that Donald Trump hasbroken. That could be an exercise. They're not assured to get what they want.

How do you think of religious liberty? And, in terms of the thisbattle over public schools?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Well, the first thing that comes to mind is the Mahmoud decision,which I'm sure you've already talked about, which is this case that just camedown that said, basically, that public school teachers are now going to have topredict what materials some parent of one of their classmates are going to findcontrary to their religious beliefs, and affirmatively provide an opt-out. It'snot possible to follow. It's simply not possible to follow. And I don't thinkit was really intended to actually be followed for everyone. I think it wasintended to do what the justices wanted in this case, which is, basically, tochill any mention of LGBTQ people in the classroom.

But they're creating these doctrines that simply can't be followed.And the idea, the opinion said something like, you know, of course, how can weexpect parents to tolerate their kids being exposed to these ideas that goagainst their religious belief? And it just seemed so absurd to me.

You know, I'm a religious minority, you understand that yourchildren are going to be exposed to things that you do not agree with or thatdon't match your culture. And it's your job as a parent to talk to yourchildren. I just think of, my daughter had an elf on the shelf in her classroom!It never occurred to me to sue about it.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

During arguments, I spoke with my colleague Maggie Siddiqi. I'm agay man with kids in public school, and my kids go to school with so manydifferent kinds of people. And, you know, I live in New York City. They'resurrounded by people who are not like us. And yet I want my kids, actually, toknow people who are not like us - not because I want them to be something else;it's because I want them to understand that living in a neighborhood that isdiverse, whether that's an immediate neighborhood or a country as aneighborhood, is involves being with people who are different from you, andunderstanding that that's just going to exist.

And, you know, I'm sorry, you can't just say, this is an effort. Ifthey were true, truly, they would say what it is, which is an effort to eraseLGBTQ people from existence, and have only stories that have certain kinds of…You could next say, I don't want any stories that don't have two parents, youknow, heterosexual parents. But if you look at Goodnight Moon - it'sjust a grandma with a bunny. You know, I'm like, I object. Where are theparents to supervise?

So I just feel it's so sad. It's really so sad, the idea that wecan't be around people who are different from us, and we can't learn. I want my kids to learn about other people. Ireally do. And I think that in my school, there's not a lot of other kids whohave gay parents. But they don't feel bad. And occasionally, maybe, there's agay character in somewhere, but they also don't even talk about that. Itdoesn't have to be a major deal. Someone made it a major deal. And I reallythink it comes back to this law machine that has created. I think behind all ofthis is the Defending Free, Alliance Defending Freedom or whatever they are. Youknow what I mean? Like, is really pushing this idea.

And so it just felt so sad to me. And my husband was like, well,maybe we need to go to a private school. And I was just like, that's so sadthat we have to abandon public school because someone has decided to try toerase our family from existence. And if you look at the stories that are there,it's not like: “And here are some gay parents and you should really respecteveryone and even, like, accept them!” They're not even the topic of the story.There's another moral, and there just happen to be incidentally same gender.

Anyway. There's a lot of sad examples, and it's all by intention. Butthere are great people like you and great groups like the Law, Rights andReligion Project that are keeping our spirits up and our hope alive. You have anew report, Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past andFuture Claims that's available. If you're a layperson, you can understandit. If you're a law person… A law person, also known as a lawyer, you can alsounderstand. If you're a faith leader or from a faith community, you canunderstand it. It's a really valuable and readable resource.

Let me just ask what I'm asking everybody. Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaumhas been on the show; she said, nobody can do everything, but everybody can dosomething. And I think that's such an important idea. If there's one thing thatyou would hope that a listener of this program might do as part of their senseof like democracy work or faith work or whatever, what would you love for themto do or be aware of or have in their minds?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Very good question. You know, one thing - it's a small thing, but Ialways like to encourage people to just take a beat when they hear the term “religiousliberty” in a news article and a law and a politician's speech and just say, what is this person talkingabout, really? A religious liberty right to do what? A religious liberty rightfor who? Because I think one of the ways that we've gotten here is that we'vebeen listening to just the loudest voice in the room on religious liberty, andthat's not actually what they want. They don't actually want religious libertyfor everyone, often.

So it's not the only thing that I think people should be doing, butI think it's a small thing, is just think a little bit more critically abouthow that term is wielded and about what it should mean, and who it shouldprotect and how.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

I love that. Elizabeth Reiner Platt has been leading the Law, Rightsand Religion Project since 2015. She has just released a new report, which isso important, Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past andFuture Claims.

Liz, thank you so much for joining me on The State of Belief. It'salways a pleasure to talk to you.

Small business owners and local school district representatives were present along with several officials, including California Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva, Orange County 2nd District Supervisor Vicente Sarmiento, Anaheim Councilmember Natalie Rubalcava and North Orange County Chamber of Commerce President Andrew Gregson.

ICE raids were confirmed to be in Orange County after ICE was spotted around the Santa Ana Civic Center on June 9. The raids most notably affected the construction, tourism and hospitality industries. Following that week, targeted ICE raids began in Irvine on June 12.

KTLA reports that ICE arrested more than 2,700 immigrants in the Los Angeles area since June 6.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, there were approximately 236,000 undocumented immigrants living in Orange County in 2019. Out of the 227,000 who were of working age, 67% were employed. The top industries these immigrants were employed in are accommodation and food services, manufacturing, construction and professional services.

“ICE raids are creating fear and disrupting our economy, hurting our local businesses, and putting tremendous pressure on our schools,” Quirk-Silva said in a press release. “We need immigration policies that reflect our values, protect working families and strengthen, not weaken, the communities that make California what it is.”

4th Street Market, also known as La Cuatro, is home to many small businesses and is a social hub in Santa Ana, Calif. The lack of street vendors, foot traffic and open businesses are a result of the impact ICE has had on the community. Business owners in Santa Ana have reported low customer attendance since June 11. According to the California Immigrant Data Portal, immigrants have approximately $354 billion in spending power.

The economic impacts are felt statewide. In Quirk-Silva’s press release, she notes that 45% of agricultural workers have stopped showing up to work, and California’s GDP is projected to decrease by 0.25%.

Private sector employment decreased by 3.1% following raids in Los Angeles, and contributions of $51.4 billion in state and local taxes and $81.8 billion in federal taxes are at risk.

During the press conference, officials also addressed the impact ICE raids have on schools. Many community colleges reported a decrease in student enrollment.

“We’ve heard from students who are afraid to attend class, parents who disappeared from drop-off lines and faculty witnessing the growing silence of a once vibrant classroom,” North Orange County Community College District Chancellor Byron D. Clift Breland said during the press conference. “We’ve seen, in certain areas, a reduction in enrollment go down as much as 50% in ESL and our adult education courses.”

Orange County proposed multiple measures to combat ICE, but few have been successful. In a recent Orange City Council meeting, a resolution that would’ve required ICE agents to reveal their identification while working failed to pass.

Council Members Arianna Barrios and Ana Gutierrez, who proposed the resolution, also requested that the City of Orange add a page to the city’s website with resources to help families who have been impacted by ICE raids. However, that request was denied.

Other cities in Orange County, including Anaheim, Irvine and Santa Ana, have pages on their city websites with resources regarding ICE raids available to them.

In a press conference on June 12, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that ICE will continue to remain in California until they “liberate the city of Los Angeles.”

“We are not going away. We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into this city,” Noem said in the press conference.

Until then, Orange County will continue to feel the impact.

“Something deeply wrong is happening,” Quirk-Silva said. “These raids have not made us safer, they’ve made us more afraid. They have pulled parents from homes, workers from job sites and children from classrooms.”

The appeals court said that a part of the July 11 temporary restraining order referring to ""except as permitted by law"" was too vague.
The appeals court panel said that the government did not dispute constitutional issues when trying to get the temporary restraining order stayed.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, called the appeals court ruling a victory.
""Today is a victory for the rule of law and for the City of Los Angeles,"" she said in a statement.","LOS ANGELES — An appeals court on Friday kept in place a Los Angeles federal judge's ruling that bars immigration agents from using a person's spoken language or job, like day laborer, as the sole pretext to detain them.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling that there seemed to be one issue with U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's temporary restraining order, but it did not put it on hold as the government sought.

The appeals court said that a part of the July 11 temporary restraining order referring to ""except as permitted by law"" was too vague.

""Defendants, however, are not likely to succeed on their remaining arguments,"" the court ruled, referring to the U.S. government.

Frimpong, a judge at the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, issued the temporary restraining order after a lawsuit was filed by people who claimed they were detained by immigration officers without good reason.

Three people were waiting at a bus stop for jobs when they were detained by immigration officials, and two others are U.S. citizens who claim they were stopped and aggressively questioned despite telling agents they were citizens. Other organizations, including the United Farm Workers, also sued.

Frimpong wrote in the temporary restraining order ruling that the people suing were “likely to succeed in proving that the federal government is indeed conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers.”

The July 11 restraining order bars the detention of people unless the officer or agent “has reasonable suspicion that the person to be stopped is within the United States in violation of U.S. immigration law.”

It says they may not base that suspicion solely on a person’s apparent race or ethnicity; the fact that they’re speaking Spanish or English with an accent; their presence at a particular location like a bus stop or a day laborer pickup site; or the type of work one does.

Los Angeles has been targeted by the Trump administration for immigration raids that the city's mayor has decried as a campaign to terrorize residents.

The lawsuit that led to the temporary restraining order was filed against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and others.

Kyle Harvick, the deputy incident commander for the government's immigration action in Los Angeles, said that ""certain types of businesses, including carwashes,"" were chosen by immigration agents ""because past experiences have demonstrated that illegal aliens utilize and seek work at these locations,"" according to the appeals court ruling.

The appeals court found that ""the four enumerated factors at issue — apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, particular location, and type of work, even when considered together — describe only a broad profile and 'do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop.'""

The appeals court panel said that the government did not dispute constitutional issues when trying to get the temporary restraining order stayed.

“They did not meaningfully dispute the district court’s conclusion that sole reliance on the four enumerated factors, alone or in combination, does not satisfy the constitutional requirement of reasonable suspicion,” the appeals court panel wrote.

Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation at Public Counsel, which is among the groups representing the people who sued, said Friday that the actions by immigration agents in the Los Angeles operation were unconstitutional.

""Today’s ruling sends a powerful message: the government cannot excuse illegal conduct by relying on racial profiling as a tool of immigration enforcement,"" Rosenbaum said. ""These raids were unconstitutional, unsupported by evidence, and rooted in fear and harmful stereotypes, not public safety.""

The appeals court did find that part of Frimpong’s temporary order was vague, relating to ""except as permitted by law"" in the clause about detaining people based on the four factors of race, speaking Spanish, a location or type of work. But it otherwise denied the government's motion for a stay.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, called the appeals court ruling a victory.

""Today is a victory for the rule of law and for the City of Los Angeles,"" she said in a statement. ""The Temporary Restraining Order that has been protecting our communities from immigration agents using racial profiling and other illegal tactics when conducting their cruel and aggressive enforcement raids and sweeps will remain in place for now.""

The immigration raids launched in Los Angeles in June resulted in large protests in the city, some of which turned violent. The Trump administration sent National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in a move that was condemned by Bass, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin rejected claims that immigration enforcement is based on race or ethnicity, saying agents are targeting individuals who are in the country without legal authorization. She also accused “unelected judges"" of ""undermining the will of the American people.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250708-ice-rs-d1a915.jpg",N,,2025-08-03 04:56:34.869327

The Denver protest was led by Colorado 50501, which also organized “Good Trouble” demonstrations honoring civil rights leader John Lewis on July 17, and “No Kings” anti-Trump protests in mid-June. The “Rage Against the Regime” protests, which were planned in more than 300 cities across the United States, focused on bringing communities “together to transform anger into action, harnessing the energy of collective resistance,” according to the 50501 website.

Several local left-leaning groups, including the Denver chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the immigrant rights group Aurora Unidos CSO, set up booths in front of the Capitol on Saturday.

The demonstrators protested President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations, the elimination of federal funding for public media by Congress, and mass layoffs at several federal agencies, among other Trump administration priorities.

At around 12:15 p.m., organizers led chants of “When we fight, we win” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,” which were met with clapping from the crowd and honks from passing cars.

Brandon Quintanilla, a co-founder of Aurora Unidos CSO, called for protestors to “stand up for our immigrant communities and educate our neighbors.” Quintanilla, 23, said members of his family were deported several years ago, adding that “these attacks on our people have been happening for years, and they have only escalated to unprecedented levels under the Trump administration.”

“We are all well aware of the attacks on our people: masked (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents picking up our parents as they pick up the trash, our siblings being picked up on the way to work or to immigration court,” Quintanilla said.

Protestors yelled “shame” when Quintanilla mentioned the recent federal Republican tax cut and spending law’s allocation of $170 billion in funding for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Denver residents Phaedra Andersen, 54, and Nancy Andersen, 71, have attended several anti-Trump protests in the past eight months. The mother-daughter duo first got involved in community organizing decades ago. Phaedra’s first protest was at age 13, against apartheid in South Africa, while Nancy started out with Vietnam War protests.

“I am hoping that we can break this cycle of human rights violations,” Nancy said. “If anyone’s rights are violated, all of our rights can be attacked. We are on the very edge of losing our democracy.”

Robynn Bartholomew, 52, attended the Denver protest carrying dozens of handmade bracelets beaded with the word “resist.” She stood near the Capitol and handed them out for free to fellow demonstrators.

“I just wanted to do what I could, what’s in my lane, to lift people up, because this is a marathon, not a sprint,” Bartholomew said. “Every day there’s a new thing that can bring you down, but I’m trying to make people smile.

And in many ways, it has worked — particularly when it comes to gender-affirming care for minors.
Mainstream U.S. medical associations have supported gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria for years.
Instead, it has aggressively tried to eradicate gender-affirming care nationwide, regardless of state laws — like those in California — that protect it.","California and a coalition of other liberal-led states sued the Trump administration Friday over efforts to end gender-affirming care for transgender, intersex and nonbinary children and young adults nationwide — calling them an unconstitutional attack on LGBTQ+ patients, healthcare providers and states’ rights.

The lawsuit was brought by California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta and officials from 15 other states and the District of Columbia. It challenges a Jan. 28 executive order by President Trump that denounced gender-affirming care as “mutilation” and called on U.S. Justice Department officials to effectively enforce a ban, including by launching investigations into healthcare providers.

The lawsuit notes the Justice Department last month sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics that have provided such care nationwide, with justice officials suggesting they may face criminal prosecution.

Bonta’s office, in a statement, said such efforts “have no legal basis and are intended to discourage providers from offering lifesaving healthcare that is lawful under state law.” The lawsuit asks a federal court in Massachusetts to vacate Trump’s order in its entirety for exceeding federal authority and undermining state laws that guarantee equal access to healthcare.

In a statement to The Times, a Justice Department spokesperson said that, as U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi “has made clear, this Department of Justice will use every legal and law enforcement tool available to protect innocent children from being mutilated under the guise of ‘care.’”

Trump made reining in transgender rights a key promise of his presidential campaign. Upon taking office, he moved swiftly to do so through executive orders, funding cuts and litigation. And in many ways, it has worked — particularly when it comes to gender-affirming care for minors.

Clinics across the country that had provided such care have closed their doors in response to the threats and funding cuts. That includes the renowned Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, one of the largest and oldest pediatric gender clinics in the United States.

The clinic told thousands of its patients and their families that it was shuttering last month. Other clinics have similarly closed nationwide, radically reducing the availability of such care in the country.

Republicans and other Trump supporters have cheered the closures as a major win, and they praised the president for protecting impressionable and confused children from so-called woke medical professionals pushing what they allege to be dangerous and irreversible treatments.

Bonta said in the Friday statement that Trump and his administration’s “relentless attacks” on such care were “cruel and irresponsible” and endangered “already vulnerable adolescents whose health and well-being are at risk.”

“These actions have created a chilling effect in which providers are pressured to scale back on their care for fear of prosecution, leaving countless individuals without the critical care they need and are entitled to under law,” Bonta said.

Mainstream U.S. medical associations have supported gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria for years. They and LGBTQ+ rights organizations have accused Trump and his supporters of mischaracterizing that care, which includes therapy, counseling and support for social transitioning, and can include puberty blockers, hormone treatment and, in rarer circumstances, mastectomies.

Queer advocates, many patients and their families say such care is life-saving, alleviating intense distress — and suicidal thoughts — in transgender and other gender-nonconforming youth. They and many mainstream medical experts acknowledge that gender-affirming care for young people is still a developing field, but say it is also based on decades of solid research by medical professionals who are far better equipped than politicians to help families make difficult medical decisions.

However, as the number of children who identify as transgender or nonbinary has rapidly increased in recent years, that argument has failed to take hold in many parts of the country. Conservatives and Republican leaders have grown increasingly alarmed by such care, pointing to young people who changed their minds about transitioning and now regret the care they received.

Some of those young people, including Chloe Cole, a prominent “detransitioner” from California, are among the administration’s most vocal supporters. In a post on X last month, Cole praised the closure of the Children’s Hospital clinic in L.A. as the beginning of the end to gender-affirming care in liberal states, writing: “Let’s finish the job!”

The battle has played out in the courts, in part as a state’s rights issue. In June, the Supreme Court ruled that conservative states may ban puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender teens, with the court’s conservative majority finding that states are generally free to set their own standards of medical care.

The Trump administration, however, has not taken the same view. Instead, it has aggressively tried to eradicate gender-affirming care nationwide, regardless of state laws — like those in California — that protect it.

Trump’s Jan. 28 executive order, titled “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” claimed that “medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child’s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions.”

It defined children as anyone under the age of 19, and said that moving forward, the U.S. wouldn’t “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another,” but would “rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.”

The states’ lawsuit focuses on one particular section of that order, which directed Bondi to convene state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials nationwide to begin investigating gender-affirming care providers and other groups that “may be misleading the public about long-term side effects of chemical and surgical mutilation.”

The section suggested those investigations could be based on laws against “female genital mutilation,” or even around a 1938 law known as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to regulate food, drugs, medical devices and cosmetics.

On July 9, Bondi announced the Justice Department’s subpoenas to healthcare providers, saying doctors and hospitals “that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology will be held accountable.”

On July 25, The Times reported that Bill Essayli, the Trump administration’s controversial pick for U.S. attorney in L.A., had floated the idea of criminally charging doctors and hospitals for providing gender-affirming care, according to two federal law enforcement sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

The targeting of gender-affirming care is part of a wider effort by the administration to eliminate transgender rights more broadly, in part on the premise that transgender people do not exist. On his first day in office, Trump issued another executive order declaring there are only two sexes.

His administration has sought to limit the options transgender people have to get passports that reflect their identities, and the Justice Department has sued California over its policies allowing transgender girls to compete against other girls in youth sports. Many transgender Americans are looking for ways to flee the country.

Still, many in the LGBTQ+ community fear the attacks are only going to get worse. Among those who are most scared are the parents of transgender children — including those who believe their health records may have been collected under the Justice Department’s subpoenas.

One mother of a Children’s Hospital patient told The Times last month that she is terrified the Justice Department is “going to come after parents and use the female genital mutilation law ... to prosecute parents and separate me from my child.”

Bonta said his office has not heard of any parents being targeted, but he hasn’t ruled it out as a possibility, given the Trump administration’s actions to date.

“If they’re willing to use nonexistent law to attack providers, what would stop them from going after parents as well, as they wage these cultural wars?” Bonta said during a Friday morning news conference.

Bonta is leading the lawsuit along with the attorneys general of Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York. Joining them are Pennsylvania Gov.

A group of about 100 community members, clergy and Haitian leaders in Springfield, Ohio, gathered this week for several days of training sessions as they prepare to defend potential deportees and provide them refuge.

“We feel that this is something that our faith requires, that people of faith are typically law-abiding people — that’s who we want to be — but if there are laws that are unjust, if there are laws that don’t respect human dignity, we feel that our commitment to Christ requires that we put ourselves in places where we may face some of the same threats,” said Carl Ruby, senior pastor of Central Christian Church.

Ruby said the ultimate goal of the group is to persuade the Trump administration to reverse its decision to terminate legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Haitians in the U.S. under temporary protected status, or TPS.

“One way of standing with the Haitians is getting out the message of how much value they bring to the city of Springfield,” he said. “It would be an absolute disaster if we lost 10,000 of our best workers overnight because their TPS ends and they can no longer work.”

In lieu of that, Ruby said participants in the effort are learning how to help Haitians in other ways. That includes by building relationships, accompanying migrants to appointments with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and providing their families with physical shelter.

Springfield in crosshairs of immigration debate

Springfield found itself in an unwelcome spotlight last year after Trump amplified false rumors during a presidential debate that members of the mid-sized city’s burgeoning Haitian population were abducting and eating cats and dogs. It was the type of inflammatory and anti-immigrant rhetoric he promoted throughout his campaign.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in June that it would terminate TPS as soon as Sept. 2 for about 500,000 Haitians who are already in the United States, some of whom have lived here for more than a decade. The department said conditions in the island nation have improved adequately to allow their safe return.

The announcement came three months after the Trump administration revoked legal protections for thousands of Haitians who arrived legally in the country under a humanitarian parole program as part of a series of measures implemented to curb immigration. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal judge’s order preventing the administration from revoking the parole program.

Earlier this month, a federal judge in New York blocked the administration from accelerating an end to Haitians’ TPS protections, which the Biden administration had extended through at least Feb. 3, 2026, due to gang violence, political unrest, a major earthquake in 2021 and several other factors.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said at the time that the Trump administration would eventually prevail and that its predecessors treated TPS like a “de facto asylum program.” In the meantime, the government has set the expiration date back to early February.

TPS allows people already in the United States to stay and work legally if their homelands are deemed unsafe. Immigrants from 17 countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan and Lebanon, were receiving those protections before Trump took office for his second term in January.

Residents ponder what actions to take

Charla Weiss, a founding member of Undivided, the group that hosted the Springfield workshop, said participants were asked the question of how far they would go to help Haitian residents avoid deportation.

“The question that I know was before me is how far am I willing to go to support my passion about the unlawful detainment and deportation of Haitians, in particular here in Springfield,” she said.

Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a longtime supporter of the Haitian community, was briefed by Springfield leaders during a visit to the city Friday. He told reporters that the state is bracing for the potential of mass layoffs in the region as a result of the TPS policy change, a negative for both the workers and the companies that employ them.

“It’s not going to be good,” he said.

The move came in a ruling by Judge Jia M. Cobb of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that blocked the administration’s termination of a Biden-era program that allowed migrants fleeing Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti to stay in the United States for up to two years. The ruling halted, for now, the rapid removal of individuals paroled into the United States “at any time.”

The Trump administration had announced the end of the program in March. It has since issued a number of other directives authorizing expedited removals by immigration agents and suspended or terminated programs that had allowed various groups of noncitizens to enter the country on a temporary basis.

In her ruling, Judge Cobb said the case presented “a question of fair play,” expressing dismay at what she described as an already tenuous legal landscape shifting under migrants’ feet at the whim of the Trump administration. She noted recent efforts to step up detention and deportation quotas, leaving migrants subject to rapid deportation at the hands of immigration agents, often with little recourse to challenge their arrest or removal through normal channels.

“In a world of bad options, they played by the rules,” she wrote of the migrants admitted under the program. “Now, the Government has not only closed off those pathways for new arrivals but changed the game for parolees already here, restricting their ability to seek immigration relief and subjecting them to summary removal despite statutory law prohibiting the executive branch from doing so.”

Judge Cobb, a Biden appointee, also noted a marked rise in expedited removals after pressure from Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, who in May demanded that Immigration and Customs Enforcement step up immigration arrests to 3,000 per day.

Judge Cobb took particular exception to the government’s use of expedited removal more generally, noting that it left people who might be seeking other avenues to stay in the country legally deprived of access to their families or lawyers.

She highlighted the experience of several of the individuals involved the lawsuit, who had sought to remain in the country legally since being admitted but had been arrested by ICE agents immediately upon leaving hearings in immigration court.

“This case’s underlying question, then, asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their case within a system of rules,” she wrote in a passage dotted with case references. “Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country that — as they are swept up at checkpoints and outside courtrooms, often by plainclothes officers without explanation or charges — may look to them more and more like the countries they tried to escape.”

“By design, the expedited removal process offers few opportunities to raise objections to eligibility for removal, or to get a neutral adjudicator’s eyes on such objections,” she added.

It was not fully clear exactly how many people were covered by the order, which Judge Cobb wrote applied to “individuals who have been, at any time, paroled into the United States at a point of entry.” As of last year, more than 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela had entered the country through the program, but many people were granted parole from other countries as well.

The ruling came after a federal judge in California blocked the administration on Thursday from pulling protections offered by another program, known as Temporary Protected Status, from around 60,000 migrants from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.

The North Carolina General Assembly overrode Governor Josh Stein's veto of a bill that requires greater collaboration between police and federal immigration enforcement.

Legislators bypassed Stein to approve House Bill 318, which strengthens a law passed last year requiring cooperation between North Carolina sheriffs and Immigration Customs Enforcement. The new laws expand when authorities must check the immigration status of prisoners.

Those arrested for nonviolent offenses like fraud or impaired driving must be checked under the new laws.

Veronica Aguilar is the communication director for the North Carolina-based Latino immigrant rights group El Pueblo. She said the governor raised valid concerns about constitutional violations, such as racial discrimination from ICE.

""It will exacerbate fear and uncertainty in our communities,"" said Aguilar. 'We also fear that this will discourage victims and witnesses from reporting crimes, and increasing the insecurity of all communities.""

GOP supporters of the new law say it addresses public safety concerns. It goes into effect in October.

House Bill 318 also delays the start of a mandatory 48-hour detainment period for immigrants while local authorities wait for ICE to take custody, requiring sheriffs to notify the agency before releasing them.

This raises fears among immigrant rights groups of human rights abuses. Aguilar said laws like this passed in other states have been touted as hard on crime.

""What happens is that people fall into the cracks,"" said Aguilar, ""people who aren't committing these crimes, who are not serious offenders, who maybe have never had a criminal history before also end up being affected and detained, deported and separated from their families because of laws like this.""

Aguilar said it's important for community members to know their rights.

Earlier this year El Pueblo released ""Safe Families: An Emergency Guide for Immigrants"" to assist with that.

""One of the things that's very important is that you do not have to state your status,"" said Aguilar, ""and if you are not being arrested then you may ask if you are free to leave.""",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-08-03 05:56:40.243945

The Trump Administration is committed to restoring integrity to our immigration system and to our justice system.""","A panel of federal judges on Friday limited President Trump's effort to close the U.S. asylum system at the southern border, saying his administration can't unilaterally suspend laws that bar the U.S. from deporting migrants to places where they would face persecution or torture.

The ruling centers on a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump just hours after he returned to the White House in January, ordering the closure of the asylum system. U.S. border officials have relied on the order to summarily expel those entering the country illegally, without allowing them to request asylum. Mr. Trump justified the sweeping measure on the grounds that the country is facing an ""invasion"" of migrants.

The three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit lifted its administrative pause on a July ruling from a federal judge who found Mr. Trump's proclamation defied U.S. laws that require the federal government to hear the claims of migrants who want to apply for humanitarian protection out of fear that they could be harmed if deported.

That ruling by U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss struck down the Trump administration's asylum ban and would've required officials to stop enforcing it on a legal class comprised of migrants who are or will be in the U.S.

While it lifted its stay on Moss' ruling, the D.C. Circuit panel also narrowed his order, limiting the class members eligible for relief to asylum-seekers already on American soil while Mr. Trump's decree is in effect. The appellate court also limited the scope of Moss' ruling, partially granting a request from the Trump administration.

The panel allowed the Trump administration to continue using the president's proclamation to deny migrants access to the U.S. asylum system, noting that U.S. law permits, but does not require, the government to grant asylum to those who prove they could be persecuted because of their race, religion, politics or other factors.

But the panel also said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to prevent migrants from applying for other forms of humanitarian protections that the U.S. is legally required to give to certain migrants fleeing persecution and torture. They're known as ""withholding of removal"" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Those protections have a higher legal threshold than asylum, but unlike asylum, they are mandatory, not discretionary, and must be granted to those who meet the requirements.

The panel was made up of Circuit Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, who were appointed by former President Barack Obama, as well as Gregory G. Katsas, an appointee of Mr. Trump. Each judge filed their own statements in the case, with Pillard and Katsas disagreeing with some aspects of the ruling.

While they had some disagreements, all three judges said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to ignore laws around ""withholding of removal"" or Convention Against Torture protections. Pillard said she would've also blocked the administration from denying migrants the right to apply for asylum.

The judges scheduled expedited proceedings to decide the merits of the case, asking both the government and the advocates challenging Mr. Trump's proclamation to file briefs through Sept. 26.

The lawsuit that triggered Friday's decision was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates, who have denounced the Trump administration's border crackdown as a draconian policy that has sent migrants to harm's way.

""The President secured the border in record time at an unprecedented level by using every available legal tool provided by Congress,"" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. ""A rogue district judge took those tools away, threatening the safety and security of Americans and ignoring a Supreme Court decision issued only days earlier admonishing district courts for granting nationwide injunctions. The Trump Administration is committed to restoring integrity to our immigration system and to our justice system.""

Trump administration officials have credited the president's proclamation and other actions — including the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the southern border — for a historic drop in illegal crossings there.

In July, just 4,600 migrants were caught crossing the southern border illegally, the lowest monthly tally recorded by Border Patrol and a figure the Biden administration reported daily during many months. While public monthly reports started in fiscal year 2000, annual data suggest the last time Border Patrol had that level of apprehensions was in the 1960s.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/02/b58ac520-1b0a-4d97-a188-a44d20cc28de/thumbnail/1200x630/10a3016b5bab3459d2720bf39193c2ab/gettyimages-2227352665.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 02:56:27.815569

Joe Neguse joined a dozen House Democrats on Wednesday in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new policy that limits congressional lawmakers’ access to federal immigration detention centers.

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security recently implemented a rule requiring members of Congress to give seven days’ notice before visiting detention centers while limiting access to certain Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices.

The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates a federal law that allows for unannounced inspections of detention centers by Congress. While the Department of Homeland Security can issue guidance on how much notice lawmakers should give, federal law allows for immediate entry.

“Such blatant disregard for both the law and the constitutional order by the Trump administration warrants a serious and decisive response, which is why I’m proud to lead the lawsuit we proceeded with earlier today,” Neguse said in a statement.

Neguse’s office raised concerns about reports of “mistreatment, overcrowding,” and “unsanitary conditions” in detention centers.

Detentions of immigrants have risen sharply since the beginning of Trump’s second term, particularly over the past few months. Data released by ICE in late July shows the agency currently holding nearly 57,000 people, a record.

Data shows that nearly half of detainees — 26,474 people — do not have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges, but are instead listed as an “other immigration violator.” Nearly 30% of detainees were listed as having a criminal conviction, while the remainder, less than 25%, had a pending criminal charge.

ICE’s most recent report, as of June 26, also shows that 13 people have died in immigration detention this year.

Lawmakers’ lawsuit comes after several Democrats in Congress reported being denied entry to detention facilities.

Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, whose 6th Congressional District includes a detention center in Aurora, said he was denied entry to the facility in July, despite bringing a printout of the law that allows members of Congress to show up unannounced. Crow is among the dozen House Democrats who joined Wednesday’s lawsuit.

""This decision reaffirms that nobody is above the law—not even the federal government,"" said Toczylowski.
""Southern California was never going to back down in the face of lawless attacks on our immigrant communities.","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit late Friday backed a lower court ruling which found immigration raids targeting people based on their apparent racial identity, language spoken, or vicinity of their capture are unlawful—a decision which dealt a further blow to President Donald Trump's authoritarian policies aimed at migrant workers and working-class communities in California and beyond.

In its ruling, the 3-judge panel of the federal court upheld a previous ruling by a U.S. District Court in early July which found the targeting of migrants during the raids was based not on suspicion of wrongdoing or criminal activity of any kind, but simply for speaking Spanish, appearing to be a certain ethnicity, or being near a location where certain workers tend to congregate, such as a bus stop, large hardware store, or agriculture site.

The ruling stems from a case brought against the Trump administration by the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, Public Counsel, workers, and others who argue the raids, which have touched off community anger and unease for months, are, in the words of Public Counsel's senior attorney Mark Rosenbaum, ""unconstitutional, unsupported by evidence, and rooted in fear and harmful stereotypes, not public safety.""

The 9th Circuit ruling means the lower court's ban on such raids in certain areas of southern California will remain in place while the case proceeds.

""Every person, regardless of immigration status, has the right to live, work, and belong in their community without being hunted, harassed, or locked away."" —Lindsay Toczylowski, Immigrant Defenders Law Center

As the New York Times notes, the latest ruling leaves the Trump administration with two legal options. ""It can ask all the active Ninth Circuit judges to reconsider the panel’s Friday night decision,"" the newspaper notes, ""or it could ask the Supreme Court to issue a stay of [the lower court order issued on July 7.]""

In the meantime—though the legal battle is far from over—the plaintiffs in the case celebrated the ruling and vowed to continue their fight against Trump's far-right, anti-immigrant agenda.

""This decision is further confirmation that the administration's paramilitary invasion of Los Angeles violated the Constitution and caused irreparable injury across the region,"" said Mohammad Tajsar, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California.

Lindsay Toczylowski, president and CEO of Immigrant Defenders Law Center, another party to the suit, also heralded the ruling.

And a district judge banned the Department of Homeland Security from using a controversial tactic against those with immigration parole.

Newsweek contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Saturday via email outside of regular office hours.

Why It Matters

Donald Trump was elected as president for a second term in November 2024 after vowing to crackdown on illegal immigration into the United States, and his administration has said it hopes to deport at least 1 million illegal migrants per year.

With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress in addition to the White House, the courts have emerged as one of the main impediments to Trump administration policy. Courts have struck down punitive measures introduced by the president against legal firms involved in cases against him; removed sanctions targeted at International Criminal Court employees; and blocked a bid to strip thousands of Haitian migrants of legal protections.

What To Know

On Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a temporary restraining order preventing immigration enforcement agents from detaining people on the basis of their occupation or language was legally valid and can remain in force.

It said part of U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's order had been vague, but added that ""defendants, however, are not likely to succeed on their remaining arguments.""

The initial case was brought by two U.S. nationals who said they were stopped and questioned by immigration enforcement, despite confirming they were citizens, and by three people who were detained at a bus stop where they were looking to find work.

Separately, Friday also saw U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ban the Department of Homeland Security from using a controversial tactic against migrants who had been granted immigration parole, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. legally.

In a number of cases in recent months, the pending cases against such migrants were dismissed after which they were detained outside the courthouse and put through an expedited removal deportation process.

Cobb said that her decision will impact ""hundreds of thousands"" of migrants. It effectively overrules a Trump administration directive issued on January 23 instructing that ""expedited removal,"" a swifter deportation process, should be used widely.

What People Are Saying

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass welcomed Friday's appeals court ruling, saying: ""Today is a victory for the rule of law and for the City of Los Angeles.

""The Temporary Restraining Order that has been protecting our communities from immigration agents using racial profiling and other illegal tactics when conducting their cruel and aggressive enforcement raids and sweeps will remain in place for now.""

Referring to migrants granted immigration parole in her judgment, Judge Cobb said: ""In a world of bad options, they played by the rules. Now, the Government has not only closed off those pathways for new arrivals but changed the game for parolees already here.""

Speaking to Politico, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said: ""Judge Cobb is flagrantly ignoring the United States Supreme Court which upheld expedited removals of illegal immigrants by a 7-2 majority. This ruling is lawless and won't stand.""

What Happens Next

District Judge Frimpong's restraining order only temporarily restricted the use of employment and language as the sole factor in detaining suspected illegal migrants, and the full case has yet to be heard.

What You Need To Know

The crash course is called Legislator U

It’s the first formal opportunity for incoming freshmen to familiarize themselves with the lawmaking process

ICE is sending letters to law enforcement agencies nationwide, urging certified officers to leave their departments and join ICE.

“Your experience in state or local law enforcement brings invaluable insight and skills to this mission — qualities we need now more than ever,” reads a letter ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan wrote.

The recruitment effort includes a $50,000 signing bonus and potential student loan repayment.

The new incentives, meanwhile, are part of a federal push to hire 10,000 new immigration staff amid what’s being called the largest deportation effort in U.S. history.

The hiring blitz comes on the heels of new federal funding, plus a statewide agreement signed earlier this year by Gov. Ron DeSantis, requiring Florida officers to partner with Homeland Security and undergo specialized immigration enforcement training.

“No other organization in the State of Florida, no other state in this country, has done more to support ICE (and) work with ICE than the Florida Sheriffs Association and our governor. Okay? And then they turn around and abuse that partnership like that — I think it’s unconscionable,” said Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood.

ICE’s move to recruit local officers may create more challenges for local agencies seeking to recruit and retain officers.

Chitwood, however, explained he doesn’t expect large turnover, at least not at his agency.

“My message to my organization is take a look at the way we’ve treated you… Take a look at their pay raises, take a look at your medical benefits. Take a look at your quality of life here and weigh that.. because there’s going to be an administration change,” he said. “That’s inevitable.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/ICE_AP_25185732268065_NAT_0704-1,N,,2025-08-02 07:56:32.986952

The requests came in an email, which was shared with NPR and posted on LinkedIn and elsewhere online, and asked them to ""serve once more.""

""This is a pivotal moment in our country's history, and your experience and expertise are vitally needed,"" the email states, which includes a message on a new webpage.

""On behalf of a grateful nation, we proudly call upon you to RETURN TO MISSION and claim your vital role among the courageous men and women of ICE.""

The push to rehire retired workers comes as the administration has also sought to downsize large swaths of the federal government through mass layoffs and other changes to long-standing norms. Immigration enforcement agencies have been among the few to be exempt from the efforts to encourage employees to voluntarily resign and hiring freezes.

The Trump administration wants to recruit 10,000 people for immigration enforcement using new congressional funds approved last month, helping it meet a target of deporting 1 million people a year.

The government has already deported more than 185,000 people during Trump's second term, a senior DHS official said in an email, but deportations are still unlikely to reach 1 million at the current pace.

Limited enforcement resources have been one of the biggest challenges to scaling up the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.

The Department of Homeland Security's hiring spree particularly focuses on ICE, which conducts arrests and deportations in the interior of the U.S.

Bonuses spread out over three years

The agency is offering former employees a $50,000 signing bonus, split up as $10,000 upon returning, $10,000 if applications are submitted before early August, and the rest as $10,000 annually for up to three years.

A ""dual compensation waiver,"" DHS said, will allow retired employees to continue to collect their new ICE salary while also retaining any existing federal benefits including pension payments.

The new hiring benefits, and the broader hiring campaign, come after lawmakers approved $76.5 billion for ICE last month, roughly 10 times its annual budget – with about $30 billion going specifically to hiring. The influx of cash sets the agency up to be one of the highest-funded federal law enforcement agencies; by comparison, the FBI requested about $10 billion for the next fiscal year.

But the new funds will also take time to kick in; they're set to be allocated through 2029.

DHS said it was distributing recruitment materials across major cities, colleges, job fairs and other networks. But it postponed a previously scheduled career fair in Phoenix, Ariz.

ICE started the administration with a little over 20,000 employees, about 6,000 of whom were doing enforcement and removal work.

The agency on Thursday said it's extended over 1,000 tentative job offers since July 4, without clarifying why they're ""tentative."" The offers included bringing back officers and agents who retired under the previous administration, according to a statement.

Growing ICE's workforce is historically challenging

DHS has three immigration-focused agencies: Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and ICE.

ICE has historically been the smallest. That agency includes enforcement officers who make arrests, attorneys who prosecute cases in immigration court and investigators who look into crimes unrelated to immigration such as drug or human trafficking, cybercrimes, and fraud.

The Biden administration kept about the same number of employees at ICE from the first Trump administration, according to an NPR analysis.

Morale within ICE has also historically been low, with slight improvements in 2024, according to the Partnership for Public Service's survey of best federal agencies to work for.

In its year-end report, ICE reported particularly struggling with growing its workforce over the past decade, and across administrations of both political parties.

Bonuses have previously helped boost recruitment for other parts of DHS.

During the Biden administration, CBP was able to recruit its workforce in part thanks to hiring bonuses, according to a Governmental Accountability Office report. Still, the agency struggled to significantly increase the overall number of applicants despite the incentives, a problem it also faced during the first Trump administration.

And while DHS focuses its recruitment efforts on enforcement, experts warn this could exacerbate the imbalance between how many people are processed for deportation, and how their cases are handled in the courts.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7008x3942+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2Fcf%2F5176d0c342168105d5c28c460807%2Fgettyimages-2197149792.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 07:56:37.193976

“The policy is to follow the 4th Amendment and to require reasonable suspicion,” said Deputy Assistant Atty.","The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dealt a stinging blow to the Trump administration’s mass deportation project Friday night in a fiery opinion upholding a lower court’s block on “roving patrols” across much of Southern California.

“If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion,” the panel wrote.

The ruling leaves in place a temporary restraining order barring masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Southern California without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.

Under the 4th Amendment, reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on race, ethnicity, language, location or employment, either alone or in combination, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong of Los Angeles wrote in her original order.

9th Circuit Judges Marsha S. Berzon, Jennifer Sung and Ronald M. Gould agreed.

“There is no predicate action that the individual plaintiffs would need to take, other than simply going about their lives, to potentially be subject to the challenged stops,” the opinion said.

Fourth Amendment injunctions are hard to win, experts say. Plaintiffs must show not only that they were hurt, but that they are likely to be hurt again in the same way in the future.

One way to meet that test in court is to show the injury is the product of a government policy. Throughout a hearing Monday, the appellate judges repeatedly probed that question, roughly doubling the administration’s time to respond in an effort to get an answer.

“After the district court injunction here, the secretary of Homeland Security said, ‘We are going to continue doing what we’re doing’ — so that’s not a policy?” Berzon asked.

“The policy is to follow the 4th Amendment and to require reasonable suspicion,” said Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Yaakov Roth.

Roth also rebuffed questions about a 3,000-arrests-per-day quota first touted by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in May.

In a memo to the panel on Wednesday, Roth clarified that “no such goal” had been established.

The court rejected that argument Friday, writing that “no official statement or express policy is required” to prove one exists.

“Agents have conducted many stops in the Los Angeles area within a matter of weeks ... some repeatedly in the same location,” the opinion said, making the likelihood of future stops “considerable.”

The ruling scolded the Department of Justice for “misreading” the restraining order it sought to block, and said it “mischaracterized” Judge Frimpong’s order. And it rejected the government’s central claim that its law enforcement mandate would be “chilled” by the district court’s order.

“Defendants have failed to establish that they will be ‘chilled’ from their enforcement efforts at all, let alone in a manner that constitutes the ‘irreparable injury’ required to support a stay pending appeal,” the panel wrote.

The case is still in its early phases, with hearings set for a preliminary injunction in September. But the “shock and awe” campaign of chaotic public arrests that first gripped Southern California on June 6 has all but ceased in the seven counties covered by Frimpong’s order: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.

“The underlying 4th Amendment law is not complicated,” said Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California — part of a coalition of civil rights groups and individual attorneys challenging cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens swept up in chaotic arrests. “Even a more conservative panel would have been concerned about what the government is doing.”

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, whose city was among a number of Southern California municipalities allowed to join the lawsuit this week, celebrated the news at a hastily arranged press conference late Friday night at Getty House, her official residence in Windsor Square.

The mayor strode out of her Tudor Revival-style home and toward the bank of waiting television cameras with a purposeful smile.

“This is a great day for Los Angeles,” she said, characterizing the court’s decision as a victory upholding the Constitution and affirming the rule of law.

Upholding the temporary restraining order “means that people cannot be snatched off the street by masked men like we had experienced for almost two months in the city,” Bass said, referencing the fact that the increasingly aggressive raids have often been carried out by masked agents who sometimes use unmarked vehicles.

Bass, whose late husband was Latino and whose late daughter, stepchildren and grandchildren are of Latino descent, has described the raids as deeply personal.

Speaking directly to the city’s immigrant community, Bass was sanguine about the possibility that the terror paralyzing local communities might begin to ebb.

“The message that I have is that I hope that feeling of fear will subside, that people will be willing and able to come out of their homes, that people will be able to go back to work, that our economy will begin to pick up again,” Bass said.

The Trump administration has previously signaled its intent to fight judicial limits on its deportation efforts any way it can. It was not immediately clear where an appeal would proceed. Bass said she believed the administration would likely appeal to the Supreme Court.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6bcb60c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2F1b%2F6c0c66114c02b9465d348dc7a074%2F1511112-me-0620-ice-action-bell-gem-013.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 07:56:40.800445

Maybe if the judge’s decision on his immigration case had landed in time, he would still be in Livermore. He’d probably come home from work at Wente Vineyards, and his wife Rosa, a U.S. citizen, would have a meal waiting.

Maybe their youngest of three children, Julian, would convince Lopez to get his favorite pineapple ice cream from Pleasanton. Maybe. If Lopez hadn’t been deported.

Instead, Lopez spent his 47th at his childhood home in Chimalhuacán, a municipality just outside of Mexico City’s eastern border. After 29 years away, Mexico wasn’t familiar, but foreign.

His dad’s house now had new floors and doors, partially bought thanks to money Lopez sent home. The mountain in the horizon, once natural, is now filled with new houses.

“It wasn’t how I imagined it,” Lopez said in Spanish during an interview at his father’s house. “You leave with the impression of how things were when you left. And you see everything’s different.”

Like the 75,000 other Mexicans repatriated since Trump took office, Lopez is navigating life after deportation. This January, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, like her predecessor, unveiled the strategy “México Te Abraza,” to “warmly and humanely receive Mexicans who were returned from the United States to our country.”

At the border, recent arrivals are offered special documentation, a health check-up at one of six centros de atención and $2,000 MXN pesos, roughly $100 USD, to travel home.

“I didn’t expect to come back like this,” Lopez said. “But here I am.”

Reintegration isn’t so easy.

The sun had barely risen on June 7 by the time Lopez got off the bus from San Ysidrio near the Mexican border. He and the other deportees, who had told him they were transferred from prison, were now in Tijuana.

It was Lopez’s first time in Mexico since he crossed the border at 18 and, at his mother’s behest, falsely told U.S. border agents he was a U.S. citizen. Now on the other side, Lopez was scared. The locals were watching him and the five or six other deportees. He ducked into the bathroom and called his wife, Rosa, back in Livermore. She didn’t yet know he’d been deported.

Lopez was still dressed in the same outfit he wore on May 27 when he went to 620 Sansome St. for a check-in on his ongoing immigration case.

“Bring a sweater,” Rosa reminded him before they left that day; San Francisco is chilly. She also urged him to keep the $400 he left on her dresser, so they could buy clam chowder at Fisherman’s Wharf afterwards.

That had become a tradition. For decades, he’d checked in at the court without issue, no appointment missed. While waiting for him to finish, Rosa saw him call. “I said, ‘Hey, are you ready?’” she recalled. “No,” Lopez told her. “They detained me. Call my lawyer.”

Over the next 10 days, Lopez was taken to Fresno, and then to the Golden State Annex in McFarland. He called Rosa from a tablet each night for 15 minutes. She, her daughter Stephanie, and three-year-old granddaughter Illiana, visited once.

The detention cells were cold. “Luckily, I was wearing the sweater,” Lopez said.

At midnight on Friday, June 6, Lopez was told to get his stuff. He was briefly transferred to the Mesa Verde ICE processing center in Bakersfield. A few hours later, he was in Tijuana.

There, Lopez and the other deportees checked in with Mexican immigration. But he didn’t have identification; U.S. ICE agents had kept his Mexican passport and California license. (They mailed it to Rosa weeks later.) Officials couldn’t find Lopez in the Mexican government database.

While it would cause him minor problems later, Mexico still receives repatriates without documents. Officials snapped Lopez’s photo and armed him with a repatriation notice and $2,000 MXN pesos. A new chapter began.

The first thing Lopez did afterward was buy deodorant and socks using the $400 he had taken with him on the day of his immigration appointment. The deportees tried to figure out where to stay. Lopez didn’t know anyone in Tijuana. His dad and brother lived in the state of Mexico, hundreds of miles away.

The other deportees checked in at Casa del Migrante, a nonprofit migrant shelter nearby, to spend the night. Luckily, Rosa found a friend who could house Lopez. The next day they agreed to fly to Mexico City, and Rosa would bring his birth certificate.

It was supposed to turn out so differently, Rosa said. The night before, she was at mass, praying the rosary for Lopez’s safe return, when Lopez’s lawyer, Saad Ahmad called. Ahmad filed a temporary restraining order on Lopez’s deportation, and Lopez was granted a Saturday morning hearing. “‘This never happens,’” Ahmad excitedly told her.

The next day, June 7, U.S. District Court Judge Trina Thompson granted the injunction on Lopez’s deportation, according to court filings. For now, he could stay. But it was too late. Hours earlier, around 5:30 a.m., Lopez had been dropped off in Tijuana.

Rosa took the rosary again and prayed.

Lopez is out of sorts in his hometown, he said. In California, he used to wake at 4 a.m. to head to Wente Vineyards, where for nine years he’d weld, or maneuver hulking mechanical harvesters to pull grapes from the vines.

Often, when Lopez was late arriving home, he’d be lending a hand at a friend’s diesel shop. “He’s a workaholic,” Rosa said and teasingly rolled her eyes.

Mexican government programs and nonprofit organizations attempt to employ repatriates, but Lopez has struggled to find a job. Chimalhuacán is in the State of Mexico, far from the trendy tourist neighborhoods of a bustling Mexico City, and life there is modest.

The majority of his neighbors sell personal wares and food outside their homes or in the public tianguis market, or have small shops; otherwise they head into Mexico City for work.

So far, Lopez has tried to ask around. He begs Rosa to drive his Ford F-350 truck and all his welding tools from over the border so he can start his own business. He daydreams about finding work in the Jalisco or Querétaro vineyards, but can’t afford to move right now.

Since Lopez’s deportation, Rosa splits their money between Livermore and Mexico. For years Lopez had been the sole breadwinner, supporting his family in California, and his dad in Mexico. Without income, “I’m stressed out,” Lopez said.

In the meantime, Lopez straightened out his identification by producing the birth certificate and received his Unique Population Registry Code for Mexican citizens, or CURP. He bought a Mexican cellphone. He’s adjusting to the limited drinking water and different culture, and how much Chimalhuacán has changed.

He tries to assure Rosa he’s safe. Chimalhuacán is seen as one of the most unsafe municipalities in Mexico, according to a 2025 national survey. Lopez’s younger brother was murdered nearby two years ago, and his father’s house has been shot at multiple times.

But the couple see this as a temporary chapter. Rosa said, “I’ll do anything to bring my family back together.”

There’s plenty that Lopez misses about home: Golfing, camping, his Wente coworkers. The way his friend’s children called him “Tio Chili’s,” because he frequently took them to Chili’s, or how neighbors greeted him with “Chilango,” slang for someone from Mexico City. But it’s his family that Lopez misses most.

In Livermore, things aren’t the same, either. Rosa parked her husband’s Ford F-350 work truck at a friend’s to avoid looking at it. Their eldest son, Angel, previously a homebody, is constantly at the gym.

Lopez coaxed the youngest, Julian, to rejoin the football team for his last high school season, and now, Lopez can’t watch it. Illiana used to rush to the door when Lopez’s truck pulled in the driveway, and now pouts when her “papa” is mentioned.

So, Lopez asked Rosa to visit Chimalhuacán for his birthday. Picking her up from the airport, the car broke down, requiring a pinch fix. In bed, thoughts of Lopez’s situation overwhelmed Rosa and she had a panic attack. She doesn’t feel safe in Mexico.

But on his birthday, the couple sat and joked at Lopez’s father’s table, sunlight striking their tattoos. Lopez sipped mezcal, and the two planned to go out to eat later.

Rosa will stay in Mexico until her daughter Stephanie’s birthday on Aug. 10. She regrets Lopez will miss that, along with Angel’s and Rosa’s birthday in September.

Meanwhile, Lopez has tried reconnecting with Chimalhuacán. His eldest brother and his young nieces visit often. Chimalhuacán is getting used to Lopez, too. The shop owner around the corner was shocked when Lopez told him he was the boy from long ago. Lopez’s grand-nieces watch him and Rosa in the house. One asked: “Why’d you come back?”

Lopez can’t yet imagine life here forever. Unlike other deportees, he has a chance at residing in the United States again, and it’s a dream neither he or Rosa will cede. Maybe, they say, Lopez will be back for the youngest’s birthday in November.

Like other immigrants, Lopez’s case is complex. Rosa and Lopez married in 2001, and Lopez applied for a green card in 2007. The Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Lopez for not having valid entry documents and for falsely claiming he was a U.S. citizen when he entered at the age of 18.

In November 2012, an immigration judge who disagreed with the removal proceedings granted Lopez a green card. The judge’s decision was appealed by DHS, citing its discretion to deport him, and revoked his green card.

Lopez appealed and took the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to take the case. Now a hearing is scheduled in the district court for Oct. 7, Ahmad, his lawyer, said in a telephone interview. The hearing had already been rescheduled, but this time, “I don’t see them changing it,” Ahmad said.

Lopez and Rosa have faith. “Sometimes God sends you the hardest things to see if you’re strong enough for it,” Rosa said. “I’ve already spent so much time fighting,” Lopez said, “And so much money on it.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3723.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 07:56:45.441165

In a statement released Friday, Casa San José — a Pittsburgh community center that advocates for Latinos — accused Ambridge police of collaborating with ICE in what they described as an hourslong raid targeting immigrant members of the Beaver County community.

Beaver County officials said ICE agents were present but were operating independently from local and county law enforcement involved in the roundup.

According to Casa San José, the arrests began at about 8 p.m. in streets in the vicinity of the Monroy Super Market, a store that specializes in Latin American, South American and Caribbean products.

Casa San José charged that people were being targeted by police and federal agents “based solely on appearance.”

“This was not public safety,” Monica Ruiz, executive director of Casa San José, said in the statement. “This was targeted chaos, a show of power meant to terrorize immigrant families. People were emotionally shattered.”

In a separate press release issued Friday, Beaver County District Attorney Nathan L. Bible said Ambridge police on Thursday were partnering with the county’s Sheriff’s Office, county detectives bureau, probation office and county Drug Task Force in a “saturation operation” in Ambridge.

Bible said, “The purpose of the operation was to round up any individuals with outstanding warrants, in addition to policing any general criminal activity. While federal agents from ICE were present, this was in no way an ‘ICE raid.’

“The Beaver County agencies and Ambridge P.D. were conducting legal traffic stops, making arrests on individuals committing crimes and apprehending individuals with outstanding warrants.”

Bible continued, “Once an individual is arrested, the local authorities have no control over what an outside federal agency does with regard to the immigration status of the arrestee.

”Some individuals were detained by ICE, however those individuals had committed an underlying crime or traffic infraction, which then triggered the ICE detainer.”

Bible said no Ambridge residences or businesses were raided during Thursday’s enforcement operation.

Casa San José said those arrested included two witnesses whom they maintain were denied legal representation.

Amy Mathieu, an attorney in Allegheny County, posted on social media that she and her wife, Katie Melson, went to Ambridge to observe and document the police action. According to Mathieu, when onlookers attempted to document the arrest of a man who was also there to observe, police demanded that the crowd move back.

Mathieu said the onlookers already were about 100 feet back from where the man was being arrested and Melson questioned “why they were asking us to move and how far back.”

According to Mathieu, an Ambridge police officer pushed Melson and ordered her to comply with the order.

“Before she could take another step, multiple officers grabbed her and arrested her,” Mathieu wrote.

Mathieu charged that Melson wasn’t read her Miranda rights and was refused access to an attorney.

An attempt to reach Ambridge police Friday evening was unsuccessful.

An online court docket indicates Melson, 45, of Pittsburgh was charged with obstructing the administration of law, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and harassment. She was placed in the Beaver County Jail before being released Friday on $10,000 bond.

Ambridge police also arrested Isaac Elias, 43, of Baden during the incident. He was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. He also was placed in the county jail before being released Friday on $5,000 bail, according to court records.

Simmons announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 176 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from July 24 through July 31, 2025.

In one such case, Texas Department of Public Safety Troopers requested assistance from El Paso Border Patrol Agents after receiving information from a concerned citizen about an apartment possibly being used to house illegal aliens. After agents arrived at the residence to perform an investigatory inquiry, an individual later identified as Jose Alfredo MACIAS-Mendoza answered the door and the agents encountered a total of 12 individuals in the apartment. All 12 individuals stated they were in the United States illegally. It was determined that MACIAS was being paid by an organization to oversee and harbor the illegal aliens and he was charged with alien smuggling. Records reveal that MACIAS himself had previously been deported from El Paso to Mexico on April 19, 2024.

Jose REYNA-Aguilera was encountered at the El Paso County Detention Facility by a Deportation Officer assigned to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Criminal Apprehension Program. Record checks revealed that REYNA is a citizen and national of Mexico without immigration documents allowing him to remain in the United States. REYNA’s immigration records established that he had been removed from the United States to Mexico on three prior occasions and was previously convicted of illegal reentry in October 2009 and April of 2011.

Deportation Officers encountered Daniel NAVA-Morales at the El Paso County Detention Facility. Immigration records reveal that he was illegally in the country having first been removed from the U.S. to Mexico on August 4, 1998. That removal order has been re-instated 6 times with NAVA last being removed to Mexico on January 18, 2024. His criminal history includes convictions for illegal entry in 1999 and 2021, where he was sentenced to 3 years probation each time, and impersonating a United States Citizen, where he was sentenced to 11 months imprisonment in 2007. He is being charged once again with illegal reentry.

In Del Rio, Texas, Azaraias Prudencio ALVARADO-Almendarez, a Honduran national who had previously been convicted of a sex offense against a child in Florida, was charged with illegal reentry. ALVARADO has a criminal history beginning in 2007 with convictions for burglary and two “hit and runs,” one of which was a felony resulting in injury. ALVARADO has been deported 3 times, the last time being to Honduras on June 21, 2024.

El Salvadoran National Celso RIVAS-Gonzalez was arrested by Border Patrol Agents on July 26, 2025, for illegal reentry. RIVAS has two prior removals from the United States and a criminal history that includes aggravated sexual assault of a child in 2020, harassment in 2021, and felony indecency with a child - sexual contact in 2024. RIVAS has been deported twice, the last time being on February 19, 2025.

Katia Yolanda SOLANO-Alvarenga, a native and citizen of Honduras, was found 3.29 miles west of Paso Del Norte Port of Entry in El Paso, Texas without documents allowing entry or residence in the United States. SOLANO was previously deported on October 7, 2024. Additionally, SOLANO was convicted and confined for 300 days for assault causing bodily injury in Dallas Texas, on March 28, 2003.

Honduran citizen Marcos Josue BANEGAS-Castro was found at the 7300 block of Alameda Avenue in El Paso Texas. It was determined that he was in the United States illegally without immigration documents. It was further determined that BANEGAS had previously been deported to Honduras on March 14, 2025.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ICE ERO), U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

Civil rights lawyers who have monitored the cases said the move is another sign of the Trump administration’s retreat from the department’s mission of protecting the rights of vulnerable groups.

Dhillon, Trump’s appointee to run the DOJ’s civil rights division, has made no secret of her distaste for such measures.","The Trump administration has halted litigation aimed at stopping civil rights abuses of prisoners in Louisiana and mentally ill people living in South Carolina group homes.

The Biden administration filed lawsuits against the two states in December after Department of Justice investigations concluded that they had failed to fix violations despite years of warnings.

Louisiana’s prison system has kept thousands of incarcerated people behind bars for weeks, months or sometimes more than a year after they were supposed to be released, records show. And the DOJ accused South Carolina of institutionalizing thousands of people diagnosed with serious mental illnesses — sometimes for decades — rather than provide services that would allow them to live in less restricted settings, as is their right under federal law.

Federal judges temporarily suspended the lawsuits in February at the request of the states and with the support of the DOJ.

Civil rights lawyers who have monitored the cases said the move is another sign of the Trump administration’s retreat from the department’s mission of protecting the rights of vulnerable groups. Since January, President Donald Trump’s DOJ has dropped racial discrimination lawsuits, abandoned investigations of police misconduct and canceled oversight of troubled law enforcement agencies.

“This administration has been very aggressive in rolling back any kind of civil rights reforms or advancements,” said Anya Bidwell, senior attorney at the public-interest law firm Institute for Justice. “It’s unquestionably disappointing.”

The cases against Louisiana and South Carolina were brought by a unit of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division tasked with enforcing laws that guarantee religious freedom, access to reproductive health services, constitutional policing, and the rights of people in state and local institutions, including jails, prisons and health care facilities for people with disabilities.

The unit, the Special Litigation Section, has seen a dramatic reduction in lawyers since Trump took office in January. Court records show at least seven attorneys working on the lawsuits against Louisiana and South Carolina are no longer with the DOJ.

The section had more than 90 employees at the start of the year, including about 60 front-line attorneys. By June, it had about 25, including around 15 front-line lawyers, according to a source familiar with its operation. Sources said some were reassigned to other areas of the department while others quit in protest against the direction of the office under Trump, found new jobs or took early retirement.

Similar departures have been seen throughout the DOJ.

The exodus will hamper its ability to carry out essential functions, such as battling sexual harassment in housing, discrimination against disabled people, and the improper use of restraints and seclusions against students in schools, said Omar Noureldin, a former senior attorney in the Civil Rights Division and President Joe Biden appointee who left in January.

“Regardless of your political leanings, I think most people would agree these are the kind of bad situations that should be addressed by the nation’s top civil rights enforcer,” Noureldin said.

A department spokesperson declined to comment in response to questions from ProPublica about the Louisiana and South Carolina cases. Sources familiar with the lawsuits said Trump appointees have told DOJ lawyers handling the cases that they want to resolve matters out of court.

The federal government has used settlement talks in the past to hammer out consent decrees, agreements that set a list of requirements to fix civil rights violations and are overseen by an outside monitor and federal judge to ensure compliance. But Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, Trump’s appointee to run the DOJ’s civil rights division, has made no secret of her distaste for such measures.

In May, Dhillon announced she was moving to dismiss efforts to impose consent decrees on the Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis police departments. She complained that consent decrees turn local control of policing over to “unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats.”

A DOJ investigation in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer accused the department of excessive force, unjustified shootings, and discrimination against Black and Native American people. The agency issued similar findings against the Louisville Metro Police Department after the high-profile killing of Breonna Taylor, who was shot in 2020 when officers forced their way into her home to execute a search warrant.

Noureldin, now a senior vice president at the government watchdog group Common Cause, said consent decrees provide an important level of oversight by an independent judge. By contrast, out-of-court settlements can be subject to the political whims of a new administration, which can decide to drop a case or end an agreement despite evidence of continuing constitutional violations.

“When you have a consent decree or a court-enforced settlement, the Justice Department can’t unilaterally just withdraw from the agreement,” Noureldin said. “A federal judge would have to agree that the public interest is served by terminating that settlement.”

“I Lost Everything”

In the case of Louisiana, the Justice Department issued a scathing report in January 2023 about the state confining prisoners beyond their sentences. The problems dated back more than a decade and remained widespread, the report said. Between January and April 2022 alone, more than a quarter of everyone released from prison custody was held past their release dates. Of those, 24% spent an additional 90 days or more behind bars, the DOJ found.

Among those held longer than they should have been was Robert Parker, a disc jockey known as “DJ Rob” in New Orleans, where he played R&B and hip-hop music at weddings and private parties. Parker, 55, was arrested in late 2016 after violating a restraining order brought by a former girlfriend.

He was supposed to be released in October 2017, but a prison staffer mistakenly classified him as a sex offender. That meant he was required to provide prison authorities with two addresses where he could stay that complied with sex offender registry rules.

Prison documents show Parker repeatedly told authorities that he wasn’t a sex offender and pleaded to speak to the warden to clear up the mistake. But nobody acted until a deputy public defender contacted state officials months later to complain. By the time he walked out, Parker had spent 337 extra days behind bars. During that period, he said, his car was repossessed, his mother died and his reputation was ruined.

“I lost everything,” he told ProPublica in an interview from a nursing home, where he was recovering from a stroke. “I’m ready to get away from Louisiana.”

Louisiana’s detention system is complex. Unlike other jurisdictions, where the convicted are housed in state facilities, inmates in Louisiana can be held in local jails overseen by sheriffs. A major contributor to the so-called over-detentions was poor communication among Louisiana’s court clerks, sheriff’s offices and the state department of corrections, according to interviews with attorneys, depositions of state officials, and reports from state and federal reviews of the prison system.

Until recently, the agencies shared prisoner sentencing information by shuttling stacks of paperwork by van or truck from the court to the sheriff’s office for the parish holding the prisoner, then to corrections officials. The document transfers, which often crisscrossed the state, typically happened only once a week. When the records finally arrived, it could take staff a month or longer to enter the data into computers, creating more delays. In addition, staff made data errors when calculating release dates.

Two years ago, The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Parker could pursue a lawsuit against the former head of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, James LeBlanc. That lawsuit is ongoing, said Parker’s attorney, Jonathan Rhodes. LeBlanc, who resigned last year, could not be reached for comment, and his attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.

In a statement, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill acknowledged that the state’s process to determine release dates was unreliable but said the issue had been overblown by the Justice Department’s investigation, which she called “factually incorrect.”

“There were simply parts of it that are outside state control, such as clerks & courts,” Murrill stated.

Murrill said correction officials have been working with local officials to ensure prisoner releases are computed in a “timely and correct fashion.” Louisiana officials point to a new website that allows electronic sharing of information among the various agencies.

“The system has been overhauled. That has dramatically diminished, if not completely eliminated this problem,” Murrill stated. She did not address questions from ProPublica asking if prisoners were being held longer than their release dates this year.

Local attorneys who are handling lawsuits against the state expressed skepticism about Murrill’s claims.

William Most, an attorney who filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people who had been detained past their release dates, noted that as late as May 2024, 141 people who were released that month had been kept longer than they should have been, 120 of them for more than 30 days.

“I have seen no evidence suggesting the problem in Louisiana is fixed,” Most said. “And it seems unwise to dismiss any cases while that’s the situation.”

Trapped in Group Homes

South Carolina’s mentally ill population is grappling with similar challenges.

After years of lawsuits and complaints, a DOJ investigation determined that officials illegally denied community-based services — required by the Americans with Disabilities Act and a 1999 Supreme Court decision — to over 1,000 people diagnosed as seriously mentally ill. Instead, the state placed them in group homes that failed to provide adequate care and were overly restrictive, the department alleged.

The DOJ report didn’t address why the state relied so heavily on group homes. It noted that South Carolina’s own goals and plans called for increasing community-based services to help more people live independently. But the investigation concluded that the availability of community-based services varied widely across the state, leaving people in some areas with no access. And the DOJ said the state’s rules for deciding when someone could leave were too stringent.

South Carolina funds and oversees more than 400 facilities that serve people with serious mental illness, according to a state affidavit.

Kimberly Tissot, president of the disability rights group Able South Carolina, said it was common for disabled adults who were living successfully on their own to be involuntarily committed to an adult group home simply because they visited a hospital to pick up medicine.

Tissot, who has inspected hundreds of the adult facilities, said they often are roach-infested, soaked in urine, lacking in adequate medicine and staffed by untrained employees. Her description mirrors the findings of several state and independent investigations. In some group homes, patients weren’t allowed to leave or freely move around. Subsequently, their mental health would deteriorate, Tissot said.

“We have had people die in these facilities because of the conditions,” said Tissot, who worked closely with the DOJ investigators. Scores of sexual abuse incidents, assaults and deaths in such group homes have been reported to the state, according to a 2022 federal report that faulted South Carolina’s oversight.

South Carolina has been on notice about the difficulties since 2016 but didn’t make sufficient progress, the DOJ alleged in its lawsuit filed in December.

After two years of failed attempts, state lawmakers passed a law in April that consolidated services for disabled people into a new agency responsible for expanding access to home and community-based treatments and for ensuring compliance with federal laws.

South Carolina’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, has argued in the DOJ’s lawsuit that the state has been providing necessary services and has not been violating people’s constitutional rights. In January, his office asked the court for a delay in the case to give the Trump administration enough time to determine how to proceed.

His office and a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities declined to comment, citing the ongoing DOJ lawsuit.

Tissot credits the federal attention with creating a sense of urgency among state lawmakers to make improvements. While she said she is pleased with the latest progress, she warned that if the DOJ dropped the case, it would undermine the enforcement of disabled people’s civil rights and allow state abuses to continue.

“It would signal that systemic discrimination will go unchecked and embolden institutional providers to resist change,” Tissot said. “Most importantly, it abandons the people directly impacted.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2222469463-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 04:57:53.817334

According to Yoo, Bush possessed incredibly expansive emergency powers to deal with people who threatened national security.
Overall, despite how closely Trump is following the war on terror blueprint for superseding legal processes, Yoo seemed troubled by Trump’s actions.
Indeed, during the Bush administration, Yoo expressed that “no treaty” and no law by Congress could limit the president’s power.
Of course, characterizing these similarities between the Bush and Trump regimes as “superficial” is a convenient narrative for these lawyers to adopt.","After months of outrage and denouncements from judges, lawmakers, and the general public, 252 Venezuelans sent from the U.S. to a prison in El Salvador have finally been released. For six months, those imprisoned at El Salvador’s notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) were denied core human rights, including the right to due process. Former prisoners said they were subject to cruel and inhumane treatment, including state-sanctioned torture. Though Trump has taken the denial of due process to a further extent than recent administrations, he is justifying his deportation strategy using legal frameworks established by the George W. Bush administration during the so-called “war on terror.”

In May, NPR interviewed Berkeley law professor John Yoo about President Donald Trump’s decision to send deportees to CECOT. The decision to specifically interview Yoo was, of course, significant. As Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel during the George W. Bush presidential administration, Yoo authored a series of legal opinions now infamously known as the Torture Memos. These memos facilitated the Bush administration’s program of torture and indefinite detention during the war on terror by arguing for its legality. According to Yoo, Bush possessed incredibly expansive emergency powers to deal with people who threatened national security. Such people were not protected by the Geneva Conventions, and if they were sent to the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, they had no access to habeas corpus rights and could be imprisoned indefinitely without trial.

As Ailsa Chang, the host of Yoo’s recent NPR interview, pointed out, these arguments are eerily similar to Trump’s policy against people his administration is sending to CECOT. In fact, one of Trump’s first moves towards accelerating deportations was to expand the migrant detention center in Guantánamo, taking advantage of the site’s legal isolation that Yoo constructed for the purposes of waging an all-out “war on terror.” As Chang notes, Trump also used the Alien Enemies Act to justify expanded presidential power to remove supposedly “dangerous” people from the country and imprison them indefinitely with no legal recourse. Members of the Trump administration also say they’re looking into suspending habeas corpus altogether, with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem going so far as to incorrectly define habeas corpus as “a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country.”

Despite the obvious similarities between the two presidents’ actions, Yoo claimed in his interview that these connections are “superficial,” and that what Trump is doing cannot be compared to Bush’s war on terror. Yoo said that he himself was arguing for expanded presidential powers as strictly wartime measures, while Trump is falsely claiming the pretense of a “war” against violent gang members. Yoo also claimed that, in his memos, he never denied anyone who set foot in the U.S. their habeas corpus rights, only those who were captured abroad. Trump, on the other hand, has deported people on U.S. soil with no due process.

Overall, despite how closely Trump is following the war on terror blueprint for superseding legal processes, Yoo seemed troubled by Trump’s actions. “I think the circumstances and the context of what we’re talking about after 9/11 and this are very different,” he said.

Yoo is not the only U.S. official who has distanced himself from Trump’s ever-expanding presidential power despite contributing to such an interpretation. Take Alberto Gonzales, who served as Bush’s Attorney General and supported Yoo’s legal interpretations. The Republican has openly criticized Trump as “the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation,” and opted to support Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. In an interview with PBS discussing the danger of Trump’s push against the rule of law, interviewer Amna Nawaz, like Chang with Yoo, pointed out the parallel between Trump and Bush’s “abuse of executive power” that Gonzales enabled. In response, Gonzales argued that the differentiating factor was Trump’s habit of “surrounding himself with loyalists” who give him the answer he wants to hear, as though the Torture Memos did not serve the same purpose.

Indeed, even in trying to mark this difference, Gonzales could not deny the similarities were still present, saying, “I was very loyal to President Bush.” He could only distinguish between the Trump and Bush legal teams using a character assessment: “Nonetheless, hopefully, you have lawyers in place that make a good faith attempt to interpret the law and are honest with the president saying, ‘You don’t have the authority to do this.’”

Jack Goldsmith, who served as Assistant Attorney General for Bush, similarly distinguishes between Trump and Bush’s legal approaches with claims of good faith interpretation on Bush’s side. While he did admit in a May op-ed in the New York Times that Trump’s “claims of untouchable national security authority echo arguments made after the Sept. 11 attacks by George W. Bush’s administration,” the difference Goldsmith identified in another piece is that the Office of Legal Counsel, which he, Yoo, and Gonzales worked with, “has been basically set aside and the White House is interpreting law.”

Notably, however, Goldsmith also distinguishes the Trump administration by claiming “the basic rule appears to be if the president wants to do something, it’s lawful.” Again, while the extent may be greater than the Bush administration’s, the idea that Bush’s legal team did not craft the arguments to serve him best politically is seriously flawed and misleading at best. This was acknowledged by some of Bush’s lawyers themselves. During the formation of the war on terror legal framework, one legal advisor warned Yoo of the “desire to identify legal authority establishing the right of the United States to treat the members of the Taliban Militia in the way it thinks best” rather than the way the law permits. Indeed, during the Bush administration, Yoo expressed that “no treaty” and no law by Congress could limit the president’s power. Contrary to Yoo’s recent claim that he never denied anyone who set foot in the U.S. their habeas corpus rights, this included indefinite detention and torture of even U.S. citizens arrested on U.S. territory, such as Jose Padilla.

Of course, characterizing these similarities between the Bush and Trump regimes as “superficial” is a convenient narrative for these lawyers to adopt. Whether these lawyers are being intentionally misleading or truly believe their own words, the reality is that the war on terror’s legal framework, the very one they built, serves as the foundation of Trump’s deportation strategy. While the differences are noteworthy, they should not distract from this fact, but serve to demonstrate how Trump’s legal framework built on Bush’s to push presidential power and further suppress habeas corpus rights.

The very fact that Trump is exploiting Guantánamo’s legally unique nature, the one Yoo and Gonzales contributed to creating, demonstrates this reality. So does the Trump administration’s declaration of several gangs and cartels as terrorist organizations. The war on terror model of indefinite detention with no due process rests on the narrative of keeping the country safe from terrorists. As Yoo argued in the Torture Memos, once a person was determined to be affiliated with a certain organization, that person was not protected under international human rights law nor were they eligible for a U.S. trial. Of course, once an organization is recognized as a terrorist group, the accusation of affiliation that spurns an arrest does not necessarily need to be true. This was certainly the case in Guantánamo, where many people were swept in simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It remains true in the Trump era, where simply having a tattoo landed people in CECOT. Now that those allegations of torture are coming in from former CECOT prisoners, the parallels only become more impossible to deny.

By classifying these similarities as “superficial” and distancing themselves from Trump by claiming that the Bush administration’s legal framework was made in good faith, Bush’s former legal team once again avoids accountability for the harm they have caused. The fact that they may disagree with Trump’s application of the war on terror model does not negate the fact that these men are significantly responsible for constructing it. The combination of expansive presidential emergency power, securitization of certain classes of people, and the denial of their human rights is a powerful force in the hands of a leader who wants to imprison people without interference. It is exactly the power that Bush’s lawyers helped put in his hands, and now, Trump has seized it as well.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2162696368-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 04:58:29.651793

People in ICE custody at Leavenworth are subject to the rules and policies of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which oversees operations.","TOPEKA — Problems linger in a Kansas federal prison holding immigrant detainees, even after altering some practices that a coalition of lawyers, civil rights groups and advocates revealed were harmful to those inside.

The Federal Correction Institution at Leavenworth is one of two places in Kansas where Immigration and Customs Enforcement can detain people long term, and the coalition wrote to the prison warden in June about unsanitary, inequitable and unhealthy conditions.

Warden Crystal Carter wrote in a June 20 response letter that the prison had eliminated medical fees, added law library resources that ICE failed to provide, implemented new recreation hours and expanded Spanish-language communications.

But concerns about lockdowns and adequate phone call time remain, said Kyle Virgien, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project.

“We see a lot of problems across ICE’s detention network,” Virgien said. “Detention is difficult. It rips people from their communities. It isolates them from their families. This is a constant.”

Virgien began speaking with people inside Leavenworth in April and continues to monitor conditions.

What he heard was troubling, he said.

The coalition wrote in a pair of letters in May that detained immigrants faced unsanitary and crowded living quarters, extended lockdowns, delayed and costly medical treatment, restricted contact with their families, and no access to religious services.

Some had attempted suicide, the letter said.

Carter, the warden, said things have changed.

After reviewing its procedures, the prison eliminated a $2 fee that people in ICE custody were charged for certain health visits. Staff were told to stop those charges and reverse all previous ones. To boost access for medical services, the prison created request slips written in Spanish for ICE detainees, Carter said. However, it is unclear how quickly officials respond to Spanish medical requests.

Carter said capacity concerns did not exist at the time of writing, and, according to the coalition, people inside have said what once were crowded cells have become less so.

According to July data from ICE, estimating average daily populations from the past year, about 35 people are held daily in Leavenworth for immigration reasons. Most pose little to no threat, according to ICE threat level classifications. On average, around 21 people were associated with criminal cases, and 12 were not. All are male and stay an average of 25 days.

During those 25 days, people in ICE custody now are afforded at least one hour of outdoor recreation time daily and a maximum of 300 minutes of phone calls per month, with no call lasting longer than 15 minutes.

People in ICE custody at Leavenworth are subject to the rules and policies of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which oversees operations. Some of the rules and policies are a departure from typical conditions in ICE detention facilities, Virgien said.

He has heard stories of mistreatment from guards and retaliatory lockdowns that punish many for the actions of few, he said. Lockdowns mean people are in cells for 23 hours a day and must “pack all of their life tasks into that one hour outside the cell,” Virgien said, which can include recreation, showers, legal research, religious practices and phone calls.

Carter said one instance of a lockdown has occurred in Leavenworth’s ICE detention unit for 72 hours, and another more than eight hours.

“Except for the limited and infrequent instances, all ICE detainees have time outside of their cell each day and have access to exercise, the electronic law library and phone systems,” Carter said.

The people ICE detains in Leavenworth are imprisoned alongside people awaiting criminal trials or serving criminal sentences.

Benjamin O’Cone, a spokesman for the bureau, said in an emailed statement that it’s the mission of the bureau and Leavenworth to “operate facilities that are safe, secure and humane.”

“We take seriously our duty to protect the individuals entrusted in our custody, as well as maintaining the safety of our employees and the community,” O’Cone said. “Humane treatment of the men and women in our custody is a top priority.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment. ICE also has not responded to the coalition’s letter, according to ACLU of Kansas spokeswoman Esmie Tseng.

Virgien said the coalition is glad the prison addressed some of the issues they raised, but concerns remain.

“Many of the people at the facility have already won their immigration cases, and ICE is still detaining them,” Virgien said.

The coalition believes ICE should release people as soon as their immigration cases are won.

In at least one case, an immigration judge determined a man could not return to his country of origin without risking torture. Others include people who have spoken out against authoritarian governments in their countries of origin or fled persecution. Some have young children. Many have come from Chicago, and a small number from Kentucky, Virgien said.

When asked about the possibility of pursuing legal action, Virgien said, “all options are on the table.”

Now, with major Congressional budget increases for ICE, Virgien fears problems will only multiply.

Congress approved more than $175 billion for ICE in its most recent budget bill, making it what the Brennan Center for Justice classified as the largest federal law enforcement agency. The funds expand ICE’s ability to bring people into custody while capping the number of immigration judges in the country.

Also in Leavenworth, private prison company CoreCivic is battling the city government to reopen a shuttered prison to use as its Midwest Regional Reception Center, which would detain as many as 1,000 people. A judge temporarily blocked the company in July from housing people at its facility until the matter is worked out in court.

Earlier this month, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against Zwinck, alleging that he had violated Colorado laws limiting cooperation between local and federal immigration authorities.","Five sheriff's deputies from Colorado are being disciplined after a college student spent two weeks in a federal immigration detention center last month after a routine traffic stop.

An administrative review concluded that Sheriff’s Deputy Alexander Zwinck shared information on a Signal group chat that included federal immigration agents after he had pulled over Caroline Dias-Goncalves, 19, a student at the University of Utah, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell said in a statement Wednesday.

The agents then used that information to track Dias-Goncalves down and arrest her. She was taken to a detention facility in Aurora, where she was held for 15 days before being released on bond.

""The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office should not have had any role in the chain of events leading to Miss Dias-Goncalves’s detention,"" Rowell said.

Colorado law restricts coordination between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. It prohibits state and local law enforcement from providing information about a person's immigration status to federal officials or disclosing personal identifying information to immigration authorities.

""I regret that this occurred. I apologize to Miss Dias-Goncalves,"" Rowell said.

Zwinck pulled Dias-Goncalves over while she was driving on Interstate 70 outside Loma on June 5. Zwinck claimed Dias-Goncalves was driving too close to a semi-truck.

The traffic stop lasted about 20 minutes and Zwinck released Dias-Goncalves with a warning. Shortly after she exited the highway, federal immigration agents stopped her, arrested her and took her to the Aurora detention facility, where she was held until June 20.

Born in Brazil and raised in Utah since she was 7, Dias-Goncalves is one of nearly 2.5 million people living in the United States known as “Dreamers,” young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Dias-Goncalves arrived on a visa that expired over a decade ago and has a pending asylum case.

In interviews conducted as part of the review, Zwinck claimed he did not know he was violating any laws or policies when he shared Dias-Goncalves' information and location with federal authorities in a group chat meant to discuss drug crackdown efforts.

According to the review's findings, Zwinck was involved in at least four other incidents last month in which the information he shared on the group chat following his traffic stops led to federal immigration enforcement actions.

Zwinck also told investigators that he had received and read two department-wide emails from the sheriff's office last year and in January, both outlining how deputies should interact with immigration authorities.

The review concluded there was “a preponderance of evidence” showing that Zwinck as well as Sheriff’s Deputy Erik Olson, who was on the group chat, and their supervisor, Sgt. Joe LeMoine, “acted outside of agency policy.”

Zwinck was placed on unpaid administrative leave for three weeks and Olson for two. Both will be reassigned to patrol. LeMoine was suspended without pay for two days.

Lt. David Holdren, LeMoine's supervisor, received a letter of reprimand and Holdren's supervisor, Capt. Curtis Brammer, was provided documented counseling.

Earlier this month, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against Zwinck, alleging that he had violated Colorado laws limiting cooperation between local and federal immigration authorities.

Rowell said the lawsuit ""sends a demoralizing message to law enforcement officers across Colorado"" and urged Weiser to ""apply the law equally to all law enforcement and government officials instead of making Deputy Zwinck an example.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250616-Caroline-Dias-Goncalves-vl-548p-b8f924.jpg",N,,2025-08-01 09:59:00.679198

She did not comment on what role, if any, Mr. Kennedy’s office had played in the case.","After nearly two months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, Paola Clouatre, 25, secured her release from a Louisiana detention center this week following an intervention from an unlikely source: a Republican lawmaker who has allied himself with President Trump.

Officials who work in the office of Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, requested that the Department of Homeland Security release Ms. Clouatre from detention after an immigration judge halted her deportation order, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times.

Ms. Clouatre, a Mexican citizen, had been detained by ICE agents on May 27 while she was at a routine appointment in New Orleans related to her application for a green card and permanent resident status.

Ms. Clouatre first entered the United States as a teenager to seek asylum with her mother and brother. The family was processed at the border in Tijuana, according to Ms. Clouatre and her lawyer, and was granted parole, which allows migrants to remain temporarily in the country. In 2018, Ms. Clouatre’s mother failed to show up for a court hearing in California, leading a judge to issue a deportation order against Ms. Clouatre.

Ms. Clouatre’s apprehension came amid growing pressure from the White House to ramp up arrests to fulfill Mr. Trump’s pledge of mass deportations. ICE agents have raided farms, swept through factories and targeted immigration courthouses across the country, in some cases arresting immigrants as they attend routine hearings.

Mr. Kennedy, the junior Louisiana senator, has been a vocal supporter of these efforts, appearing on conservative radio shows and cable television to decry sanctuary cities and applaud ICE agents’ enforcement.

“If you’re in our country illegally, you’re a criminal,” Mr. Kennedy said during a July 17 Fox News interview. “Illegal immigration is illegal, duh.”

So the Clouatres were surprised to learn that people in his office were fighting to reunite their family.

In an email on Tuesday morning, Christy Tate, the constituent services representative in Mr. Kennedy’s office, wrote to Mr. Clouatre to confirm that his wife had been released from ICE custody after her office had made a formal request to the federal agency.

“I am so happy for you and your family,” Ms. Tate wrote. “We will continue to keep you, your family and others that are experiencing the same issues in our prayers.”

Ms. Tate did not respond to phone calls or emails, and representatives of Mr. Kennedy’s office did not reply to a request for comment from The Times.

Ms. Clouatre was released from a north Louisiana detention center on Monday and is back home with her family in Baton Rouge. She is wearing an ankle monitor and awaits a court date to continue immigration proceedings. Her lawyer, Carey Holliday, said she was likely to obtain a green card.

Mr. Holliday said he had contacted Mr. Kennedy’s office in June to tell staff members there about the family’s case and to ask for their support. He said he believed ICE had eventually released Ms. Clouatre because of mounting public pressure from sources including Mr. Kennedy’s office.

“It’s a very compelling case,” Mr. Holliday said. “This is someone who honorably served his country, was honorably discharged, and now the government wants to take his wife away. It’s not a good look.”

More deportation flights have taken off from there than from any other place in the United States, and more domestic ICE flights have passed through there than anywhere else, according to a widely cited database of ICE flights.

Punished for Playing by the Rules: the Deliberate Cruelty of Trump’s Deportation Regime

The overwhelming majority of immigrants whose cases are winding through the immigration court system show up for their hearings, believing that by adhering to the system’s labyrinthine requirements they’ll be rewarded with clearance to stay in the country. Or at least the chance to fight another day. But under President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation regime, abiding by the immigration system’s rules has become increasingly dangerous. Those who show up in court now routinely face arrest. But failure to appear for a hearing generally triggers a deportation order, attorneys explained.

U.S. Highlighted on International Human Rights Watchlist for ‘Sustained Attacks on Civil Freedoms’ Under Trump

The U.S. has again been highlighted on a watchlist maintained by global alliance CIVICUS to draw attention to serious concerns regarding the exercise of civic liberties in various countries, with the organization pointing to “sustained attacks on civil freedoms” in the first six months of President Donald Trump’s second term.

The hidden bill of incarceration: How Black women bear the brunt of ‘pay-to-stay’ policies

Did you know that nearly all states allow jails and prisons to charge incarcerated people for things like room and board and medical care? It is a financial cost that is often passed on to families and loved ones, and is especially harmful for Black families. While these fees are supposed to be taken directly from incarcerated people’s wages, most adults working in these facilities make less than $1 a day. As a result, these balances grow, and that debt is either carried over into incarcerated people’s lives after release or passed onto their loved ones.",https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1-2-1024x576.png,N,,2025-08-01 10:57:07.291458

Scott Wiener, who authored a bill to ban certain kinds of face coverings for law enforcement.
That’s due in large part to opposition from powerful state and local law enforcement lobby groups, whose members resent being lumped in with federal immigration officials and questions about its legality.
Newsom has slammed federal agents’ use of face coverings — but also publicly questioned whether the state can regulate federal law enforcement.
The governor’s team in a statement also echoed moderate Democrats’ concerns about its scope.
“I’m not critical of the why, it’s the how,” said Kathryn Barger, a moderate Republican, during the meeting.","“People wearing ski masks are grabbing people, throwing them into unmarked cars and sending them to Alligator Alcatraz or El Salvador or Libya,” said California state Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored a bill to ban certain kinds of face coverings for law enforcement. “It’s really terrifying, and there should be a deep, broad-based movement to put a stop to this kind of fascist secret police.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security called the efforts “repulsive messaging bills that stoke dangerous anti-ICE rhetoric for cheap political points and fundraising emails” in a statement to POLITICO, adding that federal officers “clearly identify themselves as law enforcement” and need the masks to shield themselves from violence and online harassment.

Even in California, which is dominated by a Democratic supermajority, lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom aren’t entirely sold on Wiener’s anti-mask bill. That’s due in large part to opposition from powerful state and local law enforcement lobby groups, whose members resent being lumped in with federal immigration officials and questions about its legality.

Newsom has slammed federal agents’ use of face coverings — but also publicly questioned whether the state can regulate federal law enforcement. The governor’s team in a statement also echoed moderate Democrats’ concerns about its scope.

“This is a critical issue facing our communities,” said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a Newsom spokesperson. “Consistent with the Governor’s direction, we want to ensure the bill doesn’t disrupt the important work of state and local law enforcement, which doesn’t involve immigration operations.”

In Los Angeles County, one member of the Board of Supervisors questioned how such an ordinance would be enforced as her colleagues voted to take the first step toward drafting anti-mask rules.

“I’m not critical of the why, it’s the how,” said Kathryn Barger, a moderate Republican, during the meeting.

Janice Hahn, the supervisor who put forward the proposal, acknowledged its legality “may be decided in court.”

“This is the time for our vulnerable residents — and whether or not it gives them a false sense of security — they need to know that their government is paying attention … that we have the courage of our convictions to stand up and say, ‘When you’re in our county, this is how we expect you to behave as a law enforcement official,’” Hahn said.

Bryan Steil was met by a hostile crowd attempting to shout him down Thursday evening during his first town hall gathering since the passage of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Some supporters left early calling the spectacle “disgusting,” while one Democratic activist said the Janesville Republican “got what he deserved” for being a rubber stamp for Trump and the GOP.

The Elkhorn High School auditorium was filled with around 200 people, some of whom carried signs with slogans like “Resist,” “God is King no Others” and “Hands off SSI and Medicare.” When he entered the stage, Steil was met a by a roar of boos mixed with some cheers from a smaller group of his supporters.

The town hall was raucous as the audience repeatedly overpowered Steil’s microphone. He paused often while urging the crowd to stay civil and allow him to answer a series of questions out of respect to those who asked them.

The questions touched on a wide range of issues from federal funding for cancer research, Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs being enacted without congressional approval and the immigration arrests by masked ICE agents “disappearing” people.

One attendee questioned the morality of deportation raids during Trump’s second term.

“What I see happening to our immigrant population embarrasses me, horrifies me, and you have not raised your voice to complain about it,” she told Steil. “I see no leadership. I see following Trump 100 percent of the time.”

In response, Steil lauded Trump’s executive orders and deportations.

“What I see as moral hazard was created by (former President Joe) Biden by allowing the U.S.-Mexico border to remain unsecure,” Steil said, as he was drowned out by a roar of boos that lasted roughly 10 seconds.

“I think we need to secure the U.S.-Mexico border,” Steil continued after the crowd quieted. “You may not. It’s fine that we disagree.”

On tariffs, a man from Elkhorn said he was always under the impression that Congress must be involved, which was met with loud cheers. He then asked “what dire economic circumstances” put Trump in a position to issue them without congressional approval.

Steil didn’t get into specifics about the role of Congress, but said the overall goal of the Trump administration is “to make sure that other countries are treating the United States fairly.” He called China an “egregious abuser” of U.S. trade policies across multiple administrations. When asked again why the president is going it alone, Steil referenced an ongoing legal battle over whether Trump needs Congress’ blessing.

The shouting, the boos and overall chaos was too much for Walworth County resident Carol Stanczak who walked out of the auditorium about halfway through the question-and-answer session. She told WPR she came to have questions answered, but Steil was “road blocked by people screaming and hollering.”

“You know, I don’t know if these people are paid to come in here and be jerks,” Stanczak said. “This is not the American way. Let the man speak!”

She said Steil is a good leader who is committed to and concerned about his constituents. She said the audience’s behavior only strengthened her support.

“I’ll fight harder,” Stanczak said.

Another Steil supporter, Kevin Roblee of Lake Geneva, stood at the back of the auditorium and occasionally shouted at the crowd to let Steil answer questions. He said Walworth County is “a conservative county, and this is the fist time I’ve ever seen this kind of rhetoric coming out of the audience.” He said the dialogue “seems to be against Trump, rather than what Bryan Steil is doing in Congress, which is much more important and relevant.”

“This has nothing to do with Bryan Steil or his efforts in Congress, and that’s why I’m upset,” Roblee said.

Retired AFSCME union staff member and current organizer Mary Burpee of Elkhorn saw the town hall differently. She said she wasn’t surprised to see the anger leveled at Steil because constituents like her have been “demanding” he hold an in-person town hall “for many months, almost a year now.”

“Normally, I would be of the persuasion that there should be some decorum that, you know, let your representative speak,” Burpee said. “But I think he deserved this today, and I say that because he’s given the middle finger to his constituents for so long. And I think the passage of that horrible, big, beautiful bull**** bill has got people so angry, and it’s already passed. So people are frustrated.”

Days before Thursday’s town hall, Burpee was part of a mock funeral procession that included a cardboard coffin left at the front door of Steil’s home in Janesville, which made national news Wednesday evening. She said the coffin represented the “death of democracy,” and was in no way meant as a threat against Steil or his family.

Susan Chandler, who chairs the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District delegation, also stood by Steil’s opponents who shouted during the town hall and said “people had a right to express their emotions.”

“I don’t feel he answered a single question that was presented to him,” Chandler said. “He was slick and polished, and it’s time for him to go.”

After the town hall concluded and the audience filed to their vehicles, a homemade “No Kings” sign was left hanging on the entrance to the Elkhorn High School auditorium.

“We see the law firms, bowing to pressure, bending to bullies, instead of staying rooted in justice of the law,” Biden said.
The gala is not the first speaking engagement of the summer that Biden has used to take aim at current US President Donald Trump.
Earlier this month, Biden delivered a keynote address at the Society for Human Resource Management conference in San Diego.
While Biden heaped praise on former vice-president Kamala Harris during his speech, he did not reference his decision to step down mid-election.","Former United States President Joe Biden took the stage at the National Bar Association’s 100th Annual Awards Gala in Chicago to deliver remarks honoring the United States civil rights legacy, and the state of the country.

Speaking amid continual scrutiny around his physical and mental health, Biden played up the importance of a strong judicial branch, and characterized the US as at a moment in time that “makes us confront hard truths.”

“So many of you have fought to make this country live up to its highest ideals,” Biden said. “Not since the tumultuous days of the 1960s has this fight been so existential to who we are as a nation, with marginalized groups so dramatically under attack.”

Founded in 1925, the National Bar Association is the largest and oldest network of law professors, judges, and lawyers in the US. Biden’s speech focused heavily on the contributions of Black lawyers to America’s civil rights history, and the need to continue that legacy, in light of an administration that he said “seeks to erase history, erase quality, erase justice itself.

“We see the apparent glee of some of our politicians while watching immigrants who are in this country legally torn from the arms of their family, dragged away in handcuffs from the only home they’ve ever known,” Biden said. “My friends, we need to face the hard truths of this administration.”

Law firms representing those opposing the Trump administration’s agenda have been targeted with executive orders by the administration. Some have capitulated to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Federal judges, increasingly on the receiving end of harsh rhetoric and threats to their safety, have weighed creating their own security forces.

“We see the law firms, bowing to pressure, bending to bullies, instead of staying rooted in justice of the law,” Biden said.

The gala is not the first speaking engagement of the summer that Biden has used to take aim at current US President Donald Trump. In June, he offered oblique criticism of the Trump administration during a Juneteenth celebration service at the Reedy Chapel AME Church, one of the places in Texas where an order proclaiming the end of slavery was read on 19 June 1865.

Earlier this month, Biden delivered a keynote address at the Society for Human Resource Management conference in San Diego. During a question and answer session, Biden said he was “working like hell” to finish a memoir of his presidency as he contends with his prostate cancer diagnosis.

In his book, a reflection of the 46th president’s four years in office, Biden will probably attempt to shape his legacy – and to confront questions about his mental health and physical fitness that clouded his final years in office and ultimately forced to end his bid for re-election.

While Biden heaped praise on former vice-president Kamala Harris during his speech, he did not reference his decision to step down mid-election.

In sporadic public appearances since leaving the White House, Biden has hit back against new reporting that alleges a “cover up” by the then-president’s closest aides to hide his frailty and decline from an American public who polls showed believed he was too old to serve another four years.

Biden’s speech did not directly address these allegations, although he did note his two of his claims to fame in US politics – being the youngest person ever elected to the US Senate, and the oldest person elected to the presidency.

The White House and congressional Republicans have amplified the claims, opening investigations into whether Biden was in control when he made a series of notable clemency decisions at the end of his presidency. In an interview with the New York Times this month, Biden said he orally authorized every pardon and commutation issued during his term and called Republicans who said his staff abused the presidential autopen “liars”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298355f2b81a39fbbd36d479921aec990e7dfbd1/546_0_5463_4372/master/5463.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8ce67f0d1dcd41852ee9f0a971a8b9c9",N,,2025-08-01 10:57:12.187831

Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing them from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It is part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them.

The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.

The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8.

U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.

In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.

If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment and health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy.

“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said.

Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem’s decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and motivated by racial animus.

Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.”

“Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote.

The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less.

“They gave them two months to leave the country. It’s awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday.

Honduran Foreign Minister Javier Bu Soto said via the social platform X that the ruling was “good news.”

“The decision recognizes that the petitioners are looking to exercise their right to live in freedom and without fear while the litigation plays out,” the country’s top diplomat wrote. He said the government would continue supporting Hondurans in the United States through its consular network.

Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife, co-President Rosario Murillo, have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago.

In February, a panel of U.N. experts warned the Nicaraguan government had dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was “systematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations.”

In its crackdown on immigration, the Trump administration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the U.S. on a temporary basis.

The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts.

The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration’s objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy.

Administrative Processing Is a Temporary “Refusal” Under INA §221(g) Administrative processing occurs when a visa cannot be issued at the time of the interview.
Not All Administrative Processing Is the Same There are several distinct categories: 221(g) Document Requests: Applicants receive a written request for missing evidence; must respond within one year.
Updates and Communication Are Limited: Be Patient and Strategic Visa applicants and lawyers should not submit inquiries until at least 180 days have passed post-interview, unless an emergency exists.
Key Takeaway: Administrative processing is not a final visa denial but often causes significant delays.","Administrative processing remains one of the most misunderstood causes of visa delays. The following five key points summarize recent guidance from AILA’s DOS Liaison Committee (Practice Pointer, July 30, 2025) and offer essential insight for clients and attorneys.

1. Administrative Processing Is a Temporary “Refusal” Under INA §221(g)

Administrative processing occurs when a visa cannot be issued at the time of the interview. While it is not a final denial, the case is technically refused under INA §221(g) until the applicant satisfies additional requirements (e.g., submitting documents or awaiting internal checks). The CEAC system will display the status as “Refused”, even though the visa may ultimately be issued.

2. Common Triggers Include Missing Documents, Security Clearances, and Watchlist “Hits”

The most frequent causes of administrative processing include:

Missing documents (e.g., police or court records)

Interagency security checks (name matches, Technology Alert List reviews)

Nationality-based or sensitive occupation reviews

Biometric or biographic matches to security databases

Officers may also request Form DS-5535 for certain applicants, which gathers additional biographic data.

3. Not All Administrative Processing Is the Same

There are several distinct categories:

221(g) Document Requests: Applicants receive a written request for missing evidence; must respond within one year.

Security Clearance Cases: These are internal agency checks, requiring no applicant action; duration varies.

Waiver-Dependent Refusals (INA §212(a)): Applicants found inadmissible may need to await lengthy adjudication of waivers—sometimes up to 2–3 years for immigrant visas.

4. Updates and Communication Are Limited: Be Patient and Strategic

Visa applicants and lawyers should not submit inquiries until at least 180 days have passed post-interview, unless an emergency exists.

After 180 days: use the consulate’s contact method, follow up every 30 days.

Consider congressional liaison support in urgent or humanitarian cases.

Refiling a new visa application does not expedite processing and may worsen delays.

5. Litigation May Be a Last Resort

If a case remains stalled after months (or years), a writ of mandamus in federal court may compel a decision. This requires careful legal analysis and is best handled by experienced litigation counsel.

Please contact us via email at VISALAW@Wolfsdorf.com if you seeking to litigate a past due case must be at least 6 months and in most cases armless 12 months to be credible.

Key Takeaway: Administrative processing is not a final visa denial but often causes significant delays. Understanding the process, managing expectations, and following appropriate follow-up protocols are crucial for achieving resolution.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his lawyers have frequently asked the court to intervene when lower courts have blocked executive actions on issues such as his hard-line immigration policies and efforts to fire federal employees.

The cases are brought on an emergency basis, through the court's so-called ""shadow docket,"" and the court often decides them quickly, mostly in favor of the government, without full briefings or oral arguments, and sometimes with little or no explanation.

But Kavanaugh, speaking at a conference attended by judges and lawyers in Kansas City, said the court takes the cases seriously and has made efforts to give them the attention they deserve.

Kavanaugh conceded that it is ""not a trivial question"" whether a president's policy can go into effect while litigation continues, but he added that the court does not want to signal that what is a preliminary assessment of the legal merits is the final word on the issue.

""Because of the importance of those questions, we have been, I think, doing more and more process to try to get the right answer on those preliminary assessments,"" he said.

He mentioned, for example, that the Supreme Court heard oral arguments and issued a lengthy ruling when it narrowed injunctions that had blocked Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship.

He also cited cases involving Covid-19 vaccines that arose during the Biden administration in which the court heard arguments before issuing a decision.

""I think we've written a lot more than we have in the past,"" Kavanaugh said.

With judges facing tough scrutiny, especially in the face of harsh criticism from Trump and his allies when they rule against him, Kavanaugh thanked the judges in the room for their role in protecting the rule of law.

""So I come to you all with great respect for ... what we all do to preserve what I think is the crown jewel of our constitutional democracy, which is the independence of the judiciary,"" he said.

The recruitment email, sent this week, appears to have targeted law enforcement officers whose agencies participate in the 287(g) program.
Thompson said the association has heard from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies about the recruitment emails.
... Law enforcement has always been a calling.
This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is newly flush with billions from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” spending legislation and under pressure to rapidly hire 10,000 new agents. But one tactic it recently tried to do that hiring — aggressively recruiting new agents from some of its most trusted local law enforcement partners — may have alienated some of the leaders it needs to help execute what the Trump administration wants to be the largest mass deportation in U.S. history.

“We’re their force multipliers, and this is the thanks we get for helping them do their job?” Polk County, Florida, Sheriff Grady Judd said in an interview. Judd said he’s not happy about a recruitment email ICE’s deputy director sent to hundreds of his deputies, and he blamed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees ICE.

“Kristi Noem needs to get on her big girl pants and do what’s right. She needs to make sure that there’s an apology,” said Judd, who also made it clear that he wants to “support President Trump’s mission.”

NBC News spoke to local law enforcement leaders in four states whose agencies participate in ICE’s 287(g) program, under which local officers are deputized to help in immigration enforcement, and whose deputies ICE targeted for recruitment.

The recruitment email, sent this week, appears to have targeted law enforcement officers whose agencies participate in the 287(g) program.

The email, which NBC News has obtained, reads, in part: “As someone who is currently supporting ICE through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law. Your experience in state or local law enforcement brings invaluable insight and skills to this mission —qualities we need now more than ever.”

The email also touts potential $50,000 signing bonuses as an incentive for joining ICE, and it links to a government recruitment website featuring an image of Uncle Sam, the headline “AMERICA NEEDS YOU” and the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment beyond the signing bonuses.

“ICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership,” the Pinellas County, Florida, Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

The sheriff in Pinellas County is a Republican, as is Judd.

“It was bad judgment that will cause an erosion of a relationship that has been improving of late. And it’s going to take some getting over, and it’s going to take leadership at DHS to really take stock, ’cause, hey, they need state and locals,” Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said in an interview.

Thompson said the association has heard from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies about the recruitment emails. He also said that the group has not heard from DHS since the emails were flagged to the association and that he intends to send a “very stern note” to ICE.

“This is inappropriate behavior of a partner organization,” Thompson said. “We’re all on the same boat. And you just don’t treat friends or partners like this.”

One Florida police chief who did not want to be named out of concern that his department could face retaliation said departments that have partnered with the federal government now fear they could lose their best officers.

“Now you know why everybody’s so pissed,” the chief said.

“This is like the transfer portal in college sports,” the chief said, adding: “We see people leave us because they believe they can make more money at other locations. ... Law enforcement has always been a calling. Now it’s a job.”

The DHS media office did not respond to questions about local law enforcement concerns but provided NBC News with a statement that it attributed to a senior DHS official: “ICE is recruiting law enforcement, veterans, and other patriots who want to serve their country. ... This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience. Additionally, more than $500 million from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill will go to increasing our 287(g) partnerships with state and local law enforcement.”

The sheriff’s office in Forsyth County, Georgia, told NBC News that the Atlanta ICE office “sent an apology” for the recruitment email.

Not all sheriffs are upset with the recruitment effort. In fact, some say they support it.

Thaddeus Cleveland, the sheriff of Terrell County, Texas, said, “I think if someone wants to better their life, better their career, you know, look towards the long years, the long game, retirement, there’s nothing better than the U.S. government to go out and have a successful career.”

Cleveland, who has just four deputies, admits he cannot compete with the $50,000 bonuses the agency is offering.

“We may not be able to turn around and hire somebody the next day. It may take a few weeks. It may take a few months. But again, I support, you know, someone wanting to pursue something they’re interested in. I may end up having to work a little more, which is OK.”

Goliad County, Texas, Sheriff Roy Boyd also said he is not upset about the recruitment and noted that his office also has to deal with the state’s recruiting new troopers from his department.

“We can’t compete with the salaries of the state and the feds,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250128-ice-ch-1119-9937a1.jpg",N,,2025-08-01 09:59:25.760510

PPI says that from January 20 to June 26, almost half of all ICE arrests involved people who were detained at a local jail, typically accused of minor offenses, such as driving without a license.

“Jails and police departments play a key role in criminalizing immigration by detaining people until ICE agents can make an arrest,” the group says.

The level of cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents greatly varies. Some states or cities prohibit law enforcement from sharing information or coordinating with ICE. However, hundreds of law enforcement agencies are part of the federal 287(g) program which deputizes state and local officers to act as immigration agents. The number of participating agencies has skyrocketed under Trump. As of June 30, 875 law enforcement agencies had joined the program, up from 135 in December of 2024.

In addition to feeding people into the deportation system, local jails also lease beds to ICE, the U.S. Marshals Service, or both. PPI found that in 25 states, the only bed space available to ICE or the U.S. Marshals Service is in local jails. While sanctuary city policies generally bar cooperation with ICE, they often permit contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service, which, under Trump, plays a critical role in detaining thousands of immigrants. The U.S. Marshals Service has contracts with almost 1,000 jails, according to PPI.

PPI says that from January through June, federal prosecutors charged thousands of people with criminal immigration offenses. This led to the pretrial detention of almost 20,000 people. For criminal immigration charges, the U.S. Marshals Service, not ICE, would be responsible for the person’s incarceration, thereby circumventing local jurisdictions’ bans on cooperating with ICE.

“ICE and other federal agencies can refer people for federal prosecution on immigration-related ‘crimes’ and thus use contracted local jails in sanctuary cities, counties, and states,” the report says. “In doing so, the Trump administration is transforming what are normally civil immigration matters into more serious federal crimes. This shift hides the true scale of immigrant detention from public view, which is often reported as only those in ICE custody and does not include those facing criminal prosecution.”

According to PPI, people detained pretrial on criminal immigration charges, as well as those held on ICE detainers or in overnight hold rooms, are not included in ICE detention data, which recorded about 57,000 people held on average in June. However, PPI estimates that more than 80,000 people are detained in the “crimmigration system.”

“Almost 900 people crossed the Channel yesterday, meaning 25,000 people, mainly young men, have crossed the Channel this year.

Figures released on Thursday show that nearly 900 refugees and migrants made the crossing in 13 small boats on Wednesday alone, bringing the total number of arrivals in 2025 to 25,436. It’s a perilous journey that has resulted in dozens of deaths over the years.

The milestone is likely to intensify political scrutiny over Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s handling of undocumented migration. His government has pledged tougher action on smuggling networks, with Starmer vowing to “smash the gangs” responsible for transporting people across the Channel.

Opposition politicians have seized on the latest numbers to criticise Labour’s approach.

“Almost 900 people crossed the Channel yesterday, meaning 25,000 people, mainly young men, have crossed the Channel this year. [And] 2025 is the worst year on record so far, and the Labour Government are doing nothing to stop the crossings,” said Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp.

He added: “Their 17 in, one out deal with France will not even make a dent – it would take 10 years for [Home Secretary] Yvette Cooper to deport the illegal immigrants that have arrived since the start of this year alone under her so-called deal, which still hasn’t started.”

Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron announced “one in, one out” returns of asylum seekers earlier this month. The pilot programme sets out that for every person returned, a different individual would be allowed “to come here via a safe route: controlled and legal, subject to strict security checks and only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally”, Starmer said at the time.

Philp also reiterated his party’s proposal to immediately detain and deport new arrivals, warning that continued legal challenges under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) could force a Conservative government to consider withdrawing from it, a threat they have often made in and around the Brexit years when the party was in government.

Radical right Reform UK leader Nigel Farage echoed those criticisms, writing on social media: “898 illegals crossed the English Channel yesterday. This means more hotels, more costs and more people who should not be here. The public have had ENOUGH!”

A series of violent far-right demonstrations have been held recently outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, north of London.

Meanwhile, United States President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a hardline anti-immigration platform and has been executing it during his second term with raids and deportations of immigrants, recently praised the UK government’s efforts, saying it was “doing a fantastic thing” by addressing the issue, though he admitted knowing “nothing about the boats”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10960318-1689674914.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-01 10:57:26.216698

As the Trump Administration indiscriminately targets all immigrants, rather than focusing on violent criminals, including arresting lawful permanent residents and those here with legal protections, Padilla pushed for Republicans to finally come together to protect DACA recipients by passing the Dream Act.
Padilla emphasized that Republicans continue to voice support for the Dream Act behind closed doors and vowed to keep fighting to secure permanent protections for DACA recipients.
Key Excerpts: “Colleagues, it feels like every single day the Trump Administration finds new ways to defy the rule of law.
Senator Padilla is a leading voice in Congress for providing long-term undocumented immigrants with pathways to citizenship or permanent legal residence.","Padilla: “This mass detention and deportation operation will go down in our history as a stain, a dark chapter in our nation’s history, an outrageous moral failure, intentionally caused by this Administration.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last night, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, took to the Senate floor to defend Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients from the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) baseless statement that “illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of DACA are not automatically protected from deportations.” Padilla slammed the Trump Administration’s push for DACA recipients to “self-deport,” emphasizing that these long-term residents, who were brought to the country as children, have been working, studying, and living legally in the United States since 2012 and are vital members of American communities.

He highlighted the story of Javier Diaz Santana, a deaf 32-year-old DACA recipient who was arrested while at the Los Angeles car wash where he has worked hard six days a week for the last five years. Masked immigration officials carrying weapons raided the Temple City car wash, confiscating his ID and handcuffing him, preventing him from communicating. Despite having no criminal record and living in the United States since he was five years old, Javier was taken to El Paso, Texas where he faced the risk of deportation.

As the Trump Administration indiscriminately targets all immigrants, rather than focusing on violent criminals, including arresting lawful permanent residents and those here with legal protections, Padilla pushed for Republicans to finally come together to protect DACA recipients by passing the Dream Act. Padilla emphasized that Republicans continue to voice support for the Dream Act behind closed doors and vowed to keep fighting to secure permanent protections for DACA recipients. He also blasted the Administration for scapegoating hardworking immigrants and using cruel immigration enforcement as spectacles to distract from their failing policy agenda.

Key Excerpts:

“Colleagues, it feels like every single day the Trump Administration finds new ways to defy the rule of law. They will tear families apart, decimate local businesses, and deceive the public in order to distract from their own failures and scandals. And nowhere has this been clearer than in their cruelty towards immigrants.”

“If it was just deportation operations focused on dangerous violent criminals, there would be no discussion, there would be no debate, there would be no disagreement. But that’s not what this Administration is doing. They are going after all immigrants. The vast majority of those that have been arrested and detained and many of those deported, many without due process before being deported, are not convicted criminals.”

“The Trump Administration is saying that these young adults who were brought to the United States as children and who have lived here, who have studied here, and who have worked here legally — let me emphasize that: worked here, studied here, lived here legally — since the year 2012, thanks to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, this Administration is saying now that they have no right to be here, that they could be deported, or maybe should be deported at a moment’s notice, or worse, that they should choose to leave their families and their communities for countries that they’ve never known.”

“The whole point of DACA is protection from deportation because these are not criminals or some danger to society. These are young people who have lived in the United States for as long as they can remember. These are young adults who, as kids, were on your little league team or in your Girl Scout troop. For God’s sake, they’re part of our communities, and they’re young adults who have now grown up to be lawyers, to be doctors, to be teachers, and who have more love for everything that this country stands for than anyone threatening them in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security.”

“This week, the Trump Administration is now telling them that they should be arrested and thrown out of the only home they’ve ever known in an attempt to satisfy Donald Trump’s quest for political points or an arbitrary quota. To the Trump Administration, let me say this: you cannot claim to love our country at the same time you’re trying to destroy our future.”

“Don’t tell me the Trump Administration is following the law when we hear cases like this, and don’t tell me that the Administration is only targeting dangerous, violent criminals because the data proves otherwise. … For as tragic and as heartbreaking as Javier’s story is, he’s not alone. There have been more and more stories of DACA recipients being arrested and detained, and the fear is just growing across communities.”

“One thing is certain: this mass detention and deportation operation will go down in our history as a stain, a dark chapter in our nation’s history, an outrageous moral failure, intentionally caused by this Administration. Because for all the tough talk, this is not just politics as usual. In fact, when the Dream Act was first introduced over 20 years ago, it was bipartisan, and it enjoyed bipartisan support for most of the last 20 years, and even today, polling shows an overwhelming majority of the American public supports DACA recipients. Yes, both Republicans and Democrats across the country.”

“Make no mistake, Americans will not soon forget what this Administration is doing to their neighbors — to their neighbors, to their co-workers, to their friends. Now, this story doesn’t end the way you think it might, because we will continue fighting, not just to stop these outrageous arrests, but we will not rest until we enact real and permanent protections for DACA recipients who contribute so much to our country.”

Video of Senator Padilla’s floor speech is available here.

Senator Padilla is a leading voice in Congress for providing long-term undocumented immigrants with pathways to citizenship or permanent legal residence. Last week, Padilla hosted a press conference in Los Angeles alongside immigration advocates, impacted families, and community leaders to announce legislation to expand a pathway to lawful permanent residency for millions of long-term U.S. residents. As Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and mass deportation assaults intensified in Los Angeles, Padilla marked the 13th anniversary of the DACA policy by urging Congress to take immediate action to deliver permanent protections for millions of families, parents, and individuals who are increasingly at risk amid President Trump’s mass deportation agenda. He also delivered remarks on the Senate floor ahead of the anniversary, pushing for permanent protections for Dreamers rather than the indiscriminate ICE raids stoking fear in Los Angeles communities.

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose taxes — including tariffs — but over decades, lawmakers have ceded power over trade policy to the White House.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Appellate court judges expressed broad skepticism Thursday over President Donald Trump’s legal rationale for his most expansive round of tariffs.

Members of the 11-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington appeared unconvinced by the Trump administration’s insistence that the president could impose tariffs without congressional approval, and it hammered its invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to do so.

“IEEPA doesn’t even mention the word ‘tariffs’ anywhere,” Circuit Judge Jimmie Reyna said, in a sign of the panel’s incredulity to a government attorney’s arguments.

Brett Shumate, the attorney representing the Trump administration, acknowledged in the 99-minute hearing “no president has ever read IEEPA this way” but contended it was nonetheless lawful.

The 1977 law, signed by President Jimmy Carter, allows the president to seize assets and block transactions during a national emergency. It was first used during the Iran hostage crisis and has since been invoked for a range of global unrest, from the 9/11 attacks to the Syrian civil war.

Trump says the country’s trade deficit is so serious that it likewise qualifies for the law’s protection.

In sharp exchanges with Shumate, appellate judges questioned that contention, asking whether the law extended to tariffs at all and, if so, whether the levies matched the threat the administration identified.

“If the president says there’s a problem with our military readiness,” Chief Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore posited, “and he puts a 20% tax on coffee, that doesn’t seem to necessarily deal with (it).”

Shumate said Congress’ passage of IEEPA gave the president “broad and flexible” power to respond to an emergency, but that “the president is not asking for unbounded authority.”

But an attorney for the plaintiffs, Neal Katyal, characterized Trump’s maneuver as a “breathtaking” power grab that amounted to saying “the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long as he wants so long as he declares an emergency.”

No ruling was issued from the bench. Regardless of what decision the judges’ deliberations bring, the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump weighed in on the case on his Truth Social platform, posting: “To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country, good luck in America’s big case today. If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE “DEAD,” WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!’'

In filings in the case, the Trump administration insists that “a national emergency exists” necessitating its trade policy. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, was unconvinced, however, ruling in May that Trump exceeded his powers.

The issue now rests with the appeals judges.

The challenge strikes at just one batch of import taxes from an administration that has unleashed a bevy of them and could be poised to unveil more on Friday.

The case centers on Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs of April 2 that imposed new levies on nearly every country. But it doesn’t cover other tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, nor ones imposed on China during Trump’s first term, and continued by President Joe Biden.

The case is one of at least seven lawsuits charging that Trump overstepped his authority through the use of tariffs on other nations. The plaintiffs include 12 U.S. states and five businesses, including a wine importer, a company selling pipes and plumbing goods, and a maker of fishing gear.

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose taxes — including tariffs — but over decades, lawmakers have ceded power over trade policy to the White House.

Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, the highest rate since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.

The attorney general for one of the states suing Trump sounded confident after the hearing, arguing that the judges “didn’t buy’’ the Trump administration’s arguments. “You would definitely rather be in our shoes going forward,’’ Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said.

Rayfield said that Trump’s tariffs — which are paid by importers in the United States who often try to pass along the higher costs to their customers — amount to one of the largest tax increases in American history. “This was done all by one human being sitting in the Oval Office,” he said.

NBC Washington first reported on attorneys’ concerns about the increased presence of immigration officers at the courthouse.
“This type of ICE presence in and around the courthouse has never been like this,” said Butorac, who’s served as a public defender in Fairfax for over two decades.

Dawn Butorac, the county’s chief public defender, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been “coming to the courthouse to arrest people when they show up for their court cases.” It appeared to be happening more frequently last week, she said, and they’ve been making arrests inside for about the last month.

NBC Washington first reported on attorneys’ concerns about the increased presence of immigration officers at the courthouse.

“This type of ICE presence in and around the courthouse has never been like this,” said Butorac, who’s served as a public defender in Fairfax for over two decades.

In some cases, the officers wait outside the nearby jail for when people are released on bond, Butorac said. But they’re also appearing “when they know people might have court cases — that could be traffic infractions, that could be traffic cases, it could be felony charges, and they’re showing up to arrest people.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office said the department is aware ICE made two arrests inside the courthouse on July 21. The agency doesn’t keep records of when and where immigration officials make arrests, the statement said, but “to our knowledge, these are the only arrests that have occurred inside of the courthouse building by ICE.”

Until July 21, the statement said, ICE would generally make arrests outside of the courthouse.

Butorac said sheriff deputies have been escorting ICE agents through the courthouse to specific courtrooms in order to help them find people they want to arrest.

“This actively assisting, walking through the courthouse with them, being with them when things are happening, that is new and shouldn’t be happening,” Butorac said.

The sheriff’s office, meanwhile, said it doesn’t assist ICE in making arrests, and that there hasn’t been a change to department policy.

The increased ICE presence, Butorac said, “adds a layer of making people afraid to come to court, and that includes everyone. That includes not only the people who are looking to have their cases resolved, but also people who might be victims of crimes. They might not want to come to court. People might not want to report crimes because they’re afraid of all law enforcement.”

The agents making the arrests, she said, haven’t displayed a warrant before taking people into custody. There have also been cases in which people have told officers they’re in the U.S. legally and have been charged with but not convicted of a crime, “which would be the thing that then would take away their status, and (their cases are) not being finished, and they very likely could never be resolved,” she said.

The circumstances, Butorac said, are creating a “due process problem.”

Attorneys are more aware and monitoring whether immigration officials are in the courthouse and are frustrated because, “We all have a stake in the system running fairly, and everybody’s matter being resolved and they’re not getting done.”

In the case of clients, Butorac said anecdotally, “You just see the fear that our clients have, and the greater risk they’re taking when making decisions about how to resolve their case.”

The announcement, made in a city where three-fourths of residents are foreign-born, was greeted with thunderous applause as Trump said his next administration was going to root out undocumented criminals.

But under the current Trump administration, the idea of who is considered a “criminal” has broadened to include all undocumented people. ICE raids and arrests of undocumented immigrants, regardless of their criminal history, have ignited fear and anger from Hispanic communities across the country, a diverse voting bloc Trump made inroads with in 2024.

In Florida, the governor was quick to assist the president make the leap from “bad hombres” to anyone without papers. In February, at the first meeting of his State Board of Immigration meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said, “If you are here illegally that is a crime too, OK? You can’t just say you have free range to be here illegally until you commit some type of felony. I want you out before you commit the felony.”

The sweeping characterization of undocumented immigrants as criminals, even those that are trying to follow the rules, is changing attitudes about President Trump’s response to what he once called an “invasion.” In South Florida, large groups of immigrants who had Temporary Protected Status or asylum cases pending saw themselves suddenly categorized as “criminals” after the Trump administration ended their statuses. Recent national polling shows Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration while a local survey shows that some of South Florida’s Venezuelan immigrants are feeling disillusioned. The pendulum swing now even has South Florida Republican elected officials finding themselves in a precarious situation: stay loyal to Trump’s agenda or answer to their immigrant voter base.

“There’s this huge upsurge of sentiment that this is a country of immigrants, that these immigrants are not all bad,” said Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University. “And that even those who are being deported should be treated in a more humane way.”

‘Everyone is basically at risk’

Fort Lauderdale immigration attorney Mark Hamburger told the Miami Herald that under previous presidential administrations there was an understanding that migrants who commit serious crimes should be prioritized for deportation over undocumented people with clean records and families in the country that depend on them. “There is no line anymore. Everyone is basically at risk,” Hamburger said.

“Trump wants to group all immigrants into this category of criminals, but that’s just not true,” he said. “I’m sure they’d love to say, ‘They’re all criminals, they all have records.’ But they don’t even say that anymore. Now, what the press secretary says is, ‘Well, they’re here unlawfully and that in itself is a crime, so we’re detaining anyone who’s here unlawfully.’”

By targeting undocumented people in general, Hamburger said, the Trump administration has overwhelmed the court system and stoked fear, ultimately to push immigrants to self-deport.

One of Hamburger’s clients was a woman from Nicaragua who came to the United States in 2022 seeking political asylum, which her sister and cousin were able to secure. She had been living in Los Angeles, but was feeling paranoid amid the ICE raids and anti-ICE protests.

Hamburger called her before her trial, which was finally set for last month. She was noticeably nervous over the phone and hung up. When he called back, she confessed: “I’m in Honduras right now.”

Though she had a strong political asylum case, Hamburger said, the stress was making her sick. She gave up on her case and left the country.

“I have many other cases like that where people are just slowly putting up the white flag,” Hamburger said. “The chaos, the psychological torture, it reaches a certain point for immigrants where it starts to manifest physically as illness. And some people, ultimately, just give up.”

Americans soften on immigration

As U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar of Miami pitched the Dignity Act to the American public — and Trump himself — Salazar reiterated a crucial point that undoubtedly resonates with her constituents in Miami: not all undocumented immigrants are criminals.

“Yes, they broke the law, but someone gave them a job because they needed those workers, workers who are still needed today,” she said.

The bill would grant undocumented immigrants living in the country for more than five years with no criminal record a legal status that protects them from deportation. While its passage remains unlikely in a polarized Congress, it marks a notable attempt by Salazar to distance herself from the full scope of Trump’s immigration crackdown..

The timing is notable. A growing body of polling shows that the public mood is shifting — and fast.

A July 11 Gallup poll found that Americans are becoming more positive about immigration, reversing four years of rising concern. In June 2024, 55 percent of respondents wanted immigration reduced. By July 2025, that number dropped to just 30 percent. Among Hispanic voters, Trump’s approval on immigration now sits at 21 percent, well below his national average.

A separate CBS News poll found that a majority of Americans believe Trump’s administration is targeting “people who aren’t dangerous criminals” for deportation — and that his second-term policies have gone further than many voters expected.

What’s behind this big change in public opinion?

“A lot of it has to do with overreach,” said Mike Madrid, a Republican political commentator and expert on Latino voters. Many are critical of the Trump administration for circumventing due process and sending military vehicles to cities like Los Angeles, Madrid said. Americans have also been inundated with harrowing anecdotes in the news and on social media of undocumented immigrants being detained by ICE and separated from their families, likely adding to the unpopularity of Trump’s policies.

In Miami, ICE agents in plain clothes have arrested immigrants as they walked out of immigration courtrooms. In a New York Times report published in June, a reporter watched as ICE officers in Miami arrested an undocumented man they were looking for, along with his brother who happened to be with him.

“[Trump’s] numbers are still very strong with Republicans. I think the vast majority of Republicans did vote for this and like it, and frankly, think he probably could still be more aggressive,” Madrid said. “But the voters that he needs to get to a majority — young voters, Hispanic voters, independents — they have fled in pretty historic numbers. The collapse is pretty spectacular, especially given a very short time frame.”

Immigration attorneys across the country are hustling to help clients who have been swept up in the crackdown despite having no criminal history. Hamburger said most of his clients either have no criminal history or have been charged with misdemeanors, the most common being driving without a license. Two clients of his were arrested while fishing without a license, he said. Now, they’re in Alligator Alcatraz, the state-run immigration detention facility built in the Everglades where detainees reportedly face harsh and disgusting conditions.

Hundreds of detainees who earlier this month were held in Alligator Alcatraz or scheduled to be sent there had no criminal convictions or pending charges in the United States, the Herald reported this month.

‘They didn’t vote for this’

Salazar, who represents a diverse swath of Miami-Dade County with large populations of Cubans, Haitians, Caribbeans, Colombians and Venezuelans, is “in a bind,” said Gamarra, the FIU professor. While Gamarra said the Dignity Act bill is unlikely to pass, “it helps her public stance.”

Salazar will have to answer to that large constituency in the mid-terms, though Gamara said it’s too early to tell exactly how Latino voters in Miami will respond to South Florida Republicans.

But there are some notable trends emerging. An FIU survey Gamarra conducted in May among Venezuelans in Florida showed real disillusionment among a third of Trump voters with his administration’s immigration policy, particularly the ending of Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole.

“I can tell you from looking at the Venezuelan data that there is a degree of sentiment, very deeply held sentiment, that they were betrayed, that they didn’t vote for this,” Gamarra said. “They thought it was going to only be criminals because they made that distinction that ‘we’re not criminals.’ But they didn’t anticipate the broader definition of ‘criminal’ behavior that the administration has adopted.”

In the meantime, Madrid said he has noticed “fascinating” shifts occurring in different Latino communities in response to Trump’s policies.

For the first time in his career, Madrid said he is seeing the Cuban American community respond to this moment the same way the Mexican American community is, despite their very different histories in the United States and typical political beliefs. He recalled attending a recent press conference where Cuban and Venezuelan community leaders called on FIFA to protect attendees from ICE the way the Dodgers’ did in Los Angeles.

“That same fear, that same terror, is not something we normally see from the Cuban American community with a Republican president!” he said. “We’ve never seen that before.”

Mounting evidence shows the Trump administration’s weaponization of data analysis to target immigrants for detention and deportation moving forward rapidly. Continued advancements in AI technology are aiding in this effort.

The ongoing erosion of digital privacy this entails could soon allow the administration to not only expand its war on immigrants but also more efficiently target political enemies.

Central to the Trump administration’s strategy is exploitation of loopholes in the Privacy Act, whereby the mere allegation of criminality is enough to erode even U.S. citizens’ privacy protection.

Protections under the Privacy Act only apply to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, leaving undocumented immigrants particularly vulnerable. However, even U.S. citizens’ privacy protection evaporates if it is alleged that they are under investigation, as is the case for two former Trump aides accused by the President of treason for criticisms they leveled during and since his first term.

More worrisome is the judicial deference to administration claims that its enemies are “being investigated,” without evidence that an actual investigation is under way or has any basis.

In June, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a request from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for access to Social Security Administration data on the grounds that it was “investigating” fraud and waste.

The court’s three liberals dissented in the ruling, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writing that the ruling’s “emergency” justification was based solely on the fact that the court “cannot be bothered to wait for the litigation process to play out.” (Lawsuits challenging DOGE’s request had been pending.)

Such a pretext, Jackson added, “has traditionally been insufficient to justify the kind of extraordinary intervention the Government seeks.”

Meanwhile, the adoption of military intelligence technology—developed, in part, on “kill chain” analytic work by Palantir Technologies—to sift through this newly available data means the government can now do so more accurately and at cost.

Such battlefield data analysis approaches are already being used to improve the ability of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to target, detain and deport immigrants. In April, DHS awarded Palantir a $30 million contract to improve its existing Investigation Management System to better target immigrants for detention.

“Palantir software is already configured to support the ICE mission and environment,” DHS noted in announcing the contract.

Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former employee of Palantir Technologies now deeply concerned about the company’s violation of its’ initial principles for ethical data analysis, explains how the process works.

“In AI-enabled military operations today, the first phases of the kill chain—finding and fixing—focus on data collection and sensor input to identify and categorize subjects as targets, threats or non-targets,” writes Pinto on his Substack page.

“This type of categorization, known as ‘fixing’ in a military context, allows corporations to mark individuals for targeted action.”

For authoritarian regimes, these targeting algorithms—which are continually being refined with new AI technology—can be applied to any government-defined group of perceived enemies, immigrant or otherwise, with staggering efficiency and for pennies on the dollar.

As might be expected, ICE (Immigrations and Custom Enforcement) and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) have long used their own administrative data when determining, for example, where to conduct a workplace raid. The challenge is that the information could be out of date, missing or ambiguous (e.g., multiple individuals with the same name).

Organizations such as Palantir—with sophisticated data analysis drawing from multiple datasets—can do a better job of determining where a particular “target” can be found. And, thanks to an earlier Executive Order, “Stopping Waste, Fraud and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,” signed in March, the number of data sets available have expanded significantly. They include the following:

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

Social Security Administration (SSA)

U.S. Education Department

U.S. Postal Service

An inevitable consequence of such record sharing is that information provided by mixed-status households—where one or more family members is undocumented—for securing services such as SNAP for eligible U.S. citizen children provide indicators of immigration status that would allow an undocumented parent to be targeted.

Access to a particular individual’s data in many such cases provides access to data on their entire households, some of whom might become “collateral damage” when the data record is used for targeting detention.

Similarly, algorithms developed by Palantir experts could incorporate “indicators” such as ESL enrollment or medical treatment requiring an interpreter that do not definitively reflect citizenship/legal status but could be used in building AI-driven models for targeting.

In principle, each agency would ordinarily deny access to records with individuals’ personally identifying information as required by the Privacy Act. In today’s context, with the Trump administration clawing away at the firewalls that once guaranteed our privacy, such assumptions are anything but certain.

In our current information-rich environment, the outcome of the ongoing war over access to data will be as important or, arguably, more important than increased funding for in-the-field detentions by ICE or CBP, whose authority has now been extended nationwide.

Unfortunately, traditional judicial deference to the executive branch, premised on the assumption that the government objective is better governance, is no longer justified. All that can be hoped for at this point is a groundswell of public pressure for integrity in government and commitment to the rule of law.",https://fresnoalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/KillChain_web.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 10:57:56.914928

The appeals court adjourned Thursday morning after roughly an hour-and-a-half of arguments without issuing a ruling, and gave no indication as to when their decision might come.
Many — but not all — of Trump’s many tariff announcements rely on IEEPA for legal justification.
I mean, you heard justices referring to footnotes in pages of an opinion from 1975 for heaven's sake,” Katyal said.
“As officers of the court, as people who care deeply about the Constitution, it's just gratifying to be part of that process.”","A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard arguments Thursday about the legality of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff agenda, just one day before higher reciprocal tariff rates on dozens of nations around the world were set to take effect once again.

The 11 justices on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had tough questions for attorneys on both sides of the dispute, though they appeared inclined to agree with the lower Court of International Trade’s ruling earlier this year that Trump overstepped his legal authority in imposing the tariffs.

A coalition of five small businesses that import goods from overseas as well as a group of 12 Democratic-led states filed challenges to the tariffs, with both cases consolidated upon appeal. The appeals court adjourned Thursday morning after roughly an hour-and-a-half of arguments without issuing a ruling, and gave no indication as to when their decision might come.

At issue in the case is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law that gives the president broad powers to “regulate” international commerce during times of national emergency, specifically grants him the power to impose tariffs on foreign imports.

Many — but not all — of Trump’s many tariff announcements rely on IEEPA for legal justification. Attorneys in Thursday’s arguments highlighted the reciprocal tariffs, aimed at remedying trade imbalances with nations around the world, as well as those intended to curb the spread of fentanyl and other illicit opiates.

The Department of Justice, represented Thursday by assistant attorney general Brett Shumate, argued for broad presidential powers and suggested the authority to impose tariffs was tacitly implied in the law due to the context in which it was passed.

“Congress has long given the president broad discretion to deal with complex and evolving national emergencies in light of his preeminent role in foreign affairs and national security,” Shumate said in his opening remarks.

Lawyers representing the small business and Democratic states, conversely, noted the law makes no mention of tariffs — and suggested even if the justices were to agree with the Trump administration that it did impart a presidential emergency tariff power, the manner in which Trump is employing it should not be allowed to stand.

The Trump administration’s argument amounts to “a breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years, and the consequences are staggering,” argued Neal Katyal, the former solicitor general of the U.S. under President Barack Obama who’s now representing the small businesses in this case.

Even if the Justice Department can convince the justices that IEEPA gives the president powers to impose tariffs, it must also prove that the president is using them within the bounds of the law — which includes several limitations on the president’s emergency powers.

Specifically, the president’s actions must result from an emergency that is “unusual and extraordinary” — something the plaintiffs lawyers argue is not the case, given that the trade imbalances Trump highlighted have persisted for decades.

The Department of Justice lawyers counter that while the trade deficits may be longstanding, their impacts on domestic manufacturing contribute to the “extraordinary” situation the president identified in his emergency declaration.

The Trump administration must also prove in court that Trump’s tariffs “deal with” such a threat — something critics of the tariff policy have argued is not the case, pointing, for example, to Trump’s newly-announced tariff on Brazil — a nation with which the U.S. maintains a trade surplus.

During a briefing with reporters following the hearing, the lawyers for the small businesses that sued suggested the case was tantamount to a referendum on the American system of separation of powers.

“Our founders fought a war about this stuff,” Katyal noted. “This was not some minor thing, going into the unsuspecting night. This was about as major as it gets.”

The lawyers declined to speculate as to when the justices might rule or how they’d do so, though they heaped praise on the officials for their preparation.

“They were incredibly well prepared. I mean, you heard justices referring to footnotes in pages of an opinion from 1975 for heaven's sake,” Katyal said. “As officers of the court, as people who care deeply about the Constitution, it's just gratifying to be part of that process.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4da29ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5293x2779+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff4%2Fee%2Fe4f5c4934bf8bc372ba23a769c38%2Fap25190611553823.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 10:58:07.612674
