Kelley issued the order after four migrants from South Sudan and the nonprofit African Communities Together sued.
The United States began designating South Sudan for temporary protected status, or TPS, in 2011.
About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications, according to the lawsuit.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem published a notice on Nov. 5 terminating TPS for South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation.","A federal judge in Boston on Dec. 30 stayed plans by President Donald Trump’s administration to end temporary protections from deportation that had been granted to hundreds of South Sudanese nationals living in the United States.

U.S. District Court Judge Angel Kelley granted an emergency request by several South Sudanese nationals and an immigrant rights group to prevent the temporary protected status they had been granted from expiring as planned after Jan. 5.

The ruling is a temporary victory for immigrant advocates and a setback for the Trump administration’s broader effort to curtail the humanitarian program. It is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the administration’s moves to end similar protections for nationals from several other countries, including Syria, Venezuela, Haiti and Nicaragua.

Kelley issued the order after four migrants from South Sudan and the nonprofit African Communities Together sued. The lawsuit alleges that action by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was unlawful and would expose them to being deported to a country facing a series of humanitarian crises.

Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued an administrative stay that temporarily blocks the policy pending further litigation.

She wrote that allowing it to take effect before the courts had time to consider the case’s merits “would result in an immediate impact on the South Sudanese nationals, stripping current beneficiaries of lawful status, which could imminently result in their deportation.”

Homeland Security Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the judge’s ruling ignored Trump’s constitutional and statutory authority and that the temporary protected status extended to South Sudanese nationals “was never intended to be a de facto asylum program.”

Conflict has ravaged South Sudan since it won independence from Sudan in 2011. Fighting has persisted in much of the country since a five-year civil war that killed an estimated 400,000 people ended in 2018. The U.S. State Department advises citizens not to travel there.

The United States began designating South Sudan for temporary protected status, or TPS, in 2011.

That status is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications, according to the lawsuit.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem published a notice on Nov. 5 terminating TPS for South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation.

The lawsuit argues the agency’s action violated the statute governing the TPS program, ignored the dire humanitarian conditions that remain in South Sudan, and was motivated by discrimination against migrants who are not white in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.

“The singular aim of this mass deportation agenda is to remove as many Black and Brown immigrants from this country as quickly and as cruelly as possible,” Diana Konate, deputy executive director of policy and advocacy at African Communities Together, said in a statement.

The statement, published on the Archdiocese of Louisville’s website Jan. 1, addresses Kentuckians as a follow-up to a national statement issued by the U.S. bishops in November.
It also included the signature of Jason D. Hall, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Kentucky, which represents the bishops on matters of public policy.

We stand ready to be a part of bringing this about,’ ” they conclude.","The Roman Catholic bishops of Kentucky reiterated their commitment to “stand with our immigrant brothers and sisters” in a special statement for the feast of the Epiphany, Jan. 4.

The statement, published on the Archdiocese of Louisville’s website Jan. 1, addresses Kentuckians as a follow-up to a national statement issued by the U.S. bishops in November.

“In continuity with that message, and with our joint statement in December 2024 with the bishops of Tennessee, as we celebrate the Epiphany of the Lord and recognize Jesus Christ as the light that guides all nations on earth, we now wish to address ourselves specifically to our Kentucky communities,” they write in the Jan. 1 statement.

The four bishops who signed the statement are Archbishop Shelton J. Fabre of Louisville, Bishop of Owensboro William F. Medley, Bishop of Covington John C. Iffert, and Bishop of Lexington John Stowe, OFM Conv. It also included the signature of Jason D. Hall, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Kentucky, which represents the bishops on matters of public policy.

The bishops begin by reiterating the position of the Catholic Church on immigration.

“Nations have a right and responsibility to control their borders and to enforce laws meant to protect the population, but all laws must be enforced in a just and predictable manner that respects the God-given dignity of each human person,” they write. “Pope Leo reminded us of this when he stated, ‘No one has said that the United States should have open borders…I think every country has a right to determine who and how and when people enter.’ The Holy Father then added that ‘we have to look for ways of treating people humanely, treating people with the dignity that they have.’ ”

They go on to express concern over the challenges facing immigrants in the U.S.

“Accordingly, we are increasingly concerned about the rapidly developing challenges facing immigrants, whether documented or undocumented. Regular reports of immigrants with legal status having that status arbitrarily revoked; increasing incidents of political leaders vilifying immigrants; the elimination of sanctuary protections for churches, hospitals, and schools; and proposals at the state level targeting the ability of immigrants to live and pursue their dreams in Kentucky, combine to create an understandable climate of hostility, anxiety, and fear,” they write, adding, “We oppose all efforts to stigmatize immigrants as a group or to spread fear based on national or ethnic origin.”

Asking elected leaders to reform the immigration system, they continue:

“We stand with all of our immigrant brothers and sisters who have been victimized by unjust government action or by harmful rhetoric and vilification. We call on all of our political leaders to work to reform our broken immigration system in a way that allows for the peaceful and orderly migration of people who are searching for peace, stability, religious freedom, and economic opportunity, as well as one that respects family unification and a realistic possibility of potentially obtaining citizenship.”

The bishops also call “Catholics and all people of good will” to action — seeking a better understanding of the plight of immigrants and Church teaching and advocating for policies that respect human dignity.

“We reiterate the call and commitment we made with our brother bishops in Tennessee and invite Catholics and all people of good will ‘to learn more about the plight of immigrants, to understand the values that form our Catholic Teaching on the matter, and to join us in advocating for just and comprehensive laws and policies that respond to the requirements of human rights and dignity and reflect the desire for the common good in our nation. We stand ready to be a part of bringing this about,’ ” they conclude.",https://therecordnewspaper.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mass-for-Separated-Families-3-9.4.25-web.png,N,,2026-01-01 17:56:23.526660

They’ve committed crimes against the Constitution of the government they’re acting in the name of and they’ve used the force, often violent force, of the federal government against innocent people. They’ve lied to Congress and federal judges. They’ve systematically violated judicial orders. They’ve denied people the most fundamental right guaranteed to residents, regardless of legal status, in the US: the right to due process of law.

The man running Trump’s border policy, Thomas Homan, was under FBI investigation for accepting grocery bags stuffed with cash to steer contracts to the Trump administration. The man running Border Patrol’s commando squads, the maniacal Gregory Bovino, was excoriated by a federal judge for lying in a deposition about the circumstances of his violent crackdowns on protesters in Chicago.

Traditional sanctuaries–churches, schools, day care centers, hospitals and courthouses–have been violated. Members of Congress, including a U.S. senator, have been roughed up and arrested. Religious leaders have been tear-gassed, tasered and beaten. People have been deported to squalid prisons in unstable countries on continents they’ve never visited, never mind lived on. Arrest warrants and deportation orders have been post-dated and falsified.

For years, the libertarian right has warned about the militarized takeover of law enforcement. Using an entirely fictitious “immigrant invasion” as an excuse, Trump chucked these constitutional anxieties aside, along with the Posse Comitatus Act, and ordered federal troops into DC, Chicago, LA, Memphis and Portland.

People have been detained and deported for their political views and columns they’ve written. People have been deported for embarrassing the government. People have been deported for the hats and shoes they wear and their tattoos. Babies have been ripped out of their mothers’ arms. Children as young as four years old have been forced to defend themselves in immigration court. The torture cells of El Salvador’s most notorious prison were rented out for more than 200 Venezuelans swept up and deported in secret flights that violated a federal judge’s order. Conditions in US detention prisons are just as bad, if not worse.

The vast majority of those arrested had no criminal record. Many of them were arrested at their jobs washing cars, mowing lawns, cultivating plants, putting roofs on houses. Others were arrested while checking in with their immigration officers or showing up for scheduled court hearings. Apparently, it’s much easier to abduct people who are abiding by the law, than those who aren’t. Who knew?

People are being grabbed off the street or chased down in their cars because they “look” like they might be immigrants. Dozens, perhaps hundreds of American citizens, have been illegally stopped, interrogated, tasered, tear-gassed, arrested and detained by masked ICE and Border Patrol agents, who have routinely dismissed documents, even REAL IDs, as forgeries. Several American citizens have been wrongly deported. Racial profiling in the service of deportation has been sanctified by the Supreme Court, with Brett Kavanaugh calling such stops a minor inconvenience, even when they result in specious arrests.

Since Trump bought off most of the large law firms at the beginning of his term, most of the legal heavy-lifting to expose the corruption and criminality of the administration’s immigration crackdown has been done by small firms and non-profits, who have routinely kicked the government’s ass in courtrooms from Portland to Nashville, Las Cruces to Boston. ICE has proven itself to be a lawless agency whose mission is to spread terror through immigrant communities across the US. But they’ve succeeded in turning much of the country against them. Public support for immigration has climbed to record highs.

Block by block, city by city, the barbarous legions of ICE are being confronted, driven back and defeated. The Trump/Miller pogrom against immigrants is failing in all of its objectives except one: to inflict maximum cruelty on a vulnerable population that it has used as a scapegoat for the decline of the American economy, resulting from four decades of ruthless neoliberal policies. This shameful episode will stand as the ghastly hallmark of this misbegotten administration.

“Many people — many nations — can find themselves holding, more or less wittingly, that ‘every stranger is an enemy’. For the most part this conviction lies deep down like some latent infection; it betrays itself only in random, disconnected acts, and does not lie at the base of a system of reason.

– Primo Levi, Survival in Auschwitz

+ On January 31, Julio Noriega, a US citizen born in Chicago, was walking in Berwyn, Illinois, to get a pizza when ICE descended on him, placed him in handcuffs, and shoved him into a van with other shacked men. His wallet, which held his ID and Social Security card proving his citizenship, was confiscated. He was detained overnight before being released without a record of what occurred.

+ At 5:30 in the morning of January 27, Jhony Godoy Gregerio was driving with his brother Bayron to work in Maywood, Illinois, when he was pulled over. Bayron was wearing an ankle bracelet mandated by ICE. The officer asked if his name was “Brian.” After Jhony answered “no,” the officer opened the car door and pulled Jhony from the car, his hands and feet cuffed. As multiple trucks carrying 15 armed officers surrounded the vehicle, the officer said he was from ICE. The ICE agent didn’t show Jhonny a warrant, and he has no criminal history other than a few traffic citations. He was taken to Indiana, and before he was able to contact his wife and child or a lawyer, he transferred to the same Louisiana prison where ICE sent Mahmoud Khalil. Jhony has been living legally in the US for 15 years.

That same day, Jhony’s brother Marco Godoy Gregerio, who was driving in a second car, was also pulled over and arrested by ICE. The ICE agent also asked Marco if he was “Brian.” Marco said, “No,” and handed the officer his ID from the Guatemalan consul’s office. As armed ICE agents surrounded his car, Marco was told to turn the car off and that he was going to be placed under arrest. He wasn’t told why, and he wasn’t shown a warrant. Marco had no criminal record. Like his brother Jhony, he was taken into custody, held in Indiana, and quickly transferred to Louisiana without being able to contact his family or a lawyer. He was held for 25 days before being able to request bond from an immigration judge.

+ On January 26, ICE agents surrounded an apartment building in Chicago where Sergio Bolanos Romero lived. As he got into his car and started driving to work, he was pulled over by armed ICE agents who told him to exit the vehicle and demanded he show them proof of his immigration status. After Sergio didn’t provide any, he was handcuffed, taken to a parking lot, which served as an ICE processing center, and then transferred to a jail in Wisconsin. It turned out that ICE had mistaken Sergio for the target of a planned raid who lived in the same building, even though Sergio’s car did not match ICE’s intended target. Sergio had not committed a crime and was not shown a warrant for his arrest. He was released two days later.

+ On January 29, ICE pulled over Bernandino Randa Marinas on his way to work in Chicago. After handing his ID to an ICE agent, Bernandino was ordered to keep his hands on the steering wheel of his car and not to move. He was held this way for around 40 minutes before one of the ICE officers told him he was under arrest. When Bernando asked to see a warrant, the officer quickly flashed him his cell phone. But he was not shown a Notice to Appear, and at the time of his arrest, there were no pending proceedings against him. Bernandino has lived in the US for more than 20 years, has two children who are US citizens, and a third is due in May. He has no criminal history.

+ On the morning of February 6, 2025, Jose Ortega Gonzalez was arrested by ICE while driving to work in Kansas. Jose has lived in the US for 20 years and is the father of children who are US citizens. Armed ICE officers surrounded his car and demanded his immigration papers. Jose told them he didn’t have proof of his legal status on him. He was then asked if he’d been arrested for drug trafficking. Jose told the officers he had no criminal history besides a couple of traffic tickets. Jose was then handcuffed, taken to a local police station, and then to an ICE detention center, where he was held for three weeks before seeing a judge who freed him on bond.

+ On January 26, Abel Orozco Ortega was driving back from the grocery store to the same Lyons, Illinois house he’s lived in for 15 years when he was stopped and arrested by ICE. The ICE agents had mistaken him for his son, Abel Jr., who is more than two decades younger. After Abel handed an ICE officer his driver’s license, the immigration cop reached inside Abel’s car window, unlocked and opened the door, then grabbed Abel’s arm and told him he was under arrest. He was hauled out of the car, cuffed, and put into an ICE vehicle. Abel’s son Eduardo came out of the house to see what was going on. As Eduardo, who is a US citizen, tried to speak with his father, the driver of the ICE car drove over his foot. These traumatic events caused Abel to experience a severe health episode, which required his hospitalization. After he was discharged from the hospital, ICE transferred him to a detention center in Indiana, where he remains. Abel Ortega has no criminal record and was never shown a warrant for his arrest.

+ On the morning of January 27, ICE agents showed up at an apartment building in Chicago. They were looking for a man named Carlos. When one of the residents of the apartment told them no one named Carlos lived there, eight ICE officers busted through the door and began searching the apartment. They found 24-year-old Jockneul Hernandez Rojas in his room watching television while in bed. The officer told him to get dressed and that he was under arrest. Jockneul was handcuffed and led out of the building. Jocknuel was not shown a warrant and had no criminal record. He had previously been issued a Notice to Appear by ICE, but the immigration court had dismissed the case against him. Jocknuel was taken to the ICE center in Indiana and then swiftly transferred to Louisiana, where he was later released on the orders of an immigration judge.

+ In the early morning hours of January 28, federal agents broke down the door of Raul Lopez Garcia’s house in Elgin, Illinois. They located Raul in an upstairs bedroom, where they handcuffed him and confiscated his identification documents. He was taken to an ICE facility for processing. Raul was not shown a warrant for his arrest and had no criminal record. ICE later claimed that they encountered Raul while looking for his stepson. Raul was eventually released on bond by a federal judge.

+ ICE agents broke down the door of Senen Becerra Hernandez’s Chicago apartment, looking for his roommate. Senen was placed in handcuffs and ordered to wait outside for more than an hour as they looked for the target of their raid. Instead of releasing him, the ICE officers took Senen to a detention center. ICE later justified his warrantless arrest by falsely claiming that he didn’t live at the address and had no community ties. In reality, Senen lived in the apartment where the raid occurred, had a job, and attended a local church.

+ At 11 AM on February 7, an ICE team entered El Potro’s Mexican Café and Cantina in Liberty, Missouri. The 10-member team was armed and dressed in tactical gear. Several of the agents wore masks over their faces. One of the ICE agents told the cafe owner they were looking for someone and ordered him to make all his employees available for questioning. They didn’t provide a name, show him a photograph, or provide a warrant. Still, the owner felt he had to comply.

As two ICE agents guarded the door, the employees were rounded up and placed in separate booths in the restaurant, where each employee was ordered to provide their ID. One employee was almost immediately placed in handcuffs, while the others were detained in the booths for more than two hours as ICE seized the employment records from the restaurant. At 12:30, 12 employees were placed in handcuffs, marched out of the cafe, and taken into custody. Eleven workers were detained in Kansas, while another was taken to Kentucky and later to Indiana. All but two of the workers were soon released on minimal bonds. One was deported, and the other remains in detention.

+ In their mass roundups of alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, ICE has been using tattoos as justification to deport noncitizens to a life of hard labor and torture in Salvadoran prisons. Among those deported are: a tattoo artist who entered the US legally seeking asylum: a teenage boy in Arlington, Texas, who got a tattoo on his left hand of a rose with paper money as its petals because, his sister said, he thought it “looked cool;” and a 26-year-old man whose tattoos his wife claims are unrelated to any gangs, never mind TdA.

+ Here’s the declaration of immigration attorney Linette Tobin on the arrest and deportation to El Salvador of her client Jerce Reyes Barrios, a professional soccer player and dissident from Venezuela who was seeking asylum in the US as a political refugee.

1. I am the immigration attorney for Jerce Reyes Barrios, born in [sic] January 16, 1989 in Venezuela.

2. In February and March 2024, Mr Reyes Barrios marched in two demonstrations in Venezuela, protesting the authoritarian rule of Maduro. At the second demonstration, he was detained and taken to a clandestine building where he was tortured (electric shocks and suffocation) along with other demonstrators.

3. Shortly after his release, he fled Venezuela for the United States. He registered with CBP One in Mexico, then presented himself to CBP officials on the day of his appointment. He was taken into custody and detained at Otay Mesa Detention Facility in September 2024.

4. We applied for asylum, withdrawal of removal, and CAT protection in December 2024. His final individual hearing is set for April 17, 2025, before Judge Robinson at the Otay Mesa immigration court.

5. On March 15, 2025, Mr. Reyes Barrios was deported to El Salvador with no notice to counsel or family. It was not until March 18, 2025, that counsel was able to reach an ICE official and learn that he had, in fact, been deported.

6. Mr. Reyes Barrio was/is a professional soccer player in Venezuela. He has never been arrested or charged with a crime. He has a steady employment record as a soccer player, as well as a soccer coach for children and youth.

7. Initially, Mr Barrios was placed in maximum security at Otay Mesa and accused of being a Tren de Aragua gang member. The accusation is based on two things. First, he has a tattoo on his arm of a crown sitting atop a soccer ball with a rosary and the word “Dios.” DHS alleges that this tattoo is proof of gang membership. In reality, he chose the tattoo because it is similar to the logo for his favorite soccer team, Real Madrid. See the logo below.

8. Second, DHS reviewed his social media posts and found a photo of Mr. Reyes Barrios making a hand gesture that they allege is proof of gang membership. In fact, the gesture is a common one: It means “I Love You” in sign language and is commonly used as a Rock-and-Roll symbol.

9. After submitting a police clearance from Venezuela indicating no criminal record, multiple employment letters, a declaration from the tattoo artist who rendered the tattoo, and various online images showing similar soccer ball/crown tattoos and explaining the meaning of the hand gestures, Mr Reyes Barrios was transferred out of maximum security.

10. Nevertheless, on March 10th or 11th, he was transferred from Otay Mesa to Texas without notice. Then, on March 15, 2025, he was deported to El Salvador. Counsel and family have lost all contact with him and have no information regarding his whereabouts or condition.

+ If this is how they’re treating opponents of Maduro, imagine how they’re treating dissidents of the Bukele regime in El Salvador.

+ How does ICE justify these arrests and deportations to Buekele’s concentration camp-like prison, where torture, food deprivation and killings are commonplace? In truly Kafkaesque terms: “the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose. It demonstrates they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.”

+ In late February, the Canadian actress Jasmine Mooney was kidnapped by ICE after she tried to renew her work visa at the US/Mexico border. She was cuffed, thrown into a van, held prisoner for 12 days, denied access to a lawyer, made to sleep on concrete floors and given a forced pregnancy test before being sent back to Canada with no explanation from DHS officials for the brutality of her treatment. Mooney described her surreal ordeal in vivid terms for an article in The Guardian.

+ On March 5, Ranjani Srinivasan was told by email that her student visa had been revoked after she attended a couple of protests and liked some social media posts in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Ranjani, a 37-year-old architect from India who was on the verge of completing her doctoral program in urban planning at Columbia, withdrew from school and fled to Canada after ICE knocked on her dorm door and accused her of advocating “violence and terrorism.” In an interview with Boston radio station WBUR, Ranjani said:

I’m not a terrorist sympathizer. I’m not pro-Hamas. And I think it’s really dangerous to label any free speech that somebody disagrees with, or any sort of peaceful objection to global issues, as terrorism. I think it just creates a climate of fear where people are scared to share their opinions. There’s a feeling that your visa could be revoked for even the simplest political speech, and the whole point of an American university is to have debate and nuance about ideas to contest them freely. I think there’s a general fear of doing that now.

+ On March 7, Fabian Schmidt was detained by immigration officers at Logan Airport in Boston on his way back from Luxembourg. Schmidt holds a green card and has lived and worked in the US since moving to the States with his mother in 2007. He became a permanent resident in 2008 and has worked in the US as an electrical engineer ever since. As ICE officers interrogated him and demanded he surrender his green card, his partner, a cardiologist and US citizen, waited for him for four hours at the airport. During his detention, Schmidt was stripped naked, placed in a cold shower, and deprived of food, water, and medication. He collapsed before being hospitalized at Mass General. After his release from the hospital, Schmidt was taken to an ICE facility in Burlington, Mass., and then transferred to an ICE jail in Rhode Island. Schmidt’s green card had recently been renewed and there were no pending legal cases against him. He wasn’t served with a warrant at the time of his arrest and wasn’t permitted to contact his family for three days. Schmidt has an 8-year-old daughter who is a US citizen.

+ On March 9, a French space researcher was subjected to a “random” search upon arrival in the US. His phone and computer were confiscated and searched. The DHS agents found a series of text messages describing Trump’s treatment of scientists, which they used to accuse him of harboring a “hatred of toward Trump that could be described as terrorism.” He was held in custody overnight and deported back to Europe the next day. Agence France Press later reported that DHS had accused him of “hateful and conspiratorial messages” and had referred him to the FBI.

+ On March 12, Dr. Rasha Alawieh was detained by immigration officials at Boston’s Logan Airport. She was told that her visa had been revoked and that she would be deported back to Lebanon, where she’d been visiting her parents. Her phone and computer were confiscated. Dr. Alawieh works at Brown Medicine and Rhode Island Hospital. She had secured an H-1B visa that doesn’t expire until 2027. She was trained in the U.S. at Ohio State, the University of Washington, and Yale as a transplant surgeon. She hasn’t been convicted or accused of a crime. In court filings, ICE claimed to have discovered photos on her phone that were “sympathetic” to leaders of Hezbollah. It turns out that the images weren’t Dr. Alaweigh’s but had been posted to a group chat she belonged to.

+ On March 17, masked ICE agents arrested Badar Khan Suri outside his own in Arlington, Virginia. Bara is an Indian national with a student visa who was doing post-doctoral research at Georgetown University. The agents told Badar his visa had been revoked and he would be deported to India. Badar has no criminal record and is married to a US citizen. Badar’s lawyer, Hassan Ahmad, told Politicothat he had been targeted because of his wife’s Palestinian heritage. In a sworn statement, Badar’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, said the detention of her husband “has completely upended our lives…Our children are in desperate need of their father and miss him dearly. As a mother of three children, I desperately need his support to take care of them and me.” A federal court blocked Badar’s deportation.

+ ICE is knowingly renditioning innocent people and sending them to a prison where the night-time sadism of Abu Ghraib is the operational plan 24/7…

+ The ACLU filed a sworn declaration from a Venezuela woman asylum seeker whom ICE detained and wanted to deport to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act; she says she overheard ICE officials on the plane to El Salvador conversing about that court ruling ordering them to turn the plane back to the US. ICE defied the court order and renditioned the detainees to El Salvador despite stopping for “hours” to refuel. The Venezuelan asylum seeker was later returned to the Webb Detention Center in Laredo, Texas…

On Friday, we were told to gather our belongings and put on the bus at Webb [County detention center in Laredo, Texas] and sat in the bus for about 5 minutes and then were taken back to Webb.

Saturday morning, we were again told to gather our belongings and get on the bus. We went to the airport, and eight women were put on the plane with me.

When we got on the plane, there were already over 50 men on the plane. I could see other migrants walking to the plane, but we took off before any additional people boarded. Within a couple of minutes, I overheard two US government officials talking, and they said, “There is an order saying we can’t take off, but we already have.”

I asked where we were going and we were told that we were going to Venezuela. Several other people on the plane told me they were in immigration proceedings and awaiting court hearings in immigration court.

We were not allowed to open our window shades.

We landed somewhere for refueling. We were there for many hours. We were arm and leg shackled the whole time.

We took off again and landed fairly quickly. I was then told we were in El Salvador.

While on the plane the government officials were asking the men to sign a document and they didn’t want to. The government officials were pushing them to sign the document and threatening them. I heard them discussing the documents and they were about the men admitting they were members of TdA.

After we landed but were still on the plane, a woman opened the shade. An officer rushed to close the shade and pulled her down by her shoulders to try and stop her from looking out. The person who pushed her down had HOU-O2 written on his sleeve.

I saw out the window for a minute and I saw men in military uniforms and another plane. I saw men being led off the plane. Since I’ve been back in the US, I have seen news coverage, and the plane I saw looks like the one I’ve seen on TV with migrants from the US being delivered to El Salvador.

+ Neri Alvarado was working as a baker in Dallas when ICE showed up asking to see his tattoo. “We’re here because of your tattoos. We are finding and questioning everyone who has tattoos,” an ICE agent told him. Neri explained that the rainbow-colored ribbon on his arm was an Autism Awareness tattoo honoring his 15-year-old brother with autism. The ICE examined Neri’s phone and told him he was clean. But another agent ordered him kept in detention. Then, he was renditioned to El Salvador without any explanation. His only crime was having a tattoo.

+ ICE is trying to deport Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia student who attended pro-Palestine protests. Chung came to the US from South Korea with her family at age SEVEN. She’s been a lawful permanent resident for more than a decade. She was the valedictorian of her high school class. She faced a disciplinary hearing from Columbia, which found she did not violate the university’s policies. Despite being cleared of any crimes or infractions (even that of trespassing on her own campus), ICE agents showed up at her parent’s house and told them her green card had been revoked. Armed ICE agents showed up twice at her campus apartment looking for her. On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order stopping the Trump administration from detaining Yunseo.

+ A little after five in the evening on Tuesday, Runeysa Ozturk, a Ph D candidate at Tufts University, was accosted on the streets of Somerville, Mass., outside of Boston by hooded and masked agents, who initially refused to identify who they were and then falsely claimed they were “the police.” They were, in fact, ICE. Runeysa’s backpack, purse, and phone were seized. She was placed in cuffs, forced into a black van, and taken away. She was told her student visa had been revoked, and she was going to be deported. Ozturk, a Turkish citizen, was here legally, had committed no crimes, and wasn’t charged with a crime by ICE when they kidnapped her. Her sole offense? Co-writing an op-ed in the Tufts student paper opposing Israel’s mass killings of Palestinians. Even though a federal judge had ordered ICE to keep her in Massachusetts until a hearing on her status could take place, she was transported to an ICE detention jail in Louisiana.

+ On Thursday, Marco Rubio admitted that he’d personally revoked Runeysa’s visa and smeared her without evidence as being a terrorist sympathizer and a supporter of Hamas. “We do it every day,” Rubio boasted. “Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas.” Rubio said he’s already revoked 300 student visas and intends to revoke many more.

+ Kilmar Abrego Garcia came to the US in 2012 to escape being recruited into a Salvadoran gang that had terrorized his family for more than two years. In 2016, he met his future wife, Jennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura, a US citizen living in Maryland. They eventually moved in together and Kilmar helped raise her two children. They later had a child together. Each of the three kids had some form of disability. Kilmar, according to Jennifer, was an attentive and devoted father to all of the children. He held a steady job, he stayed out of trouble, and then he was busted in 2019 while waiting to apply for a job at Home Depot and accused of being a member of the M-13 gang in Long Island, where he’d never been. During his hearing, Abrega adamantly denied any gang ties. The cops said they arrested him because “he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique.”

Jennifer Vasquez Sura wrote in a deposition that she was so fearful Kilmar would be deported that she arranged for them to get married while he was in jail: “I coordinated with the detention center and a local pastor to officiate our wedding. We were separated by glass and were not allowed physical contact. The officers had to pass our rings to each other. It was heartbreaking not to be able to hug him.”

Relying on the bogus testimony from a confidential informant, the immigration judge issued a removal order but barred his deportation to El Salvador, agreeing that there was a serious threat to Abrego Garcia’s life if he was returned home. The judge ordered his release and required him to regularly check-ins with ICE, which Abrego Garcia faithfully did.

So things stood until March 12, 2025, when ICE agents stopped Abrego Garcia’s car as he was driving his 5-year-old son home from school. He was cuffed, told his immigration status had been revoked and that he would be deported. The agents took him to a detention center in Baltimore. When Kilmar was finally able to talk with Jennifer on the phone, he told her the ICE agents once again accused him of being a member of M-13, saying bizarrely they’d watched the family frequently visit a certain restaurant and that they had photos of Kilmar playing basketball.

On the morning of March 15, Kilmar called Jennifer again to let her know he’d been transferred to Louisiana. “That call was short and Kilmar’s tone was different,” Jennifer wrote in her deposition. “He was scared. He was told he was being deported to El Salvador. He was told he was being deported to El Salvador to a super-max prison called ‘CECOT.’” Jennifer hasn’t heard from him since.

Then, on Monday of this week, the Trump administration admitted in a court filing that Abrego Garcia had been deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order. By accident, they claimed, the result of an “administrative error:” (Which sounds like the excuse for everything that happened in the last two months.) “On March 15, although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error.” Even so, the Trump administration argued the court had no power to order the return of Kilmar from the custody of the nation that he had fled 13 years ago in fear for his life.

The entire case against Kilmar, dating back to 2019, has the smell of a frame-up. When Kilmar’s lawyers attempted to contact the detective who filled out a form in 2019 accusing him of links to MS-13, they discovered that the police department had no record of his arrest. Even more damning, the detective who filled out the fatal form had been suspended.

Despite the outrageous facts of the case, instead of admitting their grotesque error, the Trump administration went on the offensive, sending JD Vance out to smear Kilmar on FoxNews, where he called him “a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here. He had also committed some traffic violations; he had not shown up for some court dates. This is not exactly ‘father of the year’ here.” Trump’s Jesus-worshipping press spokesperson Kathline Leavitt threw even more toxic slime at Kilmar, calling him a “criminal,” a “foreign terrorist,” and a “heinous individual.”

All lies.

Abrega Garcia has no criminal record and his wife and kids miss him and worry about his fate in Naghib Bukele’s lethal dungeon.

+ In 2024, José Gregorio González came to the US from Venezuela to donate a kidney needed to save the life of his brother José Alfred Pacheco, who suffers from late-stage renal failure. But before the operation could take place, González was swept up by an ICE raid in Chicago that a neighbor described as “an ambush.” González’s request for asylum had been denied, but an immigration judge had allowed him to stay in the US for the time being because Venezuela was refusing to accept any deportation flights from the US. González hadn’t any criminal history in the US and wasn’t served with a warrant at the time of his arrest. After public outrage over his detention, Gonzalez was temporarily released until after the operation could take place, at which time he would be deported.

+ The Washington Post explains that this is far from the only case where noncitizen relatives have been deported while caring for relatives with terminal illnesses, though not as terminal as the sickness of the country that is deporting them:

Last month, a child brain cancer patient in Texas and her four siblings — all U.S. citizens — were deported to Mexico along with their undocumented parents who had removal orders as the family was en route to a Houston hospital for her treatment. An undocumented Mexican woman in the Los Angeles area fared better — ICE arrested her in February, but an immigration judge allowed her to post bond as she was the caregiver for an American daughter with bone cancer.

+ On March 27, a mother and her three children were kidnapped by ICE in Sackets Harbor in northern New York, the hometown of Tom Homan, who’s commanding the immigration raids for Trump. All four of them were handcuffed, including a third grader, and kept in detention for 11 days. They were finally released this week after more than 1,000 people showed up to protest their baseless arrests.

+ The Los Angeles United School District said plainclothes ICE agents tried to question students at two elementary schools in Los Angeles on Monday but were denied entry by administrators. Superintendent Alberto Carvahlo said the agents falsely claimed they had parental permission to question the kids.

+ Here’s the declaration of Luis Alberto Castillo Rivera, who entered the United States legally from Venezuela, had committed no crimes while in the US, yet was kidnapped without a warrant by ICE and sent to the notorious Camp 6 at Guantanamo Bay, where he was fed wretched food, kept shackled in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, denied medical care, mocked and humiliated by guards, saw a prisoner beaten by guards for refusing to return a toothbrush, had their Bibles and passports seized and were denied phone calls with family and lawyers for two weeks…

+ First, you get away with deporting non-criminal non-citizens. Then you try to deport non-criminal citizens whose ethnicity you dislike. Last week, Juan Carlos Gomez-Lopez, a 20-year-old Georgia man of Mayan heritage, was pulled over and arrested by Florida Highway Patrol for “being an undocumented immigrant over the age of 18 who had illegally entered the state of Florida.” There were just two problems. First, the enforcement of DeSantis’s punitive immigration law Gomez-Lopez supposedly violated, has been blocked by a federal court. Second, Gomez-Lopez is a US citizen. When Gomez-Lopez appeared for his arraignment before the local court, his advocates presented the judge with his birth certificate and Social Security card as proof that he is a natural-born US citizen. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggins said, “In looking at it and feeling it and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark proving this is an authentic document.” Riggins said there was no probable cause for his detention, but that her hands were tied because ICE had asserted jurisdiction and wants him sent to a detention center for deportation.

“It’s like this dystopian nightmare of poorly written laws,” said Thomas Kennedyof the Florida Immigrant Coalition. “We’re living in a time when this man could be sent to El Salvador because, what? Is he going to be treated as a stateless person?”

+ Meanwhile, in Boston: “Immigration attorney Nicole Micheroni says she was born at Newton Wellesley Hospital, grew up in Sharon, Massachusetts, and was educated at Wellesley College. So, anyone can imagine her surprise when she says she received an emailed letter from the Department of Homeland Security, telling her to self-deport within 7 days…”

+ And in Arizona, CBP targeted another Bostonian: Rioles Saeed, a lawyer now living in Tucson, received a notice from Border Patrol telling her to leave the country or be forcibly deported. Saeed is an American citizen who was born in Boston. Saeed: “I thought this was for one of my clients but then i saw that it was addressed only to me. With the dot gov, it said it was from CBP…There is a true recklessness coming from the government and shows an intimidating attitude towards our immigrant clients.”

+ Alec MacGillis, Pro Publica: “Kseniia Petrova left Russia in protest of Putin and found work at a Harvard lab, w/ a valid visa. She arrived with only a backpack. CBP stopped her recently at Logan for failing to declare frog embryos she had brought from Paris for her lab. This would normally come with a fine. Instead, she is in prison in Louisiana. “I feel like something is happening generally in America. Something bad is happening. I don’t think everybody understands.”

+ We’re watching the Milgram Experiment breakout in real-time, as hundreds of ICE agents commit sadistic acts against innocent people, they’d never imagined themselves ever doing back in Sunday School…(At least I hope they’d never imagined themselves doing it): A Guatemalan immigrant with no Massachusetts criminal record was arrested Monday on Tallman Street in New Bedford after federal agents shattered the glass on his vehicle with axes, as he and his wife waited inside the car for their lawyer to arrive. Like so many others, he was detained without a warrant.

+ The former cop who sent gay makeup artist, Andry Jose Hernandez, Romero to a hellhole of a prison in El Salvador is a known liar, who was put on a Brady List of cops whose testimony should not be trusted at trial. He also drove drunk into a family’s house and falsified his overtime hours.

American citizens are being routinely caught in Trump’s deportation dragnet, detained, jailed, and threatened with deportation, even a four-year-old with cancer and a pregnant mother who would have given birth to an American citizen. When ICE’s “mistakes” are revealed, usually through the presentation of a birth certificate days after the false arrest, the typical response has been to blame the victims. That’s if they haven’t already been deported.

Take the case of 19-year-old Jose Hermosillo, who was detained by Border Patrol outside Tucson on April 8 and held for 10 days in the privately run Florence Correctional Center before being released. Hermosilla, who has a learning disability, told his jailers he was an American citizen. They told him to tell his lawyer. At that point, Jose Hermosillo didn’t have a lawyer. Two days later, Jose told an immigration judge the same thing. Federal prosecutors requested a week-long delay in the case. And Jose, who is the father of a six-month-old American citizen, was held for another seven days until his family could finally present the court with his birth certificate.

After his release, DHS smeared Hermosillo, blaming him for his own arrest and detention. In a post on Twitter (of all places), DHS said: “Hermosillo’s arrest and detention were a direct result of his own actions and statements.” In trying to cover their own cruel blunders, DHS officials alleged “that Jose Hermosillo approached Border Patrol in Tucson, Arizona, stating he had ILLEGALLY entered the U.S. and identified himself as a Mexican citizen.”

This was a convenient concoction, a fiction. Hermosilllo hadn’t been in Mexico and he’s not a Mexican citizen. To support their self-serving claim, DHS said Hermossilo signed a transcript of an alleged interview attesting to this version of events. But Hermosilla can’t read or write. He can only scratch out his name, according to his girlfriend.

What really happened is quite different, tragic even. Hermosillo lives in Albuquerque and had traveled to Tucson with his girlfriend to visit her family. While in Tucson, he suffered a seizure and was taken by ambulance to the hospital. He was treated and released, unsure exactly where he was or how to return to his girlfriend.

Hermosilla flagged down what he thought was a police car to ask for directions. It turned out to be Border Patrol. He told the officer he was staying in Tucson but was lost.

The BP officer responded harshly, “You’re not from here. Where are you from?

“New Mexico,” Hermosilla said.

“I don’t believe you,” the BP cop said. “Show me your papers?”

Hermosilla told him he’d left his New Mexico ID at his girlfriend’s family’s place.

“I’m not stupid,” the cop told him. “I know you’re from Mexico.”

Then the cop arrested Hermosilla, told him to sign some papers, and then deposited him in a cell with 15 other men, where he was served cold food and denied his medications for the next 10 days.

“I told them I was a US citizen,” Hermosillo told Arizona PM. “But they don’t listen to me.”

+ On Friday, Federal Judge Terry Doughty, a Trump appointee, issued an order saying that DHS had apparently deported a 2-year-old American citizen to Honduras with “no meaningful” process, even though the girl’s father, also a US citizen, fought to keep her in the country.

+ The ACLU reported that on Friday, the New Orleans field office of ICE deported two families with minor children. Three of the children (age 2, 4 and 7) are US citizens. One of the children suffers from a rare form of metastatic cancer. The citizen child was deported without medications or being able to consult with their doctors, even though ICE was fully briefed about the child’s dire medical condition. One of the mothers is pregnant. Both families have lived in the US for many years.

According to the ACLU, “ICE held the families incommunicado, refusing or failing to respond to multiple attempts by attorneys and family members to contact them. In one instance, a mother was granted less than one minute on the phone before the call was abruptly terminated when her spouse tried to provide legal counsel’s phone number.”

+ Aldo Martinez-Gomez, a US citizen living in California, received a DHS notice on April 11, threatening “criminal prosecution” and fines if he does not depart within seven days, even after he showed them his birth certificate. “Do not attempt to remain in the United States,” the letter warned. “The government will find you.’ Martinez-Gomez: “I’m just trying not to be one of the government’s mistakes.”

+ At 8:30 in the morning on Friday, U.S. Marshals entered a county courthouse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and arrested trial judge Hannah Dugan on charges that she had obstructed the arrest of a noncitizen. Trump officials, including FBI director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, publicly gloated over her arrest, as did Trump, who posted a photo of the judge wearing a medical mask on his Truth Social feed.

Shockingly (right?), the facts are a little different from what the Trumpites have presented. Flores was in Dugan’s courtroom on another matter, when ICE agents entered and attempted to arrest him without a warrant. Dugan ordered the agents out of her court and told them to contact the supervising judge. Then she escorted Flores and his attorney out the back of the courtroom to a public hallway.

Flores Ruiz was not, as Patel crudely asserts, a “perp.” He hadn’t been accused of “perpetrating” any crime, except that of being in the US without papers. There was no “increased danger” to the public because there was never any “danger” to begin with, except to Flores Ruiz. He was later detained by ICE and jailed without incident. Surely, judges have sovereignty over their own courtrooms and have the authority to demand to see a warrant before an arrest is made inside their chambers.

Of course, this is yet another provocation, pushing the limits of executive power to see how far it reaches. It seems as if Trump is heeding Bukele’s advice at the White House that you need to “get rid of the judges.” In 2021, the Salvadoran despot removed all five judges from the nation’s supreme court and fired its attorney general.

+ Two weeks after a family from Maryland moved into a new rental house in Oklahoma City, 20 armed ICE agents burst into their home. “I didn’t know who they were,” the mother later said. “It was dark. All the lights were off. I kept asking them, ‘Who are you? What are you doing here? What’s happening? And they said, ‘We have a warrant for the house, a search warrant.’”

+ “You can’t just walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Show me your papers,” said U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer L. Thurston, before issuing a preliminary injunction forbidding the Border Patrol from conducting warrantless immigration stops throughout a wide swath of California.

+ Sophie’s Choice, American-style: A Guatemalan woman will be given “the choice” of whether she wants to take her newborn, a US citizen born in Tucson on Wednesday, with her when she is deported, CBP says. CBP placed guards outside her maternity ward room and refused to let her speak to a lawyer…

+ Two weeks after a family from Maryland moved into a new rental house in Oklahoma City, 20 armed ICE agents burst into their home. “I didn’t know who they were,” the mother later said. “It was dark. All the lights were off. I kept asking them, ‘Who are you? What are you doing here? What’s happening? And they said, ‘We have a warrant for the house, a search warrant.’”

Flashing the warrant, ICE raided the house, seizing cellphones, computers, and the family’s life savings. While ICE agents ransacked the house, they forced the mother and three daughters to stand outside in their underwear. “We are citizens!” the mother screamed at the ICE officers. “You have guns pointed in our faces. Can you just reprogram yourself and see us as humans, as women?”

+ ICE arrested an Afghan who provided security for US troops in Afghanistan, who was in the country legally as his asylum claim was being processed, and who had no criminal record. In the charging document, ICE lied to the court about his status. Let this be a lesson to any foreign national that you can’t trust the US to live up to its commitments. We’ll chuck you out when we have no use for you, for any reason at all or no reason at all, back into the hands of people who may want you dead…

+ If your cause is so righteous, why do you have to resort to such vile forms of trickery and deception?

+ ICE “mistakenly” arrested a US Marshall in Arizona because he looked the type. We’ve gone from showing probable cause as a basis for arrests to “he fits the general description” (ie, male and Hispanic), let’s haul him in and sort it out later….

+ Like many family members of people ICE detained during its raid on Ambiance Apparel in Los Angeles last Friday, Yurien Contreras has not heard from her father, Mario Romero, and has no idea how is doing: “I witnessed how they put my father in handcuffs, chained him from the waist and ankles. My family and I haven’t had communication with my dad. We don’t know anything.”

+ Jose Ortiz, one of the men arrested in the LA worksite raids, has lived in LA for 30 years. After 18 years on the job, he had advanced to the role of floor manager when ICE arrested him without a warrant and with no criminal record.

+ A few days ago, 75 Democrats voted for a Congressional Resolution praising ICE. Today, ICE manhandled, threw to the ground, cuffed, and detained US Senator Alex Padilla for trying to attend a press briefing by DHS Secretary. Kristi Noem…Whose side are you on?

+ Sen. Alex Padilla: “If that’s what they do to a United States Senator with a question, imagine what they do to farm workers, day laborers, cooks, and the other nonviolent immigrants they are targeting in California and across the country. Or any American that dares to speak up.”

+ ICE released photos of National Guard troops, not “guarding” against “rioters,” but assisting in raids on immigrants…

+75 Democrats joined with House Republicans to vote for a Resolution thanking ICE for its role in implementing Trump’s Mass Deportation operations…

+ You want to know what kind of people work for ICE, they’re the type that mocks and laughs at a mother, sobbing on the street outside her house while holding her infant son in her arms as masked men haul away her husband for no explicable reason: When Roberto Diego Alvarez left for work in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, he was seized by ICE officers, thrown to the ground, then hauled away in handcuffs, while his wife Nicole, a 35-year-old US citizen, watched and cried as she clutched their 8-month-old son. Nicole later told Newsweek: “I learned from Diego that they were laughing at me in the car before leaving, pointing and saying, ‘I bet she is recording.’ I was hysterical. I had our son, Denver, who is 8 months old, in my arms. I couldn’t stop crying.”

+ Last Saturday, the management of the Los Angeles Dodgers told the singer Nezza to “do the national anthem in English tonight.” Instead, Nezza put on a Dominican Republic t-shirt and sang the anthem in Spanish. (Nezza was born in the US and is an American citizen.) Word of the Dodgers’ attempt to suppress Nezza ignited outrage among many in the LA Hispanic community. This is, after all, the team that evicted a predominantly Mexican community of 300 families from their homes in Chavez Ravine (without compensation) to build Dodger Stadium. Nezza’s defiant act and the local response to it almost certainly prompted the Dodgers to take this action on Thursday…

+ This was followed by the Dodgers agreeing to donate $1 million to “immigrant families” who have been traumatized by the ICE raids in LA…(Way to go, Nezza!)

+ Pedro Luis Salazar-Cuervo was detained by Texas cops, who asked if he had tattoos. Salazar-Cuervo told the cops he didn’t, and in fact, he had none. Then the cops searched his phone and found a photo of Salazar-Cuervo standing next to a man who did have a tattoo. That was enough for ICE to label him a Tren de Aragua and have him deported to Bukele’s concentration camp prison in El Salvador without any trial or hearing. This week, a Texas judge agreed that he must be returned to stand trial in August for trespassing on private property, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison. The Trump administration has not indicated whether it will act on the court’s order.

+ Julio Noriega, a U.S. citizen, was walking around a suburb handing out his resume to local businesses when ICE surrounded him, handcuffed him, and detained him for 10 hours before checking his ID and releasing him.

+ A couple of notable cases from Immigration Defense, which is representing dozens of people arrested by ICE in LA in the last week: One of their clients is a man named Javier, a cancer patient who has lived in LA for more than 20 years without any criminal record. If he isn’t released soon, he will miss his scheduled chemotherapy treatments. Another case is that of a day laborer who was granted asylum in the US 8 years ago. He was arrested twice by ICE this week. During the first arrest, he was held for eight hours and was on the verge of being transferred out of LA until ImmDef was able to prove his legal status. Then he was detained again.

+ Brad Lander, the comptroller of NYC (and NYT-endorsed mayoral candidate), was arrested by ICE at Immigration Court this week, after asking to see a warrant for people who were detained after an immigration hearing…

+ Lander after his release from ICE custody:

I’m happy to report I’m just fine. I lost a button. But I’m gonna sleep in my bed tonight, safe, with my family… At that elevator, I was separated from someone named Edgardo… Edgardo is in ICE detention and he’s not going to sleep in his bed tonight…There were posters on the wall… it said in English, ‘Are you detained and separated from your children?’ … We are normalizing family separation, we are normalizing due process rights violations, we are normalizing the destruction of constitutional democracy.

+ Narciso Barranco was working as a landscaper at an IHOP in Santa Ana when ICE agents, who refused to identify themselves, grabbed him, threw him to the ground, repeatedly punched him in the face, and pepper-sprayed him. ICE later said he attacked them with a “weed whacker,” but videos of the abduction show no such attack. Barranco is the father of three sons, all of whom are US Marines.

+ Barranco’s son, Alejandro, on his father, after he’d been pepper-sprayed, body-slammed, punched, and bloodied by ICE: “He has always worked hard to put food on the table for us and my mom. He was always careful and did his taxes on time. He never caused any problems, and he is known as a kind and helpful person by everyone in our community. I believe my father was racially profiled. They didn’t ask him anything. They just started chasing him and he ran because he was scared. He didn’t know who was after him.”

+ “My mom looked at the rear mirror and she saw how my sister was attacked from the back,” Estrella Rosas told ABC7. “She was like: ‘They’re kidnapping your sister.’” Estrella’s sister, Andrea Velez, had just been dropped off at her workplace in downtown Los Angeles when ICE agents descended upon her. One masked agent grabbed Velez, lifted her off the ground and carried her away to an ICE fan, as her sister and mother shouted: “She’s a US citizen. They’re taking her. Help her, someone!” Velez, a 36-year-old graduate of Cal-Poly Pomona, disappeared into ICE custody. She was arrested without a warrant and wasn’t even asked for her identification. It took her lawyer more than a day to find out where she was being held.

Velez is one of at least 674 US citizens who have been wrongly arrested by ICE. More than 120 US citizens have been detained and at least 70 deported. After ICE was forced to admit Velez was a US citizen, they charged her with assaulting an ICE office. Velez is 4’11 and weighs about 85 pounds.

+ The LAPD officers seen in the videos of Velez’s abduction by ICE were only on the scene because someone had called 9-11 to report a kidnapping.

+ Iris Dayana Monterroso-Lemus was five months pregnant when she was arrested and abducted by ICE and sent to the Richwood Correctional Center in Louisiana, even though she’d committed no crime that needed “correction.” The prison guards refused to give her any prenatal care or an ultrasound, even after she pleaded for help and got sicker and sicker.. She told the prison doctor that she’d felt no fetal movement in days and was experiencing severe abdominal pain. After a steady flow of vaginal discharge for three days, she was finally hospitalized and kept in shackles as she experienced a miscarriage:

When I was delivering my baby, they didn’t even give me a little privacy. Imagine. A guard was sitting right there, watching me day and night. They even shackled my feet because they thought I might escape. Like I was some criminal. I told them, ‘What you’re doing to me isn’t right.’

+ 55-year-old Sae Joon Park, a Green Card holder and Purple Heart recipient, was forced to self-deport to South Korea, after living in the US for almost 50 years, during which time he served in the US Army, got shot in the back in combat, and spent years battling PTSD and addiction. The reason ICE came after him? A drug possession charge from 15 years ago. ” I can’t believe that this is happening in America,” Park told NPR in an interview before his departure. “That blows me away, like a country that I fought for.”

+ A deaf and mute Mongolian man named Bay, who was seeking asylum in the US, has spent more than 80 days at an ICE facility. During that time, he has not had an opportunity to see a judge or communicate with anyone who understands Mongolian Sign Language, according to his sister.

+ ICE raided a house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, abducted a family and deported them to Brazil, including a two-year-old girl, who is a US citizen. The girl suffers from chronic health issues and is now considered a “non-citizen” in Brazil, where she has no rights to medical treatments under Brazil’s public health care system, and can’t enroll in daycare or school. She’s living in the country on a temporary visa that will expire in a few weeks, at which point she could be deported back to the US without her parents.

+ Bob, a 36-year-old from Brazil told Brandon Tauszik of Mother Jones: “What’s been going on in LA is we’ve just been seeing a lot of people come in and just ripping people out in a very intense way…rounding them up, like fucking stray dogs.”

+ LA City Councilman Hugo Soto-Martinez said this week that ICE showed up at a domestic violence shelter, looking to snatch the abused, not the abusers…

+ In 1988, Johnny Noviello was 10 years old when he moved from Canada to Daytona Beach with his family. He grew up in Florida and eventually obtained his green card, becoming a legal permanent resident of the United States. In May, he was detained by ICE after DHS revoked his green card, citing a drug offense from 2017. On Monday, Noviello was found dead in his cell at the Federal Detention Center in Miami, where he’d been incarcerated for the last six weeks, awaiting deportation to Canada. He was 49 years old. Noviello is the tenth person to die in ICE custody since Trump assumed office.

+ Sixty-seven-year-old Maddona Kashanian came to the US from Iran on a student Visa in 1978. After graduating from college and the Iranian Revolution, she applied for asylum. Her request was denied, but immigration officials granted her the right to remain in the US as long as she obeyed US laws and made regular check-ups with her immigration officers. In nearly 50 years, Kashanian never missed an appointment or was charged with a crime.

Then, last week, Kashanian was at her home, working in her garden, when three unmarked vehicles pulled up in front of her house. Masked men got out and arrested Kashanian. She was tossed in the back of a pickup truck and taken to a local jail in Hancock County, Mississippi, where she spent the night. The next day, she was rendered to the South Louisiana ICE facility in Basile. Why was this harmless woman targeted? Because she’s Iranian at a moment when Trump was waging war on Iran.

+ George Retes was pulled over by ICE as he was driving near the violent raid on farm workers outside of Camarillo last Thursday. The ICE agents broke the windows of his car and pepper sprayed him, before taking him into custody. Retes is an American citizen and disabled US Army Veteran. He was held in federal lockup for four days , during which time his family and lawyer had no way of contacting him to find out where he was or inquire about his physical condition. He was released without charges on Sunday night. Is this what Thomas Homan meant when he told FoxNews that ICE can stop people based on their skin-color and “briefly” detain them without a warrant or probably cause until ICE is satisfied they’re American citizens?

+ George Retes: “Clearly it didn’t matter that I was a citizen, or a veteran, or that I identified who I was. They ignored everything I said, and they just they broke my window and they dragged me out. I let them know that I was a veteran and I wasn’t doing anything wrong, that I’m just trying to get to work.”

+ Reporter: Congressman, do you care if U.S. citizens accidentally get detained in ICE raids?

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC): “No, I’m not concerned about that.”

+ A 35-year-old Irish tourist to the US had overstayed his visa by three days, when he was arrested by ICE, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration. Although he’d agreed to immediate deportation, he somehow he got buried in the system or lack thereof and was moved around to three different facilities after Trump took office. Because the detention centers were now overflowing, Trump’s ICE made a deal to lease prison beds from the Bureau of Prisons in Atlanta, where he was sent with dozens of other unfortunate souls abducted by the masked secret police. He languished there for more than three months in conditions he described as inhumane. Bunkbeds lacked ladders, the cells were teeming with mice and cockroaches, the prison clothes he was given were stained with shit and blood. The toilets didn’t flush, he was denied medication and doctor visits and fed “disgusting slop.” When he finally got his medicine, the prison guards threw it on the ground instead of handing it to him. “We were treated less than human.” After finally being released in March, he was deported to Ireland and banned from entering the US (where he’d come to visit his girlfriend) for 10 years.

+ A man posing as a bondsman rang the doorbell of a house in Arlington, Virginia near midnight. He began asking strange and misleading questions about the residents’ mother before pulling out a gun and forcing his way into the house. The man flashed a letter from ICE, but showed no ID or badge. He rummaged through the house, broke into a bedroom, threw a young woman and her uncle Orlando on the bed and asked for ID. He then handcuffed Orlando, who had been living in the US working construction for 20 years, marched him to his car, sedated him, and drove him around for several hours until the ICE office in Chantilly, Virginia to open. Orlando was deported a couple of days later to Honduras before the family could even contact a lawyer.

+ The ICE agents who abducted her husband, Darwin Contreras, in a courthouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, wore “something you can get from Walmart,” said Elizabeth DeJesus. They didn’t say who they were or where they were taking him.

Darwin came to the US from El Salvador 20 years ago in search of his mother when he was seven years old. He was detained at the border instead and spent several years in foster care. Eventually, he was reunited with his mother and they moved to Bethlehem. He was a track star in high school and won a presidential fitness award from Barack Obama.

Since graduating, he has kept steady work and married an American citizen. He was nabbed by ICE after a routine court appearance. DeJesus says that Darwin is suffering mentally and physically while in ICE custody, awaiting a hearing: “When he got there, he was not adjusting well. He was not ok. His mental health was not good.”

+ Miguel Angel Ponce, a 33-year-old U.S. citizen born in College Station, Texas, was grabbed by ICE, handcuffed and detained for more than 2 hours. “I felt kidnapped,” he said. “They just put me in handcuffs and took me to another location.” The ICE agents said he “looked like” someone they were looking for—told him to “shave your beard” to avoid future arrest.

+ Will Kim came to the US from South Korea when he was five years old. He’s had a Green Card as a lawful permanent resident of the US for many years. Currently, Kim is a PhD student at Texas A&M, where he’s researching a vaccine for Lyme disease. Last week, he was detained at San Francisco International Airport. The feds have offered no reason for his arrest and have denied Kim access to his attorney, Eric Lee. Kim was allowed only a single brief call to his mother. The only blemish on his record is a minor marijuana possession charge, which was settled in a diversion program and should have been expunged. “My client Will Kim has a green card, grew up in the US, became a scientist & is researching Lyme disease vaccines,” Eric Lee wrote on Twitter. “He has spent more than 7 days in a CBP airport detention ctr w/ no daylight, sleeping in a chair, no access to a lawyer. Another brutal attack on immigrants & science. Free Will!”

+ Jon Luke Evans, the only black police officer in the town of Old Orchard Beach, Maine, was detained by ICE after he attempted to purchase a gun for his job. After Evans’s arrest, Patricia Hyde, a spokesperson for ICE’s Boston office, smugly quipped: “The fact that a police department would hire an illegal alien and unlawfully issue him a firearm while on duty would be comical if it weren’t so tragic.” But Evans isn’t an illegal alien. He has a valid work permit that doesn’t expire until March 2030 and Maine is one of the states that allows immigrants to work as police officers. “We rely on the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program to ensure we are meeting our obligations,” said the town’s Police Chief Elise Chard. “We are distressed and deeply concerned about this apparent error on the part of the federal government.”

+ Kenny Laynez is an 18-year-old American citizen living in Palm Beach, Florida. On his way to work on a landscaping crew, Kenny’s van was pulled over ICE, because he “looked like an illegal.[sic]” His mother, who is not a US citizen, was driving. Kenny was yanked from the van and held for more than 6 hours by ICE, after providing proof of his citizenship. During the arrest, Kenny’s cellphone recorded the giddy, juvenile banter of the ICE agents:

Agent 1: You got hit?

Agent 2: Nah, didn’t get hit, bro.

Agent 1: Oh, okay.

Agent 2: No, once she got the proper spread on, she was gone.

Agent: 1: You are funny, bro.

Agent 2: It was funny.

(Agents laughing.)

Agent 1: They’re starting to resist more now.

Agent 2: We’re going to end up shooting someone. If it keeps going like this because they’re going to end up fighting.

Agent 1: This kid goes like, this guy here: “You can’t do this. I’m not doing shit.”

Agent 2: We told you already to get out. You either get out or I am going to pull you out.

Agent 1: Right. Yeah.

Agent 2: God damn! Wow!

Agent 1: Nice!

Agent 2: Just remember, you can smell that with a $30,000 bonus.

Agent 1: Yeah! (agents laugh)

+ Jose Osman Gutierrez has been working for more than 7 years to support his family in Houston, Texas. He had no criminal criminal record when ICE raided his home at 7:13 in morning, with four young children inside. He was grabbed, roughed up and hauled off by the neck, eventually losing consciousness. All of this happening in front of his wife, Jennifer Garcia, who is 9 months pregnant. Jennifer, distraught at the prospect of giving birth alone to her fifth child, was pushed and shoved by ICE officers as she pleaded for her husband. As Jennifer crumpled to the street, her children and neighbors screamed: “She’s nine months pregnant! Call a doctor!!”

+ ICE “targeted” a female priest for expedited removal. Yeonsoo Go is a South Korean national with a valid visa that does not expire until December 2025. She spent most of her life working to protect the rights of Korean immigrants—and was the first woman ordained by the Anglican Church of Korea. “I never imagined my own family would end up being a target of Trump,” Yeonsoo said.

“She’s staying at 26 Federal Plaza, which, as we know, is not actually a facility that has showers or beds or hot food. And so the detentions here are not only illegal, but they’re immoral,” said Rev. Matthew Heyd.

+ According to a new suit filed in the federal court for the Middle District of Louisiana, ICE illegally deported three children who are US citizens along with their noncitizen family members, including a two-year-old girl and a four-year-old boy with Stage Four kidney cancer. The children and their families were abducted by ICE in April when they showed up for scheduled hearings with immigration officials. The children were immediately separated from their families and denied contact with their parents or lawyers before they were deported to Honduras. The four-year-old cancer patient’s mother was not even allowed the opportunity to tell ICE officials about his perilous condition or arrange for his ongoing chemotherapy treatments.

+ Just days after a federal appeals court upheld a ban on ICE using roving patrols and racial profiling to target immigrants, Trump’s secret police launched Operation Trojan Horse, a shock raid outside of a Home Dept in the Westlake area of Los Angeles. Posing as building contractors, ICE agents drove a yellow Penske van in front of a group of day laborers at 6:44 in the morning, asking in Spanish if any of them were looking for work. Then masked ICE agents, one of them wearing a cowboy hat, jumped out of the van and began grabbing people. In all, 16 men were arrested and taken into ICE custody in defiance of a federal appeals court.

+ Guess which person was charged with felony assault in this photo of an ICE agent hauling away a 4’10” woman, an American citizen abducted on her way to work in LA’s garment district…?

+ ICE is arresting white people for filming them arresting non-white people. Dan Mathers, a US citizen in Florida, had been filming an ICE raid from a safe distance with a large row of hedges between them. He was not in any position to interfere with the raid. Mathers said he told one of the ICE agents that he “was short and it hurt his feelings.” Offended by the tweak about his height, the pumped-up ICE agent yelled, “You threatening me?” And then threw Mathers to the ground, arrested him and kept him in ICE custody for more than 10 hours, where he was prevented from contacting his family until 2:00 am the following morning.

+ We’ve gone beyond the “Show us your papers!” phase of intimidation, because your even your legal papers won’t save you and your children from being arrested, thrown in a sordid jail and deported for no logical reason at all…Consider the case of Sarah Shaw, a Washington mother from New Zealand who has legal residency in the US and works for the state, who was detained along with her 6-year-old son by ICE when she tried to re-enter the US from Vancouver, BC, after a trip to New Zealand to escort her two older children with their parents. Despite showing immigration officials her valid work visa, ICE claimed Shaw had overstayed her travel visa and shipped her and her child to the Dilley Detention Center in Texas. DHS officials ignored Shaw’s repeated pleas to allow her son, who has a valid travel visa, to enter the US.

For the past three years, Shaw has worked as a youth counselor in a juvenile detention facility run by the Washington State Department of Children. She has no criminal record.

Shaw’s attorney Minda Thorward: “Sarah is a survivor. She’s a fighter. She’s really strong. But she’s also very stressed out about all of this. She’s repeatedly requested that her son be released, even at the border DHS refused to permit that. So his detention is unlawful. He should not be there. He should not be in removal proceedings. None of that should be happening…There’s no reason to detain her. She has no criminal history. She simply made a paperwork mistake.”

+ Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, a student at Reseda High School in LA, was walking his dog in his Van Nuys neighborhood when he was grabbed by ICE, thrown to the ground and abducted. ICE officers first tied his dog to a tree. Then they cut the leash and let it run loose along one of the LA’s most heavily trafficked roads, Sepulva Boulevard.

Cellphone videos of Benjamin’s arrest record the agents joking about the $2,500 bonuses they’ll receive for nabbing a teenager without any criminal record: “Thanks to him, we get to drink this weekend!”

Benjamin has lived in LA for more than three years with his single-parent mother and is a caretaker for both his six-year-old brother and his twin five-month-old brothers. According to his legal representative, Benjamin is currently “cramped in a holding cell with about 50 others… He is cold, scared, and one of the youngest there.” Meanwhile, his mother is distraught and too afraid to leave her apartment.

+ Masked ICE agents hit a landscaper in Beverly Hills with a taser and pepper spray. Cell phone video shows the man screaming in agony as agents roughly arrest him.

“I couldn’t see what was happening – I just could hear a man screaming ‘my eyes, my eyes!’” a witness said. Another bystander can be heard asking, “What did you taze him for? Why are you doing that?”

The man’s family members say ICE abducted and abused the wrong man, since the lawn maintenance worker has no criminal history. They showed no warrants. They just descended on the neighborhood, assaulted him, abducted him and left.

+ ICE has arrested and is trying to quickly depart Arman Momand, a Virginia High School student, who has a special visa reserved for Afghan families that aided the US military during the occupation of Afghanistan. According to Momand’s lawyer, “It’s a very, very difficult visa to get. It’s reserved for people who—at their own peril—assisted the American military in our operations.” Momand was seized by ICE agents at a court hearing on a December 2024 driving incident that was resolved by the court as a misdemeanor, a mere infraction that should not have affected his visa status and eligibility to stay in the US with his family. Instead, ICE plans to deport him just weeks before classes start at J.R. Tucker High School in Henrico, Virginia. Deportation back to Afghanistan will almost certainly put the young man’s life in jeopardy.

+ Lopez Benitez, a native of Paraguay, is a construction worker in Queens who has lived in the US for two years with his sister, both of whom are US citizens. He applied for asylum and has regularly attended his required immigration meetings. He has no criminal record. Yet when he showed up for a scheduled immigration hearing, he was grabbed by masked federal agents and pulled away from his family.ICE agents violently knocked to the ground one of Benitez’s sisters during his abduction. He was taken to the ICE processing center at Federal Plaza in Manhattan and held in a room without a bed, access to a shower, or a change of clothes for three days. Then he was shipped halfway across the country to the ICE detention center in Conroe, Texas. Benitez and his family weren’t told why he was detained for more than a week.

This week, federal Judge Dale Ho ordered ICE to return Benitez to New York and then release him from custody. In his ruling, Ho castigated the government for arresting lawful immigrants during or after court hearings. Ho writes that the Trump administration has turned attendance at immigration court proceedings into a game of “detention roulette” that violates due process.

+ Back in April, Jesús Escalona Mújicas was on his way to his job at a construction site when he was pulled over by federal immigration officers and Texas police in a joint raid near Bryant, Texas. Escalona Mújicas, a 48-year-old native of Venezuela, was pressed against his car as his hands were bent behind his back and cuffed. He was taken to a neaby gas station where he was interrogated. He was then arrested and thrown in the immigration detention jail (aka, “Processing Center”) in Conroe, Texas. The officers who arrested him claimed to have a deportation order for Escalona Mújicas based on the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump had recently invoked to speed up deportations of alleged gang members from central and south America. An agent told him: “the President does not want to see Haitians, Nicaraguans, Cubans, or Venezuelans here.” Escalona Mújicas protested that he wasn’t a gang member and had a temporary work visa. But his denials were smugly dismissed by the arresting agents.

Soon after his arrest, ICE sent out a press release including a photo of Escalona Mújicas in handcuffs, wearing a John Deere sweatshirt with the caption: “documented Tren de Aragua gang member.” But the arrest report didn’t even get Escalona Mújicas’s nationality right, claiming that he was “an alien of El Salvadorian origin without legal status in the United States.” So it’s no surprise that they falsely arrested and then publicly smeared him as a “Tren de Aragua gang member,” even though his name was not listed in the admittedly problematic (for false positives) TxGANG database. What was the evidence the Trump administration used to as proof of Escalona Mújicas’s gang affliation? His Air Jordans.

In fact, Escalona Mújicas had no criminal history and had never heard of the Tren de Aragua gang until he got to the United States. When he lived in Venezuela, he worked as a forklift operator at Empresas Polar, the Venezuealan subsidary of Pepsi. Escalona Mújicas was deported back to Venezuela in May, but the Trump administration hasn’t rescinded its false accusation that he is a gang member, a slander that may well keep him from immigrating to any other country.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/teargassedbaby.png,N,,2026-01-01 13:56:56.436405

,Human Rights,2026-01-01 16:53:38+00:00,the Guardian,US federal employees file complaint against ban on gender-affirming care - The Guardian,"Guardian staff, Associated Press",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/01/us-federal-employees-complaint-gender-affirming-care-ban,"The Trump administration is facing a new legal complaint from a group of government employees who are affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.
The complaint argues that denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination and asks the personnel office to rescind the policy.
The complaint notes that the workers are making the claim on behalf of themselves and a “class of similarly situated federal employees”.
In December, the US Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.
Senior Trump officials, such as the health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors.","The Trump administration is facing a new legal complaint from a group of government employees who are affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.

The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and US Postal Service workers.

The complaint argues that denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination and asks the personnel office to rescind the policy.

“This policy is not about cost or care – it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” the Human Rights Campaign Foundation president, Kelley Robinson, said in a statement announcing the move.

The complaint, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, includes testimonies from four current federal workers at the state department, health and human services and the postal service who would be directly affected by the elimination of coverage.

For instance, the postal service employee has a daughter whose doctors recommended that she get puberty blockers and potentially hormone replacement therapy for her diagnosed gender dysphoria, which would not be covered under the new OPM policy, according to the complaint.

The complaint notes that the workers are making the claim on behalf of themselves and a “class of similarly situated federal employees”.

The Trump administration has taken other steps to restrict care for transgender Americans, particularly minors. In December, the US Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.

Senior Trump officials, such as the health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4d439fd7406e53f25d80dba0a0ad61c2a3a59c/0_0_2597_2077/master/2597.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0540048db7c29f736c0a194f0018735a",N,,2026-01-01 12:56:49.442313

RELATED: Minneapolis store worker says she faces harassment after DHS fraud video

Legal experts said it is unusual for law enforcement agencies to publicly post active investigations on social media.

One video posted by DHS shows agents visiting the Burnsville Learning Center with a caption claiming agents are investigating “rampant childcare and other fraud.”

RELATED: Trump administration says it’s freezing child care funds to Minnesota after series of fraud schemes

The owner of the Burnsville Learning Center spoke with us off camera and denied any wrongdoing, saying his business is legitimate.

According to the Minnesota Department of Human Services licensing records, the daycare has an active license and four past violations. The most recent violation, issued in June, cited cleaning and safety issues. State records do not show any allegations of fraud against the daycare.

Another DHS video, also viewed more than two million times, shows agents questioning a worker at a Burnsville tobacco shop. DHS labeled the location a “suspected fraud site.”

However, the employee said the store was not the target of the investigation and that agents were asking questions about a different business next door.

“I didn’t do anything,” said employee Zeina Alhmaidi. “Why do I have to go through someone else’s problem?”

Immigration attorney Gloria Contreras Edin, based in St. Paul, reviewed the DHS videos.

“I’m going to just be very real and direct. It looks like racial profiling and targeting. It looks like officers are making generalized accusations,” Contreras Edin said. “There are no warrants, no subpoenas, and they haven’t stated any articulable suspicion about why they’re doing what they’re doing.”

When asked whether the federal government could face legal responsibility if people experience threats after being featured in the social media videos, Contreras Edin said the practice could expose DHS to liability.

“Posting enforcement on social media is not just unprofessional, it creates a liability,” she said. “Remember that these videos are now what we call discoverable. This is evidence and it locks it in. It’s going to show their intent, pattern and practice, lack of probable cause and you know that the agency endorsed it.”

Contreras Edin noted that while DHS can legally post these videos, doing so could preserve evidence that may later be used in court.

“You want your enforcement and investigative work to be private. In general, law enforcement is not out there publicizing the investigation of an individual here,” Contreras Edin said.

We reached out to the Department of Homeland Security four times since Monday, asking how businesses are identified as suspected fraud sites, what evidence supports those claims, and why these interactions are posted online.

On Tuesday, DHS began blurring the faces of people questioned in its social media videos.

As of publication, DHS has not responded to our questions.

Contreras Edin said it is likely that attorneys are already reviewing the videos and that individuals could be filing lawsuits in the future.",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DHS-INVESTIGATION_1S-PRESSER-SPLIT_KSTP86aa_146_mx_00.00.40.34.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 11:57:33.384992

No migrants made the journey on New Year's Eve, the Home Office confirmed on Thursday, with the last recorded crossing made on 22 December.

It means the overall number of arrivals last year ended up 9% below the all-time high of 45,774 in 2022.

The total for 2025 was 13% higher than in 2024, when 36,816 migrants made the journey, and 41% higher than 2023's total of 29,437.

The first half of 2025 saw 19,982 people arrive, a record number in that period.

However, that pace slowed during the last two months of the year and there were long periods when no migrants arrived, including a 28-day run from 15 November to 12 December.

There was an average of 62 people per small boat that arrived in 2025, which is up from 53 in 2024 and 49 in 2023.

Charities estimate that at least 36 people died trying to make the journey last year, including an eight-year-old girl and her mother, who were crushed on a boat in May, the Mirror reports.

The number of arrivals in 2025 has heaped pressure on Sir Keir Starmer's government, having entered office in July 2024 with a repeated vow to ""smash the gangs"" and reduce the number of crossings. Almost 65,000 migrants have arrived since then.

The UK's Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, tasked with curbing Channel crossings, told MPs in October that the number of arrivals in 2025 was ""frustrating"" but that work to stop the smuggling route was ""always going to take time"".

The government has also introduced and announced changes to legislation in a bid to stop Channel crossings, including:

The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act, which became law in December, that introduces new criminal offences and allows law enforcement agencies to use counter terror-style powers to crack down on people-smuggling gangs.

Plans for what Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has described as ""the most significant changes to our asylum system in modern times"" in a bid to deter people from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport them.

Making refugee status temporary, with regular reviews of the safety of the person's home country, and a wait of 20 years for permanent status.

But the government faces a fight once again with its own MPs to get those measures through, with some Labour parliamentarians branding the measures ""shameful"" and echoing the rhetoric of Nigel Farage's Reform UK.

Tap here to read more about the government's planned asylum reforms.

Meanwhile, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the measures did not go far enough, adding that leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was necessary to address the problem.

Both the Conservatives and Reform UK have pressed for quitting the human rights treaty as a way to tackle illegal immigration, but the Labour government has insisted it will not leave the ECHR and instead seeks to adjust how immigration cases are interpreted in UK law.

Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy met ministers from ECHR member states last month, who agreed to consider reforming the treaty to address illegal migration.

International cooperation has also formed part of the government's strategy, such as through the ""one in, one out"" returns deal with France that came into force in August.

On 16 December, border security minister Alex Norris told peers that 193 migrants had been sent back to France and 195 had arrived in the UK under the returns deal so far.

But the scheme has drawn criticism as being ""no deterrent at all"" by shadow home secretary Chris Philp, amid cases of two migrants returning to the UK after being removed to France under the deal, who were then deported again.

Reacting to the total number of Channel crossings for 2025, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage wrote on X: ""Smash the gangs is a complete disaster. One in, one out is a farce and the numbers have been huge. Many of the young men that arrived last year will do us great harm.""

Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""Most men, women and children taking these journeys have fled oppressive regimes like the Taliban in Afghanistan and brutal civil wars in countries like Sudan.

""No-one risks their life on a flimsy boat in the Channel except out of desperation to be safe in a country where they have family or community connections.

""It's right the government wants to stop Channel crossings but plans that will punish people found to be refugees are unfair and not an effective deterrent.""

He added that there needs to be a ""multi-pronged approach"", including targeting gangs and international cooperation to ensure refugees can access safe and legal routes - something Ms Mahmood has included in plans to overhaul the asylum system.

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The number of small boat crossings are shameful and the British people deserve better.

""This government is taking action. We have removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally, and our historic deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.

""The Home Secretary has announced the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in decades, removing the incentives that bring illegal migrants to the UK and scaling up the return of those with no right to be here.""",https://e3.365dm.com/25/11/1600x900/skynews-small-boats-channel_7082809.jpg?20251115172058,N,,2026-01-01 10:57:39.292154

Local leaders in those cities and Democrats have said the deployments, which have faced legal challenges, were unnecessary. They have accused the Trump administration of federal overreach and of exaggerating isolated episodes of violence at mostly peaceful protests to justify sending in troops.

Trump, a Republican, has said troop deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Memphis and Portland were necessary to fight crime and protect federal property and personnel from protesters.

“We are removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,” Trump wrote.

“We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again – Only a question of time!”

Judges overseeing lawsuits filed by cities challenging the deployments have consistently ruled that the Trump administration overstepped its authority and found that there is no evidence to support claims that troops are necessary to protect federal property from protesters.

The U.S. Supreme Court on December 23 blocked Trump’s attempt to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois, a ruling that undercut his legal rationale for sending soldiers to other states.

The court said the president’s authority to take federal control of National Guard troops likely only applies in “exceptional” circumstances.

“At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the court’s majority held in an unsigned order.

Trump started deploying troops in June amid protests against his hardline immigration policies including efforts to ramp up deportations. He also deployed troops to Washington and took control of local police in response to what he said was rampant crime – though local crime statistics indicated otherwise – using his unique authority as president over the U.S. capital.

And last week, Roberts and the court barred Trump from deploying the National Guard in Chicago to enforce the immigration laws.
Judges blocked it from taking effect, and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the order discriminated based on nationality.
A year later, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case and upheld Trump’s order in a 5-4 ruling.
Instead, it has repeatedly lifted injunctions that blocked Trump’s policies from taking effect.","The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., ended the first year of President Trump’s second term with a record of rulings that gave him much broader power to control the federal government.

In a series of fast-track decisions, the justices granted emergency appeals and set aside rulings from district judges who blocked Trump’s orders from taking effect.

With the court’s approval, the administration dismissed thousands of federal employees, cut funding for education and health research grants, dismantled the agency that funds foreign aid and cleared the way for the U.S. military to reject transgender troops.

But the court also put two important checks on the president’s power.

In April, the court twice ruled — including in a post-midnight order — that the Trump administration could not secretly whisk immigrants out of the country without giving them a hearing before a judge.

Upon taking office, Trump claimed migrants who were alleged to belong to “foreign terrorist” gangs could be arrested as “enemy aliens” and flown secretly to a prison in El Salvador.

Roberts and the court blocked such secret deportations and said the 5th Amendment entitles immigrants, like citizens, a right to “due process of law.” Many of the arrested men had no criminal records and said they never belonged to a criminal gang.

Those who face deportation “are entitled to notice and opportunity to challenge their removal,” the justices said in Trump vs. J.G.G.

They also required the government to “facilitate” the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had been wrongly deported to El Salvador. He is now back in Maryland with his wife, but may face further criminal charges or efforts to deport him.

And last week, Roberts and the court barred Trump from deploying the National Guard in Chicago to enforce the immigration laws.

Trump had claimed he had the power to defy state governors and deploy the Guard troops in Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., Chicago and other Democratic-led states and cities.

The Supreme Court disagreed over dissents from conservative Justices Samuel A. Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch.

For much of the year, however, Roberts and the five other conservatives were in the majority ruling for Trump. In dissent, the three liberal justices said the court should stand aside for now and defer to district judges.

In May, the court agreed that Trump could end the Biden administration’s special temporary protections extended to more than 350,000 Venezuelans as well as an additional 530,000 migrants who arrived legally from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua or Venezuela.

It was easier to explain why the new administration’s policies were cruel and disruptive rather than why they were illegal.

Trump’s lawyers argued that the law gave the president’s top immigration officials the sole power to decide on these temporary protections and that “no judicial review” was authorized.

Nonetheless, a federal judge in San Francisco twice blocked the administration’s repeal of the temporary protected status for Venezuelans, and a federal judge in Boston blocked the repeal of the entry-level parole granted to migrants under Biden.

The court is also poised to uphold the president’s power to fire officials who have been appointed for fixed terms at independent agencies.

Since 1887, when Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates, the government has had semi-independent boards and commissions led by a mix of Republicans and Democrats.

But Roberts and the court’s conservatives believe that because these agencies enforce the law, they come under the president’s “executive power.”

That ruling may come with an exception for the Federal Reserve Board, an independent agency whose nonpartisan stability is valued by business leaders.

Georgetown Law Professor David Cole, the former legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the court has sent mixed signals.

“On the emergency docket, it has ruled consistently for the president, with some notable exceptions,” he said. “I do think it significant that it put a halt to the National Guard deployments and to the Alien Enemies Act deportations, at least for the time being. And I think by this time next year, it’s possible that the court will have overturned two of Trump’s signature initiatives — the birthright citizenship executive order and the tariffs.”

For much of 2025, the court was criticized for handing down temporary unsigned orders with little or no explanation.

That practice arose in 2017 in response to Trump’s use of executive orders to make abrupt, far-reaching changes in the law. In response, Democratic state attorneys and lawyers for progressive groups sued in friendly forums such as Seattle, San Francisco and Boston and won rulings from district judges who put Trump’s policies on hold.

The 2017 “travel ban” announced in Trump’s first week in the White House set the pattern. It suspended the entry of visitors and migrants from Venezuela and seven mostly-Muslim countries on the grounds that those countries had weak vetting procedures.

Judges blocked it from taking effect, and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the order discriminated based on nationality.

A year later, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case and upheld Trump’s order in a 5-4 ruling. Roberts pointed out that Congress in the immigration laws clearly gave this power to the president. If he “finds that the entry of ... any class of aliens ... would be detrimental,” it says, he may “suspend the entry” of all such migrants for as long as “he shall deem necessary.”

Since then, Roberts and the court’s conservatives have been less willing to stand aside while federal judges hand down nationwide rulings.

Democrats saw the same problem when Biden was president.

In April 2023, a federal judge in west Texas ruled for anti-abortion advocates and decreed that the Food and Drug Administration had wrongly approved abortion pills that can end an early pregnancy. He ordered that they be removed from the market before any appeals could be heard and decided.

The Biden administration filed an emergency appeal. Two weeks later, the Supreme Court set aside the judge’s order, over dissents from Thomas and Alito.

The next year, the court heard arguments and then threw out the entire lawsuit on the grounds that abortion foes did not have standing to sue.

Since Trump returned to the White House, the court’s conservative majority has not deferred to district judges. Instead, it has repeatedly lifted injunctions that blocked Trump’s policies from taking effect.

Although these are not final rulings, they are strong signs that the administration will prevail.

But Trump’s early wins do not mean he will win on some of his most disputed policies.

In November, the justices sounded skeptical of Trump’s claim that a 1977 trade law, which did not mention tariffs, gave him the power to set these import taxes on products coming from around the world.

In the spring, the court will hear Trump’s claim that he can change the principle of birthright citizenship set in the 14th Amendment and deny citizenship it to newborns whose parents are here illegally or entered as visitors.

Rulings on both cases will be handed down by late June.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04000d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6992x3671+0+497/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2a%2F70%2F3c1d3a704e73b85b4c22b195aae8%2F2203860796.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 06:12:13.243038

Hagerstown and Washington County governments said this week they are unaware of federal government plans for an immigration detention facility in the Hagerstown area.
Hagerstown government responds to Post report about planned immigration facility The City of Hagerstown, on Dec. 30, issued a statement about The Post report, that also was posted on the city's Facebook page.
""I am outraged by reports that the Trump Administration may be considering the construction of an ICE detention facility in or near Hagerstown.","Hagerstown and Washington County officials stated they are unaware of any federal plans for an immigration detention facility in the area.

A Washington Post report indicated the Trump Administration was seeking contractors for a processing site in Hagerstown for 500 to 1,500 beds for immigration detainees.

U.S. Rep. April McClain Delaney expressed outrage at the report and pledged to oppose any such facility.

McClain Delaney is demanding transparency from DHS and ICE and plans to use congressional oversight to investigate the proposal.

Hagerstown and Washington County governments said this week they are unaware of federal government plans for an immigration detention facility in the Hagerstown area.

The Washington Post reported on Dec. 24 that the Trump Administration is seeking contractors for a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time, according to a draft solicitation The Post reviewed.

The plan includes processing sites where newly arrested detainees would be booked into for a few weeks before being sent to one of seven large-scale warehouses that could each hold 5,000 to 10,000 people — a staging area for deportation, according to Post reporting.

Among the sites The Post listed where the federal government is looking to establish a processing site, with 500 to 1,500 beds, is Hagerstown, Maryland.

It was not clear if that means within the city limits or the greater Hagerstown area.

The Post reported that a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said she ""cannot confirm"" The Post's reporting and declined to answer questions about the warehouse plan.

The Herald-Mail emailed ICE, on Dec. 30, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, on Dec. 31, inquiring about The Post's report, but had not heard back by press time.

The State of Maryland already has three state prisons off Roxbury Road south of Hagerstown. The Washington County Sheriff's Office has a detention center off Western Maryland Parkway near Hagerstown's West End.

Hagerstown government responds to Post report about planned immigration facility

The City of Hagerstown, on Dec. 30, issued a statement about The Post report, that also was posted on the city's Facebook page.

""The City of Hagerstown is aware of the article published in the Washington Post over the last week naming Hagerstown as a possible site to utilize warehouse space to house those detained on immigration violations. The City of Hagerstown has no awareness of any such plans, and no city staff or city officials has been contacted by the government as to any future plans of utilizing space within Hagerstown for such a purpose.""

Washington County government response regarding potential immigration detention facility

The Herald-Mail reached out to Washington County government, asking if county officials were aware of a plan for an ICE facility in the Hagerstown area.

County spokesperson Danielle Weaver, on Dec. 30, responded via email:

""The County does not comment on US Government/Department of Homeland Security initiatives and is unaware of any actions currently to convert local warehouses for the purposes of immigration detention.""

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen comments on report of proposed ICE facility in Washington County

The following comment from Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., was provided via email on Dec. 31 through Van Hollen's office, regarding the proposed ICE facility in the Hagerstown area.

""The Trump Administration's cruel mass deportation agenda has not focused on 'the worst of the worst,' but instead has swept up thousands of people that DHS admits pose no threat to our communities — including small business owners, community leaders, pastors, and more. Trump's ICE has already been locking up scores of people without respect for their due process rights — and contracting for massive private warehouse prisons marks another step in their assault on our communities. While we need secure borders and across-the-board reform, upholding our immigration laws can and must be done safely, smartly, and humanely — but clearly those are not the priorities of this Administration.""

Congresswoman April McClain Delaney issues statement regarding report of proposed ICE facility in Hagerstown

U.S. Rep. April McClain Delaney, D-6th District, released a statement on Dec. 30 regarding reports of a proposed ICE detention facility in Hagerstown.

""I am outraged by reports that the Trump Administration may be considering the construction of an ICE detention facility in or near Hagerstown. If true, this proposal is unacceptable — and I will fight it with every tool available to me.

""The mass detention of human beings without due process is a profound moral and constitutional failure. Detaining people — like asylum seekers and families — far from legal counsel, their support systems, and meaningful oversight creates a grave risk of unlawful detention and irreversible harm.

""Hagerstown is not a dumping ground for a broken federal system — it is a proud community built on fairness, decency, and the rule of law. I will not quietly accept a facility that threatens civil liberties, undermines due process, and contradicts our values.

""Let me be clear about what I am doing, and what I will continue to do, to stop this:

I am demanding full and immediate transparency from DHS and ICE, including all planning documents, contracts, internal analyses, and communications related to any proposed detention facility in Washington County. There will be no secrecy and no backroom decisions.

I am scheduled to meet with ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations field office in Baltimore in January, where I will conduct my constitutionally required oversight of this facility which has my constituents locked inside.

I will work with colleagues to use aggressive congressional oversight — including formal investigations — to expose any effort to rush this project forward while cutting corners on legality, due process, or human rights.

I will oppose any attempt to detain people without full constitutional protections, and I will challenge policies that normalize prolonged or unlawful detention under the guise of efficiency.

I will stand with community members, faith leaders, advocates, and local governments who are speaking out against this proposal, and I will elevate their voices at every level of the federal government.

""This is about values and who we are, and that begins with protecting our neighbors. A government that detains people in bulk, behind walls and razor wire, without transparency or accountability, is a government that has lost its moral compass.

""I will not allow Hagerstown to become a symbol of that failure. I will fight this proposal publicly, relentlessly, and unapologetically — and I will keep the people of this community informed every step of the way.""","https://www.therecordherald.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/14/PSAY/87274883007-lg-h-sfq-qw.jpeg?crop=1599,900,x0,y106&width=1599&height=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-01 07:56:51.046709

“The town has received no official communication from ICE or any federal agency regarding such a proposal,” the Merrillville Town Council said in a release Wednesday.
“Upon learning of the report, Merrillville officials immediately began reviewing the matter.
Currently, the town has no information confirming the accuracy of the Washington Post report.
This wouldn’t be the first time an immigration detention facility tried to set down roots in Northwest Indiana.","A plan by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport immigrants “like Prime, but with human beings” may include a Merrillville location — to the town’s complete surprise.

Town officials have been seeking clarification from federal sources since they got wind of a Washington Post article that ran on Christmas Eve saying the Trump administration “is seeking contractors to help it overhaul the United States’ immigrant detention system in a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time.” Its plan, based on an unfinalized document the paper obtained, is to “speed up deportations by establishing a deliberate feeder system.”

“Newly arrested detainees would be booked into processing sites for a few weeks before being funneled into one of seven large-scale warehouses holding 5,000 to 10,000 people each, where they would be staged for deportation,” the Washington Post article said. “The large warehouses would be located close to major logistics hubs in Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia and Missouri. Sixteen smaller warehouses would hold up to 1,500 people each.

“The new facilities will ‘maximize efficiency, minimize costs, shorten processing times, limit lengths of stay, accelerate the removal process and promote the safety, dignity and respect for all in ICE custody,’ the solicitation said. ICE plans to share it with private detention companies this week to gauge interest and refine the plan, according to an internal email reviewed by The Post.”

While not mentioned in the article outright, Merrillville was included and named in a graphic published with it. The revelation, however, came as a complete shock, town officials said.

“The town has received no official communication from ICE or any federal agency regarding such a proposal,” the Merrillville Town Council said in a release Wednesday. “Upon learning of the report, Merrillville officials immediately began reviewing the matter. Currently, the town has no information confirming the accuracy of the Washington Post report.

“Officials will keep the community informed as verified information becomes available.”

Council President Rick Bella, D-5, told the Post-Tribune that he believes Merrillville was included only as a “possible” location and not as an official one.

“It’s kind of like people who mention to us a possible Data Center: It’s just talk until something more formal happens,” Bella said.

Officials downstate also appeared to have been kept in the dark about any processing center plans for Northwest Indiana. Governor Mike Braun’s spokesman Griffin Reid said he had inquiries out on the matter, but did not respond by deadline.

This wouldn’t be the first time an immigration detention facility tried to set down roots in Northwest Indiana. Florida-based GEO Group in 2016 saw its plans for an $80 million private immigration detention center in Gary go up in smoke after nine months of wooing because at least six council members opposed it, the Post-Tribune previously reported.

GEO operates similar detention facilities across the country and some have drawn fire from human rights supporters and the ACLU over the treatment of immigrants. In response, GEO officials say some of the claims have been inflated by activists and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency holds its detention centers to high standards and procedures that are regularly audited.

Although no plans were ever revealed, GEO owns a 40-acre site in Hobart on West 49th Avenue where strident opposition from residents and city officials continues. GEO still owns the property.

ICE held more than 68,000 people at the beginning of this month, agency data shows, the highest number on record, according to the Washington Post article. Nearly half, or 48 percent of these people, have no criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, ICE data shows.

“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” ICE acting director Todd M. Lyons said at a border security conference in April, according to the Arizona Mirror. He would prefer the deportation process operate “like Prime, but with human beings.”

Adelina Pruneda, an ICE Public Affairs Officer out of Central & South Texas, was on vacation and did not return a request for comment.

In a December 11 court filing, Philip Lavoie, the acting assistant special agent in charge of DHS' Mobile, Alabama, office, stated that, ""REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S.
And in both instances officers allegedly retrieved Venegas' Alabama-issued REAL ID from his pocket but claimed it could be fake.
Lavoie's declaration says that the agents ""needed to further verify his U.S. citizenship because each state has its own REAL ID compliance laws, which may provide for the issuance of a REAL ID to an alien and therefore based on HSI Special Agent training and experience, REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S.

But that's what the federal government has accomplished with the REAL ID, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now considers unreliable, even though getting one requires providing proof of citizenship or lawful status in the country.

In a December 11 court filing, Philip Lavoie, the acting assistant special agent in charge of DHS' Mobile, Alabama, office, stated that, ""REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S. citizenship.""

Lavoie's declaration was in response to a federal civil rights lawsuit filed in October by the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm, on behalf of Leo Garcia Venegas, an Alabama construction worker. Venegas was detained twice in May and June during immigration raids on private construction sites, despite being a U.S. citizen. In both instances, Venegas' lawsuit says, masked federal immigration officers entered the private sites without a warrant and began detaining workers based solely on their apparent ethnicity.

And in both instances officers allegedly retrieved Venegas' Alabama-issued REAL ID from his pocket but claimed it could be fake. Venegas was kept handcuffed and detained for an hour the first time and ""between 20 and 30 minutes"" the second time before officers ran his information and released him.

Lavoie's declaration says that the agents ""needed to further verify his U.S. citizenship because each state has its own REAL ID compliance laws, which may provide for the issuance of a REAL ID to an alien and therefore based on HSI Special Agent training and experience, REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S. citizenship.""

It's the punch line to a bad joke with a 20-year windup. When Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005. It was sold as a post-9/11 security measure to create uniform standards for state IDs, including clearly listing citizenship or lawful immigration status. State IDs that conformed to the requirements would be marked with a star. Contrary to the cheeky first sentence of this story, DHS insists that REAL ID is not a national ID system, and that it doesn't involve a centralized national database. (Civil liberties groups say it amounts to a de facto national ID system anyway.)

The rub was that REAL IDs would be required for entry to federal property, including, most significantly for the average American, airport security checkpoints. But the law was widely unpopular. There was such low compliance from states that enforcement was delayed seven times over the years, until finally beginning this May.

The project should have been scrapped years ago. America somehow survived two decades of terrorism-free air travel without REAL IDs. As Reason's Scott Shackford wrote in 2021, ""The government is demanding that Americans give up more of their privacy to the feds, subject themselves to additional inane bureaucracy, and carry around proof that we're citizens to be able to fly, even though none of that makes us more secure.""

And now we discover that DHS doesn't even consider the thing proof of citizenship.

In a court filing in response to DHS, the Institute for Justice noted how incredible this position is. ""REAL IDs require proof of citizenship or lawful status,"" the Institute for Justice wrote. ""DHS is the very agency responsible for certifying that REAL IDs, including Alabama's STAR IDs, satisfy this requirement.""

The law firm argues that DHS' policy of allowing officers to disregard proof of lawful presence likely violates the Fourth Amendment and DHS' own regulations.

When asked to comment on Lavoie's declaration, a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to Reason: ""The INA requires aliens and non-citizens in the US to carry immigration documents. Real IDs are not immigration documents—they make identification harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists.""

But of course, Venegas is a U.S. citizen, so he is not required to carry non-existent immigration documents.

DHS' statement to Reason when Venegas' lawsuit was first filed insisted that, ""What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.—NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.""

The agency never responded to a follow-up question asking why, then, Venegas was targeted.

This is the cynical two-step that the Supreme Court allowed this September when it overturned a ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the Trump administration was likely violating the Fourth Amendment rights of citizens by seizing them based solely on factors such as ""apparent race or ethnicity.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh released a concurring opinion in which he waved away concerns that allowing such profiling would lead to citizens and legal residents being unduly harassed.

""As for stops of those individuals who are legally in the country, the questioning in those circumstances is typically brief,"" Kavanaugh wrote, ""and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U. S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/REAL-ID.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 04:56:26.262020

Denaturalization cases are rare and can take years. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, about 11 cases were pursued per year between 1990 and 2017.

Since taking office in January, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards, and screening of social media posts and past speeches of immigrants.

Human rights groups widely condemn Trump’s policies, saying they curb rights like due process and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies aim to improve domestic security.

US CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES TO ISSUE WEIGHTED LOTTERY RULE

On December 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published a final rule, Weighted Selection Process for Registrants and Petitioners Seeking to File Cap Subject H-1B Petitions, that will replace the previous random lottery process for the selection of new H-1B visas with a system that accords greater weight and thus a higher chance of selection to beneficiaries with H-1B job offers at higher wage levels. The rule will take effect on February 27, 2026, in time for the H-1B lottery for Fiscal Year 2027 H-1B visas.

Under the new system, a lottery registration for a particular beneficiary may be entered into the lottery multiple times based on the highest Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) wage level in the area of intended employment for the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code appropriate for the position up to the point where the offered wage equals or exceeds that level. In other words, H-1B beneficiaries would be entered into the selection pool as follows based upon the classification of their offered wages:

Wage Level IV: 4 times

Wage Level III: 3 times

Wage Level II: 2 times

Wage Level I: 1 time

The weighted lottery rule will require additional information to be provided in the registration process, including the appropriate SOC code for the offered position, the area of intended employment, and the highest OEWS wage level that is met by the offered salary.

DC DISTRICT COURT JUDGE UPHOLDS H-1B 100K FEE

In a decision issued on December 23, 2025, US District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Beryl A. Howell upheld President Trump’s assessment of a $100,000 fee on certain H-1B beneficiaries—Proclamation No. 10973, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers, 90 Fed. Reg. 46,027 (Sept. 19, 2025). The legality of the fee had been challenged by the US Chamber of Commerce. Judge Howell ruled that the Proclamation was lawful based upon the president’s ""broad authority"" to restrict noncitizens' entry.

In her decision, Judge Howell cited Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, codified at Section 1182(f) of Title 8 in the US Code, which states, in pertinent part, that whenever the president finds that the entry of noncitizens into the US would be detrimental to the United States' interests, the president ""may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""

Currently, there are two other lawsuits challenging the Proclamation, one in the Northern District of California brought by Global Nurse Force and a coalition of unions and small businesses, and one brought by 20 states in federal district court in Massachusetts.

As we discussed in a prior LawFlash outlining the applicability of the $100,000 H-1B fee, the following H-1Bs are subject to the fee:

New H-1B petitions filed at or after 12:01 am ET on September 21, 2025 for beneficiaries outside the United States who do not have a valid H-1B visa.

H-1B petitions filed at or after 12:01 am ET on September 21, 2025 requesting consular notification, port of entry notification, or pre-flight inspection, including for an noncitizen in the United States.

Petitions filed at or after 12:01 am ET on September 21, 2025 requesting change of status, amendment, or extension where the USCIS determines the noncitizen is ineligible (e.g., not in valid status or they depart the United States before adjudication or if the beneficiary departs the United States prior to adjudication of a change of status request). In such cases, the $100,000 fee applies and must be paid.

The following H-1Bs are exempt from the $100,000 fee:

H-1B petitions received by the USCIS before 12:01 am ET September 21, 2025

H-1B change of status, change of employer, extension, or amendment petition filed on behalf of a beneficiary who is in the United States in another valid nonimmigrant status, such as B, F, L, TN, etc.—and such amendment, extension, or change of status is granted

A beneficiary of an approved H-1B petition who subsequently departs the United States and applies for a visa based on the approved H-1B petition

A beneficiary who is outside the United States but holds a valid, unexpired H-1B visa at the time of the filing of another H-1B petition

Beneficiaries granted National Interest Exceptions

IMMINENT EXPANSION OF THE TRAVEL BAN

On December 16, 2025, President Trump announced the expansion of the administration’s travel ban to include additional countries and the Palestinian Authority. The expansion will take effect on January 1, 2026.

The US administration implemented the travel ban in June 2025, imposing two types of visa restrictions on 19 countries in total. Nationals of Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen were subject to a ban on all nonimmigrant (temporary) visas and immigrant visas (permanent residence, or green cards.) Nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela were subject to a ban on all immigrant visas and a slightly more limited ban on tourist, student, and exchange visitor visas.

Under the expansion to the travel ban set to take effect on January 1, 2026, there is a total ban on nonimmigrant and immigrant visas for nationals of these additional countries: Burkina Faso, Laos, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Syria. Individuals with documents issued by the Palestinian Authority are also subject to the full ban.

Nationals of the following 19 countries are now banned from all immigrant visas and a more limited ban on non-immigrant visas, specifically all tourist, student, and exchange visitor visas (B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas): Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burundi, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, Dominica, Gabon, the Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Venezuela, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Turkmenistan will now only be subject to a ban on immigrant visas, but not non-immigrant visas.

Exceptions

There were exceptions in the June ban for, among others, anyone with a current green card or a valid visa issued prior to the ban’s effective date; athletes, coaches, and their families attending the World Cup, Olympics, or other sporting events; people who are immediate relatives of a US citizen (spouses, children under the age of 21, and parents); children adopted abroad; and Afghans seeking Special Immigrant Visas for their work helping US armed forces.

In addition to the expansion of the ban to include additional countries effective January 1, the US administration also eliminated the following significant exceptions:

Immediate relatives of US citizens

Children adopted abroad

Afghans seeking Special Immigrant Visas for their work assisting US armed forces

Note that a foreign national with dual citizenship of a country subject to the ban and a country not subject to the ban may travel to the US using a valid passport from the non-banned country.

While there is no immediate impact on nationals of the 39 countries now subject to the travel ban who are currently in the United States, in late November, the USCIS placed a blanket pause on the adjudication of all immigration benefits for nationals subject to the June travel ban.

This suspension applies to all benefits, including visa petitions, green card applications, and citizenship oath ceremonies. This suspension has now been extended to nationals of the newly banned countries. As a result, this means that there are now 39 countries whose nationals are currently unable to obtain immigration status and come to the United States from abroad, or obtain or change their immigration status from within the United States.

Currently, there is no information as to when adjudication of immigration benefits will resume for nationals of the countries subject to the ban.

CBP updated the Carrier Liaison Program on December 18, 2025.

The new list of countries exempt from the six-month passport validity rule has been issued.

Citizens of these countries need only have a passport valid for their intended period of stay in the United States.

Understanding the Six-Month Passport Validity Rule

The six-month passport validity rule requires visitors traveling to the United States to possess passports that are valid for at least six months beyond their intended period of stay. This rule is crucial for maintaining orderly and secure international travel, as it prevents situations where a visitor’s passport expires while they are still in the United States, which could complicate their ability to return to their home country. By ensuring that travelers have sufficient time to address any unforeseen circumstances that might delay their departure, this rule helps to avoid complications arising from an expired passport, thereby facilitating smoother travel and entry processes.

Carrier Liaison Program Update

Countries that are provided exemptions from the six-month passport validity rule are included on the CLP list issued by CBP through a detailed process that involves several considerations. The United States often enters into bilateral agreements or reciprocal arrangements with certain countries, based on mutual trust and cooperation in immigration and border security matters. These agreements often recognize the efficiency and reliability of the exempt countries’ passport issuance and renewal systems, which can handle passport validity issues without the need for a six-month buffer.

CBP also evaluates the risk of overstaying or violating immigration laws by citizens of the countries under consideration, and countries with a low risk of such issues are more likely to receive exemptions. Historical travel practices and long-standing precedents between the United States and the exempt countries are also taken into account.

Once these factors are considered, CBP updates the list of exempt countries under the CLP. This list is published online and communicated to airlines and transportation companies to ensure passengers from these countries are aware of the exemption and only need a passport valid for the duration of their stay in the United States. It is made available through official channels, such as the CBP website and relevant bulletins, to keep carriers and travelers informed of the current exemptions.

Carrier Liaison Program Country List Update

The updated list of countries whose citizens are exempt from the six-month passport validity rule is as follows:

Practical Impact

Airline and transportation companies must ensure that their passengers are aware of these requirements to avoid any travel disruptions. Travelers from the listed countries can plan their trips to the United States with the assurance that their passports need only be valid for the duration of their intended stay.

Yesterday, more than 11 months after being inaugurated, President Trump vetoed his first bills of this term. Both had passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. These were not divisive bills. So these vetoes pit the president against his fellow Republicans and raise the question of how far they might go to defy the president. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to walk us through details. Hey there.

DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there.

KELLY: What did he veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, the first is a bill that would have helped communities in southeastern Colorado pay for a conduit that would carry clean water. The bill would have done that by giving them more time to repay money without interest to the federal government. Now, that conduit is important because residents there have dealt with unsafe water. Some of the groundwater is tainted with toxic elements like radium. The other bill deals with Florida. It would have expanded the area reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe and required the secretary of the interior to help safeguard communities there from flooding.

KELLY: OK. Let me take these one by one. The Colorado one, first, and this clean water conduit. Why did President Trump veto it?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, his stated reason is that the bill would force federal taxpayers to foot the bill for a local water project that, as initially envisioned, would have been paid for by the local communities. He added in a statement that he's committed to ending, quote, ""the massive cost of taxpayer handouts."" But it's important to get a sense of the scope here. Federal funding has paid for a large chunk of this project, but as our colleagues at Colorado Public Radio have pointed out, this particular bill would cost the federal government less than $500,000, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, which, in terms of federal spending, is absolutely tiny.

KELLY: May I ask about the language you just used? You just told us the president's stated reason for vetoing this. Is there a reason to think there are other motives in play?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Colorado Republican Representative Lauren Boebert has raised this possibility. In a statement, she said, quote, ""I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation."" She clashed with the president this year by pushing for the release of the Epstein files, but Trump has not explicitly linked that to his veto.

But in addition, Trump, earlier this year, threatened what he called harsh measures if a woman named Tina Peters was not released from a Colorado prison. Peters was a county clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, and she is serving a nine-year sentence for helping someone get access to voting equipment after the 2020 election. So the whole case is tied to conspiracy theories about election fraud. Earlier this month, Trump said he was pardoning Peters, but presidential pardons apply to federal crimes. Peters was convicted at the state level, so she remains in prison. Now, again, Trump has not explicitly linked Peters to this veto, but this morning, he posted on social media that he wants Peters freed, so we know she's on his mind.

KELLY: OK. Go to the other one, the Florida veto. What are the reasons, stated or otherwise, for that veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump was straightforward in saying this veto was in part about politics. He said in a statement that the Miccosukee Tribe, quote, ""has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies."" Now, that seems to refer to the tribe earlier this year joining a lawsuit against an immigration detention center the Trump administration created in Florida, the one the president calls Alligator Alcatraz. The tribe considers the land it's built on sacred.

KELLY: To circle back to something I said at the outset, that both these bills, Florida and Colorado, they passed with the support of the president's GOP colleagues in Congress, right?

KURTZLEBEN: Yes. In fact, they both passed the House and Senate without those person-by-person roll call votes. The bills just had so much support. They were able to pass via voice votes or unanimous consent. So now the question is whether Congress can or wants to override Trump's vetoes.

KELLY: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you, Danielle.

KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.

KELLY: And Happy New Year.

While those with TPS status can’t be deported and can work legally in the U.S., they do not have a path to U.S. citizenship.

U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson found that Noem’s termination of the three countries’ protected status was “preordained” and did not follow the proper process, including consulting with other federal agencies or considering all country conditions.

The Joe Biden appointee further found that Noem “inexplicably departed from prior practice” by limiting the transition period for Nepali, Honduran and Nicaraguan TPS holders to 60 days, an unexplained change from 22 years of DHS practice of allowing at least six months’ transition after a TPS termination notice.

“Unilateral power has never been American. Nor has this country ignored the importance of humanitarian relief,” Thompson said in the opening of her 52-page order.

She continued: “By complying with the Constitution and enforcing the purpose of the temporary protected status statute, this nation’s economy becomes strengthened and our society united.”

The TPS program protects individuals from certain countries due to violence or economic duress. While those with TPS status can’t be deported and can work legally in the U.S., they do not have a path to U.S. citizenship. The National TPS Alliance and individual TPS holders from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal sued after Noem ordered the termination of protected status for the three countries, claiming her actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and were motivated by racial animus.

The order vacates Noem’s terminations, restoring protections for thousands of TPS holders in the country.

“Consistent with virtually every District Court decision in the last year, the court found that the administration failed to follow the law as it pursued its vendetta against these immigrant communities,” UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy Co-Director Ahilan Arulanantham said in a statement to Courthouse News.

National TPS Alliance coordinator Jose Palma said the decision “brings hope” to the TPS community but acknowledged that the government will most likely appeal the ruling.

“Today’s victory, we have to celebrate it; it gives hope that respect for the law is still strong and the court will continue being strong on the side of the law,” he said.

A representative for the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

In the order, Thompson said Noem’s decision to terminate TPS to Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal was arbitrary and capricious because her decision was “preordained and not based on an objective review of the country conditions, after consultation with the appropriate interagency department, as required by the TPS statute and the APA.”

Thompson also found that Noem deviated from past practices by not considering all country conditions when she made her decision, writing that the government’s decision to only consider conditions under the initial designation for TPS would go against the intent of the statute.

“Defendants’ interpretation to only include the initial designation would grant the secretary unfettered discretion to terminate TPS for a country in the midst of destabilizing and destructive civil war so long as a historic flood for which an antecedent TPS designation was made (even just months earlier) had dissipated,” the judge wrote, adding, “Such a perplexing result is a natural consequence of defendants’ interpretation of the TPS statute; and this court need not ‘read the statute to usher in such a bizarre and half-baked scheme.’”

Further, Thompson said there was “substantial evidence” that the termination decisions for Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal were motivated by racial animus, referring to multiple public statements by Noem and President Donald Trump that referred to TPS holders as criminals.

“These statements reflect a stereotyping of the immigrants protected under the TPS program as criminal invaders and perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population,” the judge said.

On July 31, Thompson postponed the termination of the TPS program for Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal until Nov. 18. However, a federal appeals court stayed that ruling, greenlighting the Trump administration to go ahead with its termination of TPS status for the three countries while litigation played out.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/01/kristi-noem-speaks-to-homeland-security-employees.jpeg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-12-31 23:56:32.766476

Arquette was responding to White’s post slamming Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tennessee) for re-sharing an AI-generated video of the White Stripes musician threatening Trump voters.

The pro-Trump X account MAGA Response posted a video Monday of an AI-generated clip of White telling Trump supporters, “Don’t even think about listening to my music, you fascists.”

A day later, Burchett retweeted the video and mocked White’s appearance, writing, “That cute little girl from the Addams Family got really ugly and angry.”

White responded on Instagram, calling out the congressman’s “playground” bully behavior.

“Can you believe that a U.S. congressman, that’s right, a CONGRESSMAN (from my state no less), a once hallowed and respected position in our society, would repost an AI-generated video, containing a false comment that I never said and refuted (without researching that I might add) and like a 10 year old on a playground, add to it attempted insults to my physical appearance?” White asked his Instagram followers. “What kind of joke are we all living in now?”

White went on to bemoan how “low class playground bullies” like Trump and Burchett have lowered the standards for America’s elected officials, writing, “It’s really sad how embarrassing our leadership has become, I so wish the average American conservative could have a conversation with any intelligent people in other countries around the world, just for one brief moment, and actually see just what a joke our government (and by proxy our country) has become.”

The musician concluded his fiery post Monday by predicting a future when officials like Burchett refuse to “admit to being a part” of the MAGA “cult” and “well-spoken leaders” have replaced them in power.

“All the MAGA hats will be in landfills and actual intelligent and honorable leadership will take their place.

While some of those policies have since been paused or rolled back, the changes left many educators and families nervous and frustrated.

Here’s a round-up of some of the big moments from 2025.

Immigration fears keep students out of school

In April, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security showed up at two LAUSD schools to conduct what officials at the agency described as “wellness checks” on some immigrant students. The agents were turned away.

Widespread immigration sweeps started in L.A. a few months later.

Local school leaders, parents and students have said that fear has at times kept kids from attending school and high school principals across the country reported similar experiences.

We’ve also seen acts of resistance. As early as February, students walked out to protest Trump’s policies. Teachers and volunteers with organizations like Union del Barrio began patrolling neighborhoods near schools to sound an alarm if there was any suspected immigration enforcement activity.

Schools have also provided additional resources, including busing for students afraid to walk to school and know-your-rights training for parents.

Immigration concerns also stretched into early childhood education. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in July that children without legal status would be barred from Head Start programs. That directive was paused by the administration, and then rejected by a federal judge.

Federal budget cuts hit hard

The administration made a number of budget cuts to agencies that serve students and their families.

Early in the year, the administration slashed Department of Education staff.

The department also made steep cuts to its civil rights office in March, which already faced a backlog of complaints. Seven of 12 regional Office for Civil Rights branches were shuttered, including one in San Francisco, which handled complaints filed in California. The cases involve families trying to get services for students with disabilities, allegations of bias related to race and religion, and claims of sexual violence.

Many attorneys with the Office for Civil Rights were called back to work in December as the backlog of complaints became untenable.

The administration also restructured its funding of homeless services, meaning that the future may be even rougher for L.A. families seeking housing. Data reviewed by LAist show the number of unsheltered L.A. County children and families rose in 2025.

The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program was eliminated in 2025. The end of the program sunsets a long-standing celebration of local school achievements. LAist preserved the records of California winners.

And the shutdown this fall over the federal budget also ensnared children and others who rely on food assistance from SNAP and WIC. In some cases, school districts invested in expanded meal programs to help make up for lost meals.

Diversity, equity and inclusion were targeted

The Trump administration has also sought to eliminate language associated with historically under-served communities across public education:

Some Head Start centers were told to avoid words like “Black,” “minority,” and “trauma” in their funding applications.

Under pressure to avoid certain terms, educators in TK-12 have had to figure out different approaches to improve academic outcomes and mental health for Black students.

Colleges and universities such as the University of Southern California have eliminated “diversity, equity and inclusion” as stated values.

Trump also took other actions. He issued an executive order to end public service loan forgiveness for people who work at places that “advance illegal immigration, terrorism, discrimination and violent protests.”

Public higher education in California also found itself in unfriendly territory

In March, the Justice Department announced an investigation into University of California campuses related to allegations of antisemitism.

A few months later, the Justice Department revealed the results of an investigation into UCLA, alleging it found “indifference” to “a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students” — much like at Harvard, Columbia and other elite universities. To settle those and other claims, the Trump administration demanded $1 billion from UCLA.

The National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health froze hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding that had been allocated to the university’s researchers. This cut funding for a wide variety of projects — everything from research into pediatric cancer to how our gut microbiome affects our health.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20be2db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+170/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F52%2Fb3%2Fb53ff5df4ca5b9ea032ce2d720d5%2Fgettyimages-trump-mcmahon-education.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 06:56:24.368156

“It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, their land and their way of life,” he said at the time.

Financing modifications proposed for a water pipeline in Colorado The other bill vetoed by Trump would have helped rural residents pay for their share of a long-planned water pipeline project, called the Arkansas Valley Conduit.","For the first time in his second term, President Donald Trump has used his veto power, rejecting two bills that would have expanded tribal control to more of the Florida Everglades and helped Colorado residents pay their share of a water pipeline project.

Both bills had bipartisan support when passed by Congress earlier this year. To override Trump’s veto, a two-thirds majority would need to vote for each measure in both the Senate and House of Representatives.

Trump rejected 10 bills in his first term in the Oval Office –– with Congress overriding only his veto of a defense policy bill in January 2021. Former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama vetoed 13 and 12 bills, respectively.

Bill to expand land reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe

In rejecting the Florida bill, Trump cited actions by the Miccosukee Tribe to try “to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”

The tribe signed on as plaintiffs to one of three federal lawsuits against the Trump administration over the immigration detention facility constructed earlier this year in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The facility had been slated to close its doors earlier this year, but a federal appeals court put that order on hold in September, pending an appeal.

The bill vetoed by Trump would have incorporated the Osceola Camp — an inhabited tribal village in the Everglades — into the Miccosukee Reserved Area, controlled by the Native American tribe. The measure would have also required the Interior Department to consult with the Miccosukee Tribe on the best ways to protect structures from flooding.

One of the bill’s bipartisan sponsors — Republican Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez of Florida — said the measure was “about fairness and conservation” during a speech on the House floor in July.

“It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, their land and their way of life,” he said at the time.

Requests for comment made Wednesday by Spectrum News to attorneys listed in federal court records as representing the Miccosukee Tribe — as well as to Gimenez’s office — were not immediately returned.

Trump contended in his veto that the Osceola Camp was built “without authorization, in a low area that was raised with fill material” and that the cost to repair and replace infrastructure could be as much as $14 million.

The president wrote that “it is not the Federal Government’s responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.

Financing modifications proposed for a water pipeline in Colorado

The other bill vetoed by Trump would have helped rural residents pay for their share of a long-planned water pipeline project, called the Arkansas Valley Conduit.

The bill sought to lengthen the repayment timeline and to reduce interest payments the communities of the Arkansas River Valley must make to the Bureau of Reclamation for the pipeline’s construction.

First approved by former President John F. Kennedy in 1962, the project would provide an estimated 7,500 acre-feet of water per year to as many as 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.

“Currently, many people in these areas rely on groundwater supplies that may contain naturally occurring radionuclides such as radium and uranium,” the Bureau of Reclamation says on a webpage about the plan.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., criticized Trump’s veto on social media, writing, “This isn’t governing. It’s a revenge tour.”

Bennet has previously accused the president of retaliating against the state over the incarceration of former election clerk Tina Peters, who is serving a nine-year sentence for her role in a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., also chimed in Tuesday night on X, writing, “This isn’t over.”

The Colorado lawmaker shared another post, noting that she was among a handful of Republicans to sign a discharge petition forcing a vote in the House to require the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

After reversing course on his opposition, Trump ultimately signed the bill into law, and records have been made public in batches since Dec. 19 –– though several media outlets recently reported the Justice Department has more than 5.2 million more documents to review.

When asked for comment about Bennet's and Boebert’s remarks, the White House referred to Trump's message to Congress.

In those remarks, the president said that the water pipeline project had been delayed for decades because it is “economically unviable” and that he blocked the bill to save taxpayers money.

""We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!"" he said in a social media post Wednesday.

Governors typically control states' National Guardsmen, and Trump had deployed troops to all three cities against the wishes of state and local Democratic leaders. He said it was necessary as part of a broader crackdown on immigration, crime and protests.

The president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centerpiece of his second term - and has toyed with the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to stop his opponents from using the courts to block his plans. He has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Troops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration.

In his post, Trump said the troops' presence was responsible for a drop in crime in the three cities, though they were never on the streets in Chicago and Portland as legal challenges played out. When the Chicago deployment was challenged in court, a Justice Department lawyer said the Guard's mission would be to protect federal properties and government agents in the field, not ""solving all of crime in Chicago.""

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson's office in a statement said the city's reduction in crime was due to the efforts of local police and public safety programs. Chicago officials echoed the sentiment, saying in a release Tuesday that the city had 416 homicides in 2025 - the fewest since 2014.

Trump's push to deploy the troops in Democrat-led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.

Governors react

The Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area. The order was not a final ruling but was a significant and rare setback by the high court for the president's efforts.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker wrote on X Wednesday that Trump ""lost in court when Illinois stood up against his attempt to militarize American cities with the National Guard. Now Trump is forced to stand down.""

Hundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement Wednesday that her office had not yet received ""official notification that the remaining federalized Oregon National Guard troops can return home. They were never lawfully deployed to Portland and there was no need for their presence. If President Trump has finally chosen to follow court orders and demobilize our troops, that's a big win for Oregonians and for the rule of law.""

Trump's decision to federalize National Guard troops began in Los Angeles in June, when protesters took to the streets in response to a blitz of immigration arrests in the area. He deployed about 4,000 troops and 700 Marines to guard federal buildings and, later, to protest federal agents as they carried out immigration arrests.

The number of troops slowly dwindled until just several hundred were left. They were removed from the streets by Dec. 15 after a lower court ruling that also ordered control to be returned to Gov. Gavin Newsom. But an appeals court had paused the second part of the order, meaning control remained with Trump. In a Tuesday court filing, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Newsom.

""About time (Trump) admitted defeat,"" Newsom said in a social media post. ""We've said it from day one: the federal takeover of California's National Guard is illegal.""

Troops will remain on the ground in several other cities. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in December paused a lower court ruling that had called for an end to the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., where they've been deployed since August after Trump declared a ""crime emergency.""

Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September as part of a larger federal task force to combat crime, a move supported by the state's Republican Gov. Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued. However, the judge stayed the decision to block the Guard as the state appeals, allowing the deployment to continue.

In New Orleans, about 350 National Guard troops deployed by Trump arrived in the city's historic French Quarter on Tuesday and are set to stay through Mardi Gras to help with safety. The state's Republican governor and the city's Democratic mayor support the deployment.

The contracts, totaling $6.3 million, are for engineering, technical services, and facility maintenance.

Tribal members have expressed deep opposition to the contracts on social media.

Oneida Nation officials say they are reviewing the issue to ensure alignment with the Nation's values.

Oneida Nation officials are coming under fire by tribal members after it was discovered one of the tribe’s subsidiaries entered into contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.

The Federal Procurement Data System, an online database of federal contracts, shows Oneida-Stantec JV LLC (OESC Group) was awarded a $2.6 million contract by ICE on Sept. 19 and a $3.7 million contract by ICE on Dec. 26. The information was first reported by Fox 11 News in Green Bay.

The contracts are engineering and technical services and for maintenance of government facilities.

“Since becoming aware of this issue, the Nation has been completing its due diligence to address the issue in a legal and transparent manner,” tribal officials posted on social media late Tuesday. “We are working in compliance with our corporate charter to take the steps necessary to ensure alignment between the Nation's values and OESC group.

“The Nation has taken preliminary steps on this issue, and we ask for your patience as we navigate legal processes. More information is forthcoming over the next several days.”

The post on Facebook garnered hundreds of comments, some in favor of working with ICE and most against.

“This reflects a clear misalignment with the values I expect our elected officials to uphold,” posted tribal member and former Oneida Nation attorney Rebecca Webster. “This is mind boggling that anyone thought this was a good idea.”

Others posted that ICE is targeting mostly Indigenous people from Turtle Island (North America) who happen to be from Mexico or Central America.

There have been incidents in which ICE briefly detained tribal members of reservations in the U.S. in apparent cases of racial profiling.

These incidents have drawn ire from Indian Country because the ones being arrested have ancestors who were among the first people in what is now the U.S., going back at least 10,000 years.

A similar situation of a tribal nation facing the ire of Indian Country after it entered into a contract with ICE occurred earlier this month with the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation of Kansas.

Dallas Goldtooth, a popular Indian Country actor, comedian and activist spoke out against that nearly $30 million contract.

“This is a clear example of where economic development without any base values grounded in Indigenous philosophy and human dignity leads you into some dark places,” he wrote on social media about the issue.

Prairie Band officials fired the senior members of the tribe’s LLC, which made the contract with ICE. Potawatomi tribal officials later announced they were able to cancel the contract with ICE.

On Wednesday, Oneida tribal officials issued a statement saying they condemn OESC’s actions to enter into the contracts with ICE because “we believe such actions hinder teaching our values to the next seven generations of its employees, representatives or corporations if we do not abide by those values today.”

The leadership of OESC is scheduled to meet with the tribal business committee, which just passed a resolution to provide clarity of the tribe’s position on the issue.

“Passing this resolution is an initial step to implementing clarity about the Nation’s expectations that our employees, representatives, businesses and tribal corporations align with our core values,” Oneida Chairman Tehassi Hill said in a statement. “The Oneida Business Committee will consider other appropriate steps needs to prevent future misalignment with balanced measure using our ‘Good Mind Principles’.”

In his more-than-eight-hour of testimony, Smith insisted he had no political motivations in indicting Trump, and said he believed “we had proof beyond a reasonable doubt in both cases” that he brought.
Smith later told an unnamed committee staffer he would have indicted Biden or Barack Obama over similar evidence.
“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election.
I did not choose those members, President Trump did,” Smith said.","Jack Smith, the former justice department special counsel who led the aborted federal prosecution of Donald Trump, told a congressional committee that he never spoke to Joe Biden about his cases, according to the transcript of a deposition released on Wednesday.

In his behind-closed-doors testimony to the House judiciary committee earlier this month, Smith defended the charges he brought against Trump for allegedly possessing classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election, while warning of the consequences of allowing election meddling to go unpunished.

“Theoretically, what happens if there is election interference and the people who are responsible for that are not held accountable?” Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal asked.

“It becomes the new norm, and that becomes how we … conduct elections,” Smith replied, according to the transcript.

“And so the toll on our democracy, if you had to describe that, what would that be?” the congresswoman asked.

“Catastrophic,” Smith said.

Trump and his Republican allies have alleged that the former special counsel was a key figure in a justice department that Biden had “weaponized” against his predecessor. The Republican-controlled House judiciary committee earlier this year heard testimony from one of Smith’s top deputies, and months later subpoenaed the former special counsel for private testimony. Smith had offered to voluntarily testify in public, as special counsels typically do.

In questioning from Democratic congressman Dan Goldman, Smith said he operated without interference from Merrick Garland, the attorney general who appointed him, or any other top justice department officials.

“Did President Biden ever give you any instructions about what you should or should not do related to these investigations?” Goldman asked.

“No,” Smith replied, later specifying he had not spoken to Biden about his cases in any way.

Smith was appointed in November 2022, and quickly brought the two federal cases against Trump, who also faced state-level charges of election interference in Georgia, and falsifying business records in New York.

While he would later be convicted of 34 felonies in the Manhattan case, neither of Trump’s federal indictments went to trial before he returned to office following the 2024 election, after which Smith, in line with justice department policy, dropped the charges.

The election-interference case was slowed by pretrial motions, including a supreme court ruling that gave presidents immunity for official acts and forced Smith to make changes to his case. The classified-documents case was hampered by rulings from Florida judge Aileen Cannon, who at one point dismissed Smith’s indictment.

Smith authored a report into his prosecutions, and the portion covering the election interference case was released prior to Biden leaving office. However, Cannon has barred the chapter discussing the classified-documents charges from being made public, though Democrats on the judiciary committee have asked her to reverse her decision.

At the outset of the hearing, an attorney for Smith, Peter Koski, told the committee the former special counsel had received an email from the justice department advising him to avoid talking about his evidence in the case because of Cannon’s ruling.

“This restriction significantly limits Mr Smith’s ability to discuss the classified-documents case. Nevertheless, Mr Smith is committed to doing his best to answering questions consistent with the department’s guidance,” Koski said.

In his more-than-eight-hour of testimony, Smith insisted he had no political motivations in indicting Trump, and said he believed “we had proof beyond a reasonable doubt in both cases” that he brought.

“If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Republican or a Democrat,” he said in his opening statement. Smith later told an unnamed committee staffer he would have indicted Biden or Barack Obama over similar evidence.

Republicans have been in uproar after it emerged that federal investigators obtained data related to the phone usage of several members of Congress, which was used as part of Smith’s prosecutions. Smith hit back in his testimony, saying: “Recent narratives about my team’s work are false and misleading” and the “records were lawfully subpoenaed and were relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation”.

The only data collected, Smith said, was incoming and outgoing phone numbers and the calls’ durations, not their contents themselves. The data helped show that Trump continued to press his allies to stop Biden from formally becoming president, even as his followers were attacking the US Capitol on January 6, he added.

“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I did not choose those members, President Trump did,” Smith said.

Trump has repeatedly railed against Smith, and in his testimony the former special counsel acknowledged the risk that the president could come after him.

“I have no doubt that the president wants to seek retribution against me,” Smith said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c6b6153f6ef9976762872e59a0f5b562c179a7/180_0_1800_1440/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57080d18d6d26ff6f65158e72c863b5c",N,,2025-12-31 20:57:24.767673

Immigration agents took at least 92 people into custody from Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, according to data collected by 805 UndocuFund, a local nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting undocumented immigrants and their families. The elevated ICE activity appeared to continue later into the week as well.

“This one is a direct attack on our communities,” 805 UndocuFund communications and media organizer Claudia Gonzalez said, noting that ICE picked most people up in areas where immigrants live and work.

805 UndocuFund collected this data from rapid responders who witness the arrests and community members who call and report the arrests of their friends and family members, she said. The group then checks the numbers to ensure there aren’t duplicates of the same incident in the dataset.

On Saturday, ICE agents took 34 people into custody from Santa Maria and two people into custody from San Luis Obispo, according to the data provided to The Tribune.

Then, on Sunday, ICE took 13 people from Lompoc, two people from Santa Barbara and eight people from Santa Maria — including four people who were working at a gas station, according to the data.

On Monday, ICE agents took 24 people from Santa Maria, five people from San Luis Obispo, one person from Nipomo and three people from Paso Robles, according to the data.

Since President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, Gonzalez said ICE agents have taken at least 94 community members into custody from San Luis Obispo County and 537 community members from Santa Barbara County — with a large number of those incidents happening during the past few days, Gonzalez said.

805 UndocuFund community organizer Cesar Vasquez said he’s never seen ICE take so many people during a two-day period.

“It’s been hell,” he said.

ICE did not respond to The Tribune’s request for comment about the apparent uptick in Central Coast activity as of Tuesday.

Elevated ICE activity continues into week

On Monday, 805 UndocuFund rapid responders were running around Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties monitoring ICE agents and offering help to families who had been separated, Vasquez said.

In addition to Santa Maria ICE agents, agents from Camarillo and Los Angeles appeared to join the swarm, too — which Vasquez hasn’t seen before, he said.

805 UndocuFund identifies ICE agents based on their vehicles and license plates.

The activity began early in Santa Maria on Monday, with ICE picking up a man on the way to his car at 4 a.m. on Bunny Avenue, Vasquez said. Then, at 4:45 a.m., ICE detained a man and a woman when he stopped on Bunny Avenue to drive her to work, he said.

At 5:24 a.m., ICE took a man from the parking lot of his apartment building on Western Avenue.

Then, ICE detained a man on Morrison Avenue as he dropped his children off with a babysitter at 5:26 a.m., Vasquez said.

ICE continued to circle the area, taking people into custody on Alvin and Bunny avenues and other nearby streets.

The agents then descended on San Luis Obispo County, taking a father from outside his apartment on Bullock Lane and Orcutt Road, Vasquez said. Then, 30 minutes later, ICE agents picked up two men from the same area, and another man on the way to his car 20 minutes after that, he said.

At 11:13 a.m., ICE agents took a man into custody from the lobby of the San Luis Obispo County Jail when he was released. The Tribune was at the scene at the time he was detained.

The agents immediately placed him in handcuffs and escorted him to a vehicle in the parking lot. ICE agents did not appear to present a warrant to the man, and the agents refused to answer questions on the scene.

Meanwhile, in Paso Robles, ICE took a man at 11:43 a.m. while he was getting groceries, Vasquez said. Agents continued to pick up other people in Santa Maria and across San Luis Obispo County on Monday afternoon, he said.

Tuesday morning was a similar story — with ICE agents driving around Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties to pick people up off the street, Vasquez and Gonzalez both told The Tribune.

The elevated activity has had a large impact on community members through the holiday weekend and into this week.

People avoided leaving their homes, even to go to work, to the doctor or to take their children to school, Gonzalez said.

“They’re definitely scared,” she said. “Even documented community members are scared to go outside, because what we’ve seen is obvious racial profiling. They’re hitting Santa Maria, and this is where our working community lives.”

These deportations have also impacted children from mixed-status families.

“When a family is separated, sometimes they lose their main breadwinner,” Gonzalez said. “Children are left without parents.”

Gonzalez said people can call 805 UndocuFund at 805-870-8855 if they see ICE or if they need assistance because a friend or family member was taken. People can donate to 805 UndocuFund’s mutual aid fund for impacted families at www.pledge.to/mutual-aid-fund.

At an ICE recruitment fair in Arlington, Texas, more than a hundred people were waiting outside before the event started.
Attenders told the New York Times they were there because they were “very patriotic” and committed to “guarding the homeland”.
“When I saw Uncle Sam pointing that finger, I just had it in my heart,” Mahin Ahmed, an ICE applicant, told the Times.","US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly planned a $100m, one-year media blitz for what it’s calling “wartime recruitment”, targeting conservative radio show listeners, gun rights aficionados, military affairs followers and men’s interests enthusiasts – among others in the Maga-verse – for jobs in the Trump administration’s next phase of its mass deportation campaign.

“Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” one of the agency’s ads says, directing interested readers to apply.

As ICE looks to hire for thousands of new positions, flush with cash after an unprecedented influx from Congress last summer, it’s relying on geofencing to ensure people near military bases, Nascar races, gun and trade shows, and college campuses receive its recruitment ads, according to an internal document reported by the Washington Post.

Officials also intend to spend $8m or more on deals with fitness, military and tactical/lifestyle online influencers, who would use their sway to push the administration’s immigration agenda through livestreams, events, and other content meant for their gen Z and millennial audiences.

“America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out,” ICE’s recruiting website says.

The administration’s hiring push comes after Donald Trump signed HR 1 into law in July, which allotted $45bn for immigration detention and $32bn for immigration enforcement-related activities and personnel.

Yet even as ICE now has the funds to hire about 14,000 new employees, its efforts to quickly do so have raised red flags among everyday citizens disgusted by the recruitment ads themselves and experts concerned that the speed and tone with which the federal government is pursuing new agents could attract more aggressive, combat-hungry applicants.

“They’re aiming for that sweet spot of people who’ve got something to prove, who want to have that power, under the guise of patriotism,” Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told the Post.

ICE’s controversial ads have leaned heavily on American symbolism – Uncle Sam, George Washington, Lady Liberty – while casting immigrants as bad actors to convince potential deportation officers to apply.

Meanwhile, ICE is offering an up to $50,000 signing bonus, higher than the real median personal income for a year’s work in the US, as well as up to $60,000 in student loan repayment for those who join.

The agency has already received more than 220,000 applications and made more than 18,000 tentative job offers, sometimes on the spot. At an ICE recruitment fair in Arlington, Texas, more than a hundred people were waiting outside before the event started.

With more ICE officers available, the White House border czar, Tom Homan, said that the number of immigrant arrests will “explode” in 2026, including through an increase in enforcement at workplaces, Reuters reported.

Homan’s comments came after the administration had signaled it would instead be toning down its public-facing immigration actions to focus on apprehending people with serious criminal convictions, in the face of widespread backlash to its violent and highly visible tactics in major cities around the country.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38bb565c4c908b17da4f77167e55959d3c281e9c/904_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d4402e573fdfe2f3354caf1d87583e3",N,,2025-12-31 17:57:23.358418

In the coming year, ICE plans to spend $100 million to recruit individuals who may be a good fit to assist in furthering President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda by targeting military enthusiasts, gun rights supporters, people interested in physical training and conservative politics, according to an internal document seen by the Washington Post.

The plan, reportedly dubbed the “wartime recruitment” strategy by ICE, outlines an aggressive acceleration in strategic marketing that ICE has already used to recruit more than 200,000 individuals to join the agency as it seeks to deport swaths of immigrants from the U.S.

New strategies include targeting recruitment ads to individuals on a military base, attending a NASCAR race or gun trade show, or at a college campus through “geofencing” – a technical strategy where advertisers can create a virtual boundary around a real area to trigger ads on web browsers or social media for people in the location.

The 30-page document also indicates ICE may partner with online influencers, some of whom could be former agents, veterans, or “pro-ICE,” who have Gen-Z and millennials audiences with interests that align with the military or fitness.

Those influencers would be expected to host live streams, attend events or post content online targeted toward “niche communities.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said they would not confirm or deny any leaked documents but praised the Washington Post for highlighting Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem’s “wildly successful ICE recruitment campaign, which is under budget and ahead of schedule.”

McLaughlin said ICE received more than 220,000 applications in five months and has issued more than 18,000 tentative job offers. She added that more than 85 percent of new hires have previous law enforcement experience.

McLaughlin stressed that new law enforcement hires meet “the same rigorous standards” that apply to all officers and those deployed in the field attend a virtual Deportation Officer Training Program as well as an in-person firearm and tactical training program at a local field office.

Over the last year, ICE has launched ad campaigns on television, radio, web browsers, streaming services and at in-person sporting events to attract potential recruits. Some of the ads target disgruntled police officers in major cities such as Chicago or Seattle. Others highlight signing bonuses of $50,000, generous benefits and even student loan forgiveness.

The agency has been specifically targeting Gen Z and early-career professionals as potential recruits, according to internal documents seen in August. Officials have been utilizing social media and streaming services to reach more than 42 million people in specific audience groups that may be a good fit for roles in ICE.

The recent document seen by the Post indicates that those techniques are becoming more narrowly-tailored as the administration continues to fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to deport undocumented immigrants and reduce overall immigration to the U.S.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/31/18/37/GettyImages-2231531157.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-12-31 18:57:24.715738
,Human Rights,2025-12-31 21:59:58+00:00,the Guardian,Documents suggest Kilmar Ábrego García was retaliated against after wrongful deportation,"Guardian staff, Associated Press",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/kilmar-abrego-garcia-retaliation-deportation,"On 3 December, US district judge Waverly Crenshaw filed an order under seal that compelled the government to provide some documents to Ábrego García and his attorneys.
Earlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Ábrego García could be vindictive.
He specifically cited a statement by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Ábrego García because he had won his wrongful deportation case.
The human-smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Ábrego García was pulled over for speeding.
“The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.","A newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Kilmar Ábrego García reveals that high-level justice department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority”, only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.

Ábrego García, originally from El Salvador, has pleaded not guilty in federal court in Tennessee to charges of human smuggling. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive – a way for the Trump administration to punish him for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.

To support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022. On 3 December, US district judge Waverly Crenshaw filed an order under seal that compelled the government to provide some documents to Ábrego García and his attorneys. That order was unsealed on Tuesday and sheds new light on the case.

Earlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Ábrego García could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Ábrego García because he had won his wrongful deportation case.

Rob McGuire, who was the acting US attorney for the middle district of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Ábrego García.

In the newly unsealed order, Crenshaw writes: “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in [the justice department] and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”

The US attorney’s office for the middle district of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established [justice department] practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”

The email referenced was from McGuire to his staff stating that Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later”, according to Crenshaw’s order.

The human-smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Ábrego García was pulled over for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and state troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.

The order does not give much detail on what is in the documents that were turned over to Ábrego García, but it shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the office of the deputy attorney general, contacted McGuire about Ábrego García’s case on 27 April, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the US supreme court ruled in Ábrego García’s favor on 10 April.

On 30 April, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the deputy attorney general’s office, according to the order. Singh and McGuire continued to communicate about the prosecution. On 18 May, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got “clearance” to file it. “The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.

A hearing on the motion to dismiss the case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for 28 January.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2c659b86cb10ca03a17a1acf26f9a4e829c6069/167_0_4859_3888/master/4859.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=88bb1d778b559ab1ebc26c615ef31bc6",N,,2025-12-31 17:57:27.365476

According to the Post, the Hutchins warehouse would hold up to 9,500 detainees, nearly triple the amount that the largest current ICE detention facility, a makeshift tent encampment at Fort Bliss, can hold.
That number stands out even more when compared to the 700 or so that the current closest ICE detention center to Dallas, the Prairieland Detention Center near Alvarado, reportedly holds.
The Department of Homeland Security declined to answer questions about the proposed plan and did not confirm any of the paper’s findings.
Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, is the only state with more than one of the proposed new detention sites.","Nearly a year into President Donald Trump’s second administration, the signs that his controversial immigration policies will continue to show themselves in many ways are only growing more frequent. Along with near-daily headlines involving eye-popping statistics, arrests and deportations, a recent Washington Post report outlines a new plan that calls for Dallas County to soon be the home of the nation’s second-largest ICE detention facility.

“The Trump administration is seeking contractors to help it overhaul the United States’ immigrant detention system in a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time, according to a draft solicitation,” the Post reported on Dec. 24.

According to the documents reviewed by the paper, the aim of the plan is to “speed up deportations by establishing a deliberate feeder system,” which is not logistically possible at present. Proposed new, large detention facilities would, according to the draft solicitation, be placed near “major logistical hubs.”

If the Dallas-Fort Worth area is anything, it’s a major logistical hub, so it’s of little surprise that Hutchins, in Dallas County, just a bit southeast of downtown Dallas, is one of the seven proposed spots for new detention facilities that would hold thousands of people at once. The proposed sites in the draft are located in cities, counties or states led by Republican officials who have demonstrated a pro-Trump stance and support for the president’s immigration policies.

According to the Post, the Hutchins warehouse would hold up to 9,500 detainees, nearly triple the amount that the largest current ICE detention facility, a makeshift tent encampment at Fort Bliss, can hold. That number stands out even more when compared to the 700 or so that the current closest ICE detention center to Dallas, the Prairieland Detention Center near Alvarado, reportedly holds.

The plans call for the renovated warehouses to have restroom and shower facilities, as well as medical units, recreational facilities, kitchens and housing for families that are detained together. But the fact that the government wants to place so many detainees together in an effort to deport as many as possible as quickly as possible leaves some advocates less than impressed with the proposed blueprints.

Tania Wolf, an advocate with the National Immigration Project who is based in New Orleans, near another proposed new detention center, told the Post. “It’s dehumanizing. You’re treating people, for lack of a better term, like cattle.”

The promise to begin mass deportations as soon as possible was arguably Trump’s most controversial pledge following his 2024 election victory. As of December 14, more than 68,400 people are in ICE custody, a record high.

Contrary to early statements from Trump and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who often declared that only the “worst of the worst” undocumented criminals would be detained and deported, many non-criminal immigrants have been held. According to recent reports, more than 75,000 of the people detained by ICE in the first nine months of 2025, at least a third of all ICE arrests during that time, did not have criminal records.

On Monday, the Observer reported from a press conference where the family of Maher Tarabishi, a Palestinian man living in North Texas detained by ICE in October, pleaded for his release. Tarbishi is being held at the Bluebonnett Detention Center north of Abilene, has no criminal record and is the primary caregiver for his son, Wael, who suffers from a rare neurological disorder that has caused him to be hospitalized twice since his father was arrested. Tarabishi is but the latest example of a North Texas resident being held by ICE who would likely not have been a candidate for deportation under previous administrations.

At this point, the plans for new dentinon facilities are in their early stages, and the Post article notes that the draft isn’t final and could change. The Department of Homeland Security declined to answer questions about the proposed plan and did not confirm any of the paper’s findings.

Texas, as Trump-friendly a state as there is, thanks to the enthusiastic support of Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, is the only state with more than one of the proposed new detention sites. Baytown, outside of Houston, is listed in the draft solicitation as the second Texas warehouse site. San Antonio, along with El Paso and Los Fresnos, in the Rio Grande Valley, are noted as possible sites for new ICE processing centers, where detainees would go through before being “funnelled” to the larger detention facilities. These new processing facilities would act in a similar fashion to the Dallas ICE field office on Stemmons Freeway, the site of the September shooting that saw a gunman kill two detainees and injure another from the top of a nearby office building.",https://www.dallasobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/Immigrations_ICE_Detention_AdobeStock-e1767134725582.jpeg,N,,2025-12-31 16:58:07.639072

""Enough is enough. My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies.

Both bills had bipartisan support.

“President Trump’s first veto of his second term blocks a bipartisan bill that both the House and Senate passed unanimously, costs taxpayers nothing, and delivers safe, reliable water to rural communities that overwhelmingly supported him,"" Colorado senators said ina joint statement.

Trump said the new law would not allow for any new construction spending on the pipeline project, but only fix the terms of repaying the cost, sparking a debate about the federal government's role in funding infrastructure projects.

While explaining the veto for the tribal lands bill, Trump wrote the tribe was ""actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.""

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo, backed the Arkansas Valley Conduit bill. Although Trump did not refer to her in the rejection, Boebert suggested the reason for the veto was ""political retaliation.""

Mr. Trump vetoed the two bills on Monday, the White House announced on X, after they were sent to his desk earlier this month. The bills had backers in both parties, and they passed the House and Senate through voice votes. Both houses of Congress would need to pass the bills again by a two-thirds margin to override the president's veto.

It's fairly rare for the president to exercise his veto power, especially when the president's party controls Congress. Mr. Trump vetoed 10 bills in his first term, all during his last two years in office, and former President Joe Biden used the veto power 13 times while in office.

Trump vetoes Everglades bill over immigration dispute

One of the bills — the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act — would have added a small village called the Osceola Camp to a section of the Florida Everglades that the Miccosukee Native American Tribe has control over. It would also require the Department of the Interior to take action to protect structures in the village from flooding.

The bill was backed by Florida Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody, and by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez and Democratic Rep. Darren Soto. Shortly before it passed the House in July, Gimenez said the bill was ""about fairness and conservation.""

""It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, land and their way of life,"" Gimenez said in a speech on the House floor.

But in a message to Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the project benefits ""special interests"" — and accused the tribe of not cooperating with his immigration policies.

He wrote that ""despite seeking funding and special treatment from the Federal Government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.""

Earlier this year, the tribe joined a lawsuit challenging an immigration detention center in the Everglades that state and federal officials refer to as ""Alligator Alcatraz."" The tribe has argued the facility could hurt the surrounding environment, impacting the tribe's ability to hunt and hold ceremonies on the land.

The president also argued that the Osceola Camp was originally created without authorization, writing, ""it is not the Federal Government's responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.""

The tribe said in a statement it was ""disappointed"" by the veto, arguing the bill ""was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests.""

""We have never sought to obstruct the President's immigration agenda,"" Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress said. ""Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments.""

Soto said: ""Trump's veto appears to be revenge for the Miccosukee Tribe's valid opposition to the atrocious 'Alligator Alcatraz.' It's sad, petty, and a violation of tribal sovereignty.""

Trump vetoes Colorado water bill — local lawmakers call it ""revenge""

The other piece of legislation that faced a presidential veto this week was the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. That bill was aimed at completing a long-planned water pipeline that could serve some 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.

The pipeline was first proposed during President John F. Kennedy's administration, part of a series of water projects in Colorado. But it was never built, in part because federal law required local communities to pay for it, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A 2009 law changed the funding breakdown and allowed local governments to pick up only 35% of the tab. The bill that was passed this year would have reduced those local entities' interest payments and given them more time to repay the costs.

Mr. Trump said he vetoed the bill as part of a broader push to cut ""taxpayer handouts."" He pointed to the pipeline's expected price tag — the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimated in 2023 it would cost about $1.4 billion, double the projected price seven years earlier.

The president argued the legislation ""would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project.""

The bill was backed by the state's two Democratic senators and by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jeff Hurd, whose districts include areas that would be served by the pipeline.

Boebert told CBS News in a statement the veto was ""very disappointing,"" writing: ""This fight is not over.""

Boebert castigated the veto in a separate statement to local reporter Kyle Clark, calling the bill ""completely non-controversial"" and saying she hopes Mr. Trump's veto ""has nothing to do with political retaliation.""

""I must have missed the rally where he stood in Colorado and promised to personally derail critical water infrastructure projects,"" Boebert wrote. ""My bad, I thought the campaign was about lowering costs and cutting red tape.""

Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado also strongly criticized the president's decision, writing on X: ""Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water.""

Fellow Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet accused the president of seeking ""revenge.""

Financing modifications proposed for a water pipeline in Colorado The other bill vetoed by Trump would have helped rural residents pay for their share of a long-planned water pipeline project, called the Arkansas Valley Conduit.","For the first time in his second term, President Donald Trump has used his veto power, rejecting two bills that would have expanded tribal control to more of the Florida Everglades and helped Colorado residents pay their share of a water pipeline project.

Both bills had bipartisan support when passed by Congress earlier this year. To override Trump’s veto, a two-thirds majority would need to vote for each measure in both the Senate and House of Representatives.

Trump rejected 10 bills in his first term in the Oval Office –– with Congress overriding only his veto of a defense policy bill in January 2021. Former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama vetoed 13 and 12 bills, respectively.

Bill to expand land reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe

In rejecting the Florida bill, Trump cited actions by the Miccosukee Tribe to try “to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”

The tribe signed on as plaintiffs to one of three federal lawsuits against the Trump administration over the immigration detention facility constructed earlier this year in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The facility had been slated to close its doors earlier this year, but a federal appeals court put that order on hold in September, pending an appeal.

The bill vetoed by Trump would have incorporated the Osceola Camp — an inhabited tribal village in the Everglades — into the Miccosukee Reserved Area, controlled by the Native American tribe. The measure would have also required the Interior Department to consult with the Miccosukee Tribe on the best ways to protect structures from flooding.

One of the bill’s bipartisan sponsors — Republican Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez of Florida — said the measure was “about fairness and conservation” during a speech on the House floor in July.

“It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, their land and their way of life,” he said at the time.

Requests for comment made Wednesday by Spectrum News to attorneys listed in federal court records as representing the Miccosukee Tribe — as well as to Gimenez’s office — were not immediately returned.

Trump contended in his veto that the Osceola Camp was built “without authorization, in a low area that was raised with fill material” and that the cost to repair and replace infrastructure could be as much as $14 million.

The president wrote that “it is not the Federal Government’s responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.

Financing modifications proposed for a water pipeline in Colorado

The other bill vetoed by Trump would have helped rural residents pay for their share of a long-planned water pipeline project, called the Arkansas Valley Conduit.

The bill sought to lengthen the repayment timeline and to reduce interest payments the communities of the Arkansas River Valley must make to the Bureau of Reclamation for the pipeline’s construction.

First approved by former President John F. Kennedy in 1962, the project would provide an estimated 7,500 acre-feet of water per year to as many as 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.

“Currently, many people in these areas rely on groundwater supplies that may contain naturally occurring radionuclides such as radium and uranium,” the Bureau of Reclamation says on a webpage about the plan.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., criticized Trump’s veto on social media, writing, “This isn’t governing. It’s a revenge tour.”

Bennet has previously accused the president of retaliating against the state over the incarceration of former election clerk Tina Peters, who is serving a nine-year sentence for her role in a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., also chimed in Tuesday night on X, writing, “This isn’t over.”

The Colorado lawmaker shared another post, noting that she was among a handful of Republicans to sign a discharge petition forcing a vote in the House to require the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

After reversing course on his opposition, Trump ultimately signed the bill into law, and records have been made public in batches since Dec. 19 –– though several media outlets recently reported the Justice Department has more than 5.2 million more documents to review.

When asked for comment about Bennet's and Boebert’s remarks, the White House referred to Trump's message to Congress.

In those remarks, the president said that the water pipeline project had been delayed for decades because it is “economically unviable” and that he blocked the bill to save taxpayers money.

“Enough is enough,” Trump wrote about his decision. “My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Trump_AP_25363767852117_NAT_1231,N,,2025-12-31 15:56:42.580492

The plan even names specific platforms, like Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Substack, and Rumble, a popular ""alt-tech"" video platform frequented by conservatives.

Recruitment advertisements under this plan would specifically target users whose devices ping near military bases, NASCAR races, UFC fights, college campuses, or gun and trade shows, as well as listeners of ""patriotic"" podcasts, country music, fitness, and true crime. A significant portion of the strategy hinges on getting influencers, commentators, and live streamers on board to boost ICE's message, with $8 million allocated to a new influencer program, Washington Post reported. Online creators accepted into the program would receive around $1,500 for joining.

While analysis shows the agency has yet to reach its $100 million advertising goal, many have already noticed the aggressive push into online and entertainment spaces, including television and streaming ads, social media campaigns, and celebrity endorsements. In October, many Spotify users boycotted the app for hosting ICE recruitment slogans, as well as CEO Daniel Ek's financial ties to companies developing AI technology for the military.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Post that the agency was “thrilled"" about coverage of the ""wildly successful ICE recruitment campaign, which is under budget and ahead of schedule.” She did not dispute the information presented in the document.

Officials and citizens have raised alarm bells over ICE's traditional advertising methods, too, including public campaigns and propaganda efforts that many say are stoking unnecessary fear within communities.

Under the Trump administration, federal immigration officials have pivoted to extreme, high-risk tactics to meet deportation aims set by the president, including periodically violent operations in areas far from the border. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino has said the unprecedented actions of ICE agents are a new ""turn and burn"" strategy that sees agents deploying tactics normally reserved for major offenders on families and individuals who haven't been suspected of violent offenses.

ICE is reportedly set to sign on tens of thousands of new agents in the coming months as a result of its ""surge hiring marketing strategy,"" incentivized by major signing bonuses and inflated salaries allocated from Trump's Big Beautiful Bill. The agency has also reduced requirements for new hires. DHS reported that it received over 200,000 job applications in the last five months alone, with McLaughlin stating the vast majority are former law enforcement.

Former officials say the scale of raids and countrywide recruitment is unlike anything the country has seen before, according to a report in the Idaho Statesman.",https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01gVH0Roh7NuamyNHcd37sd/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1767205631.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 15:56:56.319828

As allegations of civil rights violations increased, so have the numbers of habeas corpus petitions filed in U.S. District Court Massachusetts.","Since President Donald Trump began his second term in office, New Bedford’s immigrant community has been transformed.

The first nine months of mass deportations were marked by sudden and violent raids that drew national and international attention. Over time, enforcement became more targeted, moving largely out of public view.

Federal authorities have arrested at least 60 immigrants living or working in the New Bedford area. The Light has confirmed the apprehension of 53 through local sources, court records, and area and federal law enforcement. Some were detained during large-scale actions. Others were arrested individually, or at check-ins for immigration appointments.

Of those individuals, nine have been confirmed released. Some are awaiting decisions in immigration court, while others were released under supervision. Twelve detainees have since been deported from the United States.

Violent raids

People felt the mass deportation campaign before it hit New Bedford. Shortly after the 2024 election, advocates, lawyers, and some public officials urged their community to brace for impact. Businesses on Acushnet Avenue began to feel the pinch before the first street arrest happened.

U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s hammer fell upon New Bedford on March 11, when agents descended on the Minit-Man Car Wash and detained three Guatemalan men.

On March 21, ICE agents detained two Guatemalan men when they used a battering ram to enter their home on Viall Street. Teenagers present at the home said agents did not present warrants for entry. The raid left a 19-year old as household head. The action spurred 200 residents to demonstrate outside City Hall.

On April 14, Marilú Domingo Ortiz used her cellphone to record a federal agent as he smashed the car window when agents arrested her husband, Juan Francisco Méndez. The tape led to an international outcry and prompted declamation from U.S. Rep. Bill Keating. After more than two months in detention, ICE released Méndez on bond.

Dramatic street raids continued. Operation Patriot in May and Operation Patriot 2.0 arrested thousands of immigrants statewide, largely with no criminal convictions. In New Bedford, the vast majority of immigrants detained had no violent criminal convictions.

The overwhelming majority of those detained locally have been Indigenous men from Guatemala. The gender disparities led some advocates to speculate that it may point to a strategy of removing breadwinners to pressure their families to leave.

On June 8, ICE detained Emerson Garcia DosSantos as he drove his car in Fall River, leaving his U.S. citizen wife, Erika Hartman DosSantos, to fight brain cancer alone. DHS later deported Garcia DosSantos to his native Brazil. The couple is arranging for Hartman DosSantos to relocate to Brazil.

In the coming months, tactics evolved. The last confirmed street operation took place in Fairhaven on Sept. 19, when agents took three Guatemalan men into custody. Among them was Luís David Ajtzac Osório, an 18-year old with special immigrant juvenile status and a legal work permit.

Tactics have moved beyond street arrests. In July, Market Basket told 47 workers to leave their New Bedford store unless they could show proof of legal work authorization.

That demonstrated New Bedford’s economic dependence on immigrants as fear pushed people to leave their jobs, and often enough, the area. After months of terror, some businesses along Acushnet Avenue reported drops in sales as high as 50%.

The number of immigrant students enrolled in New Bedford Public Schools also dropped by 6% from last year, and a further 13% since September.

Bishop Edgar Moreira da Cunha, the prelate of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River, leads New Bedford’s large Catholic community. He spoke with The Light on the impact of ICE raids on church attendance.

“The United States is shooting themselves in the foot because they are doing harm to themselves by the things that they are doing,” da Cunha told The Light.

From the streets to the courts

ICE agents’ presence on the streets of New Bedford shrank significantly by the fall as federal operations shifted to other parts of the country. In Massachusetts, while street arrests have continued, ICE’s gaze fell upon district courts and immigration check-ins at the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program office in Framingham, or for check-ins at the ICE Field Office in Burlington.

Data collected by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by The Light show that over 400 arrests in Massachusetts from January to mid-October 2025 occurred across 44 courts statewide.

In Bristol County, emails obtained by The Light show routine exchanges between the sheriff’s office and ICE, including booking logs, court dates, and release times. At the Dartmouth House of Correction, jail officials often coordinated directly with ICE, sharing information that has helped facilitate immigration arrests.

However, sheriffs are limited in how much they can assist ICE, even when detainers are issued. A 2017 ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court bars sheriffs from holding someone solely on an ICE detainer once they are cleared for release, a ruling that has led to friction with federal agents.

That tension culminated in May, when the Department of Homeland Security published a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions,” accusing them of obstructing immigration enforcement. Nearly every county in Massachusetts appeared on the list, a move the president of the National Sheriffs’ Association, Kieran Donahue, criticized as arbitrary and damaging to cooperation between law enforcement and the White House.

In April, Mayor Jon Mitchell criticized ICE over a lack of transparency around Méndez’s arrest.

Communication has been inconsistent with the New Bedford Police Department as well, Police Chief Jason Thody told The Light in October. Most of the time, he said, officers learn of immigration arrests through news reports or social media.

In response to increased immigration enforcement activity and “some community pushback,” Thody issued interim guidance outlining how officers should interact with ICE when agents conduct operations in the city.

Legal developments

Enforcement continues to reflect massive changes in policy. And it has rippled into the court systems, where advocates and lawyers say many of those policies violate civil and due process rights.

Many complaints revolve around the speed at which those detained are processed and transferred outside Massachusetts. ICE detained Pascual Cuin González, a Guatemalan asylee in New Bedford, on Sept. 12, alongside his partner, Manuela Morales González.

Over the next week, authorities transferred him between Burlington and detention facilities in New York and Louisiana before agents released him to find his way back to New Bedford.

The use of Hanscom Air Force base to swiftly fly detainees out of Massachusetts prompted a letter from Gov. Maura Healey on Dec. 15 protesting the flights from the base.

“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed,” Healey said.

As fears of ICE permeate communities, nonprofits across the state have noticed a sizable increase in the number of residents applying for U.S. citizenship.

But many others seeking legal status, including Ajtzac Osório, the New Bedford teenager from the Fairhaven raid, have been de-documented despite following legal processes. The same day Ajtzac Osório was arrested, U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services removed his deferred action and later terminated his work permit.

As allegations of civil rights violations increased, so have the numbers of habeas corpus petitions filed in U.S. District Court Massachusetts. As of Dec. 29, there had been 629 habeas petitions filed in the court, 432 of which remained active. The number of habeas petitions filed continued to rise after multiple Board of Immigration Appeals decisions and an ICE policy change in July resulted in blanket bond hearing denials.

That happened to Yury Melissa Aguiriano Romero, a Honduran asylum seeker and the first confirmed female detainee from New Bedford. An immigration judge denied her a bond hearing at the behest of DHS. That judge later granted her release on bond only after a U.S. District Court judge ordered a bond hearing.

In December, U.S. District Court Judge Patti Saris declared that DHS had misclassified many detainees in order to deny their right to a bond hearing. She ordered DHS to allow for bond hearings to notify all current and future detainees within the jurisdiction of U.S. District Court Massachusetts and the Boston and Chelmsford immigration courts of that right in an appropriate language.

The rapidly shifting environment has taxed immigration lawyers, who find themselves overwhelmed with policy changes and people seeking legal representation.

The Massachusetts hub

The ICE Field Office in Burlington, where many are processed after arrest, has become a focal point of discussion over detention conditions. Stories of harsh treatment and possible civil and human rights violations have led to weekly protests outside the building and visits from federal lawmakers.

In August, The Light collected testimonies from immigrants in the Greater New Bedford area who had spent time in Burlington and, in some cases, other ICE facilities out of state. They described being kept in rooms with no windows for most of the day, receiving little food and water, and sometimes going days without bathing.

Others said their experiences in jails in New England, where immigrants were held with the general inmate population, felt more humane than ICE-run facilities.

Andrés De León Castro, arrested in Fairhaven in May and deported to Guatemala on July 12, said agents at Burlington told detainees they were not allowed to talk or move and left them in a freezing room without food or water.

“When we complained, they told us that’s what we deserved.”

Conditions inside the facility drew public attention after the release of Marcelo Gomes da Silva, a Milford High School student detained in May and held there for six days. His detention prompted a visit on June 5 by the U.S. Reps. Jake Auchincloss and Seth Moulton.

After his second visit in November, Moulton said at a news conference outside the facility that he saw fewer detainees than during his earlier visit, but that access to blankets remained a concern.

“It seems that they are moving people through here more quickly,” said Moulton. “The consequence of that is that they don’t have as much time to have lawyers intervene in their cases.”",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ice-arrest-screenshot.png,N,,2025-12-31 14:58:05.315601

Gavin Newsom.

In a filing Tuesday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Justice Department lawyers withdrew their request to maintain authority over roughly 300 Guard members still deployed in Los Angeles. The move comes after the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. Illinois, which undercut the administration’s argument for using state troops in domestic law enforcement.

Federal lawyers said they “do not oppose lifting of the partial administrative stay,” clearing the way for California to regain command.

“This admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,” Newsom posted on X. He added that he expects the court to affirm California’s authority over its Guard.

The legal battle between Trump, California explained

The fight began in June when Trump federalized 4,000 California Guard troops and sent U.S. Marines to Los Angeles after immigration raids sparked protests. Newsom called the move “a serious breach of state sovereignty” and warned it would inflame tensions.

Those tensions boiled over downtown, where demonstrators clashed with police and federal agents after raids in Paramount and Compton. Union leader David Huerta was arrested during one protest, fueling outrage among immigration advocates.

California sued, arguing Trump’s order violated constitutional limits. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer agreed, ruling the president’s theory of indefinite control “would upend the constitutional balance between state and federal power.” He ordered the troops returned to Newsom.

The administration appealed, but after the Supreme Court ruling, even conservative judges have questioned Trump’s stance.

Attorney General Rob Bonta called Tuesday’s filing “a good day for our democracy,” adding: “The President is not king.”

What’s next in the California National Guard case

The 9th Circuit is expected to lift the stay soon. Meanwhile, Congress is probing the broader use of military forces in civilian settings, raising civil liberties concerns.

For now, California appears poised to win back full control of its Guard — and score a symbolic victory in its long-running clash with Trump over immigration enforcement and state sovereignty.

Timeline: Key moments in the National Guard fight

December 31, 2025

HRRC is deeply alarmed by the documented rise in the detention and physical assault of journalists in the United States, as outlined in the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s latest report. The routine detention of journalists signals a dangerous erosion of press freedom and a troubling shift in how authorities engage with independent media. HRRC calls on federal, state, and local authorities to immediately reaffirm and enforce protections for journalists, ensure accountability for abuses, and guarantee that members of the press can report freely and safely without fear of retaliation.

As press freedom is under increasing threat through legal and financial attacks in the United States, physical detention and assaults on journalists have also increased, according to a new report by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.

In 2025, at least 32 instances of journalists being detained by law enforcement while reporting were documented, in what the Freedom of the Press Foundation says represents a fundamental shift in authorities’ relationship with the press.

Nearly 90% of detentions took place during protests, the vast majority of which occurred during protests against efforts by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest and deport “undocumented” immigrants. According to the report, documented instances involved journalists being detained for multiple hours at a time, sometimes while painfully handcuffed.

Though most instances involved journalists being released without charges, the detentions themselves deprived journalists of their crucial role to document and record potential abuses by law enforcement during protests.

“We know this chills their rights,” said Adam Rose, Chair of the Press Rights Committee for the LA Press Club and Deputy Director of Advocacy for Freedom of the Press Foundation, “but it also ends their shift.”

Assaults on journalists have also spiked in tandem with arrests, with nearly as many reported assaults on journalists recorded as in the previous three years combined. Half of those detained report being assaulted by officers in the lead-up to or process of being detained, including being violently forced to the ground and beaten by batons.

According to the Foundation, while covering immigration protests remains the riskiest beat for journalists’ safety and freedom, journalists have also been detained for routine news gathering, such as while covering city council meetings. The arrests represent a pattern of authorities “either poorly understanding the elements of routine newsgathering or purposefully using prosecutions to chill future reporting,” the report said.

This year, press freedom in the United States has fallen to a record low, according to Reporters Without Borders’ Press Freedom Tracker, classified as in a “difficult situation” for the first time in the tracker’s history. In addition to physical attacks on journalists, economic factors – which force news organizations to choose between editorial independence and financial sustainability – were considered the greatest challenge.

Just prior to his Kennedy Center appointment, Grenell served as the president’s envoy for special missions, and was involved in securing the release of Americans detained in Venezuela.
“Clearly the intent of the charter provisions was to entrust Kennedy Center guidance to a broad group, not just those appointed by the president,” she said.
The disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards.
The Guardian has contacted the Kennedy Center for comment.","The Kennedy Center reportedly adopted bylaws earlier this year that would limit voting to Donald Trump-appointed trustees – a controversial move that appears to reveal the long-held plan to install Trump’s name to the center.

The bylaws, in a possible breach of the institution’s charter, were revised in May and specified that board members appointed by Congress, known as ex-officio members, could not vote or count towards a quorum, according to the Washington Post.

The new rule was in force when the board voted unanimously on 18 December to add Trump’s name to the center, rebranding the building as the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.

The name change has since triggered a wave of protests. Artists have cancelled bookings and members of Congress have vowed to overturn the name change. Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, is even suing to reverse it on the grounds that changing the center’s name requires an act of Congress.

Trump took over as chair of the board in February, quickly purging sitting members, while installing his supporters – including his longtime foreign policy adviser Ric Grenell, whom he appointed as president of the center. Grenell had been a vocal tribune of Trump’s “America First” ideology, and was not afraid to ruffle feathers during past spells as ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence (he was the first openly gay person to lead the intelligence community).

Just prior to his Kennedy Center appointment, Grenell served as the president’s envoy for special missions, and was involved in securing the release of Americans detained in Venezuela.

The center lists 34 presidentially appointed board members and 23 ex-officio members, who by law must include the mayor of Washington DC, head of the library of Congress, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. The federal law underpinning the center’s establishment identified ex-officio members as among the venue’s trustees, charged with maintaining it as a memorial to President John F Kennedy, the Post reported.

Roma Daravi, the center’s vice-president for public relations, told the Post that the rules had been changed in line with longstanding convention that ex-officio members did not vote: “The bylaws were revised to reflect this longstanding precedent and everyone received the technical changes both before the meeting and after revisions.”

Daravi continued: “Some members (including ex officio) attended in person, others by phone, and no concerns were voiced, no one objected, and the bylaws passed unanimously.”

Ellen Aprill, a legal scholar at UCLA, told the paper that such voting right limits breached the center’s charter.

“Clearly the intent of the charter provisions was to entrust Kennedy Center guidance to a broad group, not just those appointed by the president,” she said.

The disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards. A record low audience of 3.01m watched this year’s broadcast of the annual honors awards – hosted by Trump himself – when it was screened by CBS, marking a stark 25% downturn from last year. The event included appearances from some of Trump’s favorite artists, including Gloria Gaynor, Kiss and George Strait.

As artists cancel bookings, Trump on social media on Tuesday posted a string of statements from supporters criticizing the Kennedy family’s supposed lack of support for the center. His posts on his Truth Social network started mere hours after the Kennedy family announced the death of Tatiana Schlossberg, JFK’s granddaughter, who died aged 35, from leukemia.

In a statement, Walz’s office expressed openness to appearing before Comer’s committee while attacking the committee and President Donald Trump, who has led the attacks on the Minnesota governor and the state’s Somali population.

“We’re always happy to work with Congress, though this committee has a track record of holding circus hearings that have nothing to do with the issue at hand,” the office said. “While the Governor has been working to ensure fraudsters go to prison, the President has been selling pardons to let them out.”

The statement did not definitively indicate whether Walz would voluntarily appear before Congress.

The president and his allies have used the fraud investigations to attack Walz, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee whom he’s seeking to unseat in the midterms, and disparage Somali immigrants in the state.

Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage” at a White House event in early December. On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services froze hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for Minnesota’s child care programs, the latest in a string of actions the administration has taken against Minnesota in response to the fraud scandals.

In a social media post Wednesday, Trump again railed on Somali immigrants and insisted the U.S. “send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration is seeking to revoke the citizenship status of U.S. citizens of Somali descent who were charged with benefits fraud, while acknowledging that action may be rebuffed by the courts.

“It’s something the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State is currently looking at right now,” Leavitt said in a Fox News interview Wednesday morning. “We know that there are liberal activist judges across this country who will try to block and tackle this administration from pursuing justice at every turn. But that’s not gonna stop the president and his entire cabinet by acting on behalf of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens in the state of Minnesota and in states across the country who have been ripped off by people who have abused our immigration system.”

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in President Trump's first year back in office, an estimated 1.9 million people are self deporting versus more than 622,000 deportations. She is attributing it to the administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants.

In total, 2.5 million migrants have been deported.

For the holidays extending to Dec. 31, $3,000 was offered to immigrants who are in the country illegally through the CBP home app. Normally, $1,000 is offered. According to DHS's website, that money is an exit bonus, and the self-deportation also includes free travel to their home country or country where they have lawful status.

DHS will give migrants time to wrap up work, school and other personal matters before they self-deport.

It is unclear if the incentives are contributing to the self-deportation numbers or if it's mainly fear of migrants getting detained by ICE.

FOX 17 News is working to find out how many self-deportations have occurred in Tennessee. We are also looking to speak to migrants or activists who can speak on the self-deportations.

The angst from that community has been deportations include people whose only crime is crossing the border illegally, which they say is not basis for deportation. Deportations have also caused family separations.

In it, Mr. Singh made clear that charging Mr. Abrego Garcia was “a top priority” for Mr. Blanche’s office.","In messages to Congress released Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he blocked the bills to save taxpayers’ money. But the president has grievances against the Miccosukee Tribe and the state of Colorado, leading lawmakers to accuse Mr. Trump of blocking the bills because of political disagreements. Throughout his second term, Mr. Trump has carried out a campaign of retribution against political opponents, law firms, universities and specific individuals.

In Florida, Mr. Trump suggested the veto of the bill to expand Miccosukee Tribe land was tied to its opposition to his immigration agenda. The Miccosukee Tribe joined a lawsuit earlier this year to block the administration from constructing an immigrant detention center in the Everglades nicknamed Alligator Alcatraz. And in Colorado, Mr. Trump has attacked the state’s leaders over the imprisonment of a former state election official, Tina Peters, for interfering with the 2020 presidential election.

“Despite seeking funding and special treatment from the federal government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected,” Mr. Trump wrote in a message to Congress. “My administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my administration’s policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.”

Both pieces of legislation passed by voice vote in Congress, indicating strong bipartisan support and suggesting lawmakers may try to override the president’s vetoes, which requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers. In Mr. Trump’s first term, he vetoed 10 pieces of legislation, one of which — the 2021 military policy bill — was overturned.

The Colorado legislation, which was sponsored by Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, would help local communities pay for the Arkansas Valley Conduit water pipeline.

“Enough is enough,” Mr. Trump wrote in a message to Congress. “My administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies.”

Ms. Boebert slammed the president’s veto, arguing he was “denying clean drinking water for 50,000 people in Southeast Colorado.”

“I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability,” she said in a statement.

Ms. Boebert was a vocal supporter of releasing the Epstein files, drawing backlash from the White House, and the president has attacked Colorado’s leaders in recent weeks over Ms. Peters. She was found guilty of interfering with voting machines in an effort to prove falsehoods that they had been used to rig the 2020 election against Mr. Trump. The president has pledged to pardon Ms. Peters, even though she was convicted in state court and Colorado officials argue he had no power to do so.

“This isn’t governing,” Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat of Colorado, wrote on X about the president’s veto. “It’s a revenge tour.”

The Trump administration first imposed a travel ban on 12 countries in June. After an Afghan national was arrested in the shooting of two National Guard troops in Washington over the Thanksgiving weekend, Mr. Trump vowed to extend the restrictions to more countries. This month, he expanded the ban to 19 countries, including Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, taking the total number of affected African states to 12.

Mali’s foreign ministry said it rejected the Trump administration’s argument that the action was taken because of security concerns and said the United State had made its decision without consulting Mali.

Several African countries that have adopted a more conciliatory approach and conceded to the demands to accept deportees from the United States have received exemptions from such travel bans. Weeks after Liberia agreed to receive Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March, the Trump administration extended visas for Liberians visiting the United States to 36 months from 12 months.

Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso are run my military juntas after coups in recent years. The military leaders of the countries had all largely severed ties with Washington and developed closer relations with Russia and China, as well as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. They have also left the Economic Community of West African States, a regional alliance, and formed their own bloc.

“While this is likely to further constrain relations, it will also displace Washington’s influence,” said Beverly Ochieng, an analyst at Control Risk, a risk management group.

Since Mr. Trump was re-elected, he has sought to reshape American relations with Africa. While there have been pockets of continued engagement, such as efforts to end the war in Congo, analysts said the president has leaned heavily toward withdrawing from the continent.

Mr. Trump’s decision to slash foreign aid spending was deeply felt in Africa, which was the biggest recipient of U.S. assistance. A large number of the U.S. diplomats who were withdrawn from service this month were believed to have been posted in Africa.

Despite the American pullback, the strategic importance of countries in the Sahel region, a stretch of land that refers to countries south of the Sahara, could mean they are able to rebuild relations with Washington.

The Sahel, especially Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, account for more than half the world’s terrorism related deaths, according to the United Nations. The United States has advised its citizens not to travel to three countries because of the threat of terrorism, crime and kidnapping.

“Some of the closest partners of the Sahel countries — despite unmatched military or financial resources as the U.S. — continue to position themselves in a way that will likely grant them favorable access in strategic areas, including defense, mining and energy,” Ms. Ochieng said.

Congress required the Justice Department to release its files related to the investigations of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by Dec. 19. The department released about 100,000 pages on that date, and said in the days that followed that at least a million more documents still needed to be reviewed.

Since late November, the department has assigned nearly 200 lawyers from the national security division to review the documents and remove any information about victims, or anything that would compromise continuing investigations or national security. Now, Justice Department officials have told employees that they need more help to accomplish the task.

The document review is expected to take until at least Jan. 20, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Trump administration had already drawn the ire of Democrats and a few Republicans in Congress for appearing to break the law setting the deadline to release the documents.

The Justice Department has defended its handling of the matter. “We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,” the department said on social media.

But the disclosure that only a fraction of the documents have been released has only added to the troubles surrounding the rollout of the material. After the initial release on Dec. 19, some photographs were removed from the online collection because of what the department described as concerns about them possibly containing information about victims.

One image showed a credenza with an open drawer containing other photos, including at least one of Mr. Trump. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said the image was removed not to protect the president but because of concerns about whether that image contained any victims. The image was later restored to the collection.

More than a dozen schemes have come to light in Minnesota in recent years, many of them involving people of Somali origin. Prosecutors say the schemes have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The scandal has rattled Minnesota politics and drawn the ire of the White House.

On Friday, a conservative active on social media, Nick Shirley, posted a video purporting to uncover rampant fraud in day care centers run by people of Somali origin. While day care centers in Minnesota have been prosecuted for overbilling in the past, none of the centers featured in the video have been accused of fraud by the authorities. Nevertheless, the video drew accolades from several senior White House officials.

Jim O’Neill, the deputy health secretary, said in a video statement on Tuesday that the department was pausing the funding in response to “credible allegations” of “extensive fraud” in Minnesota’s child care programs. Mr. O’Neill said he had sent a letter to the state’s governor, Tim Walz, a Democrat, demanding a thorough audit of the state’s day care centers.

In a statement, Mr. Walz’s office said the governor had been combating fraud “for years.”

“Fraud is a serious issue,” said the statement. “But this is a transparent attempt to politicize the issue to hurt Minnesotans and defund government programs that help people.”

Alex J. Adams, an assistant health secretary, joined Mr. O’Neill in the video statement and said that he had spoken on Monday with Cindi Yang, Minnesota’s child care services director, who had been unable to tell him whether fraud in the state’s social services system was isolated or widespread.

Carissa Larsen, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families, which oversees government-subsidized day care centers, said on Tuesday evening that agency officials were aware of the announcement but were not in a position to comment.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Walz applauded new federal charges in a widening, yearslong federal investigation into his state’s social services programs and promised that state officials were working to overhaul the troubled system. But Mr. Walz has been facing criticism from President Trump and Minnesota Republicans, who charge that the state lacked adequate safeguards.

Mr. Walz, who is seeking re-election, wrote in an opinion piece in The Minnesota Star Tribune this month that his state had made “significant progress” in rooting out fraud in its social services system but had “much more to do.”

“And it’s my responsibility to fix it,” he wrote.

More than 90 people have been charged in federal fraud investigations in Minnesota, which began during the Biden administration, and at least 60 have been convicted. In announcing charges against six more people accused of defrauding safety net programs, Joseph H. Thompson, the prosecutor overseeing the investigation, said this month that the authorities had identified “staggering, industrial-scale fraud” in Minnesota’s safety-net programs.

The schemes, which took root in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali community, targeted government programs meant to feed children during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help children with autism and to assist people at risk of homelessness. The authorities say that fraudsters billed the state government for social services that were never provided.

Mr. Trump has seized on the scandal, using it to unleash xenophobic tirades against America’s Somali community.

Mr. O’Neill said in his video statement that the health department had also taken steps to secure the national Administration for Children and Families system, requiring that future payments around the country would need to be certified with a receipt or photo evidence. The department also created a new hotline for reports of fraud, he added.

“We’re committed to holding bad actors accountable,” Mr. O’Neill said in the video. “Regardless of rank or office, anyone who’s involved in perpetrating this fraud against the American people should expect to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

The emails, which were made public as part of a newly unsealed judicial order, largely reflected communications about the case that Robert E. McGuire, the acting U.S. attorney in Nashville, had with members of his staff and with Aakash Singh, a top official in Mr. Blanche’s office. They raised serious questions about whether the Justice Department had misled Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr., who is overseeing the case, by telling him that local prosecutors had acted alone in charging Mr. Abrego Garcia.

“These documents show that McGuire did not act alone and to the extent McGuire had input on the decision to prosecute, he shared it with Singh and others,” Judge Crenshaw wrote in the unsealed order. “Specifically, the government’s documents may contradict its prior representations that the decision to prosecute was made locally and that there were no outside influences.”

One of the emails, dated April 30, was written by Mr. Singh to Mr. McGuire and another prosecutor, Jacob Warren, as the government was building its criminal case against Mr. Abrego Garcia, who at the time was still in custody in El Salvador.

In it, Mr. Singh made clear that charging Mr. Abrego Garcia was “a top priority” for Mr. Blanche’s office. In response, Mr. McGuire wrote, “We want the high command looped in.”

A little more than two weeks later, Mr. McGuire wrote to his staff that while the ultimate decision about whether to bring charges was his own, he had heard that Mr. Blanche and his chief deputy at the time, Emil Bove III, were pushing for charges to be filed. In the email, Mr. McGuire referred to Mr. Blanche as the “DAG” — or deputy attorney general — and to Mr. Bove as the “PDAG” — or principal deputy attorney general. He also mentioned the “ODAG” — or the office of the deputy attorney general.

“I have not received specific direction from ODAG other than I have heard anecdotally that the DAG and PDAG would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” Mr. McGuire wrote.

Judge Crenshaw’s order was only the latest in an ever-growing series of rebukes dealt to the Justice Department as it has pursued parallel efforts to both prosecute Mr. Abrego Garcia and expel him from the country again.

Three weeks ago, a federal judge in Maryland released him from immigration custody in a scathing order that accused the Justice Department of egregious conduct that included stonewalling her, disobeying her direct instructions and even “affirmatively” misleading her about its plans to re-deport Mr. Abrego Garcia.

The judge in that case, Paula Xinis, has temporarily barred the Justice Department from taking Mr. Abrego Garcia back into custody. But on Tuesday evening, department lawyers said they would rearrest him if they were able to overcome her provisional order stopping them from doing so.

Judge Crenshaw’s order containing the excerpted emails was originally issued under seal on Dec. 3, when he instructed prosecutors to hand over the full trove of materials to Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers. The lawyers sought the communications in an effort to bolster their claims that the indictment against Mr. Abrego Garcia had been brought because the Trump administration was trying to vindictively punish him for contesting his initial deportation.

In October, Judge Crenshaw issued a preliminary ruling finding that there was a “realistic likelihood” that the administration had in fact brought the case vindictively. That decision allowed Mr. Abrego Garcia’s legal team to seek internal documents from the government.

In his initial order, the judge singled out Mr. Blanche, saying that he had made “remarkable statements” about the criminal case. On the day in June that Mr. Abrego Garcia was brought back to face indictment, Mr. Blanche went on Fox News and declared that the government had started to investigate the case only after Judge Xinis, in Maryland, had questioned the administration’s decision to deport Mr. Abrego Garcia and found that it “had no right.”

The newly released emails only pointed further at Mr. Blanche’s involvement in deciding to charge Mr. Abrego Garcia.

In one of the emails, written on May 16 as the Justice Department was nearing its decision to bring charges, Mr. Warren wrote to Mr. Singh, suggesting that Mr. Blanche was playing some sort of role in whether to seek an indictment quickly.

“If the DAG does want to move forward with the indictment on Wednesday,” Mr. Warren wrote, “we think it would be prudent to loop in the press office ASAP.”

Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have issued subpoenas to both Mr. Blanche and Mr. Singh in an effort to have them testify under oath about their roles in seeking criminal charges. The Justice Department has strenuously objected to the subpoenas in a series of court filings, some written by a top department official, Stanley E. Woodward Jr.

For the moment, Judge Crenshaw has put off deciding whether to force Mr. Blanche and Mr. Singh to take the witness stand — although he has put Mr. McGuire and his team in Nashville in a tough spot as they seek to rebut the judge’s preliminary finding that the case was brought vindictively.

All along, Mr. McGuire has told Judge Crenshaw that he can fight the claims of vindictiveness by placing himself and other lower-ranking witnesses from law enforcement on the stand to testify that senior Trump officials were not involved in the indictment of Mr. Abrego Garcia. But that argument lost much of its credibility after the emails were released on Tuesday.

And that has left Mr. McGuire facing a pair of bad outcomes.

If he were to go forward with his plan to overcome Judge Crenshaw’s preliminary finding of vindictiveness with testimony that the emails have already undercut, the judge could make a permanent finding of vindictiveness and immediately dismiss the indictment.

But the judge has also reserved the right to force Mr. Blanche and Mr. Singh to take the witness stand if he is unsatisfied by Mr. McGuire’s presentation. And that could lead to embarrassing questions being asked of some of the Justice Department’s most senior leaders.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/31/multimedia/31trump-news-promo-mqhv/31trump-news-promo-mqhv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 12:13:17.833372

One such facility is planned in Stafford County, Virginia, The Washington Post reported, citing internal documents about a facility made to hold 5,000 to 10,000 people.

No one from the federal government has contacted the county about plans, the head of the board of supervisors told News4. He flagged concerns about what a detention center in Stafford County might mean for the community.

News4 asked Board of Supervisors Chairman Deuntay Diggs if the county could support the level of infrastructure a major detention facility would need.

""No, not currently, and that's one of the bigger concerns with this potential detention facility. With 5,000 to 10,000 detainees, that's going to require upgrades in infrastructure, and that is going to come at the cost of the taxpayer,” he said.

Diggs said providing water, sewer and other resources to a federal facility would come at a cost.

News4 asked Diggs if he thinks such a facility is a move in the right direction for Stafford County.

""I don't believe so at this time. I think it changes the character and the nature of Stafford. We have a lot of history in Stafford. We're a very diverse community. Our constituents have been asking for things to do for the family, for kids, and this doesn't track with that direction,” he said.

News4 reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security to ask about plans and did not hear back.

ICE is planning to hold 80,000 immigrants in warehouses around the country to speed up deportations, the Post reported.

While specifics on a potential facility in Stafford County are scarce, opinions are not.

“I mean, is that necessary? And is it morally right?” one resident asked. “That’s more so what I’m really concerned about.”

The safe third country agreement, created by the Trump administration, is a network of countries who have agreed to take U.S. asylum seekers. Included in the list of countries are Ecuador, Honduras, and Uganda, among others.

This is the latest effort by the current administration to reduce immigration to the United States. In October, the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals found that immigration judges should consider third-country removal prior to hearing an asylum case in the United States. In November, DHS asked immigration judges to dismiss nearly 5,000 cases. The basis of dismissal is not known.

The third country agreement gives the U.S. the ability to remove and relocate individuals to any of the countries in the program. In return, these countries typically receive some preferred treatment, like additional security support. In 2019, an interim final rule was issued, allowing the U.S. to reach agreement with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras as third country partners. Per that agreement, if individuals were considered safe to apply for asylum in any one of those countries, they were barred from applying in the United States. Several lawsuits were filed, challenging the program. Additional lawsuits are expected in response to the current agreement.

In response, deniers of the program state it is eroding U.S. humanitarian programs. The program is considered another avenue for meeting Trump administration removal goals. Last month, DHS stated they are projecting nearly 600,000 removals by the end of the first year of office for President Trump’s second term. The previous peak of 400,000 removals within a year was under the Obama administration.",https://bizlegalservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/asylum-seekers-dismissal.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 19:56:25.776400

The Department of Justice argues the law violates the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause and endangers federal officers.

Illinois officials state the law protects residents' constitutional rights from overreach by federal agents.

SPRINGFIELD — In an expected move, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit last week seeking to nullify a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated.

The suit was filed by the Department of Justice in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. It alleges that the law, passed by the Democrat-led state legislature in October and signed by Pritzker earlier this month, violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and increases the likelihood that officers face threats and harassment.

“Threatening officers with ruinous liability and even punitive damages for executing federal law and for simply protecting their identities and their families also chills the enforcement of federal law and compromises sensitive law enforcement operations,” the Department of Justice said in a statement.

The complaint names Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as defendants.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said in a statement to Capitol News Illinois that “the Trump Administration’s masked agents are not targeting the ‘worst of the worst' — they are harassing and detaining law-abiding U.S. citizens and Black and Brown people at daycares, hospitals, and courthouses.”

“This new law reflects our belief that no one is above the law, regardless of their position or authority,” the spokesperson said. “Unlike the Trump Administration, Illinois is protecting constitutional rights in our state.""

Response to blitz

Pritzker signed the law in the aftermath of “Operation Midway Blitz,” a federal immigration enforcement campaign that targeted the Chicago region starting in September.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the operation resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission. But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.

Leading Illinois Democrats viewed the new law as a comprehensive legislative response to the blitz that provides safeguards to people in their interactions with immigration agents. It also places new requirements on public colleges and universities, hospitals and child care facilities and mostly prohibits them from disclosing the immigration status of students, patients, parents and children.

But the reach of the law is limited. Not included in the package is an outright ban on law enforcement officers wearing face masks while on duty, for instance.

Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged before the bill passed that the state was “playing with a stacked deck” versus a federal government with the “upper hand” and that the law would likely be challenged.

Courthouse, private right of action provisions targeted

In its 22-page filing, the federal government specifically challenged the provisions relating to immigration agents’ actions in and around state courthouses as well as the private right of action that it created, arguing that “states have no power to ‘in any manner control the operations of’ the federal government.”

Under the law, all people attending court are considered “privileged from civil arrest” inside state courthouses and within a 1,000-foot buffer zone outside of the buildings.

Though there had long been a de facto understanding that such facilities were off-limits for immigration enforcement, they have increasingly been the site of apprehensions over the past year. Those who violate the act could be liable for statutory damages of $10,000.

The law also allows residents to sue immigration agents for violating their constitutional right to due process and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

They would be able to collect punitive damages that can increase if the agents are wearing masks, concealing their identities, failing to wear body cameras or using a vehicle with a non-Illinois or obscured license plate.

“That is a policy choice for Congress, not each individual state, to make,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing, predicting that the law will “inevitably become a vehicle to threaten and harass federal officers.”

Latest state-federal immigration clash

It is not the first time the state and federal government have been entangled in litigation relating to immigration policy.

The Trump administration earlier this year filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate, under the supremacy clause, a state law and Chicago and Cook County ordinances that limit state and local law enforcement’s cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July.

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation's third largest city. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court that prevents the deployment of troops while the underlying case works through the courts.

This latest case has been assigned to Judge David W. Dugan, a Trump appointee.

Russia launched an overnight drone attack in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, injuring four people, including three children.

In Iran, mass protests over the country’s dire economic situation, including a collapsing currency and high inflation, have spread from businesses to universities. According to social media posts, students protested Tuesday at six university campuses in the capital Tehran, as well as in Isfahan and Yazd. The posts showed students chanting “Freedom” and “Don’t be afraid! We are all together.” Clashes broke out between students and security forces near the University of Tehran. This comes as Iran responded to President Trump’s threats that he would support new strikes against the country over its nuclear program. On social media, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that any actions against Iran would be “severe and regret-inducing.” This is the head of Iran’s parliament on Tuesday.

Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf: “I emphasize that Iran does not seek permission from anyone to defend itself. The Iranian people’s response to any widespread adventurism and evil is unapologetic and even unexpected.”

At least two oil tankers have reportedly arrived in Venezuela in recent days, with other vessels navigating toward the Venezuelan coast, despite the Trump administration’s blockade. The two other tankers approaching Venezuela are not under sanctions and are part of a fleet from China. It’s unclear whether China will press the Trump administration to secure the safe passage of the vessels as the United States ramps up its military forces against Venezuela.

This comes as a New York Times investigation has offered a glimpse into the physical evidence following mounting U.S. military strikes on boats off the Caribbean. The Times reports that days after a U.S. boat strike in November, a scorched 30-foot-long boat washed ashore a Colombian peninsula, followed by two bodies and dozens of packets, some of which had traces of a substance that smelled and looked like marijuana. The damning new details contradict President Trump’s claims of targeting cocaine and fentanyl traffickers. Marijuana is legal in at least 40 U.S. states.

In Bolivia, protests led by miners have entered a second week, with police forces on Tuesday firing tear gas at demonstrators in the capital La Paz. Protesters have condemned new austerity measures issued by the government of President Rodrigo Paz Pereira, who took office in early November.

This is one of the protesters.

Franz Apulaca: “We’ve been repressed with rubber bullets, with weapons. We are fighting for a just cause. It is for Bolivia. We will fight to the end, until we get this cursed decree repealed.”

There are mounting accusations of fraud after conservative Nasry Asfura was declared the winner, nearly one month after voters took to the polls in an electoral process that was riddled with technical issues and a lack of transparency. Asfura was personally endorsed by President Trump, which was widely criticized as a way to intervene in Honduras’s election. Nasralla lost to Asfura by less than 1% of the vote and is seeking a review and recount of voter ballots.

The state of Florida executed 19 people on death row this year, a record high that nearly doubled the national average. That’s according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which said Florida’s executions accounted for about 40% of the country’s total this year. Advocates calling to abolish the death penalty have warned many of those put to death suffered from mental illnesses or were not given access to proper legal representation in their cases. Others were victims of abuse. Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has been accused of expediting executions for political gain. Unlike other states, where the courts are more steadily involved in the process, Florida’s governor has the sole authority to issue execution warrants.

It wasn’t long before he was recognized as the lieutenant colonel who ran a notoriously repressive military unit in Barquisimeto, Venezuela.

Rafael Quero Silva, a former officer in Venezuela’s National Guard, was once accused by dozens of people and several human rights organizations of ordering violent military raids and the torture of detainees who were arrested after massive crackdowns on antigovernment protests in 2013 and 2014.

At some point after the protests ended, Mr. Quero Silva left the national guard.

Then, in 2018, Venezuelans living in the United States discovered that he had a new life in the Miami suburbs as a television extra on the Spanish-language soap opera “My Perfect Family.”

On Tuesday, five people who say they were tortured, shot or beaten by soldiers under Mr. Quero Silva’s command filed a claim in U.S. court under the Torture Victim Protection Act. The 1991 law allows the filing of civil suits in federal court against people who committed torture or extrajudicial killings while acting in an official capacity in another country. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages, although it is unclear whether Mr. Quero Silva has any assets.

The civil lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, would mark the first time a Venezuelan military officer would stand trial in the United States for abuses carried out under the government of President Nicolás Maduro in the more than 10 years since he took power, the lawyers said. The plaintiffs say they hope their case can serve as an important symbolic step for those who were abused or wrongfully detained under the Maduro regime.

“We would have the first case ever, despite all the attempts to bring a little accountability for what has been going on for over a decade,” said Almudena Bernabeu, a London-based lawyer with the law firm Guernica 37 Centre, which specializes in human rights cases. Her firm, along with the Miami-based firm McDermott Will & Schulte, represents the plaintiffs.

But before the lawsuit is ever heard, Mr. Quero Silva, 55, could be expelled from the United States.

He was arrested by ICE officials in March and now sits in immigration detention in South Florida awaiting deportation after being denied bail, according to U.S. government records. The Department of Homeland Security declined to say why he was detained.

When electoral results showed Mr. Maduro had won by a razor-thin margin, protesters who questioned the results hit the streets for months, including in Barquisimeto. The demonstrations turned violent and claimed at least 40 lives nationwide, including nine security forces, and marked a turning point in the government’s willingness to crack down on dissent.

Interviews with protesters and other witnesses found an apparent pattern of abuses on the part of security forces, who frequently beat, kicked and threatened protesters and, in some cases, shot demonstrators at point-blank range with plastic pellets.

Human Rights Watch called the violence “a systematic practice by the Venezuelan security forces.”

Other human rights groups documented instances of aggressive raids by soldiers in the city of Barquisimeto, involving the use of tear gas and lack of search warrants, at a minimum of 12 gated housing complexes.

Tuesday’s lawsuit accuses soldiers under Mr. Quero Silva’s command of firing tear gas and rubber bullets into and at people’s apartment complexes; setting on fire the roof of one of the buildings; breaking apartment windows and damaging buildings and cars. One plaintiff said her apartment was targeted because she often rendered aid to protesters.

Mr. Quero Silva was often there at the forefront, the lawsuit says, overseeing these military raids. The plaintiffs knew him, and they said they recognized him while they were in custody or participating in protests — an unusual factor uncommon in human rights cases where victims try to hold perpetrators accountable.

One of the plaintiffs, Wladimir Díaz, 32, a former student leader who now lives in Chicago, says he saw Mr. Quero Silva several times at protests when his unit used excessive force. At one demonstration, Mr. Díaz said guardsmen stormed a university building where students had sought refuge and fired live ammunition at protesters and he was struck.

“He destroyed families,” Mr. Díaz said to The Times. “I had to abandon my country. I have a gunshot wound. His people, his orders ruined my life.”

Carlos Doubront, 38, a Venezuelan lawyer who now lives in Miami, says he was attacked by soldiers from Mr. Quero Silva’s unit who made him kneel for hours, according to the lawsuit. He says knew Mr. Quero Silva from the neighborhood because they had friends in common and Mr. Doubront’s father was a general in the national guard.

“The boss doesn’t get his hands dirty, he has lackeys for that,” Mr. Doubront told The Times. “But when he starts to repress, he doesn’t forgive anything, he doesn’t respect anything.”

Another plaintiff, Ehisler Moises Vásquez Caridad, said in the lawsuit that she was shot in the face by Mr. Quero Silva’s soldiers.

Yet another, Maria Elena Uzcátegui Castro, said Mr. Quero Silva personally supervised the search of her house, where soldiers tied her up and robbed her. She was held in detention for four months, according to the lawsuit.

The plaintiffs said they all filed complaints with the authorities at the time but eventually fled Venezuela in the face of threats and other forms of repression.

Four years after the protests, word got out that Mr. Quero Silva had moved to the United States. In 2018, a South Florida journalist who had previously worked in Barquisimeto posted screenshots on social media of the former military officer in his roles on the television show, including one where he happily cheered at a horse racetrack.

Shortly after Mr. Quero Silva was spotted living in the United States, F.B.I. agents in both the United States and Spain interviewed victims who had accused Mr. Quero Silva of ordering torture and appeared to be preparing a case, the plaintiffs told The Times.

It is unclear what came of the investigation. The F.B.I. declined to comment.

Then in March of this year, Mr. Quero Silva was arrested by ICE agents.

Independent journalist Nick Shirley released a video detailing his investigation into the issue on Friday, sparking a renewed interest into the allegations. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged 98 people in connection with its sweeping probe into the matter, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Monday on the social platform X.

Here is what to know, by agency, regarding federal investigations into allegations of fraud in Minnesota:

Department of Justice

Dating back to 2022, the DOJ has charged dozens of people as part of its inquiry into alleged fraud within programs under the Minnesota Department of Human Services (MDHS). Those charged are accused of defrauding MDHS programs that receive federal funding, including from Medicaid.

Joseph Thompson, the assistant U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said at a press conference earlier this month that it is possible that “half or more” of the $18 billion billed to 14 MDHS programs since 2018 is fraudulent.

“The fraud is not small, it isn’t isolated,” Thompson added. “The magnitude cannot be overstated. What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes, it’s a staggering, industrial-scale fraud.”

Bondi also said Monday on X that the DOJ is “working hand-in-hand” with the departments of Treasury, Homeland Security), Housing and Urban Development and Labor to “continue unraveling this scheme.”

Department of Homeland Security

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dispatched agents from its investigations unit to Minneapolis on Monday, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem saying on X that her department is “conducting a massive investigation on [child care] and other rampant fraud.”

The department has shared multiple videos of investigators conducting inspections at businesses in Minneapolis over the last two days.

In one video, investigative officers approach a man in a store, whose face is blurred, and confirm that he received a notice of inspection for his business.

“We will root out this rampant fraud plaguing Minnesota,” DHS added.

Small Business Administration

Small Business Administration (SBA) head Kelly Loeffler said Monday that her department is halting annual grants to Minnesota, amid an inquiry into alleged fraud in COVID-era lending programs.

Loeffler said on X that the SBA is pausing the funding while it investigates $430 million in suspected Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) fraud in the state.

The PPP was established by the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program provided more than $750 billion in forgivable loans to businesses to assist with payroll, operating and other essential costs.

Last week, Loeffler sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) outlining at least $2.5 million in PPP and Economic Injury Disaster Loan funds sent to people indicted in the fraud probe.

Department of Health and Human Services

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) paused payments from its Administration for Children and Families to Minnesota on Tuesday.

HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill said on X that he has also demanded an audit of day care centers highlighted in Shirley’s video from Walz, including attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations and inspections.

In fiscal 2024, the Administration for Children and Families provided more than $172 million to Minnesota’s Child Care and Development Fund, more than $31 million of which was used to “improve the quality and availability of child care,” according to the state’s Department of Children, Youth and Families.

“We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud,” O’Neill added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AP25296714037305-e1764518306601.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-31 11:14:18.306115

A Gateway Community Services spokesperson told NewsNation Tuesday that Republican lawmakers have treated allegations of fraud as fact.","(NewsNation) — The Department of Homeland Security is investigating immigration cases for potential fraud to see if it should seek to strip American citizenship from individuals.

“Under U.S. law, if an individuals (sic) procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin toldNewsNation. “We are certainly auditing cases for the countries of concern which includes Somalia.”

DHS is auditing cases of individuals from not only Somalia but also 18 other countries.

Denaturalization refers to the process of stripping someone of their U.S. citizenship after it was granted. It is a time-consuming, lengthy, legal process that is infrequently used.

The government must prove that the citizenship was obtained illegally through the application process, such as through marriage fraud or lying during the application process.

It comes amid ongoing fraud investigations in Minnesota, where people in the Somali community are accused of defrauding taxpayers of social services funds.

Republican lawmakers in Maine blamed state Democrats, including the governor, for ignoring a Somali-led health services contractor that defrauded the state’s Medicaid program of millions of dollars.

In an exclusive interview with NewsNation earlier this month, whistleblower Christopher Bernardini alleged that Gateway Community Services filed false claims for visits to disabled and low-income clients, though the services were never performed.

A Gateway Community Services spokesperson told NewsNation Tuesday that Republican lawmakers have treated allegations of fraud as fact. The spokesperson said that the allegations are being “used as a wedge issue in a high-stakes election year.”

The Justice ​Department argues the measure conflicts with federal immigration law ⁠in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it gives educational benefits to illegal immigrants that are denied to U.S. citizens from other states.
“This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country.” The Justice Department filed the ⁠lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and ‍hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.","The U.S. Department ‌of Justice has filed a lawsuit challenging a Virginia law that makes immigrants in the country illegally eligible for reduced in-state tuition and financial aid at the state’s public colleges and universities. Monday’s lawsuit marked the latest in a campaign by President ‍Donald Trump’s administration to challenge state laws that extend tuition and financial aid benefits to non-citizens living in their states regardless of their immigration status.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country ​unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges ​if they can establish they reside in the state.

Supporters of the measure, which was signed into law in 2021 by then-Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, argued it would remove financial barriers that had limited the ‍ability of immigrant students in the state to pursue higher education like other Virginia residents.

The Justice ​Department argues the measure conflicts with federal immigration law ⁠in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it gives educational benefits to illegal immigrants that are denied to U.S. citizens from other states.

The lawsuit cites the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, ⁠which restricts states’ ability to grant immigrants in the country illegally certain postsecondary education benefits.

“This is a simple matter of federal law: in Virginia and nationwide, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country.”

The Justice Department filed the ⁠lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and ‍hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

At least 21 other states and the District of Columbia have similar “tuition ‍equity” laws and policies that allow certain students who graduated from high ​schools in their states to pay in-state tuition regardless ‍of their immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.

What You Need To Know

Federal immigration agents seem to have changed their tactics inside of immigration court in the city at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan

Immigrant advocates say ICE is now detaining more immigrants behind closed doors during regularly scheduled check-ins on a floor where attorneys aren’t allowed

In November, White House “border czar"" Tom Homan defended ICE operations across the country during a Fox News interview, saying, “Majority of people they’re arresting are public safety threats. They’re making your neighborhoods safer. They’re making your communities safer""

NY1 reached out to ICE several times to request an interview on the concerns raised by immigrant advocates, and ask for access to its enforcement operations in the building, but have not heard back

26 Federal Plaza houses two floors of the city’s immigration courts, and is much quieter these days.

Once a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in New York, video shot in late July shows dozens of armed masked officers arresting immigrants leaving their court hearings.

On a given day in December, fewer than a dozen federal agents from agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) stand outside courtrooms.

Benjamin Remy — with New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG), a nonprofit legal services organization — has been on the ground here since detentions began in late May. He believes the Trump administration is shifting its resources and focus elsewhere.

“We’ve seen less enforcement here outside of courtrooms at 26 Federal Plaza, but we have seen more street raid enforcement, more raids on homes, businesses,” Remy, a senior staff attorney with NYLAG’s Immigrant Protection Unit, said.

In October and November, federal agents on Canal Street arrested 10 immigrants later charged with selling counterfeit goods.

In November, video appears to show ICE agents forcing their way into a Queens home without a warrant, looking for the mother’s cousin. Her children are American citizens.

In early December, residents in Jackson Heights shouted at ICE agents who appeared to leave.

In another November incident, ICE agents took a man from a car in Washington Heights to detain him.

Street arrests like those rarely end up in court. Rather, they can lead to detention and deportation.

“And then it’s ICE check-ins, so we’re seeing a lot of folks get detained, especially here on the fifth floor,” Remy said.

Remy and another NYLAG attorney, Allison Cutler, say they’re seeing less ICE activity on the floors with the more than two-dozen immigration judges.

However, they’re now getting many more calls about immigrants, including parents with children being detained during regularly scheduled check-ins with ICE, which are behind closed doors on a different floor.

“What’s very different about the fifth floor check-ins is that they don’t allow attorneys inside, and so unlike the 12th floor, where these detentions are very public, they’re getting caught on camera so that the world can know what is happening, these fifth floor detentions are very hidden,” Cutler, a supervising attorney with NYLAG’s Immigrant Protection Unit, said.

Earlier in December, Cutler and Remy learned about a fifth-floor detention from a faith-based organization.

“We just had ICE detain a community member on the fifth floor, so essentially this client who is going through her process, doing everything the right way, has a future date with her immigration judge for a future hearing, she was detained,” Cutler said.

NY1 reached out to ICE several times to request an interview on the concerns raised by immigrant advocates, and ask for access to its enforcement operations in the building, but have not heard back.

In November, White House “border czar” Tom Homan defended ICE operations across the country during a Fox News interview.

“Majority of people they’re arresting are public safety threats. They’re making your neighborhoods safer. They’re making your communities safer,” Homan said.

The Trump administration recently fired eight immigration judges at 26 Federal Plaza — a net drop of more than 10% there, bringing the total number of judges to 60 across three courthouses, according to NY1 reporting. Remy believes that complicates matters even more.

“Folks are showing up, they’re coming in, they’re expecting to have their hearing, they show up to the courtroom, and the judge is gone. If they’re lucky, maybe the clerk will be in there and can give them adjournment for another date. Sometimes they’re just turned away,” he said.

“But this is just adding another layer of confusion to an already just incredibly confusing and fearful situation. People are already scared and confused. This has only made that a lot worse,” he added.

Remy says fewer judges means more cases are being added to the more than 300,000 preexisting cases in the backlog in New York State, since cases don’t get resolved or are shifted over to judges who don’t have the same level of immigration expertise.

The Pentagon announced in September that it’s hiring 600 military lawyers as immigration judges across the country and eliminating job requirements, including having a decade of immigration law experience.

The move was confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security and follows reports first published by Fox News.

Denaturalization is legally possible if citizenship was obtained through fraud, but such cases are rare and often take years. Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has pushed a hardline immigration agenda that includes deportations, visa and green card revocations, and increased scrutiny of immigrants’ backgrounds.

Why It Matters

Civil rights and immigrant advocacy groups warn the audits could unfairly target Somali Americans and undermine due process. They argue the administration is using fraud investigations as a pretext to single out a specific community.

The issue has gained national attention as federal officials have labelled Minnesota’s Somali community a hotspot for fraud involving federal social service funds, a claim state officials dispute.

Key stakeholders include Somali American citizens, particularly in Minnesota, who fear increased scrutiny and potential loss of citizenship. The Trump administration and federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and Department of Health and Human Services are driving the investigations as part of broader anti-fraud and immigration enforcement efforts.

Other stakeholders include Minnesota’s state government, which administers affected social programs, and immigrant-rights and human rights groups that argue the policy risks racial profiling and erosion of due process protections.

What’s Next

Federal agencies have increased investigative resources in Minnesota, while the Department of Health and Human Services has frozen child care payments to the state pending stricter documentation requirements.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has pushed back, saying the state has already taken action against fraud and accusing the Trump administration of politicising the issue. Legal challenges and community backlash are likely as investigations continue.

And these operations have come with the unprecedented show of lawlessness from law enforcement that the ICE agents have been wearing face masks to conceal their identities.
Federal law generally overrides state law, and I just don’t see feds taking orders from state officials.
So Wiener’s ban on ICE agents wearing masks is unlikely to change anything once it takes effect January 1.
But it did start the momentum of legally deciding on what seems like a dubious law enforcement practice to many of us who do not work in law enforcement.","State Senator Scott Wiener got a law passed prohibiting ICE agents from wearing face coverings in California. We’ll find out when it goes into effect Thursday whether ICE agents will follow that law.

Right from the start of the Trump 2.0 administration, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents started snatching anyone remotely Hispanic-looking off the street and throwing them in detention facilities god-knowns-where. And these operations have come with the unprecedented show of lawlessness from law enforcement that the ICE agents have been wearing face masks to conceal their identities.

So back in June, state Senator Scott Wiener and his fellow state Senator Jesse Arreguín proposed a law to ban federal agents from wearing face coverings while on duty in the state of California. That measure sailed easily through the state legislature and Gavin Newsom signed it into law.

Now that law officially takes effect on Thursday, January 1, 2026. Come Thursday, it will no longer be legal for ICE agents to wear masks on the job when in California.

“Starting on Thursday, ICE agents who terrorize California communities while covering their faces will be in violation of California law and subject to civil and criminal liability,” Wiener said in a Tuesday press release. “There is no legitimate reason for ICE or any law enforcement officer to cover their faces while conducting normal operations, and doing so undermines public safety and erodes trust in law enforcement. If ICE continues to operate as a secret police force in California, we will hold them accountable.”

Okay well that’s all well and good Mister State Senator, but is there any way we can enforce this? Federal law generally overrides state law, and I just don’t see feds taking orders from state officials. Plus it's the Trump administration, which has been completely unapologetic about pulling reasons out of their ass to justify all manner of legal violations.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is not budging on the mask thing. “I would say that they wear masks at times to protect their identities from dangerous situations,” she said at an Illinois press conference shortly before Newsom signed the law. “With the leadership teams, we leave that up to them to discern what’s necessary in certain situations.”

The feds have already said they’d sue to overturn the law. But three other states have already started the process of passing similar bans (New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts).

So Wiener’s ban on ICE agents wearing masks is unlikely to change anything once it takes effect January 1. But it did start the momentum of legally deciding on what seems like a dubious law enforcement practice to many of us who do not work in law enforcement.

DHS emphasized that denaturalization, or stripping of citizenship, is governed by strict legal standards and applies only under limited circumstances.

The review includes cases tied to 19 countries that DHS considers countries of concern, including Somalia. DHS did not specify how many cases are currently under review or whether any individuals have been referred for denaturalization proceedings.

Denaturalization is a rare and intense legal process. Historically, the federal government has pursued only between a dozen and a few dozen cases per year, dating back to the 1990s.

Prosecutors must prove that citizenship was obtained illegally, and denaturalization convictions require a high burden of proof that can often take years to litigate.

The scrutiny also comes as the Department of Health and Human Services moved Tuesday to freeze child care payments to Minnesota, citing alleged fraud involving daycare providers across the state.

On the Southwest Side — and across the city — I covered the efforts of Chicagoans who organized to protect their neighbors.","CHICAGO — Since the start of the year, I’ve covered the federal government’s immigration crackdown in Chicago — and its impact on immigrants who call the city home.

I am one of those immigrants. Like many others, I moved to the United States from Mexico pursuing opportunity. I came first as a young professional, then as an international student. In the end, I stayed because of the life I’m building here. I’ve lived in Chicago for years, growing from an aspiring journalist to an award-winning reporter while covering the West and Southwest sides. I’ve made some of the best friends one can ask for, bought a house with my partner and made Chicago my home.

Journalists are trained to set aside our feelings and opinions, to recognize our biases and to pursue the truth above all else. But I cannot set aside my status as an immigrant, nor would I want to.

Operation Midway Blitz reminded me how much documenting the truth matters, even as it became increasingly risky for me to do so. Although I am a legal immigrant, I worried I could be detained as I was out in the neighborhood reporting, wondering whether not being a citizen could be used against me — even if my job, as a member of the press, is protected by the Constitution. Even if I’ve always followed the law.

But being an immigrant reporter has helped me better connect with sources, asking them deeper questions and establishing trust. I understand the complexities of the immigration system — one that can turn people’s lives upside down, bring great opportunities or force people to make incredibly difficult decisions.

For many, Operation Midway Blitz brought long-held fears to the forefront, the kind that come up during sleepless nights: Would they have to leave their home? Their loved ones? As the federal government increasingly targeted journalists, detaining one locally, I found myself asking similar questions.

What if they detain me? What about my family? What about our dreams?

I talked to people who, for years, lived in the shadows because they were undocumented. In Little Village, U.S.-born teenagers told me how much their mothers and fathers had sacrificed, working hard despite their anxiety because they wanted to provide for their children.

On the Southwest Side — and across the city — I covered the efforts of Chicagoans who organized to protect their neighbors. I talked to people who had the incredibly difficult task of telling a neighbor their loved one had been taken away, ripped from their lives. I interviewed teenagers left with guilt and pain after one of their parents was detained.

I never expected to see masked, armed federal agents moving through an American city, deploying tear gas on streets lined with people’s homes, shooting a woman, killing a man, all while detaining the landscapers, construction workers and others who work hard for the American Dream. But I am proud to have covered these stories.

These are voices I cannot forget. Everywhere, I am reminded of corners of the city where people — including legal immigrants, U.S. citizens, even children — were taken, brutalized or tear-gassed.

“Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that ​was first reported by Fox News and ​reposted by the White House on social media.

Denaturalization cases are rare and can take years. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, about 11 cases were pursued per year between 1990 and ‍2017.

Since taking office in January, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline ​immigration policy involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations ⁠of visas and green cards, and screening of social media posts and past speeches of immigrants.

Human rights groups widely condemn Trump’s policies, saying they curb rights like due process ⁠and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies aim to improve domestic security.

Here's a breakdown of some of this year's defining moments, presented in no particular order.

Outrage, grief after Minnesota lawmaker shootings

Minnesota Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were injured in what federal and state officials characterized as politically-motivated shootings in June.

Melissa and Mark Hortman were fatally shot in their Brooklyn Park home, while John and Yvette Hoffman were shot around 5 miles away in their Champlin home.

The attacks spurred a manhunt involving federal, state and local law enforcement for the suspected shooter, Vance Boelter. He was taken into custody less than two days after the shootings near his home in Green Isle, Minnesota.

Boelter has since been federally charged on six counts, which include murder, stalking and firearms violations. He pleaded not guilty to the charges in August. He's also been charged by the state with two counts of first-degree murder and four counts of attempted first-degree murder.

Court documents show Boelter's then-wife told an investigator they were ""preppers,"" meaning they ""prepare for major or catastrophic incidents."" She says her husband gave her a ""bailout plan"" before the attacks. She subsequently filed for, and was granted, a divorce.

State records show that Boelter served two consecutive three-year terms on the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board. He was first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016 and was reappointed by Gov. Tim Walz three years later.

""The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter,"" Walz's office said in a statement to WCCO. ""They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.""

Minnesotans and state and federal lawmakers mourned the loss of Melissa and Mark Hortman in the weeks following the attacks. Melissa Hortman represented Minnesota House District 34B as a member of the Democratic Party. She was elected to the Minnesota Legislature in 2004 and was in her 11th term.

Federal immigration enforcement operations reach Minnesota

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations targeting Somali immigrants began in the Twin Cities earlier this month. The actions started a day after President Trump said, ""I don't want [Somalis] in our country.""

On Thanksgiving, Mr. Trump, in a social media post, used a slur usually directed at people with intellectual disabilities to describe Walz, used racially and religiously prejudiced language against Rep. Ilhan Omar and said that Somali refugees are ""completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said its agents have arrested more than 400 people since ""Operation Metro Surge"" began. It's unclear how many of those 400 are still detained or have been sent elsewhere.

ICE agents have conducted operations in several cities around the metro. In Brooklyn Park, a coffee shop owner said agents lied to one of his employees before detaining him. WCCO reached out to ICE to ask what charges the employee faces and why he was detained, but has not heard back.

Minneapolis city leaders said on Dec. 10 that a U.S. citizen was wrongfully arrested by ICE agents because he looks Somali. WCCO reached out to ICE for a response to the accusation, but has not heard back.

Federal agents also gathered outside a home construction site in Chanhassen, where two men were atop an aerial work platform. One of the men came down after nearly two hours, and the other didn't come down until after the agents left. DHS officials say the men first climbed atop the roof after they ""fled from a vehicle and entered a construction site,"" and claim the first man to come down from the roof had entered the country illegally from El Salvador in 2019. He is now in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

Omar, a Democrat, told WCCO in an interview on Dec. 14 that her son was pulled over by federal agents and asked him to prove his citizenship. ICE's Acting Director Todd Lyons said the agency has ""absolutely zero record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son"" and accused her of trying to ""unfairly demonize our law enforcement officers."" Omar then responded, ""ICE has long operated as a rogue agency beyond reform. It's no surprise that an agency known for disappearing people also can't keep its records straight. ICE now claims it has records of all the stops, and our office would welcome the opportunity to review them.""

Residents have clashed with ICE agents on several occasions since the operations began, including in south Minneapolis and the city's Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. Thousands of others have marched in protest of the federal actions.

Court documents said a federal agent was briefly kidnapped in Plymouth while conducting surveillance at an apartment complex, looking for a man who allegedly overstayed his student visa. Two people have been federally charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers or employees in the incident.

Trump voices support for Lindell's bid for governor

Mr. Trump voiced support for Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Mike Lindell, founder and CEO of MyPillow, at a rally on Dec. 20 in North Carolina.

Lindell, 64, has joined a crowded Republican field seeking to unseat Walz in 2026. Mr. Trump said Lindell ""deserves to be governor of Minnesota"" after the myriad legal and financial woes the businessman dealt with in his quest to push conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.

""That man suffered. What he did, what he went through, because he knew the election was rigged. And he did it. I mean, he just did it as a citizen,"" Mr. Trump said.

Noem delivers bonus checks to MSP Airport TSA employees; union calls move illegal

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in November to deliver $10,000 bonus checks to Transportation Security Administration officers, some of whom worked during the 43-day federal government shutdown.

Local 899 Airport Screeners Union said the bonuses were illegal and only rewarded 7% of the MSP workforce. WCCO asked Noem why some staff were excluded from the bonus, and she said they went to staff nominated for the reward.

Rep. Emmer calls for ethics investigation into Rep. Craig's town hall stops

Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer in April called for federal lawmakers to launch an ethics investigation into Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota.

Craig and several other Democratic lawmakers across the country were making town hall stops in GOP-led districts in April to highlight the absence of Republican leaders at local events during the first months of President Trump's second term.

Emmer and fellow House Republican delegation members Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber, sent letters to the House Committee on Ethics and the Committee on House Administration urging a review of possible ethics violations by Craig.

""While her Republican colleagues have refused to show up and answer to their constituents in person, Representative Craig is actively showing up in their districts,"" Craig's office said.

Investigations into fraud in Minnesota reach new scrutiny

The Feeding Our Future scandal, the nation's largest COVID fraud scheme, garnered renewed focus from the Trump administration this year.

Somali Minnesotans are among the nearly 80 charged in connection with the scheme, in which prosecutors say defendants stole hundreds of millions of dollars that were supposed to be used to feed hungry children during the pandemic.

Mr. Trump has criticized Minnesota over the controversy, calling the state a ""hub of fraudulent money laundering activity"" and claiming ""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state and billions of dollars are missing.""

Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson suggested earlier this month that the total amount of fraud in Minnesota could be $9 billion or more. Walz and other state officials disputed that the amount of taxpayer money stolen is that high.

In late December, Homeland Security agents in Minneapolis were ""conducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud,"" according to Noem. Many of their targets came not from tips from the FBI, but from a viral video posted on social media. The video alleged nearly 12 day care centers in the state that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any service. CBS News conducted its own analysis here.

Amid the investigation and Thompson's accusation that fraud in the state could be $9 billion or more, Minnesota House and Senate Republicans called on Walz to resign. In response, the governor's office said Walz has been working for years to crack down on fraud and has asked the state Legislature for more authority to take aggressive action.

On Dec. 13, Walz unveiled a new statewide fraud prevention program, naming former FBI agent Tim O'Malley as the new director of program integrity. Republican State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson said, in response to the announced program, a ""statewide director of program integrity isn't something you need when your commissioners are doing their jobs well in the first place.""

Special elections held after Eichorn and Mitchell resign

Minnesota officials held two special elections, in April and on Election Day in November, to fill the seats of former state senators Justin Eichorn and Nicole Mitchell.

Eichorn, a Republican from Grand Rapids, resigned in March in the wake of a federal criminal charge accusing him of soliciting sex from someone he thought was 17, but turned out to be an undercover cop. He is charged federally with attempted coercion or enticement of a minor, and pleaded not guilty to the charge in April.

Mitchell resigned in July after she was convicted of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary or theft tools for breaking into her stepmother's Detroit Lakes home in April 2024. The former Democratic state senator represented parts of Woodbury and Maplewood.

Republican Keri Heintzeman beat Democrat Denise Slipy to replace Eichorn in Senate District 6 in a special election held on April 29. Six months later, on Election Day, then-state Rep. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jager defeated Republican Dwight Dorau for Mitchell's former seat in Senate District 47.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.","“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary

Protected Status?

A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, Venezuela

Immigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela – make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021 memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian

parole program

Separately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting last month in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national granted asylum, the program is under increased scrutiny and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influential

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/themercury.com/content/tncms/custom/image/47283276-d683-11e6-9ad2-7311962f5570.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-12-30 21:11:48.361845

Stephenson said she did not accept the characterisation that this was “a licence to discriminate based on looks”.","The new chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission has asked campaigners who raised doubts about her appointment to “judge me on what I do”.

In one of her first media interviews since her appointment at the start of December, Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson pledged to “uphold the rights of everybody across all protected characteristics”, after the UK government overruled the objections of parliament’s women and equalities committee about her suitability for the job.

Stephenson argued that open letters she had signed opposing censorship on campus and violence against campaigners had been “really widely mischaracterised as kind of anti-trans letters”.

Instead, she said, they were in line with her “lifelong commitment to protecting and upholding human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association and basic democratic rights”.

Stephenson donated to the 2022 campaign of the barrister Allison Bailey, who was found to have been unlawfully discriminated against by her chambers for her gender-critical views.

Asked what she would say to those who may feel she had taken a side in the debate, Stephenson said: “I was concerned about women who had been harassed or sometimes lost their jobs for the expression of legally protected views at a point when there was a public debate about changing legislation.”

She went on: “I would say, you know, judge me on what I do. I am really keen, I think it’s really important for the chair of the EHRC to uphold the rights of everybody across all protected characteristics.”

Acknowledging that “clearly I need to build a relationship” with the LGBTQ+ sector in her new role, she said: “I think it’s really important when we’re looking at this issue around single-sex spaces, to make sure that you also protect the rights of trans people.”

A number of LGBTQ+ organisations raised objections to Stephenson’s prior public statements after she was announced as the government’s preferred candidate. An open letter signed by Stonewall, Galop and TransActual, among others, said: “We recognise that Dr Stephenson has an impressive track record in the sector. However, she has also previously supported views seen at odds with inclusivity for all.”

Stephenson’s most pressing challenge in the new role is the formal guidance on how public bodies, businesses and other service providers should respond to April’s landmark supreme court ruling on biological sex that the equalities watchdog submitted to the government for approval in September.

Her predecessor, Kishwer Falkner, has criticised the amount of time ministers have taken to approve the new rules, while a leaked draft last month suggesting transgender people could be banned from single-sex spaces based on how they look caused consternation among LGBTQ+ advocates.

Stephenson said she did not accept the characterisation that this was “a licence to discriminate based on looks”. She said: “I think my starting point in all of this is that you have to ensure that everyone, as far as possible, has access to the services they need.”

She said it was “important to make sure that there are services provided for people who can’t or don’t want to use the services for their biological sex. It is about recognising that everybody has rights in this situation, but where you are providing single-sex services, the supreme court has said those have to be on the basis of biological sex.”

The UK government has previously insisted it will take as much time as necessary to “get right” new rules on access to single-sex spaces.

Asked if she would be prepared to accept changes to the draft guidance from ministers, Stephenson said she believed it was “legally sound” and that the EHRC was “really happy to provide [the government] with any evidence that they need”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18dbfe6db088cf20d7d1ca6681f960ce28d2a670/456_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74672cc9eda9253a9eb875a3f16ff05e",N,,2025-12-30 20:57:14.610457

Monday’s order from Judge Vince Chhabria of US District Court for the Northern District of California comes in a legal battle between states and the federal government over the use of state Medicaid data for immigration enforcement.

In Chhabria’s view, it’s “an open question” whether federal policies greenlight the US Department of Health and Human Services to share “sensitive medical information about Medicaid patients” with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.

Chhabria’s Monday preliminary injunction says it remains unclear whether the DHS can get from the HHS “any information relevant to any proceedings beyond criminal immigration investigations or civil enforcement actions.”

He also noted that it’s unclear “whether DHS may request any data from HHS about citizens or lawful permanent residents, including members of mixed-status households.”

The order isn’t entirely a win for the states Chhabria denied the states’ motion “as to the data that is the primary focus of the new policies—basic biographical, location, and contact information—because the sharing of such information is clearly authorized by law and the agencies have adequately explained their decisions.”

He also noted that while the litigation plays out, the HHS can share Medicaid information pertinent “only to aliens who are not lawfully residing in the United States” and that “divulges only those aliens’ citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth, and Medicaid ID.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/ce65934/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6f%2Fe3%2F63ca97404c7dab9582c681323b88%2Fice2.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 19:56:25.861373

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation’s third largest city.","Springfield, IL (CAPITOL NEWS ILLINOIS) – In an expected move, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit last week seeking to nullify a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated.

The suit was filed by the Department of Justice in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. It alleges that the law, passed by the Democrat-led state legislature in October and signed by Pritzker earlier this month, violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and increases the likelihood that officers face threats and harassment.

“Threatening officers with ruinous liability and even punitive damages for executing federal law and for simply protecting their identities and their families also chills the enforcement of federal law and compromises sensitive law enforcement operations,” the Department of Justice said in a statement.

The complaint names Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as defendants.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said in a statement to Capitol News Illinois that “the Trump Administration’s masked agents are not targeting the ‘worst of the worst’ — they are harassing and detaining law-abiding U.S. citizens and Black and Brown people at daycares, hospitals, and courthouses.”

“This new law reflects our belief that no one is above the law, regardless of their position or authority,” the spokesperson said. “Unlike the Trump Administration, Illinois is protecting constitutional rights in our state.”

Response to blitz

Pritzker signed the law in the aftermath of “Operation Midway Blitz,” a federal immigration enforcement campaign that targeted the Chicago region starting in September.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the operation resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission. But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.

Leading Illinois Democrats viewed the new law as a comprehensive legislative response to the blitz that provides safeguards to people in their interactions with immigration agents. It also places new requirements on public colleges and universities, hospitals and child care facilities and mostly prohibits them from disclosing the immigration status of students, patients, parents and children.

But the reach of the law is limited. Not included in the package is an outright ban on law enforcement officers wearing face masks while on duty, for instance.

Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged before the bill passed that the state was “playing with a stacked deck” versus a federal government with the “upper hand” and that the law would likely be challenged.

Courthouse, private right of action provisions targeted

In its 22-page filing, the federal government specifically challenged the provisions relating to immigration agents’ actions in and around state courthouses as well as the private right of action that it created, arguing that “states have no power to ‘in any manner control the operations of’ the federal government.”

Under the law, all people attending court are considered “privileged from civil arrest” inside state courthouses and within a 1,000-foot buffer zone outside of the buildings.

Though there had long been a de facto understanding that such facilities were off-limits for immigration enforcement, they have increasingly been the site of apprehensions over the past year. Those who violate the act could be liable for statutory damages of $10,000.

The law also allows residents to sue immigration agents for violating their constitutional right to due process and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

They would be able to collect punitive damages that can increase if the agents are wearing masks, concealing their identities, failing to wear body cameras or using a vehicle with a non-Illinois or obscured license plate.

“That is a policy choice for Congress, not each individual state, to make,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing, predicting that the law will “inevitably become a vehicle to threaten and harass federal officers.”

Latest state-federal immigration clash

It is not the first time the state and federal government have been entangled in litigation relating to immigration policy.

The Trump administration earlier this year filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate, under the supremacy clause, a state law and Chicago and Cook County ordinances that limit state and local law enforcement’s cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July.

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation’s third largest city. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court that prevents the deployment of troops while the underlying case works through the courts.

To hear the DOJ tell it, providing in-state tuition to immigrant residents unlawfully discriminates against out-of-state U.S. citizens.
The DOJ also said UVA tuition guidelines are ""in direct conflict with federal law.""
""As a result, Virginia law affirmatively removes immigration status as a barrier to establishing domicile and obtaining in-state tuition benefits.""
The federal government says the salve for Virginia's alleged encroachment of federal immigration law is federal preemption of the domicile rules used to determine in-state tuition.","The Trump administration filed a federal preemption lawsuit on Monday against the Commonwealth of Virginia over a policy that provides in-state tuition for immigrants who live in the Old Dominion.

In February, President Donald Trump signed an executive order entitled ""Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders."" The order aimed to keep ""taxpayer-funded benefits"" away from immigrants and directed officials to target ""[s]tate laws that provide in-State higher education tuition to aliens but not to out-of-State American citizens.""

Now, in a 13-page lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice is taking a constitutional swipe at the University of Virginia's tuition policies.

""Federal law prohibits States from providing aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States with any postsecondary education benefit that is denied to U.S. citizens,"" the lawsuit begins. ""There are no exceptions. Virginia violates it nonetheless. This court should put an end to this and permanently enjoin the enforcement of provisions of the Virginia Education Code that directly conflict with federal immigration law.""

The litigation focuses on two sections of Virginia law that recognize immigrants as ""Virginia residents based on certain conditions.""

The laws themselves do not mention immigrants or distinguish between classes of people, except for provisions outlining rules for military dependents. Rather, the laws cited by the DOJ focus on how domicile is determined and the time periods that allow a person domiciled in Virginia to become eligible for in-state tuition.

The lawsuit offers the following upshot of those guidelines: ""Virginia law permits an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States to qualify for reduced in-state rates and state-administered financial assistance based on residence within the state but does not make United States citizens eligible for such benefits without regard to whether the United States citizens are Virginia residents.""

To hear the DOJ tell it, providing in-state tuition to immigrant residents unlawfully discriminates against out-of-state U.S. citizens.

""That classification makes illegal aliens eligible for reduced in-state tuition and state-administered financial assistance for public state colleges and universities while U.S. citizens from other states are ineligible for the reduced tuition and must pay higher out-of-state tuition rates,"" the lawsuit goes on. ""This is not only wrong but illegal. The challenged act's discriminatory treatment in favor of illegal aliens over U.S. citizens is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law.""

The Trump administration argued the UVA domicile policy runs afoul of a section of federal law which, on its own terms, purports to limit ""eligibility for preferential treatment of aliens not lawfully present on basis of residence for higher education benefits.""

The lawsuit cites the relevant language (emphasis in original):

An alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State . . . for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit . . . without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.

It is not enough for the federal government to say the UVA tuition guidelines violate federal law, though they do argue that UVA is violating at least two immigration-related statutes. The DOJ also said UVA tuition guidelines are ""in direct conflict with federal law."" And, closely related to this argument, the DOJ says Virginia encroaches on federal immigration law by trying to take immigration status out of the equation in a third section of the domicile rules.

""Virginia law expressly provides that a student may not be deemed ineligible to establish domicile for in-state tuition purposes solely on the basis of the immigration status of the student's parent,"" the lawsuit goes on. ""As a result, Virginia law affirmatively removes immigration status as a barrier to establishing domicile and obtaining in-state tuition benefits.""

The litigation comes in the form of an as-applied challenge. This means the DOJ does not think Virginia law is broadly unconstitutional. Instead, the federal government is arguing that the in-state tuition guidelines used by UVA are unconstitutional in one specific circumstance: when such pricing is afforded to immigrants.

The federal government says the salve for Virginia's alleged encroachment of federal immigration law is federal preemption of the domicile rules used to determine in-state tuition.

To that end, the lawsuit puts forward a lone avenue of redress: a violation of the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The government's lawsuit also marshals some support from a 2023 case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in which a group of conservative students unsuccessfully attempted to bar the University of North Texas from charging out-of-state tuition.

In that case, the appellate panel declined to grant relief for the out-of-state students but opined separately to say the federal law cited by the students – the same one cited by the Trump administration here – has a ""sole focus…on improper benefits for illegal aliens.""

So, while the lawsuit rhetorically seeks to strike blows for U.S. citizens, the law itself cannot do that under the DOJ's preferred precedent. The Trump administration, instead, is simply trying to get Virginia to stop allowing immigrants to make use of the domicile laws.

""[T]hey confer in-state tuition benefits on unlawfully present aliens that are not available to all United States citizens on the same terms, regardless of residency,"" the lawsuit argues. ""As a result, these provisions, as applied to illegal aliens, are preempted under the Supremacy Clause and are therefore unconstitutional.""",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Memorial-Day-2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 18:56:50.300692

Here is our primer on the biggest stories to emerge from federal courts in Northern California and the Sacramento region this year.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff arrested in FBI public corruption probe

Dana Williamson, former chief of staff to Newsom and a powerhouse among political aides and lobbyists, was arrested on Nov. 12 and charged with 23 federal counts of bank and wire fraud, filing false tax returns and obstruction of justice. Several of the charges were made in connection with a scheme to funnel money from a campaign account connected to longtime California politician Xavier Becerra to benefit his former chief of staff, Sean McCluskie. Both McCluskie and lobbyist Greg Campbell have pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme.

Federal defendants in Sacramento walked free. The reason: No paid lawyers

In at least eight cases in federal court in Sacramento, judges ruled that defendants’ constitutional rights were violated after the U.S. government stopped paying court-appointed lawyers to represent them. Julian Ortiz, who had faced life in prison for allegedly selling methamphetamine, was released on Dec. 12 after U.S. District Judge John Mendez ruled that without payment, his lawyer could not pay for experts, investigators, translators or others needed to properly research and defend his case. Nationally, about 12,000 private attorneys who rely on the courts to appoint them to represent indigent defendants went without pay for about six months, thanks to the snowballing effect of budget issues, the government shutdown and a computer glitch.

Trump v Newsom: California defiant as policy differences play out in court

From the price of eggs to the deployment of the National Guard, tensions between the Democratic Governor of California and the Republican President played out in federal court in 2025, offering some wins and some losses to each side.

Early in the year, California’s leaders responded defiantly to a threat by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in public safety grants to states and cities that protected migrants under so-called sanctuary policies. San Francisco and Santa Clara sued to stop the action in a case that was quickly joined by numerous cities throughout the country.

Immigration sweeps lead to hard-fought cases on immigration, National Guard

In June, when violent protests erupted over immigration sweeps in Los Angeles, Trump federalized the California National Guard over Newsom’s objections, prompting the first of several lawsuits over an issue that soon went nationwide.

The very next month, immigration sweeps at a South Sacramento Home Depot led to arrests and protests here. Detention of migrants, sometimes violently, at immigration court in Sacramento was detailed in a case filed in federal court in San Jose. But in another case, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Southern California federal judge’s ruling that immigration stops could not be conducted solely based on someone’s apparent ethnicity or job site.

The state also refused to roll back protections for transgender athletes in schools, prompting yet another lawsuit from the Trump administration.

Retired Supreme Court Justice Kennedy reflects on cases, politics, Sacramento boyhood

Among the personalities who shaped the modern political and court system is Sacramento’s own retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. In a rare interview, the 89-year-old sat down with The Bee to talk about the city he loves, his childhood friendships with future luminaries such as the writer Joan Didion, and court decisions that for decades defined him as an influential swing vote on the court.

TRUMP ADMIN DEFENDS WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM AS NATIONAL SECURITY MATTER The site is a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with dozens of 19th- and early-20th-century buildings.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is moving to demolish a cluster of historic buildings at a long-vacant former psychiatric hospital complex in Washington D.C. that is being redeveloped into headquarters for the agency, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a Dec. 19 memo to the General Services Administration (GSA), obtained by the Post, that the buildings in question at St. Elizabeths’ 176-acre West Campus ""present a risk to life and property"" and that ""demolition is the only permanent measure that resolves the emergency conditions.""

DHS included a security risk assessment report with the memo that Noem said supports immediate corrective action.

The assessment states the vacant buildings could be accessed by unauthorized individuals and could provide a tactical advantage for small-arms or active-shooter scenarios. The report also warned of threats from ""malicious insiders,"" including employees or contractors with legitimate access who could exploit the vacant buildings to target executives, disrupt operations or compromise sensitive information.

In total, DHS is seeking to demolish 17 buildings. Four have already received approval from federal planning bodies, while the remaining 13 have not been reviewed or approved and are now being pushed through under the emergency demolition designation, according to preservation officials.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that buildings at the site need to be demolished for safety reasons.

""DHS security and safety assessments have determined these dilapidated, vacant buildings pose unacceptable safety, security and emergency-response risks,"" McLaughlin said. ""Demolition is the only permanent corrective action.""

A GSA spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the agency was notified by DHS of a serious and immediate security risk at the St. Elizabeths campus.

""Where buildings pose a threat, demolition may be necessary, and we are currently following all applicable laws and regulations,"" GSA spokesperson Marianne Copenhaver said.

Founded in 1855, St. Elizabeths was the nation’s first federally operated psychiatric hospital.

The West Campus was declared ""excess property"" in 2001 and then transferred to the GSA. It was later selected to become DHS’s headquarters and has been redeveloped over the past 15 years into a high-security, fortified complex for DHS, according to the GSA website.

The site is a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with dozens of 19th- and early-20th-century buildings.

The demolition plan has drawn opposition from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the D.C. Preservation League, which argue that DHS has not shown evidence of an actual emergency.

The groups told the Post that the emergency declaration relies solely on Noem’s own determination and bypasses required historic-preservation review procedures for a National Historic Landmark.

""A unilateral declaration like this is problematic because it bypasses the procedural safeguards designed to ensure stability, legitimacy and fairness,"" reads a letter signed by Elizabeth Merritt, the National Trust’s general counsel, and Rebecca Miller, the Preservation League’s executive director, according to the Post.

The preservation groups also argue that DHS used an emergency declaration and holiday timing to compress the review window, leaving little opportunity to challenge the demolition of historic buildings.

DHS declared an emergency on Dec. 19, when Noem signed the memo and security assessment, but GSA did not notify D.C. officials until the evening of Dec. 23, just before the Christmas holiday, per the Post.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/st-elizabths-demolish.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 18:56:46.490543

There are not enough dangerous criminals in this country to meet the goal of 1 million deportations a year,” expressed Sherman Luna.","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — President Donald Trump said he would deport a million people in his first year in office. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detained nearly 6,000 people in Tennessee alone.

In 2025, ICE kicked off its raids in large cities across the country. By May, Nashville was in the bulls-eye. With traffic support from the Tennessee Highway Patrol, ICE began detaining people in South Nashville; the operation ended with 196 arrests.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 95 arrestees had prior criminal convictions and 31 were already removed from the U.S. and “reentered the U.S. illegally,” but the arrests did not end there.

“Right now, the community is at incredible risk. And there is palpable fear throughout the community,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director at the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition.

Sherman Luna added that the high number of deportations would not be possible without what is known as a 287(g) agreement, which allows local Tennessee law enforcement to work with ICE. Homeland Security calls it a “force multiplier“ in ramping up deportations, but for Sherman Luna, it is a negative. She says Tennessee went from only two 287(g) agreements up to several dozen.

“It is a program that is rife with civil rights violations, that is incredibly costly to local governments, and erodes trust with local law enforcement within the community,” she said. “Now, if you’re an immigrant, you’re not going to call law enforcement when you’ve been a victim of a crime.”

According to arrest data obtained by the Deportation Data Project, ICE made 800 arrests in Tennessee in October; many of those were in jails. In the Robertson County Jail, ICE detainments went from 18 to 128 in one year. Meanwhile, in Wilson County, they increased from 22 to 110.

Congressman Andy Ogles supports ICE’s operation.

“These countries are literally emptying out their prison, they’re busing them to the Southern border, and then they’re pushing to toward the United States. We literally have been the recipient of the worst of the worst of Africa, South America and Central America because those countries no longer wanted those individuals in their countries so they sent them here. So enough is enough. We’ve got to get very serious about deportations,” said Ogles.

“The reality is that for Trump to carry out his mass deportation agenda, he has to have a broader scope. There are not enough dangerous criminals in this country to meet the goal of 1 million deportations a year,” expressed Sherman Luna.

Arrests in Tennessee have nearly doubled since last year. A DHS website lists what it calls the “worst of the worst.” Looking at Nashville arrests, the list includes Mario Romero-Beltran from El Salvador who was convicted of rape and aggravated assault; Nimia Gamez-Saucedo was convicted of drug trafficking and illegal re-entry; and Jose Herrera-Rivas was convicted of a weapons offense possessing a synthetic narcotic.

“If I have to choose between a migrant from Somalia and our wives, our daughters, our sisters, I’m going to choose to protect you rather than someone like this,” said Ogles.

“Unfortunately, I do think cruelty is at the heart of all this,” said Santiago Mueckey, associate director for advocacy at Vera Institute of Justice.

Mueckey is especially concerned about what happens to the detainees once they are in the system and removed from the public eye.

“The bigger issue is that more than 96% of the people detained in Tennessee are then moved out of state, mostly to Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. So not only is this completely destabilizing to communities, to families, but it presents challenges for the individuals who are detained,” added Mueckey.

Mueckey says by moving them out of state, detainees have a hard time connecting with their families and securing a lawyer.

“Out of the close to 6,000 people who have been detained in Tennessee, more than two-thirds of them don’t have legal representation,” he said. “And I keep coming back to legal representation because it really is the last line of defense.”

Looking at the economy locally, according to the Vera Institute, about three quarters of the immigrant population in Davidson County alone takes part in the workforce.",https://www.wkrn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2025/12/immigration_ice_12062025_AP25157540699407.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 17:57:54.150039

Under Chhabria's order, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services can share with ICE the basic biographical, contact and location information outlined in his order starting on Jan. 5","A federal judge in California this week allowed officials to share some Medicaid information — including addresses and phone numbers — with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help that agency in its efforts to identify, arrest and deport immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally.

The ruling amounts to a partial legal victory for the Trump administration and its efforts to carry out a deportation operation of unprecedented proportions.

U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria said in an order Monday the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, can receive biographical, contact and location information from the Medicaid program, for immigration enforcement purposes. That can include the immigration status of individuals, their address, phone number and date of birth.

""Congress could not have made a clearer statement about DHS's entitlement to certain data from other agencies, and that entitlement would be meaningless if it did not also obligate agencies to comply with DHS's legitimate data requests,"" Chhabria wrote in his order.

Chhabria said ICE's data requests must be limited to people in the U.S. unlawfully. He blocked the agency from having access to a broader set of Medicaid information, including sensitive medical records and data on American citizens and lawful permanent residents.

Generally speaking, immigrants in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for Medicaid or most federal benefits, but states are required to provide emergency care to anyone, regardless of their immigration status. And some Democratic-led states also offer certain health benefits to immigrants who lack legal status.

A group of roughly 20 Democratic-led states, led by California, had challenged the Trump administration's immigration information-sharing effort, saying it will deter immigrants from seeking critical medical care.

The Trump administration, on the other hand, has said the policy will allow officials to better enforce federal immigration law. In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the ruling was a ""victory for the rule of law and American taxpayers.""

""President Trump consistently promised to protect Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries,"" McLaughlin added. ""To keep that promise after Joe Biden flooded our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens, CMS and DHS will ensure that illegal aliens do not receive Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.""

The court rejected the federal government’s conditions, stating that they were not “consistent with Congressional intent or FEMA’s mission.”

“The court saw through FEMA’s attempt to break the law and deny money that North Carolina relies on to respond to hurricanes, natural disasters, and other emergencies,” Jackson said in the release. “Our state is going to get back the $17 million that Congress promised so that our emergency responders and law enforcement officers are ready to respond to the next crisis.”

In Nov., Jackson sued FEMA and DHS for setting “unlawful” terms on grants without congressional approval. Congress passed a law setting how much funding each state should receive, but then the federal agencies “unlawfully” held one grant and shortened the time on another, according to the press release.

Though multiple courts said these arrests violate the First Amendment, the Department of Homeland Security begs to differ.

While an official count of these arrests is not available, ProPublica tracked at least 130 Americans — including at least 12 elected officials — who’ve been arrested for allegedly interfering with and filming agents.

In the ongoing legal battles about whether or not people can legally film ICE activity in public, at least seven federal courts have ruled that it is a First Amendment right to record law enforcement agents in public.

“If you obstruct or assault our law enforcement, we will hunt you down and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” an unnamed DHS spokesperson told Reason. The publication asked the department if it considers recording or following a law enforcement officer in a public place to be obstruction of justice.

“That sure sounds like obstruction of justice,” the DHS spokesperson said. “Our brave ICE law enforcement face a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against them.”

Straight Arrow News contacted DHS to try to clarify the agency’s legal argument, but did not receive a response.

In July, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared “violence” as being “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at,” she said.

First Amendment right, courts say

Federal courts, including the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th circuits, have ruled that the First Amendment protects the rights of people to record law enforcement agents performing their duties in the public sphere.

Adam Rose, the deputy director of advocacy for Freedom of the Press Foundation, said he’s sat in on courtrooms where the DHS’ attorneys try to argue their point.

“This DHS comment is pro-secret police and anti-American,” Rose told Straight Arrow News. “Using an unnamed spokesperson puts it on the same level as an online troll, so let’s not pretend this has any merit. Filming in public is a fundamental American right, as confirmed by federal appeals courts for decades.”

The department’s email responses to Reason seem to defy federal courts saying that the First Amendment protects the right to record police activity in public spaces.

“It’s one of the most direct public statements yet from DHS articulating a policy that treats following, recording, and revealing the identities of federal immigration officers as illegal activity,” C.J. Ciaramella wrote for Reason.“There have been months of news reports and viral showing federal immigration officers threatening, brandishing weapons, and violently detaining people for following and recording them in public.”

But most of ICE’s citizen arrests for allegedly interfering with or assaulting agents have been dropped, ProPublica reported.

“There’s a reason DHS and its counterparts keep getting humiliated in court when they pretend to be victims,” Rose told SAN. “They’re losing in front of juries, judges are calling them not credible. It’s important not to normalize this absurd language from DHS — their ‘sounds like’ doesn’t mask their intent.”

Powerful player

ICE is positioned to receive more money than any other federal law enforcement agency.

This year, Congress earmarked $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security initiatives, including a $45 billion allocation for immigration detention. Officials plan to increase its detention capacity from a daily average of 41,500 people to at least 100,000, according to Reuters.

Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’ assistant secretary for public affairs, said, “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents… We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.”

But many courts, organizations and people say that videotaping the agents in public is a First Amendment right.

“There is no doubt that DHS is deliberately threatening people who observe and record their activities,” David J. Bier, the director of immigration studies at Cato Institute, told SAN. “This is an attack on their First Amendment rights as well as accountability when agents violate people’s rights in other ways.”

Cato Institute, a libertarian organization, is among the vocal critics of ICE’s arrests of people for filming law enforcement agents. Cato, alongside groups like the ACLU, says that these arrests are unconstitutional, and that ICE has a “systematic” approach to detaining people who film agents’ arrests.

“[I]t is crucial to understand that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consider people who follow DHS and ICE agents to observe, record, or protest their operations as engaging in ‘impeding,’” Bier wrote in an article for Cato. “DHS has a systematic policy of threatening people who follow ICE or DHS agents to record their activities with detentions, arrests, and violence, and agents have already chased, detained, arrested, charged, struck, and shot at people who follow them.”

The ACLU is another group that is an active opponent of these ICE arrests. Scarlet Kim, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told SAN that it is a core First Amendment right to record publicly visible law enforcement activity.

“It creates an independent record of what officers are doing, and it is no accident that some of the most high-profile cases of misconduct have involved video recordings,” Kim said. “The burning question is why ICE officers feel the need to hide who they are and what they do from the public — masking their faces, lacking visible ID, driving unmarked vehicles, and now attacking those who document their activities.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2226092192_Dominic_GwinnGetty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 19:56:20.258130

Likewise, Hasen said, Trump could spread misinformation to undermine confidence in vote tallies, as he has done routinely ahead of elections.","If history is a guide, Republicans stand a good chance of losing control of the House of Representatives in 2026. They have just a slim majority in the chamber, and the incumbent party usually gives up seats in midterm elections.

President Trump, whose loss of the House halfway through his first term led to two impeachments, is trying to keep history from repeating — and doing so in ways his opponents say are intended to manipulate next year’s election landscape.

He has rallied his party to remake congressional maps across the country to create more conservative-leaning House seats, an effort that could end up backfiring on him. He’s directed his administration to target Democratic politicians, activists and donors. And, Democrats worry, he’s flexing his muscles to intervene in the midterms like no administration ever has.

Democrats and other critics point to how Trump has sent the military into Democratic cities over the objections of Democratic mayors and governors. They note that he’s pushed the Department of Homeland Security to be so aggressive that at one point its agents handcuffed a Democratic U.S. senator. And some warn that a Republican-controlled Congress could fail to seat winning candidates if Democrats reclaim the House majority, recalling Trump’s efforts to stay in power even after voters rejected him in 2020, leading to the violent attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol.

Regarding potential military deployments, Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, told the Associated Press: “What he is going to do is send those troops there, and keep them there all the way through the next election, because guess what? If people are afraid of leaving their house, they’re probably not going to leave their house to go vote on Election Day. That’s how he stays in power.”

Military to the polls, or fearmongering?

Democrats sounded similar alarms just before November’s elections, and yet there were no significant incidents. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a frequent Trump antagonist who also warns about a federal crackdown on voting in 2026, predicted that masked immigration agents would show up at the polls in his state, where voters were considering a ballot measure to counter Trump’s redistricting push.

There were no such incidents in November, and the measure to redraw California’s congressional lines in response to Trump’s efforts elsewhere won in a landslide.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the concerns about the midterms come from Democratic politicians who are “fearmongering to score political points with the radical left flank of the Democrat party that they are courting ahead of their doomed-to-fail presidential campaigns.”

She described their concerns as “baseless conspiracy theories.”

Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, denied that Trump was planning to use the military to try to suppress votes.

“I say it is categorically false, will not happen. It’s just wrongheaded,” she told Vanity Fair for an interview that was published earlier in December.

DNC litigation director Dan Freeman said he hasn’t seen an indication that Trump will send immigration enforcement agents to polling places during the midterms, but is wary.

He said the DNC filed public records requests in an attempt to learn more about any such plans and is drafting legal pleadings it could file if Trump sends armed federal agents to the polls or otherwise intervenes in the elections.

“We’re not taking their word for it,” Freeman said in an interview.

States, not presidents, run elections

November’s off-year elections may not be the best indicator of what could lie ahead. They were scattered in a handful of states, and Trump showed only modest interest until late in the fall when his Department of Justice announced it was sending federal monitors to California and New Jersey to observe voting in a handful of counties. It was a bureaucratic step that had no impact on voting, even as it triggered alarm from Democrats.

Alexandra Chandler, the legal director of Defend Democracy, a group that has clashed with Trump over his role in elections, said she was heartened by the lack of drama during the 2025 voting.

“We have so many positive signs we can look to,” Chandler said, citing not only a quiet election but GOP senators’ resistance to Trump’s demands to eliminate the filibuster and the widespread resistance to Trump’s demand that television host Jimmy Kimmel lose his job due to his criticism of the president. “There are limits” on Trump’s power, she noted.

“We will have elections in 2026,” Chandler said. “People don’t have to worry about that.”

Under the Constitution, a president has limited tools to intervene in elections, which are run by the states. Congress can help set rules for federal elections, but states administer their own election operations and oversee the counting of ballots.

When Trump tried to single-handedly revise election rules with a sweeping executive order shortly after returning to office, the courts stepped in and stopped him, citing the lack of a constitutional role for the president. Trump later promised another order, possibly targeting mail ballots and voting machines, but it has yet to materialize.

DOJ voter data request ‘should frighten everybody’

Still, there’s plenty of ways a president can cause problems, said Rick Hasen, a UCLA law professor.

Trump unsuccessfully pushed Georgia’s top election official to “find” him enough votes to be declared the winner there in 2020 and could try similar tactics in Republican-dominated states in November. Likewise, Hasen said, Trump could spread misinformation to undermine confidence in vote tallies, as he has done routinely ahead of elections.

It’s harder to do that in more lopsided contests, as many in 2025 turned into, Hasen noted.

“Concerns about Trump interfering in 2026 are real; they’re not frivolous,” Hasen said. “They’re also not likely, but these are things people need to be on guard for.”

One administration move that has alarmed election officials is a federal demand from his Department of Justice for detailed voter data from the states. The administration has sued the District of Columbia and at least 21 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, after they refused to turn over all the information the DOJ sought.

“What the DOJ is trying to do is something that should frighten everybody across the political spectrum,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department voting rights attorney and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. “They’re trying to use the power of the executive to bully states into turning over highly sensitive data — date of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license, the Holy Trinity of identity theft — hand it over to the DOJ for who knows what use.”

‘Voter protection’ versus ‘election integrity’

Voting rights lawyers and election officials have been preparing for months for the midterms, trying to ensure there are ways to counter misinformation and ensure state election systems are easy to explain. Both major parties are expected to stand up significant campaigns around the mechanics of voting: Democrats mounting what they call a “voter protection” effort to monitor for problems while Republicans focus on what they call “election integrity.”

Freeman, the DNC litigation director who previously worked in the DOJ’s voting section, said his hiring this year was part of a larger effort by the DNC to beef up its in-house legal efforts ahead of the midterms. He said the committee has been filling gaps in voting rights law enforcement that the DOJ has typically covered, including informing states that they can’t illegally purge citizens from their voter rolls.

Tina Barton, co-chair of the Committee for Safe & Secure Elections, a coalition of law enforcement and election officials who advise jurisdictions on deescalation and how to respond to emergencies at polling places, says interest in the group’s trainings has “exploded” in recent weeks.

“There’s a lot at stake, and that’s going to cause a lot of emotions,” Barton said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/166dfe2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7402x3886+0+524/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F9a%2F3dc380d046cba1b90269841ab2e8%2Ff33eee354ef14343be819efae9d9d415.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:12:26.361645

The complaint cites federal law that states, “an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State … for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit … without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.”

I’m only suggesting the issues surrounding the detention and release of illegal entrants are not as clear-cut as all those jurists believe.","Judge Robert Pitman of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (W.D. Tex.) issued an order last week in Siac Guzman v. Bondi, directing DHS to release from immigration custody an alien who entered illegally 19 years ago and who was arrested at his home on Halloween. Such orders have been commonplace since DHS changed its detention policies earlier this year, but are they correct? The answer likely isn’t as clear cut as a lot of jurists seem to believe.

Section 235(b) versus Section 236(a)

Section 236(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) permits immigration officers to arrest aliens on administrative warrants “pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States”.

Once they are arrested, section 236(a) gives immigration officers three options: (1) to “continue to detain the arrested alien”; (2) to release the alien on a bond of not less than $1,500; or (3) to release the alien under a little-used authority known as “conditional parole”, which is different from the more commonly utilized “parole” under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the INA.

Certain aliens arrested on warrant under section 236(a) of the INA are not eligible for release, however.

Specifically, section 236(c) of the INA bars the release of any alien inadmissible on the criminal grounds of removal in section 212(a)(2) of the INA and the “security and related” grounds in section 212(a)(3) of the INA, as well as certain aliens who are deportable under the criminal grounds in section 237(a)(2) and security grounds in section 237(a)(4) of the INA.

Finally, an amendment to section 236(c) in Pub. L. 119-1, the “Laken Riley Act”, bars the release of aliens inadmissible because they are “present without admission or parole” under section 212(a)(6)(A) of the INA, because they sought admission through fraud under section 212(a)(6)(C) of the INA, or because they lack proper entry documents under section 212(a)(7) of the INA who have been “charged with”, “arrested for”, or “convicted of”, or who “admits having committed, or admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of” certain crimes.

So far, so good.

The problem is a different section of the INA: Section 235 (which I refer to as the “inspection protocol”) mandates the detention of all “applicants for admission” to the United States and thus is seemingly at odds with the release provisions in section 236(a) of the INA.

“Admission” is defined in section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA as “the lawful entry of [an] alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer”, while section 235(a)(1) of the INA” defines “applicant seeking admission” as:

An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) . . ..

More specifically (and importantly), section 235(a)(1) of the INA defines that term “for purposes of” title II, chapter 4 of the INA – which includes section 236(a).

In any event, the inspection protocol gives immigration officers two options for dealing with applicants for admission who are removable under 212(a)(6)(C) for seeking admission through fraud or who lack proper entry documents and therefore are removable under section 212(a)(7) of the INA.

Under section 235(b)(1), immigration officers can subject such aliens to “expedited removal”, which permits the immigration officers to issue a removal order to such alien provided the alien hasn’t been found to have a “credible fear” of persecution or torture.

If DHS goes that route, section 235(b)(1) of the INA mandates that the alien be detained “pending a final determination of credible fear of persecution and, if found not to have such a fear, until removed”, and also requires DHS to detain aliens who were subject to expedited removal but found to have a credible fear pending “further consideration of the application for asylum” by an immigration judge.

Alternatively, section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA permits immigration officers to process those aliens subject to removal under sections 212(a)(6)(C) and 212(a)(7) of the INA the same way it deals with every other inadmissible “applicant for admission” by placing them into removal proceedings (under section 240 of the INA) before an immigration judge.

Again, however, section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA mandates those aliens also be detained, as is clear from the language therein, which states in pertinent part:

in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section [240 of the INA]. [Emphasis added.]

I’ll explain the highlights below, but for now just keep them in mind.

There is one more wrinkle to add to this analysis.

“Expedited removal” under section 235(b)(1) of the INA only applies to aliens encountered by CBP at the borders and the ports, and – at the executive branch’s option pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the INA – to any other alien who is removable under sections 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) who:

has not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility under this subparagraph. [Emphasis added.]

That highlight will also be explained below.

DHS Changes Its Detention Interpretation, and EOIR Follows Suit

The inspection protocol in section 235 was added to the INA by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), and for 29 years thereafter various administrations offered differing opinions on how the detention mandates therein were to be applied.

In its 2005 opinion in Matter of X-K-, for example, the BIA held that aliens subject to expedited removal who were placed into section 240 removal proceedings before an immigration judge following a credible fear finding were eligible for release on bond.

That was plainly at odds with the language of section 235(b)(1), but it wasn’t until more than a year after the Supreme Court concluded in its 2018 opinion in Jennings v. Rodriguez that aliens detained under sections 235(b)(1)(B)(ii) and 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA aren’t entitled to EOIR bond redeterminations that then-AG William Barr issued his own opinion (Matter of M-S-) overruling Matter of X-K-.

One constant interpretation throughout that period, however, was that aliens who entered illegally, evaded apprehension, and were arrested in the interior were eligible for bond under section 236(a) of the INA.

That changed, however, in July when acting ICE Director Todd Lyons issued a memo (as yet unpublished) “declar[ing] that immigrants who arrived in the United States illegally are no longer eligible for a bond hearing as they fight deportation proceedings in court”.

Thereafter, in September, the BIA issued an opinion in Matter of Yajure-Hurtado concluding that illegal entrants remain “applicants for admission” up to the point they’re either admitted or removed and therefore remain subject to mandatory detention under section 235(b) of the INA – essentially blessing Lyons’s interpretation.

Siac Guzman v. Bondi

That brings me to Judge Pitman’s recent order in Siac Guzman, which largely focuses on the tension between discretionary release in section 236(a) of the INA and mandatory detention under 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA.

The court concedes that the term “applicant for admission” in section 235(a)(1) of the INA “would be a broad enough category to include an individual like” Siac Guzman, “who was not admitted to the United States, regardless of how long” he has “resided in the United States”.

In other words, the judge found that Siac Guzman is subject to the inspection protocol.

But Judge Pitman concluded the alien is not subject to mandatory detention under section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA even though he’s an applicant for admission.

That’s because, the court found, Siac Guzman is not also “seeking admission”, a ""requirement” Judge Pitman reads “to mean a noncitizen [sic] present in the United States without admission who has recently arrived and is actively seeking admission, not a noncitizen [sic] who has been residing in the country for years”. (Emphasis in the original.)

Judge Pitman is not alone in reaching that conclusion, and in fact cites to a series of recent district court decisions issued post-Matter of Yajure-Hurtado that make the same finding, all premised on the conclusion that the phrase “seeking admission” in section 235(b)(2)(A) must mean something.

IIRIRA and the “Entry Doctrine”

Respectfully, however, that interpretation of section 235(b)(2)(A) ignores the history of that provision, and in particular what Congress was attempting to accomplish when it created the inspection protocol.

I’ve explained that history in-depth elsewhere, but briefly, IIRIRA was intended to eliminate a convoluted sorting process then in existence known as the “entry doctrine”.

Pursuant to that doctrine, if an alien like Siac Guzman had entered illegally “free from official restraint”, he’d be placed into deportation proceedings and would receive a broad range of procedural rights.

If an alien crossed illegally while actively pursued by an immigration officer and was apprehended, however, the alien would be placed into exclusion proceedings, with few constitutional protections.

The entry doctrine invited a lot of unnecessary litigation (check out the BIA’s opinion in Matter of G-, and you’ll understand), and so Congress in IIRIRA replaced “deportation” and “exclusion” proceedings with one unified process – “removal proceedings” under section 240 of the INA – and treated every alien who hasn’t been “admitted” as an “applicant for admission”.

“Seeking Admission”

In so doing, Congress created a legal fiction under which even illegal entrants were “applicants for admission” even though – by evading inspection at the ports – applying for “admission” as defined in section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA was the last thing they intended.

Given that, no illegal entrant could be found to be “actively seeking admission”, and Judge Pitman’s logic would, expedited removal aside, scuttle the inspection protocol entirely, and frustrate Congress’s intentions in amending section 235 in IIRIRA.

Moreover, there is no limiting principle to the W.D. Tex.’s logic. At what point does “recently arrived” end, and where? Does it expire in a day, a week, a month? If an alien crosses illegally at Juarez and immediately hops a flight to Maine at El Paso, could the alien be stopped four hours later at the arrival airport and detained?

Such fine parsing is why IIRIRA ended the entry doctrine, but if Congress had the intention Judge Pitman ascribes to it, it would have defined the term “alien seeking admission” as it did with “admission” and “applicant seeking admission”.

Congress didn’t, and therefore the only way that term can logically be read in section 235(b)(2)(A) is in the context of the phrase as a whole, “an alien seeking admission” who “is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted”, and in the context of section 240(c)(2)(A) of the INA, which places the burden on an “applicant for admission” to prove “the alien is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section” 212 of the INA.

Simply put, if “aliens seeking admission” have shown they are not inadmissible during the inspection process, Congress in section 235(b)(2)(A) is saying that they are to be admitted, not detained. It’s only when they fail to do so that the detention mandate kicks in.

That’s the most logical interpretation, and the only one that doesn’t actively subvert Congress’s intentions in the rest of section 235.

The Section 236 Conundrum

That still leaves the issue of sections 236(a) and (c), the former permitting the discretionary release of certain aliens and the latter barring the release of certain (criminal and security-risk) aliens who are removable under section 212 of the INA.

One could argue that only aliens who haven’t been admitted, and who are therefore “applicants for admission” under section 235(a)(1) can be subject to inadmissibility under section 212, and that Congress thus didn’t intend the detention mandate in section 235(b)(2)(A) to apply to every applicant for admission.

There are two flaws in that logic, however.

First, aliens who have been paroled under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the INA are not subject to detention under section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA but could still be – or become – removable under the section 212 grounds of inadmissibility listed in section 236(c) (with one exception I’ll discuss below).

Given that, by my estimate, nearly 2.9 million “applicants for admission” were paroled under the Biden administration, a provision mandating their detention in specific instances would be logical.

The sole reference in section 236(c) that would undermine that conclusion is to aliens inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(A) – because they have neither been “admitted” nor “paroled” – who committed certain criminal offenses.

As noted above, that reference was added (on January 29) by the Laken Riley Act – an important point for two reasons: (1) that act was intended to force DHS to detain aliens, not release them; and (2) at that point, neither DHS nor EOIR read section 235(b)(2)(A) as mandating the detention of every illegal entrant encountered in the interior.

Congress is presumed to know how a law has been interpreted when it is amended, and therefore it’s logical to conclude the drafters of the Laken Riley Act specifically mandated the detention of alien criminals who hadn’t been admitted or paroled to ensure they would be detained.

The second flaw is that redundant detention provisions aren’t uncommon in the INA. Notably, section 241(a)(2)(A) of the INA mandates the detention of all aliens under final orders of removal and then states that “[u]nder no circumstance” shall an alien ordered removed on criminal grounds be released.

Doubling down on the detention of an alien who is an “applicant for admission” (section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA) who has committed certain criminal acts (section 236(c)(1)(E) of the INA) would be consistent with Congress’s double-detention mandate for criminals in section 241(a)(2)(A).

“Inconsistency with Prior Pronouncements”

Finally, Judge Pitman argues that the BIA’s “inconsistency” in Matter of Yajure-Hurtado “with prior pronouncements reduces even its ‘power to persuade’”.

With due respect to both the W.D. Tex. and EOIR, the BIA has a spotty record in interpreting the detention mandates in section 235 of the INA.

As noted above, the BIA misapplied the detention mandates in section 235(b)(1) of the INA in Matter of X-K- for 14 years before AG Barr issued Matter of M-S-, even though Matter of X-K- was wildly at odds with the language of the statute – a fact even I realized when I was an immigration judge, but was powerless to correct.

In fact, it wasn’t until the Supreme Court read the language of the statute plainly in Jennings that AG Barr corrected the Board’s erroneous interpretation.

“An Error Does Not Become Truth by Reason of Multiplied Propagation”

To quote Judge Dolly Gee’s 2015 order in Flores v. Lynch (quoting Gandhi): “An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does truth become error because nobody sees it.”

If that’s true with respect to the release of tens of thousands of alien families (at issue in Flores), it must also be true when applied to the detention of illegal entrant “applicants for admission” as well.

None of this is to call out Judge Pitman; his is one of at least a hundred district court orders rejecting Trump II’s interpretation of the detention mandate for illegal entrant “applicants for admission” in section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA.

Earlier this year, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, sued Vought, and ultimately secured an order from Jackson that stopped the administration from dismantling the consumer watchdog, and blocked mass firings.
Today, she added that Vought’s argument is “not a valid justification for the agency’s unilateral decision to abandon its obligations under the injunction”.
Jackson’s ruling comes just days before the agency was set to run out of the funding necessary to pay employees.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, following Jackson’s decision.","A federal judge has ordered that the Trump administration must allow funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to continue.

The watchdog, which supporters say protects US consumers from financial harm by powerful banks, lenders and corporations, is at risk of collapsing after Donald Trump vowed to shutter it since he returned to office this year.

The agency’s acting director, Russell Vought, said that since the Federal Reserve has been operating at a loss, it is unable to fund the CFPB.

In a 32-page decision, DC district judge Amy Berman Jackson said that this novel workaround by the Trump administration to “starve” the agency of funding was “manufactured by the defendants” and based solely on an office of legal counsel memo, which said that there were no “combined earnings” available from the Fed for the CFPB – since the agency doesn’t receive its appropriations from Congress.

Earlier this year, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, sued Vought, and ultimately secured an order from Jackson that stopped the administration from dismantling the consumer watchdog, and blocked mass firings. Today, she added that Vought’s argument is “not a valid justification for the agency’s unilateral decision to abandon its obligations under the injunction”.

She added that funding for the agency has continued “seamlessly” since the bureau was established in 2011, “even in the years since 2022 when the Federal Reserve’s interest expenses have exceeded its earnings”.

The US court of appeals for the DC circuit upheld Jackson’s earlier injunction and is set to hear the case on the administration’s wider attempt to dismantle the entire CFPB in February 2026. “The only new circumstance is the administration’s determination to eliminate an agency created by Congress with the stroke of pen, even while the matter is before the Court of Appeals,” Jackson wrote in today’s order, describing it as “yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court’s injunction was put in place to prevent”.

Jackson’s ruling comes just days before the agency was set to run out of the funding necessary to pay employees. In response, Elizabeth Warren – the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee – praised Tuesday’s decision. “If courts continue to uphold the law, they’ll keep blocking Russ Vought’s illegal attempts to ‘close down’ the agency that has returned $21bn directly to Americans who were cheated by big banks and giant corporations,” she said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, following Jackson’s decision.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ffdd1aafd616db1b72ff393270552fc8b4b01db/840_0_4200_3360/master/4200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c643135fde1bf46214d7b4c76f35bbfd",N,,2025-12-30 15:12:20.639723

Topline:

President Donald Trump focused on California first as his administration rolled out its crackdown on unauthorized immigration, sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and carrying out high profile raids throughout the state.

Why it matters: Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border.

What's next: California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity.

Read on... for more on what happened in 2025 and what to expect in the coming year.

In 2025, California became the frontline of a federal playbook for more militarized immigration enforcement.

Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border.

CalMatters reporters across California documented how tactics first seen in Kern County, such as warrantless traffic stops and a heavy reliance on appearance-based profiling, spread statewide and then across the country. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these methods.

Early in the second Trump administration, the federal government sent Marines to the border, citing a crisis. Those troops have since quietly gone home.

Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles following civil unrest about immigration arrests. President Donald Trump threatened to send forces to the Bay Area, then backed off. State officials objected, while federal leaders characterized the moves as necessary. The standoff deepened long-running tensions between California and the White House over the state’s sanctuary policy and federal authority.

All this fell most heavily on families with deep roots in California. CalMatters found deportations increasingly reached people who have decades-long residence, U.S.-citizen children, stable employment, and even those following legal pathways. ICE detained people at green-card interviews and routine check-ins. The changes destabilized school systems, the agricultural economy, and health care.

A federal lawsuit over a deaf asylum seeker’s prolonged detention exposed gaps in medical care and disability accommodations in immigration facilities. Under Trump, asylum seekers with pending claims lost protection from arrest. A new system is emerging where people trying to follow the rules are easier targets than those evading them. Detention centers drew scrutiny as local authorities shied away from conducting health and safety inspections, while advocates reported worsening conditions inside.

A quieter but equally consequential trend has emerged: The immigrant population shrank. Love them or hate them, Trump’s immigration policies were achieving the administration’s goals. Pew Research found the national immigration population shrank by about 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, the first decline in half a century. Economists warned about slower growth. State leaders weighed long-term impacts on the workforce, schools, and social service systems.

Enforcement grew more data-driven. Drone surveillance expanded in urban areas, and advocates warned about new uses of artificial intelligence to identify deportation targets and analyze asylum and visa applicants’ digital histories.

2026 outlook

California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity. School districts and employers are preparing for more mass removals, while lawmakers are considering new privacy protections.

For more than a century, the Rose Parade has delighted audiences across Southern California with its colorful, elaborate floats and fanfare.

The parade will celebrate its 137th year when floats begin traveling through Pasadena at 8 a.m. Jan. 1, 2026. This year's theme is ""Magic in Teamwork,"" and Magic Johnson is the Grand Marshal.

This year, for the first time in two decades, rain appears to be highly likely on parade day. Rain conditions are rare for the legendary parade.

Showing off SoCal weather, in fact, was one of the main drivers of the parade's creation.

As the Pasadena Tournament of Roses website recounts, Charles F. Holder led Valley Hunt Club members in creating the parade in 1890, saying: “In New York, people are buried in snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let’s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.”

Nearly one year after fires destroyed thousands of homes in L.A. County, many families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors. That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published this morning.

The numbers: Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

The context: Investor activity is common following disasters. While some say they can be helpful in bringing homes back to ravaged communities, others are skeptical about their plans. Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development in Altadena.

Read on… to learn why one Altadena fire survivor sees this trend as “disaster capitalism” coming for the diverse foothill community.

Shortly after the Eaton Fire destroyed thousands of homes in and around Altadena, signs sprung up across the community announcing “Altadena is not for sale.”

Now, nearly one year later, hundreds of Altadena families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors.

That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published Tuesday.

Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

“It's not uncommon to see that when disasters hit a place, investors come in,” said Sheharyar Bokhari, Redfin’s principal economist. “It's hard to value a vacant lot, so you could perhaps buy lower than what it should sell for and then flip it.”

More vacant lots are getting scooped up

To conduct the analysis, Redfin researchers looked at sales in the zip codes 90272 for the Pacific Palisades, 91001 for Altadena and 90265 for Malibu. They categorized buyers as investors if their names contained words or abbreviations such as LLC, Inc, Corp or Homes.

There was a marked increase of vacant lots sales in all communities, according to the report. In the Pacific Palisades, 119 lots sold in July, August and September. Altadena saw 61 lot sales. In 2024, before the fires, neither Pacific Palisades nor Altadena had any lots selling in those months.

Malibu saw some vacant lots sell in that time frame in 2024. But before the fires, only about 21% of those sales were to investors.

The findings are similar to those in a separate report published in October by the nonprofit Strategic Actions for a Just Economy. That report found that 49% of sales in the Eaton Fire burn zone went to corporate entities.

Zaire Calvin lost his family’s home in Altadena and had a sister who died in the fire. He said the trend shows “disaster capitalism” poised to change the diverse foothill community.

“If rebuilding becomes a race for capital instead of a return home for families, then disaster has been basically repackaged as opportunity for those with the most resources,” Calvin said. “It's like they're preying on us while we're still praying for hope and help.”

Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development..

Assembly Bill 851, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in October, outlawed unsolicited offers on properties in burn zones until 2027.

The nonprofit Greenline Housing Foundation has been buying lots from distressed sellers in Altadena, giving them an alternative to more bottom-line driven investors. The organization has said it intends to rebuild homes and sell them at below market prices to first-time buyers.

Corporate buyers: disaster capitalists or helpful rebuilders?

Bokhari, the Redfin economist, said investor activity is not entirely detrimental to communities recovering from disaster.

“Investors who have a lot more capital can come in and build that community,” he said. They can afford to clean up lingering environmental damage and build homes that comply with the latest fire safety codes, he said.

“Investors play that role in bringing back those homes,” Bokhari said.

Still, uncertainty around investors’ plans have left many Altadenans anxious. Will homes be for sale or for rent? How will those homes look? Will investor-built properties give Black families a way to continue building generational wealth in a historically Black corner of L.A. County?

Lori Gay, president and CEO of Neighborhood Housing Services of L.A. County, said in the grand scheme of L.A. real estate, not many lots in Altadena are trading hands so far. Only 61 lots in the community sold in July, August and September according to the Redfin report.

“More will go up for sale over time,” Gay said. But in her organization’s work advising families on how to rebuild, she said, “Most families we’ve seen want to go back home. They’re not trying to leave. They’re trying to figure out how to stay.”

Good Tuesday morning. I’m Kimberly Leonard, guest-writing Playbook from sunny Miami, where I live and write Florida Playbook. Get in touch.

DRIVING THE DAY

AN (ALMOST) CONGRESSIONAL ARRAIGNMENT: The now-postponed arraignment for Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida could have been just a short, humdrum court proceeding. But the scene that unfolded outside the C. Clyde Atkins U.S. Courthouse in Miami yesterday became so much more as multiple political storylines converged.

A dozen journalists surrounded Cherfilus-McCormick as she entered the federal courthouse with her husband and lawyers just across the street from where President Donald Trump had faced his own arraignment over classified documents in 2023.

Cherfilus-McCormick, 46, has been charged with allegedly stealing $5 million in overpaid federal disaster funds — then using the money toward her congressional campaign and a 3.14-carat yellow diamond ring. (There was no stone in sight yesterday.)

As they walked up the courthouse steps, the member of Congress and her lawyers ignored questions from Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio. Holding a mic and accompanied by a cameraperson, he demanded to know why her indictment should be treated differently from that of former GOP Rep. George Santos of New York, whose colleagues expelled him from Congress following numerous criminal charges including misuse of campaign funds. (He was eventually sentenced for wire fraud and identity theft.)

Tarrio told Playbook the scene reminded him of his own initial court appearance in Miami that resulted in a 22-year sentence in DC for seditious conspiracy for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection.

In a January 2022 interview with PBS News, Cherfilus-McCormick accused the Proud Boys of trying to intimidate Black voters at her special election.

“On a personal level it’s sweet justice,” Tarrio said, referring to how Democrats publicized his sentencing. Trump pardoned Tarrio in January.

The drama inside the courtroom was more subdued, playing out in less than five minutes. Magistrate Judge Lisette Reid gave the member of Congress the three more weeks her lawyer, David Markus, said she needed to officially retain his legal team, and the arraignment got bumped to Jan. 20, 2026. While that punted Cherfilus-McCormick’s official plea, she has repeatedly said she’s innocent, including yesterday.

Markus is the same lawyer representing Ghislaine Maxwell in ongoing legal matters stemming from her conviction for involvement in her late boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network. But it was what Markus said upon exiting the courthouse that drove the day’s news: He accused “folks within the Florida Democratic Party” of targeting his client and said his team would be “exposing” those involved. He didn’t elaborate.

Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried notably hasn’t weighed in on the indictment. Yet the comments about possible intraparty strife come just as the beleaguered state party had otherwise ended the year with glimmers of hope after a Democrat was elected Miami mayor.

Cherfilus-McCormick’s seat is safely blue. Trump lost it by nearly 40 points in 2024, according to the Downballot. But her charges and claims of her own party’s involvement threaten to distract Florida Democrats as they go up against a much better-funded and organized Florida GOP, especially as national Democrats warn that failing to compete in the South could make a future presidential victory nearly impossible.

Former Broward County Mayor Dale Holness, who lost the Democratic nomination to Cherfilus-McCormick in 2021 by five votes, said candidates should be focused on affordability and stressed he viewed the state party as “working hard to rebuild itself.”

“Everyone deserves their day in court,” said Holness, who’s among those running for the seat again. “I don’t know the spin the attorney is putting on it now.”

If convicted, Cherfilus-McCormick is facing more than five decades in prison. She’s the only member of Congress of Haitian descent and has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration’s travel ban and immigration restrictions. Florida has half a million residents with ties to Haiti, which is facing gang violence and political instability.

While Cherfilus-McCormick stepped down from her subcommittee leadership role, some Florida Republicans have called for her to be expelled, pointing to Santos’ 2023 ouster.

Santos — who’s moving to Florida fresh off the heels of a Trump clemency — agrees. “I was denied due process and that is the standard that was set by the House,” he said. “I don’t like it — but fair is fair. She needs to go.”

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. DEEP DIVE: POLITICO’s Daniel Lippman, Sophia Cai and Daniel Barnes have an in-depth story this morning about how Paul Ingrassia has survived in the Trump administration. The 30-year-old lawyer pulled his nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel after POLITICO reported that he said he has a “Nazi streak,” according to texts. He is now the acting general counsel at the General Services Administration, after two previous jobs as White House liaison to DOJ and DHS.

“His almost Trumpian survival demonstrates how ideological affinity and personal loyalty can outweigh all other considerations in this administration,” the authors write. “And while top officials in the Republican Party and White House have split between denouncing bigoted language exhibited by officials like Ingrassia and forming a defensive line around supporters, the messages don’t appear to have hurt his official standing.” A lawyer for Ingrassia did not confirm the texts were authentic and said at the time they “could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted.” The lawyer and Ingrassia did not comment for this story.

2. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Bowl blitz: Abdul El-Sayed’s campaign for the U.S. Senate in Michigan is airing the last of its football-themed, nearly six-figure statewide ads during the Citrus Bowl on New Year’s Eve, which will see Texas take on the University of Michigan, El-Sayed’s alma mater. In promoting the ad, which features him throwing the pigskin, El-Sayed’s campaign said that “College football remains one of the last places where Michiganders can come together across political divides, age, and background.”

But El-Sayed, who captained his high school football team, has expressed a more complicated relationship with the game in the past, Playbook’s Adam Wren reports. In his now private Substack called “The Incision,” EL-Sayed wrote of the “toxic masculinity at the heart of America’s most popular sport.” He also wrote that “on the sidelines and in the locker room, I was fed a hefty dose of the worst kinds of racist taunting. On an episode of the podcast “America Dissected,” El-Sayed said football “takes some of the most egregious narratives that we tell ourselves about who we are as a country. And it puts it on the field every Sunday.”

Asked for comment, an El-Sayed spokesperson said: “Abdul’s love of football isn’t theoretical. It’s up close and personal, earned snap after snap and tackle after tackle. Football taught him so much about leadership and community — but also about the risks and who bears them. Abdul knows that loving something means pushing it to be better. That’s the same approach he’ll bring to the U.S. Senate: identify the problem honestly and directly so we can find real solutions, and then fight to make things better for everyone, not just the people at the top.”

3. VENEZUELA VEX: The CIA carried out a drone strike earlier this month on a port facility on the coast of Venezuela — marking the first known attack inside the country and a major escalation of the administration’s pressure campaign, CNN’s Natasha Bertrand and colleagues scoop. The strike targeted the dock believed to be storing drugs, and there were no casualties. The report came after Trump told reporters yesterday about hitting a facility, calling it a “major explosion” but remaining mum on details, per WSJ’s Dustin Volz. And on the oil front, the squeeze on Venezuela via the blockade is causing the country to shutter some of its oil wells, as they run out of storage space, per Bloomberg.

4. WAR AND PEACE: Despite simmering tensions on the way forward on Gaza and Iran, Trump and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu projected a united front while doling out the usual praise for each other, NYT’s Tyler Pager and David Halbfinger report. Little was said publicly about their talks over the multi-course lunch at Mar-a-Lago, including on how the Gaza peace plan will advance into the second phase. Trump did heap some pressure on Hamas, saying they have a “very short period of time” to disarm, adding there will be “hell to pay” if they don’t, per Bloomberg.

Trump’s strongest commitment was on Iran, stating he will back more strikes on the country should they rebuild their nuclear capabilities, POLITICO’s Alex Gangitano writes from Palm Beach. “And if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” Trump said. He added that he heard Iran may want to make a deal, but otherwise he would support an Israeli strike. Trump also paid reporters a surprise visit on the Mar-a-Lago patio, Alex writes in to Playbook. He pointed to an area where there was the family of Ran Gvili, a deceased hostage in Gaza. “They’re waiting for their son to come home. From Israel. Their son is a very brave soldier and that’s the only body.” His mother said they are going to bring her son home.

Trump’s other headache: After a hopeful meeting this weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy where Trump declared a peace deal could be “very close,” Russia is once again throwing cold water on the prospect, POLITICO’s Eli Stokols and Diana Nerozzi write. The Kremlin vowed to turn up hostilities after an attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s property. The latest disagreement signals the sides remain far apart on peace, Eli and Diana write.

5. HEALTH OF A NATION: “Trump admin doles out billions for rural health,” by POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein and Ruth Reader: “The Trump administration on Monday doled out billions to states from a fund Congress created to ‘transform; rural health care. The funds, however, will be lavished more generously on small states and states that adopt administration friendly policies. … [CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz] said disbursements for states are between $145 million and $281 million for 2026, amounts largely driven by how large a state’s rural population is. … even fans of the program stress that it won’t come close to making up for the deep cuts to Medicaid that states are bracing for in 2026.”

The bigger picture: “Inside RFK Jr.’s reshaping of public health in Trump’s first year,” by WaPo’s Rachel Roubein and colleagues: “Interviews with almost 100 people reveal how Kennedy, as health secretary, has reshaped the vaccine and broader public health infrastructure in less than a year.”

6. 2026 WATCH: With current members of Congress weighing reelection, “the direction of travel is toward the door,” but there’s another growing trend: former members looking to come back, WaPo’s Anna Liss-Roy writes. At least 18 former members are jockeying to win back a seat. And the reaction from current lawmakers is telling: “I’ve had so many members ask me if I need a wellness check,” Ben McAdams said. “They’re like, ‘Cori, we love that you’re running again, but why would you want to come back? You’re free,’” Cori Bush told WaPo. For a running tally of all the retirees in Congress next year, AP has you covered.

Redistricting rodeo: The new maps approved in California made some districts more competitive for Democrats, and now they’re intensifying the Democratic Party’s civil war about which faction should carry its mantle — moderates or progressives, POLITICO’s Blake Jones reports. And in Rep. David Valadao’s (R-Calif.) district, NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s team is crafting Democrat Randy Villegas’ media strategy and “going for the jugular.” … Next up, Utah’s state Republican lawmakers will appeal to the state’s Supreme Court which could determine the future of its maps, per Deseret News’ Brigham Tomco.

Happening tonight: Iowa’s special state Senate election. Should Republicans take the Democratic-leaning district, they’ll regain a supermajority and secure their control on state government, per AP.

7. LIVE FROM NEW YORK: “The Making of Mayor Mamdani,” by NY Mag’s David Freedlander: “Mamdani’s revolution, in this moment before he takes office, has two defining qualities. The first is the well-known movement-building skill of the man. …The second is a certain sense of unreality — a tension between what he promises he will do and what the normal laws of political physics would seem to allow. … The two qualities — the scintillating political skill and the strangeness of a 34-year-old democratic socialist just a few years removed from a music career taking control and pledging enormous changes without meaningful compromise — exist side by side, and how they resolve will define Mamdani’s mayoralty.”

8. IMMIGRATION FILES: A federal judge ruled yesterday that the Trump administration can move forward with sharing location data on undocumented immigrants receiving public health benefits with ICE officials, starting Jan. 6, POLITICO’s Tyler Katzenberger reports. The ruling is a victory for Trump’s push for mass deportations, and a significant setback for Califonia AG Rob Bonta and the Democratic attorneys general who sued back in July.

Deportation drive: “The Trump administration’s plan to close a ‘huge loophole’ in legal immigration,” by POLITICO’s Myah Ward and Eric Bazail-Eimil: “The Trump administration’s strategy was bolstered in October when the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals, an administrative body that oversees immigration courts, said judges should weigh third-country removal before an asylum case is considered in the U.S. … in November, DHS attorneys asked judges to dismiss nearly 5,000 cases, more than twice the amount in October and four times the amount in September … Immigration attorneys and advocates, alarmed by the latest trend, argue that it’s a further erosion of the U.S. asylum system in the United States.”

ICE told Fox News they're on the ground in Minneapolis investigating allegations of fraud involving child care centers, as authorities follow a sprawling money trail that federal prosecutors say could ultimately total more than $9 billion.

""We're learning a lot,"" ICE Director Todd Lyons told ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday.

Lyons shared that the agency is looking into possible criminal and terrorist ties overseas, adding that the probe speaks to the breadth of ICE's work.

""[We're] going with criminal warrants to conduct these investigations,"" he said.

""All too often you hear that ICE is just out there terrorizing the community or conducting administrative work. We've been on the ground in Minnesota conducting criminal investigations and Homeland Security investigations [and have] gone door to door to a lot of these suspected fraud sites all over St. Paul and Minnesota.""

The investigation follows widespread fraud allegations, including ones stemming from a viral video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley showing visits to several Minnesota daycare facilities, including Quality Learning Center in Minneapolis, which appeared inactive during the visit despite receiving state childcare assistance funds.

Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families Commissioner Tikki Brown said during a Monday news conference that prior inspections of the sites – which occurred at random and within the last six months – did not uncover fraud and children were active at the sites.

Brown additionally acknowledged questions about the timing of the video visits, noting that regulators are seeking clarity on whether footage was recorded during operating hours or on days when centers were scheduled to be open.

""While we have questions about some of the methods that were used in the video, we do take the concerns that the video raises about fraud very seriously,"" she said.

A spokesperson for Gov. Tim Walz also addressed the swath of fraud allegations plaguing the state, saying, ""The governor has worked for years to crack down on fraud and asked the state legislator for more authority to take aggressive action. He has strengthened oversight.""

Lyons criticized Minnesota's policies, alleging that ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions allow bad actors to ""hide in plain sight"" and commit crimes.

In today’s issue:

▪ Trump admin targets Minnesota

▪ Trump consumed with foreign policy

▪ U.S. strikes facility in Venezuela

▪ Iowa state Senate election

A fraud scandal plaguing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) has drawn the ire of many Republicans and those in the Trump administration, The Hill’s Sarah Fortinsky reports. The state and its governor are facing national backlash following a viral video that made headlines showing a day care facility that appeared inactive despite receiving significant funding.

This comes amid an already launched investigation into the state’s safety net programs.

And on Monday, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said she sent agents door to door at suspected fraud sites as part of the broader investigation launched earlier this month.

“DHS is on the ground in Minneapolis, going DOOR TO DOOR at suspected fraud sites. The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found,” readsa post from DHS’s account on social platform X.

The viral video, released Friday by independent journalist Nick Shirley, renewed scrutiny of the governor’s handling of widespread fraud occurring in some state-run programs, Fortinsky reports.

Many have sought to blame the Democratic governor for failing to sufficiently crack down on the issue, while Walz’s office has sought to defend the governor’s handling of the situation.

A spokesperson for the governor said they have “hired an outside firm to audit payments to high-risk programs, shut down the Housing Stabilization Services program entirely, announced a new statewide program integrity director, and supported criminal prosecutions.”

Walz has criticized the administration’s actions but has said consistently that anyone committing fraud should go to prison.

Additionally, Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Kelly Loeffler said Monday on X that she is pausing annual funding to Minnesota while the SBA investigates fraud.

Leading the Day

TRUMP’S YEAR-END POLICY FOCUS: Trumphas spent the last week of the year focused on foreign policy while residing at Mar-a-Lago, where he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ending the war with Russia and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss ongoing peace efforts in Gaza, disarming Hamas, strikes in Iran and an “understanding” regarding Syria.

He announced military strikes against ISIS in Nigeria on Christmas Day and revealed he targeted a Venezuelan facility on Dec. 26. This string of events at the end of the year underscores the president’s focus on foreign policy during his second term, The Hill’s Brett Samuels reports.

The president, now in his last term, is seeking to establish his legacy around the world as a dealmaker, and as a peacemaker.

▪ The Hill: Trump shows foreign policy focus to end 2025

NETANYAHU MEETING: Trump and Netanyahu on Monday were in lockstep during their after-meeting news conference, The Hill’s Filip Timotija and Colin Meyn report.

Trump said Israel had lived up to its ceasefire commitments “100 percent,” despite the U.S. reportedly scolding Netanyahu for killing a top Hamas military leader earlier this month.

A main focus was pressure on Hamas to disarm, with Trump saying the militant group would be “wiped out” if it refused to abide by its commitments in the second phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan.

Trump also expressed support for U.S. strikes against Iran for Tehran’s purported extension of its ballistic missile program as well as for Israel’s potential military action against the country. Despite the language, he reiterated the U.S. is open to holding discussions with Tehran regarding its nuclear program.

The president also said he and Netanyahu have an “understanding regarding Syria,” adding that he was “sure” Israel and Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, would get along, Timotija and Meyn report.

Trump also discussed a potential pardon for Netanyahu’s fraud and bribery charges, saying that Israeli President Isaac Herzog was on board. Herzog denied that claim.

▪ The Hill: Trump backs Israeli strikes on Iran if ballistic missile tests continue.

With this year’s focus on foreign policy and solving international disputes, many of the president’s allies have said he is deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize, with Trump himself even quipping that he deserves it during an earlier meeting with Netanyahu.

But not everyone in the president’s party agrees with Trump’s foreign policy work, including Greene, who has said the president should be more focused on domestic issues. The Georgia Republican is an outlier, however, as she’s broken with the president publicly many times recently.

Polling has shown voters, too, have not necessarily rewarded Trump for his focus on foreign affairs.

A Quinnipiac University poll published earlier this month found Trump’s overall approval was at just 40 percent, while 54 percent of survey respondents disapprove. The poll found that 41 percent approved of his handling of foreign policy, compared with 54 percent who disapproved.

US ATTACKS FACILITY IN VENEZUELA: Few details are known about an attack that Trump has said “knocked out” a “big” facility in Venezuela as the administration continues to put pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Trump said this during a Friday appearance on the “Cats & Cosby” show on New York’s WABC radio and lauded the attacks on purported drug-smuggling boats in the region, The Hill’s Filip Timotija reports.

“We just knocked out — I don’t know if you read or you saw — they have a big plant or big facility where they send the, you know, where the ships come from,” the president told hosts John Catsimatidis and Rita Cosby. “Two nights ago, we knocked that out. So we hit them very hard.”

On Monday, Trump shed some more light on the attack, saying the U.S. personnel hit an “implementation” area.

“We hit all the boats and now we hit the area, it’s the implementation area. That’s where they implement. And that is no longer around,” the president said at Mar-a-Lago while taking questions alongside Netanyahu.

Trump said there was a “major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,” adding it took place “along the shore.”

If confirmed, it would be the first land strike in Venezuela since the Trump administration began a pressure campaign against Maduro and since U.S. forces started striking alleged drug-trafficking boats in September.

ISSUES REMAIN IN UKRAINE PEACE TALKS: The president on Monday said thathe had spoken with Putin but that there were still “very thorny issues” to get through before solidifying a peace plan with Ukraine, Samuels reports.

Trump was expected to call the Russian leader following his Sunday meeting with Zelensky. And, though the exact details of which issues were the most difficult to negotiate with Putin are unclear, it is known that land ownership is a particular sticking point.

Additionally, Trump expressed frustration at Ukraine for claims from Russian officials saying that a Ukrainian drone attacked one of Putin’s residences, something Kyiv has denied, The Hill’s Ellen Mitchell reports.

“It’s one thing to be offensive. It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that. … I was very angry about it,” Trump said, adding that he learned of the alleged attack during his call with Putin.

Also, following Sunday’s meeting to discuss the Ukrainian president’s 20-point peace plan, Zelensky said Monday that he asked Trump for the U.S. to commit to security guarantees for decades, and that Trump said he would consider it.

BIGGEST EDUCATION STORIES OF 2025: Education news in 2025 was dominated by Trump’s crusade against higher education and the U.S. Department of Education, The Hill’s Lexi Lonas Cochran reports. From the president consolidating his power over education institutions to immigration affecting K-12 students, here are just a few of the main education stories of the past year:

Trump dismantles Education Department

Since taking office Trump has singled out the Department of Education as something to get rid of. And Education Secretary Linda McMahon began the process in March when she laid off half the employees at the federal agency.

The president then signed an executive order ordering the department to be dismantled as much as legally possible.

“The department’s useful functions … will be preserved, fully preserved,” he said at the time, referring to Pell Grants, Title I funding and programs for students with disabilities. “They’re going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments.”

Programs hit hardest include the Institute of Education Sciences, Federal Student Aid and the Office of Civil Rights, which recently brought back some employees because of case backlogs, Lonas Cochran reports.

Immigration crackdown

Trump has always had a firm line on immigration policy, but many students were still surprised to see so many international students with ties to pro-Palestinian campus movements arrested.

The administration has said these students are a threat to the foreign policy of the United States and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio could order their deportation.

The administration has added new rules for foreign students, most notably adding a check on students’ social media accounts when they apply for a visa.

As a result, the crackdown has led to a drop in international students’ interest in attending school in the U.S., and K-12 districts with high immigrant populations have seen a decline in attendance.

Student loan changes

Trump is handling student loan repayment much differently from former President Biden, who advanced new measures to reduce student loan debt.

Notably, the Trump administration recently announced the end of the Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) income-driven repayment option, which is almost guaranteed to raise the rates for 7 million borrowers who will need a new plan.

Republicans’ massive spending package, which passed earlier this year, also included changes to the student loan system that will drop the number of repayment options to two by 2028. One option is a standard repayment plan expecting payment within 10 to 25 years, and the other is a plan that requires 30 years of loan payments before they are forgiven.

The administration has also said it wants to remove some employers from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, as well.

Poor reading scores

Reading scores have been down since the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 was no different. Twelfth-grade reading scores from 2024 were at the lowest level since before 1992.

And at the beginning of the year, the Nation’s Report Card showed reading scores for fourth and eighth graders continued to plummet.

“These results are both heartbreaking and tragic,” Alicia Levi, president and CEO of Reading is Fundamental, said at the time. “We need to take action. … We are calling on, leaders from all sectors, public and private, to join us in this fight.”

But, as Lonas Cochran reports, the reading crisis is affecting older adults as well. A 2020 Gallup study found the reading crisis was costing the U.S. $2.2 trillion annually, with the problem likely getting worse over five years.

IOWA STATE SENATE ELECTION: Voters in Iowa will vote Tuesday in a special state Senate election that could allow Republicans to regain a supermajority in the upper chamber. The GOP already has one in the state House, but if they can win the West Des Moines-area seat formerly held by a Democrat, they can regain their tight grip on state government, The Hill’s Julia Mueller reports.

Republicans held a supermajority in the state Senate until Democrats broke it during an August special election, which added to national Democrats’ optimism during the 2025 off-year elections. Democrats in Iowa and at the national level are looking to hold on to current trends and keep their momentum going ahead of the 2026 midterms.

The race is between Renee Hardman (D) and Lucas Loftin (R), who are running against each other for the District 16 seat following the death of state Sen. Claire Celsi (D). Republicans currently enjoy a 33-16 seat advantage over Democrats in the state Senate, just one voting member shy of being able to override the governor’s veto outright.

Democrats won an August election to break the state Senate supermajority and have made Tuesday’s election a priority. And the odds are in their favor.

Celsi won the district by 16 percentage points against a Republican after redistricting in 2022 and went on to win reelection by 40 percentage points over a Libertarian Party competitor. Though Trump won Iowa last fall, then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the District 16 area by 17 percentage points.

Hardman, the first Black woman elected to the West Des Moines City Council, is currently the West Des Moines mayor pro tempore. Loftin, a political newcomer, is a longtime employee of an environmental services company and is active on boards related to homeschooling.

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee has called the race a “must-win” to protect the party’s “hard-won progress” after Iowa marked the sixth time Democrats broke a state legislature GOP supermajority in the last two years.

Democrats have enjoyed a year of expected and unexpected wins and seek to continue the trend going into 2026.

The Closer

And finally … It’s time to add Gonzaga men’s basketball coach Mark Few to the list of people disappointed with the sport’s current situation.

Coaches across college sports have lodged complaints as student-athletes are now able to receive name, image and likeness (NIL) compensation and transfer multiple times without penalty, The Hill’s Max Rego reports.

Concerns came to a head last week when 21-year-old James Nnaji, a former NBA draft pick, committed to Baylor University and was given four years of eligibility by the NCAA.

“Our lack of leadership has really shown,” Few told reporters Sunday after his team beat Pepperdine University 96-56, according to The Spokesman-Review. “Now it’s probably time to get some help from Congress, but they’re more screwed up than the NCAA.”

Few added that leaders “need to start listening to coaches” on relevant topics.

Nnaji, who was the 31st pick in the 2023 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons, has not played on an NBA or G League team. Instead, he has spent the past two-plus years playing professionally in Spain and coming to the U.S. to compete in the NBA Summer League, retaining his collegiate eligibility.

But Nnaji’s decision, and Baylor’s decision to put him on the team, has been met with condemnation by some coaches.

Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo joined Few and slammed collegiate athletics leaders for allowing this to happen.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Leading-Walz_120425_AP_Steve-Karnowski.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 18:12:24.363533

There are sixteen smaller proposed warehouses, including one in Highland Park, according to the Post's reporting.","A Michigan lawmaker says she is looking into rumors circulating online about a detention center potentially coming to Highland Park.

State Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) says she is in contact with the mayor of the Detroit-adjacent community after reporting last week identified plans by the Trump administration to build large holding centers to speed up deportations.

Chang, who represents neighborhoods including those in Highland Park, said the community was on the list of potential cities where one of these warehouses would be built.

What they're saying:

""We know that a few days ago, there was an article in the Washington Post that listed out a number of cities across our whole country — places that are going to host huge detention centers, places that are going to hold smaller detention centers and Highland Park was on that list,"" said Chang.

The state senator told FOX 2's Roop Raj she had been in touch with the local state representative and mayor of the city in hopes of getting more answers about the plans.

""We were trying to figure out if this was accurate. I still don't have the answer to that question, but it has definitely raised the alarm,"" she said. ""None of us want an ICE detention center in Highland Park.""

She said residents have reached out to her office, saying they have no interest in a facility like the one allegedly proposed by ICE being brought to Highland Park.

The backstory:

Reporting in the Washington Post on Dec. 24 found efforts by the Trump administration to overhaul the country's immigrant detention center in favor of a plan that uses industrial warehouses that hold tens of thousands of immigrant detainees at a time.

The Post cited a ""draft solicitation"" that included plans for large warehouses in Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia, and Missouri.

There are sixteen smaller proposed warehouses, including one in Highland Park, according to the Post's reporting. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security could not confirm the reporting.

FOX 2 has also reached out to the White House for comment, but has not heard back.

Dig deeper:

The Trump administration's push to ramp up deportations is part of the president's agenda that he outlined throughout his campaign.

Since taking office, the U.S. has seen its Immigration and Customs and Enforcement agency ramp up efforts at detaining immigrants in a bid to remove them from the country.

The Post cited reporting out of Arizona in which the agency's acting director advocated for treating deportations more like a business.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges if they can establish they reside in the state.
“This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country.” The Justice Department filed the lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger.
According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.
Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.","Dec 30 (Reuters) – The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit challenging a Virginia law that makes immigrants in the country illegally eligible for reduced in-state tuition and financial aid at the state’s public colleges and universities.

Monday’s lawsuit marked the latest in a campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to challenge state laws that extend tuition and financial aid benefits to non-citizens living in their states regardless of their immigration status.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges if they can establish they reside in the state.

Supporters of the measure, which was signed into law in 2021 by then-Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, argued it would remove financial barriers that had limited the ability of immigrant students in the state to pursue higher education like other Virginia residents.

The Justice Department argues the measure conflicts with federal immigration law in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it gives educational benefits to illegal immigrants that are denied to U.S. citizens from other states.

The lawsuit cites the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which restricts states’ ability to grant immigrants in the country illegally certain postsecondary education benefits.

“This is a simple matter of federal law: in Virginia and nationwide, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country.”

The Justice Department filed the lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

At least 21 other states and the District of Columbia have similar “tuition equity” laws and policies that allow certain students who graduated from high schools in their states to pay in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.

Texas and Oklahoma, both led by Republican governors, quickly settled by agreeing to consent decrees blocking enforcement of their state laws.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in California said in his ruling that the federal government can legally share ""basic biographical, location, and contact information"" with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The ruling will take effect on Jan. 6, according to court documents.

The development comes months after 20 states, including California, sued in July to prevent the federal government from sharing with ICE data obtained by the Department of Health and Human Services about immigrants receiving Medicaid benefits.

""We are disappointed in the court’s decision allowing for the sharing of some Medicaid data with ICE,"" said a statement from the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta, one of the nearly two dozen Democratic officials who sued to block the information-sharing effort.

Chhabria noted in his ruling that while basic Medicaid information can be shared with ICE, the injunction still applies to other information, including data about immigrants legally in the country.

""Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decision making process,"" Chhabria wrote.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the ruling was ""a victory for the rule of law and American taxpayers.""

Undocumented immigrants are largely ineligible for federal health benefits, and they do not qualify for comprehensive Medicaid coverage.

But some undocumented immigrants can receive treatment for life-saving procedures in emergency rooms through Emergency Medicaid, and some states – including California – allow people to receive other state-funded benefits regardless of their immigration status.

The Trump administration has pushed for agencies across the federal government to share more information with immigration authorities to power the president's deportation agenda. Judges have blocked several of those efforts.

In September, a federal judge in California temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Agriculture from collecting data about recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP. In November, a federal judge in Washington, DC blocked the IRS from sharing tax return information with ICE.

Virginia law extends eligibility to individuals who established residence in the state at least a year prior, and a student may not be disqualified based on their immigration status.

“This is not only wrong but illegal. The challenged act’s discriminatory treatment in favor of illegal aliens over citizens is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law,” the 13-page complaint states.

The DOJ filed its lawsuit in federal district court in Richmond, Va. A judge has not yet been assigned.

It adds to legal challenges the Trump administration has filed against other states over similar policies that provide migrants access to in-state tuition and education benefits.

The administration in June first sued Texas before bringing subsequent lawsuits against Kentucky, Oklahoma, Illinois and California. DOJ has reached agreements with the three red states, while Illinois and California continue to fight their lawsuits.

The Virginia suit comes as Democrats prepare to take over the state’s governor’s mansion and attorney general post next month after a series of victories in the recent elections.

The Hill has reached out to the office of Jason Miyares, Virginia’s current Republican attorney general, for comment.

The Justice Department’s lawsuit alleges Virginia’s law runs afoul of the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause by violating federal immigration law, which prohibits states from providing migrants in the country unlawfully with postsecondary education benefits denied to citizens.

""Well said… Merry Christmas,"" Bovino said, adding he would follow her X account.

When another critic brought up Swalwell’s alleged relationship with a Chinese spy named Fang Fang — which the congressman denies – Bovino quipped, ""Oh yes, how could I forget to mention that.""

Other commentators slammed Swalwell for appearing to misstate the underlying facts of why Joseph and Mary had gone to Bethlehem and why they fled to Egypt soon after Jesus Christ’s birth — a storyline immigration activists sometimes use to counter pro-border security arguments.

DHS FIRES BACK AFTER DEM LAWMAKER CLAIMS SHE WAS 'PUSHED ASIDE AND PEPPER SPRAYED' DURING ICE RAID

One cited a passage from the Gospel of Luke, which recounts that Caesar Augustus ordered a census across the Roman Empire, requiring each man to return to his ancestral town. Joseph, a descendant of King David, therefore traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, David’s birthplace.

Per the Gospel of Matthew, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him to take his family and flee to Egypt, as King Herod was seeking to kill young Jesus.

Observers often debate the connection, if any, that biblical passages have to contemporary immigration policy arguments.

Immigration hawks often cite Egypt as being a province of the Roman Empire, meaning the Holy Family did not immigrate to another country as refugees in a legal sense, but to escape Herod’s rule as a provincial king installed by Rome; similar to a governor; until his death made it safe to return to Judea.

Others dispute that characterization.

ICE DELIVERS 'GREATEST GIFT OF ALL' WITH CHRISTMAS ARRESTS OF CONVICTED CRIMINALS ACROSS MULTIPLE STATES

""Eric – Mary and Joseph were legal immigrants complying with the rules of the Roman Empire,"" conservative activist Robby Starbuck responded to the congressman.

""Rome ordered a census and Joseph had to be counted because Bethlehem was his city; basically the opposite of illegal immigration. Lying about this is Christophobic,"" he said.

Starbuck added that in the Book of Acts, God ""marked out … boundaries of their lands,"" which the commentator said was proof that secure borders have scriptural grounding.

U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley’s order does not reflect the underlying legal merits. It is intended to ensure the migrants can remain in the country until the judge considers the case more fully.

“Because of the serious consequences at stake, both for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants, the Court finds an administrative stay appropriate, as it would ‘minimize harm,’ while allowing the assigned District Court Judge the time this case deserves,” Kelley wrote in her four-page ruling.

The judge will issue a new decision after receiving written briefing through Jan. 13.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) allows migrants to stay in the U.S. and receive work authorization when they are from a country experiencing armed conflict, environmental disaster or other extraordinary conditions.

South Sudan was first designated for the program in 2011 as it gained its independence and became Africa’s youngest country. It has been plagued with war, and a State Department advisory urges Americans to avoid travel to the country.

Roughly 232 South Sudanese are currently TPS recipients, court filings indicate.

President Trump’s second administration has looked to shrink the program by revoking various countries’ TPS designations. Lawsuits remain ongoing over changes to the program regarding Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

Last month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced she had conducted a review of conditions in South Sudan and the administration was terminating the country’s TPS status after Jan. 5.

It sparked a lawsuit from individual South Sudanese TPS holders and African Communities Together, an immigrant rights organization. They claim Noem acted unlawfully by acting with racial animus against nonwhite immigrants, failing to consult with appropriate agencies and not having good reason for the decision.

Kelley, an appointee of former President Biden who serves in Boston, will consider those arguments next month. But her ruling keeps TPS in place in the meantime, ensuring recipients do not become eligible for deportation as early as next Tuesday.

The plaintiffs pleaded with the judge for the immediate intervention, warning they will otherwise face “irreparable harm, including deadly harm.”

The Trump administration urged the judge to deny the request, criticizing the plaintiffs for waiting more than six weeks after Noem’s announcement to sue and insisting an administrative stay should only serve to briefly freeze legal proceedings.

“It should not serve to directly enjoin Executive agency action, which is what Plaintiffs’ requested administrative stay would accomplish,” the Justice Department wrote in court filings Monday.

The judge rejected those arguments. She wrote that the government’s proposed approach could imminently result in some individuals’ deportations.

“Further, if their TPS expires and is eventually restored following a full consideration of the merits, any gap in immigration status for South Sudanese nationals could result in ineligibility for future relief,” Kelley wrote.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/AP25310446835020-e1767108543803.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 11:58:52.879418

By Darmin Bachu

TiE New York has formally responded in court to the lawsuit brought by charter member Kesav Dama, arguing that the case reflects an internal dispute rather than actionable misconduct and urging the court to allow the organization’s governance activities to proceed uninterrupted.

The response, filed as an opposition to an Order to Show Cause, marks the first detailed public articulation of TiE New York’s position since the litigation became public — after multiple board members, including former president Jignesh Patel and secretary Vaibhav Parikh, declined to comment for prior reporting.

At the center of the latest development is the court’s interim ruling lifting a previously issued temporary restraining order that had briefly restricted certain TiE New York governance actions.

Justice Karina E. Alomar of Queens County Supreme Court declined to extend the TRO after reviewing the parties’ submissions, allowing TiE New York to resume routine operations while the broader lawsuit continues. The ruling does not dismiss the case or resolve the merits of the allegations, but it signals that the court was not prepared—at this preliminary stage—to impose emergency restraints on the organization’s leadership.

Legal analysts note that lifting a TRO is procedurally significant but not dispositive. “It reflects the judge’s assessment that immediate irreparable harm was not sufficiently established for interim relief,” said one nonprofit litigation attorney familiar with similar cases. “It does not mean the underlying claims lack substance.”

TiE NY’s argument

In its opposition papers, TiE New York and the individual defendants characterize the lawsuit as an attempt to judicialize an internal governance disagreement. The filing argues that:

The board followed established procedures in addressing complaints;

An internal subcommittee was formed to review the allegations;

No emergency circumstances justified court-imposed restraints on elections, finances, or leadership decisions; and

The plaintiff failed to demonstrate irreparable harm warranting extraordinary relief.

DefendantsOppositionToShowCause

The defendants further contend that granting the requested relief would improperly interfere with the autonomy of a New York not-for-profit corporation and set a precedent for courts to manage internal disputes better handled through organizational processes.

As part of TiE New York’s response, former president Jignesh Patel submitted a sworn affidavit denying allegations of threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority. Patel asserts that communications cited in the complaint were taken out of context and that his actions were consistent with his duties as an officer of the organization.

The affidavit also challenges the plaintiff’s credibility and motivations, framing the dispute as a reaction to disagreements over governance and decision-making rather than misconduct.

TiE New York’s filings rely heavily on a report prepared by a board-appointed subcommittee, which concluded that the complaints did not warrant disciplinary action against Patel. The report describes interviews, document review, and deliberations undertaken by select board members tasked with evaluating the allegations.

Critics, however, have questioned the independence of the subcommittee, noting that its members were drawn from the same board accused in the lawsuit of failing to act. Those concerns are likely to feature prominently as the litigation proceeds.

Despite filing extensive court papers, TiE New York leadership has not offered on-the-record comment to the press. Patel, Parikh, and other board members again declined to respond to questions for this follow-up article, referring inquiries to court filings or offering no response at all.

The absence of public explanation has drawn criticism from some members, who argue that transparency is particularly important for a nonprofit organization that positions itself as a steward of ethical leadership and entrepreneurship.

What the ruling does — and does not — resolve

The lifting of the TRO allows TiE New York to continue operations, including governance and administrative functions, while the case advances through motion practice and potential discovery. It does not resolve:

Whether fiduciary duties were breached;

Whether the board acted in good faith in responding to complaints;

Whether internal processes were adequate or conflicted; or

Whether damages or injunctive relief may ultimately be warranted.

Those questions remain before the court.

With emergency relief denied but the lawsuit intact, the case now enters a more conventional litigation phase. Observers expect motions to dismiss, possible document discovery, and further judicial scrutiny of board conduct.

For TiE New York, the immediate operational threat may have eased, but the reputational and legal challenges persist. As one nonprofit governance expert noted, “A lifted TRO buys time—but it doesn’t end the conversation. In many ways, it just begins the real examination.”

Baltimore protest calls for ICE to leave Maryland in wake of Glen Burnie Christmas Eve shooting

""Put pressure on lawmakers to stop collaborating with ICE — abolish the agency altogether. Put the money toward something good.""According to witnesses, ICE agents followed the driver, identified by authorities as Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins, from a nearby Walmart.Agents caught up with him in a parking lot while he was playing a game on his phone, authorities said.ICE officials said Sousa-Martins is an undocumented immigrant from Portugal. Agents said Solomon Antonio Serrano-Esquivel, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador, was in the passenger seat.ICE officials said agents approached the vehicle and instructed the driver to turn off the engine. The driver refused and attempted to flee.

Protesters gathered Monday at the ICE Field Office in Baltimore in response to a Christmas Eve shooting involving ICE agents in Glen Burnie.

Authorities said ICE agents shot and wounded the driver of a vehicle they claimed rammed into their vehicle.

The protest, organized by the People's Power Assembly, called on getting ICE out of Maryland — and everywhere else, for that matter.

""We consider that our duty to be out here, speak up against what's happening,"" said one protester. ""Put pressure on lawmakers to stop collaborating with ICE — abolish the agency altogether. Put the money toward something good.""

According to witnesses, ICE agents followed the driver, identified by authorities as Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins, from a nearby Walmart.

Agents caught up with him in a parking lot while he was playing a game on his phone, authorities said.

ICE officials said Sousa-Martins is an undocumented immigrant from Portugal. Agents said Solomon Antonio Serrano-Esquivel, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador, was in the passenger seat.

ICE officials said agents approached the vehicle and instructed the driver to turn off the engine. The driver refused and attempted to flee. ICE said the driver weaponized his vehicle and began ramming his van into several ICE vehicles.

The People's Power Assembly (PPA) organized the protest in direct response to the ICE officer shooting that happened in Glen Burnie on Christmas Eve. In that incident, ICE maintains its officers only acted in self-defense.

While one of the protesters' goal was to raise awareness of ICE's activity locally, PPA organizers told WJZ they want to pressure state leaders to act.

Calling for an end to ICE enforcement

Protesters gathered on the corner of Hopkins Place and Baltimore Street, which is near where the ICE Baltimore Field Office, holding signs and calling for ICE to be abolished.

They chanted, ""ICE out of Baltimore! ICE out of Maryland!""

""All they had on the [people involved in Glen Burnie] was they were suspected of being [undocumented] immigrants. We reject that,"" said PPA organizer Andrew Mayton.

In a statement, ICE said officers shot Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins -- who the agency says is an undocumented Portuguese immigrant -- when Sousa-Martins tried to ram other vehicles and the officers.

ICE said the officers first tried to get him to turn off the engine, which he refused to do. Solomon Antonio Serrano-Esquival, who ICE has identified as a Salvadoran undocumented immigrant, was in the passenger seat with Sousa-Martins.

PPA organizers hopes Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and other state lawmakers move to ban cooperation agreements some counties have with ICE, as well as 287(g) agreements.

287(g) agreements are where ICE gives local law enforcement the authority to perform some immigration officer enforcement duties.

A bill to ban 287(g) agreements failed to reach Gov. Moore's desk in the 2025 legislative session, but several lawmakers have expressed interest in introducing another similar bill in the upcoming session.

""ICE is its own department, there is no other kinds of collaborative efforts similar to this. All it does is put communities in danger,"" Mayton said.

WJZ reached out to ICE for any updates to the investigation into the Christmas Eve shooting, but didn't hear back. ICE issued a statement on the day of the shooting that called on ""extremist rhetoric"" against the agency to stop.

""The incident, which is still under investigation, comes as the extremist anti-ICE rhetoric and outright lies of politicians, the news media, activists, and violent agitators continue to fuel a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against ICE officers,"" the agency said.

Sousa-Martins and Serrano-Esquival were taken to area hospitals and, at last check, are stable.

Local ICE activity

The Christmas Eve shooting is one of the latest local showings of President Trump's ramped up immigration enforcement.

Another recent case making headlines is the detainment of 22-year-old Dulce Consuelo Morales Diaz. She was taken into ICE custody when she was on her way home from a Taco Bell in Baltimore, despite saying she's a U.S. citizen.

Her lawyer, Victoria Slatton, has gone viral for her TikToks about Morales Diaz. She posted a TikTok Sunday reporting Morales Diaz has been transported to a third detention facility. She'd previously been detained in Louisiana and Texas.

Slatton has said she has Morales Diaz's birth certificate, immunization records, and other documentation proving her client's U.S. citizenship. The government has maintained Morales Diaz is an undocumented immigrant, and that she claimed to be a Mexican citizen to border patrol when she was at the Arizona-Mexico border in 2023.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/29/99d2e872-3ba8-4afa-a7fc-2d5889e10d95/thumbnail/1200x630/3ed72be8a269e18668e2183df3ca9567/iceprotest.png,N,,2025-12-30 11:59:07.701148

The big picture: The judge's order permits sharing of basic biographical, contact and location information, a win for the Trump administration's effort to use Medicaid data in its immigration crackdown — an arrangement that critics said raised privacy concerns.

Context: Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in federal Medicaid coverage.

But emergency Medicaid dollars pay hospitals for care provided to those who meet eligibility requirements regardless of immigration status, per KFF. And some states provide state-funded coverage to some who are ineligible for federal funds.

Driving the news: U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, a California-based Obama appointee, said in his Monday order that sharing basic biographical, location and contact information is ""clearly authorized by law.""

However, he strictly limited what kinds of data could be shared.

The Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can provide citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth and Medicaid ID for those illegally living in the United States.

Chhabria did block broader data sharing, writing that ""the new policies are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be.""

State of play: Chhabria pointed to government filings outlining the policy and legal background on such information sharing, including one that said CMS would provide ICE the ""minimum required information.""

But that policy said CMS may share other information beyond immigration status, location and phone numbers ""on a case-by-case basis as permitted by law.""

Chhabria wrote that many questions remain and that the memos fail to address ""why a more narrowly tailored policy, focused on the basic biographical information discussed above, would not suffice for immigration enforcement purposes.""

Catch up quick: The judge blocked the Trump administration in August from using the information for immigration enforcement purposes, finding a ""reasoned decisionmaking process"" did not precede the policy change.

That prior preliminary injunction will remain in place until next Monday.

The criminal charges against McIver stem from a conflict at Delaney Hall, a recently reopened, 1,000-bed immigrant detention facility in Newark. The facility — located just miles from New York City — plays a key role in the Trump administration’s deportation efforts in the region.

Julian “Vicente” Ortiz Velazquez was taken into custody on Nov. 4 after leaving the Lowe’s parking lot in Puyallup with a truck full of lumber. His wife, Shauna, said unmarked vehicles surrounded him as he pulled onto South Fruitland.

“They started asking him about his legal status,” Shauna said. “And he said, ‘I have the right to remain silent, can you please tell me why you’re detaining, what did I do wrong?’”

Two days before Christmas, video captured the moment his family embraced him for the first time in more than two months. A federal judge had ruled he should be released from custody while his case continues.

“Every day you just sit in there and think about how your family is surviving on the outside,” Shauna said, translating what her husband said. “When you’re the main source of income…it feels like every day is an eternity.”

In a statement to KING 5, ICE said:

“ICE arrested Julian Ortiz Velazquez Nov. 4 because he is in the United States illegally in violation of federal law as written by Congress. He has been returned to Mexico on three separate occasions in 2021 and will be detained at an ICE detention facility pending immigration proceedings and will be afforded due process before a federal immigration judge.”

Shauna said Vicente does not have a criminal history and was working to obtain legal status — both through an asylum claim and through his marriage to her. The couple has been married for three years, and she is a U.S. citizen.

Despite his release, Vicente now wears an ankle monitor and is restricted from leaving the state.

“It’s not necessarily house arrest — he can go anywhere he wants, just can’t leave the state,” Shauna said.

His arrest comes amid reports that top Trump officials have encouraged ICE to increase arrest numbers by targeting places like Home Depot, Lowe’s and 7-Eleven — locations where day laborers often gather.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump adviser Stephen Miller directed agents to “just go out there and arrest illegal aliens” and specifically suggested big-box retail locations.

KING 5 also witnessed ICE agents arrest another father outside a Home Depot in Redmond in October.

Shauna describes her husband as hardworking and devoted.

“He would literally give someone his shirt off his back to make sure they weren’t cold,” she said back in November.

Their daughter said losing him so suddenly has been painful.

“I never thought the whole father-daughter relationship…was something I was going to get, and he made it possible for me,” Alexandrea Ortiz said.

Deploying National Guard

One of the most prominent cases involved the topic of deploying the National Guard to Portland.

In September, President Donald Trump described Portland as ""war ravaged"" in a social media post, following protests outside the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility.

Less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump announced he was sending troops to Portland, protesters and ICE agents came face to face with minor clashes. KATU witnessed one get detained by officers.

The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit, arguing that the president lacked the authority to invoke Title 10 and deploy the National Guard without proving a rebellion, invasion, or inability to enforce federal law.

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and the president had a tense text message exchange over his invoking of Title 10 and authorizing the troops to go to Portland.

Judges ultimately sided with Oregon, ruling that the protests did not meet these criteria. The Trump administration appealed the decision, until a judge permanently blocked the deployment in early November.

Gender-affirming care penalties

Another high-profile case saw Oregon Attorney General Rayfield suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over Secretary RFK Jr.'s declaration that providers could be barred from Medicaid if they allowed gender-affirming care for children.

Rayfield contends that RFK Jr. lacks the authority to define professional standards of care. The case is ongoing.

Imposing tariffs

Other states also joined Oregon in challenging President Trump's tariffs, including a 145% tariff on most Chinese products.

Experts estimated these tariffs could increase the cost of living for Oregonians by about $4,000 annually.

Rayfield argued that only Congress has the authority to impose taxes and tariffs, as outlined in Article 1 of the Constitution. The federal court sided with Rayfield, but the Trump administration has since appealed.

Federal funds

Earlier this year, Oregon sued the Trump administration over the freezing of federal funds.

The administration had announced a freeze to audit overspending, affecting nonprofits working on social issues like domestic violence.

The court ruled in favor of Oregon, stating that the president could not impose new conditions on already awarded funding.

SNAP data

In the summer of this year, Rayfield and Wash. Attorney General Nick Brown were among AGs from 20 other states suing the Trump administration over its efforts to obtain data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.

According to the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was improperly attempting to gather sensitive personal information from low-income families who use food stamps. The requested information included Social Security numbers and home addresses.

In December, a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from fining states millions of dollars over their implementation of SNAP under new federal government guidelines.

Around that time, the Trump administration reversed its guidance, saying that noncitizens living in the country legally remained eligible for the food assistance program.

The guidance included refugees, asylum seekers and permanent residents, also known as 'green card"" holders.

That order, however, is temporary and prohibits the administration from penalizing the states as the states’ lawsuit is considered by the courts.

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.
“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego.
“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said.
HBO reached out to Alliance San Diego a few years ago about conducting its own investigation, according to Guerrero.","SAN DIEGO (Border Report) — HBO has begun airing a documentary about the 2010 death of Anastasio Hernández-Rojas, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who died while at the hands of Border Patrol agents at the San Ysidro Port of Entry.

The film is called “Critical Incident: Death at the Border,” which details accounts of the Border Patrol’s involvement in Hernández’s death and the ensuing investigation, which has been described as a “cover up” by Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, a human rights advocacy group.

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.

“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego. He had a wife, five U.S. citizen children born here and was a member of the community,” Guerrero said.

Hernández encountered the Border Patrol agents after trying to enter the country illegally; he had been deported days prior to the incident.

“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said. “Unfortunately, that was only the first part of the story — the second part was the cover-up.”

According to Guerrero, the Critical Incident Team that was sent to investigate Hernández’s death tried to exonerate U.S. Customs and Border Protection along with the agents involved of any civil and criminal liability.

“After he died, after he stopped breathing, they went up onto the pedestrian bridge and took the video cameras off and they erased those videos,” Guerrero said. “They also cleared the crime scene of any evidence … then they went to the hospital and removed all the Taser wires. … They were shadow units, they were cover-up units clear and simple.”

Guerrero stated they came across the investigation results while researching legal measures against the agents and discovered these criminal incident teams had been involved in other border-related incidents over many years.

In 2022, CBP disbanded the Critical Incident Teams, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on the Hernandez-Rojas case, ultimately calling for the reopening of the matter while recognizing that Hernández’s human rights had been violated.

“The HBO documentary is so timely because it exposes what unchecked power looks like at the largest law enforcement agency in the country and it reminds us what the consequences are,” said Guerrero.

HBO reached out to Alliance San Diego a few years ago about conducting its own investigation, according to Guerrero.

“That’s not just a documentary, but it’s also investigative journalism,” Guerrero said.

Neither CBP nor Border Patrol provided comment about the HBO film, which began airing on Monday.

In May 2024, the U.S. Office of Government Accountability Office issued a report stating that the units “were widespread — used in seven of nine U.S. Border Patrol sectors, including San Diego, on the southwest border — and operated for years with little to no oversight.” The GAO’s report suggested that CBP take additional steps to strengthen its response to incidents involving its personnel.

In response to the 2024 GAO report, CBP issued a statement saying in part: “CBP continually evaluates and improves upon its policies, practices, and procedures to ensure they are consistent with the law, and adhere to the highest standards. CBP has made tremendous strides improving oversight and training, and in reducing incidents involving the use of force.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/12/cit-hbo.png?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 11:59:03.790817

Chhabria's order notes that basic information is something that the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that governs ICE, has always had the authority to request.
“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process,” he wrote.
But in June, CMS began sharing data about Medicaid patients with ICE, and in July, CMS and ICE ""entered into a formal data-sharing agreement,"" Chhabria wrote in background about the case.
The previous ruling that barred sharing information will be in effect until next Monday, which was its previous expiration date, ""solely for administrative purposes,"" Monday's ruling says.","A federal judge in California ruled Monday that the federal government is allowed to share basic information about Medicaid participants with Immigration and Customs Enforcement amid a government push to locate people it believes are in the country unlawfully.

The plan to share information from the federally backed program had been blocked by a preliminary injunction that applied to 20 states that sued, including California.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria partly denied the states' request for a preliminary injunction Monday, writing that “basic biographical, location, and contact information” is legal under the law.

But he also granted the injunction as it pertains to any information beyond that.

“We are disappointed in the court’s decision allowing for the sharing of some Medicaid data with ICE,” the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement Monday.

“Though we are gratified that the court enjoined DHS’s broader efforts to obtain more sensitive health data; data of citizens, lawful permanent residents, and other people with lawful status; and data from other CMS administered health programs,” Bonta’s office said, referring to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Monday's order notes that the Medicaid services agency, CMS, has said in a notice that it ""will share the minimum required information,” such as “citizenship and immigration status, location, and phone numbers.”

Immigrants unlawfully in the United States are largely not eligible for Medicaid.

All states are required to offer emergency Medicaid — temporary coverage that pays only for lifesaving services in emergency rooms — to anyone, regardless of immigration status.

Emergency Medicaid spending accounts for less than 1% of the program’s expenses, according to a study published in October in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Chhabria's order notes that basic information is something that the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that governs ICE, has always had the authority to request.

Chhabria also said in his partial order that there are many unanswered questions.

“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process,” he wrote.

His order grants a preliminary injunction against sharing information of broader categories.

Chhabria cited questions about whether DHS may request information about lawful citizens or lawful permanent residents, including in mixed households in which some are lawfully in the country and others are not.

“The new policies are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be,” he wrote.

Medicaid is a federal and state joint program that has about 79 million enrollees across the country. In California, it is called Medi-Cal.

The California attorney general’s office said Monday that participants expected privacy.

“When individuals signed up for Medi-Cal, they did so with the understanding that their data would not be used for purposes unrelated to administering the program,” it said.

CMS has long had a policy of not sharing data about Medicaid patients with ICE, and since at least 2013, ICE has had a policy of not using that data for immigration enforcement, Chhabria wrote in a ruling in August.

But in June, CMS began sharing data about Medicaid patients with ICE, and in July, CMS and ICE ""entered into a formal data-sharing agreement,"" Chhabria wrote in background about the case.

The lawsuit was against the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security and others.

Those agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday evening.

Federal agents fanned out in Minneapolis on Monday for a “massive investigation on child care and other rampant fraud,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

Noem posted the update about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions on X and said “more coming.”

The post shows agents wearing jackets with large white letters, “HSI,” for Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of ICE — interviewing people at storefronts.

Homeland Security posted a separate notice saying that agents were “going DOOR TO DOOR at suspected fraud sites.”

“The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found. Under the leadership of @Sec_Noem, DHS is working to deliver results,” a Monday X post said.

About $9 billion has been lost to fraudulent claims in Minnesota’s federal-assistance programs, federal authorities have estimated. Dozens of people have been arrested, charged and convicted since 2022 in at least three major scandals, with more arrests expected as additional scandals are probed, federal prosecutors have said.

In other recent action, the Small Business Administration announced it was cutting off $5.5 million in federal funds because Minnesota state officials haven’t effectively safeguarded federal tax dollars, said Kelly Loeffler, the head of the agency.

Although the scandals are now drawing national attention, concerns over programs being defrauded on a large scale date back to at least 2018. Some whistleblowers raised alarms as early as 2009.

Minnesotans said that contributing factors include the state’s generous, progressive social-welfare policies, lax enforcement, and the “Minnesota Nice” attitude: A willingness to help others with few questions asked.

In addition, whistleblowers said they were reluctant to come forward because they suffered retaliation and claims of “racism” or “Islamophobia” for reporting allegations against Somali immigrants, who are Black and Muslim.

Patel: FBI Surged Resources to Minnesota Early in Investigation

FBI Director Kash Patel on Sunday confirmed that his office had surged resources to Minnesota to investigate claims of fraud exploiting federal services and programs.

Federal officials have so far indicted 78 people and convicted 57 individuals in a $250 million fraud scheme in Minnesota, Patel said in a post on X. Charges included wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and more.

“The FBI is aware of recent social media reports in Minnesota,” Patel wrote. “However, even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs. Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide.”

The FBI director also said that the recent arrests are “just the tip of a very large iceberg.”

“We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing. Furthermore, many are also being referred to [immigration] officials for possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings where eligible.”

The fraud scheme, Patel wrote, resulted in the stealing of “federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during COVID” including “sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network.”

“These criminals didn’t just [engage] in historic fraud, but tried to subvert justice as well,” he said.

Patel noted a case in which a defendant and others have been “charged for attempting to bribe a juror with $120,000 in cash.”

“Those responsible pleaded guilty and were sentenced, including a 10-year prison term and nearly $48 million in restitution in related cases,” he said.

The FBI chief’s announcement was made after a viral video posted online showed a day care in Minneapolis that allegedly obtained millions of state-backed funding, even though it was largely inactive. Some Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., called for Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s office to investigate.

Vice President JD Vance called the fraud allegations in the state “a microcosm of the immigration fraud in our system.”

“Politicians like it because they get power. Welfare cheats like it because they get rich,” Vance wrote on X on Saturday. “But it’s a zero sum game, and they’re stealing both money and political power from Minnesotans.”

Joe Thompson, first assistant U.S. attorney, told reporters earlier this month that the scale of fraud in Minnesota-run programs is astronomically high. Fraud was found in programs involving services such as child nutrition, housing services, and autism, he said.

“I’m sure everyone is wondering how much of this $18 billion was fraud,” Thompson told reporters. “That’s the $18 billion question.”

In response to the investigations, Walz in October ordered a third-party audit and paused payments to the 14 programs for 90 days. One program has since been shut down entirely. Walz says the state aggressively increased resources for fraud detection and prevention and recently appointed a statewide director of program integrity to oversee those efforts.

Aside from Patel’s statement, the White House has sounded the alarm for fraud among Minnesota’s Somali community. On Thanksgiving, President Donald Trump described the state as “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” and noted that he was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota.

Walz has been critical of Trump and the White House’s statements about Somalis in his state, saying in an NBC interview in late November that administration officials are “demonizing an entire community.”

The county’s seen numerous deportation operations kick off throughout the region since June, raising a host of concerns from some residents, local officials, state legislators and congressional representatives.

A series of protests kicked off shortly after the raids began in June, with protestors railing against ICE sweeps in downtown Santa Ana, near the federal buildings.

Not long after that, the National Guard came to town and were posted by federal buildings in Santa Ana, including the Ronald Reagan federal courthouse.

[Read: Orange County Grapples With Federal Occupation]

The raids have also spurred the cities of Anaheim, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana to roll out immigrant aid funds for people impacted by ICE raids – helping with things like legal representation and rent payments.

Some local elected officials throughout OC warned that creating such immigrant aid programs could jeopardize critical federal funding for things like housing assistance.

Other city council members called on their local police departments to work with ICE, with the Huntington Beach City Council voting to disregard state law and direct officers to assist in deportation efforts.

While the roving deportation tactics were temporarily put on hold by a federal judge, a majority of U.S. Supreme Court Justices ultimately blocked that restraining order as the lawsuit plays out in lower court.

Who Got Caught Up in ICE Sweeps?

Beginning in early June, federal agents began detaining people throughout the county – from courthouses to Home Depots.

[Read: Orange County Braces For ICE]

“We all I guess were under the impression that the presence of ICE was going to be to target dangerous, violent criminals. But what we’re seeing, and what I woke up to yesterday, were day laborers looking for work that were being detained, tackled with excessive force by Homeland Security officers and ICE,” Orange County Supervisor Vicente Sarmiento said at a June 10 county supervisors’ meeting.

The deportation efforts also reached neighborhoods, like in Santa Ana and Irvine.

Shortly after the raids kicked off, Congressman Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana) criticized federal agents for not going after criminals.

“From what I saw, I don’t believe those are serious violent criminals,” Correa said at a June news conference . “I saw a couple individuals that looked like they got pulled off a job painting somewhere.”

“Why did you pick up working individuals? They’re not violent serious criminals to my knowledge,” he said.

In the coming months, immigrant advocates and volunteers have told Voice of OC that federal officials restructured immigration policies, turning once documented immigrants into undocumented immigrants.

“It’s not criminals, it’s the most vulnerable of the immigrant population that are being made undocumented. Immigration has their information because they’re applying, they’re trying to do it the right way and they’re being targeted,” said volunteer and a federally accredited immigration legal representative, Bethany Anderson, in a late October interview.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security repeatedly told Voice of OC throughout the year that agents have done their due diligence and have conducted “highly targeted” deportation enforcement.

According to data from the Department of Homeland Security, a large majority of the over 5,700 people in ICE detention facilities throughout California are considered “no ICE threat.”

As of Nov. 28 – the latest available data – 67% of the people in ICE facilities are “no ICE threat” while 33% are considered ICE threats.

One Orange County case made national news after federal agents violently arrested Narciso Barranco, a 48-year-old Tustin landscaper who’s a father of three U.S. Marines.

It kicked off a series of protests, vigils and calls for immigrant aid programs.

[Read: Tustin Landscaper Violently Arrested in Deportation Sweeps Says Hope Lives]

Barranco, who was arrested in Santa Ana in June, has since been released and is working his way through the immigration system.

His son, Marine veteran Alejandro Barranco, testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration in July.

“My father is a human being but was not treated with the dignity he deserves. He has always made sure to do his best in giving back and supporting this country like we all do. That is who he is – that is who this country punched, threw in detention and is trying to deport,” Alejandro Barranco told the committee.

“I am here today because I want other people who have had family members like my dad taken away to know they’re not alone. Thousands of families like ours are being ripped apart and their stories matter. I want this committee to understand the human impact of the immigration policies

A Wave of Protests

A wave of protests began June 9 – the same day deportation sweeps kicked off – in Downtown Santa Ana, the heart of Orange County.

In the coming days, thousands of demonstrators railed against ICE raids and called on elected officials to take stands against the operations.

But concerns immediately began surfacing on how local police departments responded to the protests, namely in Santa Ana.

It spurred Santa Ana City Councilman Johnathan Hernandez to ask for a public accounting of how police officers responded, including information like what types of non-lethal rounds were used and how many times such tactics were deployed.

The protestors also focused on Mayor Valerie Amezcua, who was largely silent on the ICE raids in June.

[Read: Santa Ana’s Response to ICE Protests Prompt Questions for Police & Mayor]

At a June city council meeting, numerous residents sounded off at the public podium – criticizing the city’s response to the raids.

[Read: Santa Ana Residents Demand Mayor Resign, Citing Weak Response to ICE Raids, Protests]

During a November police oversight commission meeting, Santa Ana Police Department officials said the response was textbook and that officers targeted bad actors among the protestors.

Yet many who were at those protests, like Hernandez, dispute that characterization of events.

There were also large-scale demonstrations in Anaheim and Santa Ana – as part of the nationwide “No Kings” protests – where a diverse group of residents voiced numerous concerns against federal policies, especially the ICE raids.

In June, thousands of people gathered at Anaheim’s La Palma Park for the “No Kings” protest.

And in October, thousands gathered in Santa Ana’s Centennial Park to rail against deportation sweeps and other federal policies, like cuts to food stamps.

ICE Sweeps Spur Immigrant Aid

The raids spurred a roundtable of state legislators and community organization leaders over the summer, when Assemblymembers Sharon Quirk-Silva (D-Fullerton) and Avelino Valencia (D-Anaheim) detailed how much the raids were impacting Orange County’s local economy.

[Read: Orange County Feels Economic Fallout of ICE Raids]

The community organizations also told the state legislators they needed resources from the state so they could continue helping people impacted by the deportation sweeps.

Recently, Valencia announced state legislators carved out a $1.5 million state grant to Catholic Charities OC in an effort to get more legal resources for the immigrant community and help people become legal residents and citizens.

[Read: More OC Immigrants Could Get Citizenship, Visas Under $1.5 Million State Grant]

In the meantime, the cities of Anaheim, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana created immigrant aid funds for their residents – helping people with things like groceries, rent and legal assistance at a time when many are too frightened to go to work or the grocery store.

[Read: Immigration Legal Aid Funds Grow in Orange County]

OC Supervisor Sarmiento and various community organizations also helped establish a $1.5 million fund aimed at helping people through the immigration legal system.

Like Correa, Sarmiento said that President Donald Trump’s administration hasn’t been targeting criminals like what federal officials promised early in the year.

“You have now Homeland Security, Border Patrol and ICE officers staged at some of the immigration courts throughout Southern California and here in Santa Ana, which I’ve personally seen, that are ready to detain immediately after a summary dismissal,” Sarmiento said in a September phone interview.

A Flashpoint in Garden Grove

Orange County saw one of the most thorough debates on the deportation sweeps at a Garden Grove City Council meeting in October as officials there considered a resource webpage for residents – a portion of the city website that directs people to things like legal aid and other resources.

During the Oct. 28 council meeting, Councilwoman Arianna Arestegui successfully got a majority of her colleagues to support creating the resource page.

“We need to have this conversation together,” Arestegui said during the meeting. “A lot of these provisions are things that are being enacted by other cities in our region that are major stakeholders in this issue as well and Garden Grove is the third largest Hispanic community in Orange County.”

But Councilman George Brietigam said the issue should be tackled at the state level and blamed California’s sanctuary law for the deportation raids – a law that largely curbs local law enforcement from aiding deportation efforts.

“The state is responsible. Not the federal government, the state – they created sanctuary state laws,” Brietigam said. “The sanctuary state laws made it so ICE has to go out in the community and chase people down. And it looks terrible, it scares people. It scares kids. This is what the state created.”

[Read: Garden Grove Becomes Flashpoint of Immigration Debate in Orange County]

Brietigam, who said immigrants should go through the citizenship process instead, voted against the resource page.

Mayor Stephanie Klopfenstein, who abstained on the vote, warned the resource page could land Garden Grove on the federal government’s radar – potentially jeopardizing federal funding.

“I don’t want to have to look somebody in the face and say your rental assistance has been taken from you.”

The government had argued that the plaintiffs should pursue other legal avenues, including habeas corpus petitions, to challenge their treatment.
“The ‘inherently transitory’ exception thus no longer applies to Mr. Hernandez Torres, rendering his claims moot,” the judge wrote.
Representatives for the plaintiffs, ICE and the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","(CN) — Carmen Sequen faced a dilemma familiar to thousands of immigrants across the country: appear for her hearing and risk arrest by ICE agents or stay away and lose her chance to make a legal case to remain in the United States.

On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge P. Casey Pitts of the Northern District of California ruled that such concerns warrant judicial examination. He rejected the government’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit challenging policy change implemented by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Justice Department’s immigration court system.

The decision allows Sequen and two other plaintiffs to continue their challenge against policies they say have fundamentally altered immigration enforcement. This includes Yulisa Alvarado Ambrocio and Ligia Garcia.

“In general, there is a strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action,” Pitts, a Joe Biden nominee wrote in his order.

In May, ICE issued final guidance allowing its agents to make civil immigration arrests in or near courthouses on a case-by-case basis whenever they believe a noncitizen will be present, easing earlier restrictions that generally limited such arrests to national security threats, imminent danger or other exceptional circumstances.

The plaintiffs say the policy shift has led to more absences at immigration hearings as they weigh the risk of arrest against appearing for their cases. Pitts found that the plaintiffs had reasonably argued that the government didn’t provide sufficient justification for the changes.

“Plaintiffs plausibly allege that each of the challenged policies is arbitrary and capricious,” she wrote.

The plaintiffs also challenge ICE’s elimination of a longstanding 12-hour limit on detention in short-term holding facilities. The agency now permits detention in these facilities for up to 72 hours or longer under what it terms exceptional circumstances.

In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs describe conditions at ICE’s San Francisco field office that include overcrowded rooms with open toilets, limited access to hygiene products and showers, and inadequate sleeping arrangements.

Pitts expressed concern about the policy’s internal contradictions.

“Providing for overnight or multi-night detention in hold rooms while preserving a prohibition on ‘sleeping apparatus’ is not just likely but certain to lead to violations of noncitizens’ due process rights to be free from punitive conditions of confinement,” he wrote.

The government had argued that the plaintiffs should pursue other legal avenues, including habeas corpus petitions, to challenge their treatment. Pitts rejected that argument, explaining that such petitions have limited scope.

“Habeas petitioners may challenge only the fact or duration of particular detainees’ confinement,” she wrote. “Plaintiffs could not use habeas to challenge ICE’s failure to provide a reasoned basis for its overall policy of permitting detention longer than 12 hours in short-term hold rooms.”

Pitts granted the government’s motion to dismiss claims brought by Martin Hernandez Torres, who was removed to Mexico and no longer faces the prospect of detention by ICE.

“The ‘inherently transitory’ exception thus no longer applies to Mr. Hernandez Torres, rendering his claims moot,” the judge wrote.

The decision allows claims by Sequen, Ambrocio and Garcia to move forward. The court has already issued preliminary orders staying the courthouse arrest policies within ICE’s San Francisco area of responsibility, which covers Northern California, Hawaii, Guam and Saipan, in the Northern Mariana Islands, and requiring ICE to address conditions at its holding facility on Sansome Street.

In June, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that provided unauthorized immigrants in-state tuition.
Texas became the first state to offer in-state tuition to unauthorized students in 2001, according to the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group.
In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that the provision illegally favors unauthorized immigrants living in Virginia over U.S. citizens who reside outside the state and would not be eligible for the reduced in-state tuition.
In 2020, Ralph Northam, a Democrat and then the Virginia governor, signed legislation allowing unauthorized immigrants in Virginia to receive in-state tuition.","The Justice Department sued Virginia on Monday over its policy of granting unauthorized immigrants in-state financial aid at public colleges and universities, saying that the assistance violates federal law because it discriminates against U.S. citizens living in other states.

The complaint came as Virginia’s term-limited Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, prepares to leave office next month. He will be succeeded by the state’s Democratic governor-elect, Abigail Spanberger. It is the latest in a series of lawsuits from the Trump administration aimed at blocking states from extending tuition benefits to unauthorized immigrants.

In November, the administration sued California over a similar tuition policy, and in September it brought a case against Illinois over its financial aid program for unauthorized immigrants.

In June, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that provided unauthorized immigrants in-state tuition.

Texas became the first state to offer in-state tuition to unauthorized students in 2001, according to the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group.

The case in Virginia centers on a section of the state’s legal code that allows students who have lived in Virginia for at least two years to qualify for in-state tuition at public universities.

In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that the provision illegally favors unauthorized immigrants living in Virginia over U.S. citizens who reside outside the state and would not be eligible for the reduced in-state tuition.

“This is not only wrong but illegal,” the lawsuit said. “The challenged act’s discriminatory treatment in favor of illegal aliens over U.S. citizens is squarely prohibited and pre-empted by federal law.”

Governor Youngkin’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of the state’s attorney general, Jason Miyares, another Republican who is due to leave office next month. The Virginia Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

As of September, at least 14 states offered financial aid to students without regard to immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center, another advocacy group. But many states’ policies are shifting.

In 2020, Ralph Northam, a Democrat and then the Virginia governor, signed legislation allowing unauthorized immigrants in Virginia to receive in-state tuition. At the time, Mr. Northam said the law underscored that the students were “Virginians, in every sense of the word, except for the immigration status,” according to WTOP-FM.

State Senator Jennifer B. Boysko, a Democrat who cosponsored the legislation, said in an interview Monday night that she was unsurprised by the lawsuit, saying that she expected the Trump administration to move to penalize the state as Democratic leadership takes over.

Seeing it first hand, Muhammad Haseeb Ahmad is anxiously awaiting word on whether he can obtain permanent residency.

“It's like just waiting and waiting — frustration at its pinnacle,"" he said.

The 25-year-old from Pakistan completed his master's in applied computing in artificial intelligence (AI) from the University of Windsor in October 2024. He applied to an immigration stream that catered to master's and PhD graduates, and has been waiting ever since.

Ontario changing its system as Ottawa cuts caps

The prog ram he a pplied to falls under Ontario's Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP). A partnership with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the program provides a fast-track to permanent residency for workers and international students with skills in specific areas seen as a benefit to the overall Canadian economy.

The Ontario government is looking at changes to the program. Already, a skilled trades stream has been cancelled, and the government is considering going from nine entry categories (based on skills and profession) to a proposed four.

An Ontario government webpage seeking feedback on the proposed changes says the plan would simplify the process for applicants and their employers, f acilitate access for ""priority health-care applicants"" and add a path for entrepreneurs.

There will also be fewer spaces. Ottawa has reduced the number of provincial nominee applications accepted by about half, as the federal finance minister says Canada wants to bring immigration to ""more sustainable"" levels.

Ahmad said he and his friends worry that their stream will get suspended as proposed, though they may still be eligible under a different proposed stream for “exceptional talent.”

Amid that uncertainty, he said, his plan to pursue a PhD in medical AI from University of Toronto or University of Waterloo — paperwork for which is already prepared — is now on hold.

Ahmad said he still hopes things will work out.

“After every darkness, there's a hope. After every night, there's a light. I'm hopeful I will get nominated and get my permanent residence.”

International student permit cuts are pushing away prospective students, experts say

Ahmad has time on his work permit until fall 2027 and if nothing works out, he said he would pursue his PhD in New Zealand instead.

“We are not sure what those new requirements going to be. So far, it's totally unclear,” he said.

Skilled trades stream axed

For a London, Ont., man, six years of efforts to attain permanent residency in Canada have gone down the drain and he said he's returning home follow ing the suspension of the skilled-trades stream under OINP.

“I am done with Canada. I've done everything I could do fo r this economy. And then, if this is how I'm going to be treated, then I'm sorry, no thank you. I'm a human too,” Ankit Kumar Patel said.

CBC spoke with the 29-year-old soon after the announcement of the suspension and, a month later, he says going back home is his only option. Patel came to Canada in 2019 as an international student from India after completing his mechanical engineering degree.

After studying at Fanshawe College, he secured a three-year work permit and worked as a computer numerical control operator for manufacturing companies.

In October 2024, with three months left on his work permit, Patel applied to the OINP for permanent resident status under the skilled-trades category.

Move to suspend parts of Ontario immigration program leaves London man in limbo

Immigrant workers say future in limbo as government ranking system scores soar

More than a year later, on Nov. 14, the provincial government, in an update posted an on the ONIP web page, announced the indefinite suspension of the program's skilled trades stream due to fraudulent applications in the system.

“I feel betrayed. If I knew that it's going to end up this way, then I would’ve pursued something else and not waste my time working three years in a trade.”

Patel said it’s unfair the province is treating all applicants with the same broad stroke.

“It's like a broken promise… If they didn't need us in the first place, they should not have invited us,” he said.

Patel and hundreds impacted by th e suspension of the trades stream staged protests last month outside the OINP's office. CBC spoke with some of them, who say the province’s decision has thwarted their years of hard work and hopes of becoming Canadians.

In an emailed statement, the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development said the move is in line to better meet current and future labour market needs in Ontario.

“This decision was made following a comprehensive review that found evidence of systemic misrepresentation or fraud in applications to the skilled trades stream,” the statement said.

“Examples of these systemic compliance and enforcement concerns include falsified information relating to work experience claims, including manufactured payroll records, inaccurate or falsified income documentation, and forged employer reference letters.”

The ministry said prior to the suspension, it had approved 59 applicants from the stream for a nomination but all other applications in the stream remain closed.

NDP calls for reopening of applications

Alexa Gilmour, Ontario NDP critic for the OINP file, said the wider OINP overhaul and restructure from nine to four immigration streams could be “a jobs disaster.""

She said there were 2,600 applicants under the now-suspended trades stream. She called on the government to reopen the applications and give them ""due process.""

“[The workers] did everything right … then the rug was pulled out from under them on November 14th. These workers were not only betrayed, but painted unfairly,” she said.

The employers and the communities that depend on those workers need them, she said. In northern Ontario, Gilmour said, whole communities are counting on these trades workers.

Expect more immigration scrutiny, lawyer says

Lou Janssen Dangzalan, an immigration lawyer in Toronto, said misrepresentation and fraud has plagued OINP with “unsavory agents or ghost consultants and sometimes even licensed representatives” padding applications with problematic documentation.

But Dangzalan said it is still a “disruptive and drastic” move to the applicants and the businesses to cancel the trades stream entirely.

“This is purely a political policy choice,” he said.

“I do applaud the Ontario government for acknowledging that there's a problem, but I'm not sure if basically using a hammer to kill a fly would be a good idea in a house of glass.”

Dangzalan said realistically, applicants should start planning for a possible future where they may need to leave Canada.

“But that doesn't mean that their PR journey is necessarily over right there. Leaving Canada doesn't mean that you're already automatically excluded from the Canadian experience class.”

He said if people have to leave and wait in their home countries for PR, they can work toward gaining skilled work experience there, which can bump their scores, and boost language scores, including by learning French.

“So, 2026 is going to be tough for a lot of people… 2026 is going to be a year of enforcement… IRCC’s going to scrutinize every single application with more diligence than they ever did before.”

“From a large policy perspective, this is a crisis… There's still an immigration arms race. A lot of candidates are available who are very fantastic candidates and Canada is going to need this, especially at a time where Canada is trying to wean itself away from its dependence from the United States.”","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/8a1f7bf8-4157-4447-82b8-4630596d64ac,1766434178580/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C222%2C4032%2C2268%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-30 02:57:31.120880

Twenty-one states asked the court to block enforcement of an October ICE policy memo that rescinded a 2019 rule barring the use of health care information for immigration enforcement.

“The Trump administration’s effort to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement is a violation of their trust and will lead to fewer people seeking vital health care, harming the overall health of our communities and increasing public health costs to the state.”","SAN FRANCISCO (CN) — A federal judge on Monday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy permitting the agency to obtain basic information of certain Medicaid patients for immigration enforcement purposes.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria ruled that the sharing of Medicaid data that is “the primary focus of the new policies” — including basic biographical, location and contact information — is “clearly authorized by law and the agencies have adequately explained their decisions.”

However, the Barack Obama appointee blocked the agencies from sharing any information beyond the specified categories.

“The new policies are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be,” he said in the seven-page order released Monday.

Twenty-one states asked the court to block enforcement of an October ICE policy memo that rescinded a 2019 rule barring the use of health care information for immigration enforcement.

The new policy allows ICE to request and use data from the Department of Health and Human Services for “any and all law enforcement activities that ICE is authorized to pursue as a matter of federal law.”

Chhabria rejected many of the states’ arguments against the data-sharing policies, ruling that the Department of Homeland Security has broad statutory authority to obtain data from other agencies to “pursue legitimate law enforcement objectives, like immigration enforcement,” and that Congress requires agencies to comply with legitimate data requests from DHS.

The judge also rejected the states’ claims that the data-sharing policies violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Privacy Act, the Affordable Care Act and the Social Security Act, finding the policies “do not restrict ICE from obtaining Medicaid data pertaining to the basic biographical, contact and location data of unlawfully present aliens.”

However, Chhabria sided with the states regarding data beyond basic information, echoing concerns raised at the Dec. 9 preliminary injunction hearing about what additional information DHS could request on a “case-by-case basis,” whether data about citizens or lawful permanent residents could be sought, and whether the policies would allow HHS to share sensitive medical information about Medicaid patients with DHS.

“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decision-making process,” Chhabria said, adding that the “government failed to provide satisfactory answers to these and other questions based on the contemporaneous record” at the Dec. 9 hearing.

The new preliminary injunction temporarily bars HHS and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from sharing information received from the plaintiff states with DHS or ICE, unless it is limited to the citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth and Medicaid ID of individuals who are not in the country legally.

Chhabria added that if such basic information is “not severable” from data the agencies are prohibited from obtaining, including information about U.S. citizens or sensitive medical records, it may not be disclosed.

Representatives for either party did not respond to a request for comment.

The states sued the Trump administration in July, claiming that the health information of millions of individuals — including their immigration status — was shared with DHS, which oversees ICE, without their consent and in violation of federal law.

On Aug. 12, Chhabria granted the plaintiff states’ initial request for a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking DHS from using Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states for immigration enforcement purposes, including data they already acquired.

The previous preliminary injunction will remain in effect until Jan. 5, 2026.

The California Attorney General’s Office told Courthouse News it is disappointed in the judge’s decision to allow the sharing of some Medicaid data with ICE.

“When individuals signed up for Medi-Cal, they did so with the understanding that their data would not be used for purposes unrelated to administering the program,” a spokesperson said. “The Trump administration’s effort to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement is a violation of their trust and will lead to fewer people seeking vital health care, harming the overall health of our communities and increasing public health costs to the state.”","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/06/doctors-in-operating-room.jpg/w=800,h=600,fit=crop",N,,2025-12-29 22:56:58.766032

During a live interview with KFOX14/CBS4, Escobar highlighted issues with subcontractors failing to deliver services at Camp East Montana, a tent detention facility for migrants, which reportedly cost taxpayers $1.24 billion.

""Subcontractors who are supposed to deliver laundry services... are not doing it,"" Escobar said, noting that detainees are reporting that they themselves are washing their clothes in their sinks while the subcontractor continues to receive payment for these services.

Escobar also pointed out that janitorial services, meant to be daily, are reportedly only performed once every 10 days.

Escobar emphasized the need for oversight, despite Democrats being in the minority.

""I have visited Camp East Montana four times now. And, and just for context, I think it's really important for El Pasoans to know that this is part of the job that members of Congress are supposed to do,"" Escobar said, adding that it is important to make sure that taxes are being spent appropriately.

However, Escobar noted that she believes it has been difficult to get her colleagues from across the aisle to get on board with scrutinizing the camp, as she said, ""Unfortunately, not everyone believes that we should provide humanitarian care to human beings in our custody.""

Escobar said she has tried to appeal to Republican colleagues on fiscal grounds, arguing that while people lose healthcare and joblessness rises, the government pays billions for inadequate services at Camp East Montana.

""Republicans do not seem at all bothered by the fact that American taxpayers keep dishing out billions of dollars for services that are not being delivered,"" Escobar said.

As it has been reported, Escobar and over 100 Democratic leaders, along with human rights advocates, have demanded action to address issues at Camp East Montana.

From introducing the ""Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act,"" which calls for the establishment of oversight over these types of centers, to sending letters and testimonies from detainees to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has categorically denied allegations that conditions in Camp East Montana are inhumane.

A DHS official dismissed the claims as ""fearmongering clickbait,"" asserting that detainees receive proper meals, medical treatment, and opportunities to communicate with lawyers and family members.

Below is DHS's full statement:

This is fearmongering clickbait. As our brave ICE law enforcement is facing a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against them, KFOX14 is choosing to smear them with anonymous allegations. Here are the facts: any claim that there are 'inhumane' conditions at ICE detention centers are categorically false. No detainees are being beaten or abused. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, access to showers, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members. It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by dieticians. No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States. Get a grip.

These third-country agreements, which ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution, are essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people. If you break our laws and come to our country illegally, you could end up in any number of third countries. President Trump and Secretary Noem are using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens out of American communities and out of our country. Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States. These third-country agreements, which ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution, are essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people.

In response to Escobar, Michael Aboud, chairman of the El Paso Republican Party, dismissed the complaints, stating,

I haven’t heard anything about any problems with the camp. I know that the congresswoman is constantly saying stuff about it. She hates it and everything else.

Aboud suggested that those speaking out have their own motivations, saying, ""They’re always going to complain because they hate Republicans. Lawyers are paid to find reasons to complain.""

Escobar countered skepticism about her account, asserting, ""The same individual who says people like me can’t be trusted is likely the same individual who believes anything Donald Trump says. If Donald Trump says the sky is yellow, even if they see it’s blue, they’ll repeat that it’s yellow.""

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.
“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego.
“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said.

The film is called “Critical Incident: Death at the Border,” which details accounts of the Border Patrol’s involvement in Hernández’s death and the ensuing investigation, which has been described as a “cover up” by Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, a human rights advocacy group.

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.

“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego. He had a wife, five U.S. citizen children born here and was a member of the community,” Guerrero said.

Hernández encountered the Border Patrol agents after trying to enter the country illegally; he had been deported days prior to the incident.

“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said. “Unfortunately, that was only the first part of the story — the second part was the cover-up.”

According to Guerrero, the Critical Incident Team that was sent to investigate Hernández’s death tried to exonerate U.S. Customs and Border Protection along with the agents involved of any civil and criminal liability.

“After he died, after he stopped breathing, they went up onto the pedestrian bridge and took the video cameras off and they erased those videos,” Guerrero said. “They also cleared the crime scene of any evidence … then they went to the hospital and removed all the Taser wires. … They were shadow units, they were cover-up units clear and simple.”

Guerrero stated they came across the investigation results while researching legal measures against the agents and discovered these criminal incident teams had been involved in other border-related incidents over many years.

In 2022, CBP disbanded the Critical Incident Teams, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on the Hernandez-Rojas case, ultimately calling for the reopening of the matter while recognizing that Hernández’s human rights had been violated.

“The HBO documentary is so timely because it exposes what unchecked power looks like at the largest law enforcement agency in the country and it reminds us what the consequences are,” said Guerrero.

HBO reached out to Alliance San Diego a few years ago about conducting its own investigation, according to Guerrero.

“That’s not just a documentary, but it’s also investigative journalism,” Guerrero said.

Neither CBP nor Border Patrol provided comment about the HBO film, which began airing on Monday.

In May 2024, the U.S. Office of Government Accountability Office issued a report stating that the units “were widespread — used in seven of nine U.S. Border Patrol sectors, including San Diego, on the southwest border — and operated for years with little to no oversight.” The GAO’s report suggested that CBP take additional steps to strengthen its response to incidents involving its personnel.

In response to the 2024 GAO report, CBP issued a statement saying in part: “CBP continually evaluates and improves upon its policies, practices, and procedures to ensure they are consistent with the law, and adhere to the highest standards. CBP has made tremendous strides improving oversight and training, and in reducing incidents involving the use of force.”",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/12/cit-hbo.png?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 10:59:05.017346
