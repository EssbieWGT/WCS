Advocates are calling the raid a human rights violation.
“A few individuals, we didn't even know where they were being held or what state they were being held in.
I don't know what to do.’” The workers said ICE agents ignored their papers and pleas to speak to an attorney.

About 50 advocates and allies gathered in Fulton Friday to share how dozens of families have been traumatized by the sudden removal of family members by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE agents. Advocates are calling the raid a human rights violation.

“We had a lot of folks who were detained, missing for one to two weeks, could not make phone calls to lawyers or their family members,” said Marc Alessi. He’s an organizer with the Syracuse Immigrant and Refugee Defense Network.

“A few individuals, we didn't even know where they were being held or what state they were being held in. They were shuffled between three or four different border patrol locations to make it harder for them to contact lawyers and families.”

He said they still don’t know the whereabouts of six of the 69 people detained or deported.

Jessica Maxwell is director of the Workers Center of Central New York, and said they continue to hear stories of intimidation and threats the workers faced inside the plant. This includes not only undocumented workers, but those with valid working papers.

“This is really sending shockwaves so that now we are having people call saying, I thought I was safe, but now I don't know,” Maxwell said. “’I have my working papers, but now I'm not sure that's enough. I don't know what to do.’”

The workers said ICE agents ignored their papers and pleas to speak to an attorney. One of them was an adult son who was deported to Guatemala. Melina Ivanchikova is an organizer with Finger Lakes Rapid Response, which jumps into action during urgent immigration situations. She reads a message from the son’s mother.

“’In our household now, we have only one wage earner supporting nine people now that they took my son,”’ the mother said in her letter. ‘“We have two newborns and are going through a lot. We feel fear. Every day we are asking, what is going to happen tomorrow?’”

The family has been in Central New York for nine years. Finger Lakes Rapid Response has launched an online fundraising campaign.

Ana Mendez is Western New York Regional Coordinator for Rural and Migrant Ministry, which is tied to many of the families impacted by the raid.

“We have sat with families who are afraid to open the door when someone knocks. We have heard children crying at night, asking when mama or papa is coming home,” Mendez said. “We have seen families forced to choose between buying food and paying legal fees. And we have witnessed a deep fear and humiliation caused when people are treated as disposable rather than as human beings. This is not about politics. This is about humanity.”

Jessica Maxwell with the Workers Center said they shouldn’t be the only ones speaking out.

“If you're an employer with immigrant workers, then it is your responsibility to take action,” she said. “There should be dozens of employers standing here calling out these abuses and calling for permanent pathways for their workers.”

Nutrition Bar Confectioners is running at a fraction of its capacity after losing so many workers.

The groups also called on local and state elected officials to take action. They want Oswego County lawmakers to pass a no-collusion resolution to prohibit the county sheriff and probation department from supporting immigration-related actions. They were involved in the Cato raid.

The advocates are also calling on New York State legislators to go into special session to pass the New York for All Act, prohibiting local law officials across the state from colluding with immigration officials.

Experts are concerned that a smaller population could lead to a reduced workforce, higher living costs and a shortage of elder care.

States with aging populations and declining birth rates, like Ohio, may be among the first to feel the negative impacts.

The Trump administration's immigration crackdowns and"" One Big Beautiful Bill"" are driving the United States toward a smaller and slower-growing population, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is projecting.

The prediction has population experts concerned for the nation's economic future, as fewer people in the U.S. means a smaller workforce, as well as higher costs of living and a shortage of elder care.

If the CBO's predictions become true, some experts warn that Ohio would be among the first to feel the impact, as a state with an aging population, dropping birth rates and a declining number of working age people.

""What is disappointing is how counterproductive this all is,"" said Reanne Frank, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University, who specializes in immigration and social demography. ""It frustrates me to no end that these demographic facts were not given more attention during the last presidential election.""

What the numbers show

Due to federal actions and new immigration policy, deaths are expected to exceed births in the U.S. starting in 2031, in part because of fewer immigrants having children in the U.S. due to deportations and detentions. The country's population is expected to grow from 350 million to 367 million by 2055, according to the report.

It's a rapid turnaround from their January report, which gave the U.S. until 2033 before deaths would start exceeding births and predicted the population would grow from its current 350 million to 372 million by 2055.

In the short term, at least 290,000 immigrants are expected to be ""removed"" from the U.S. and 30,000 are expected to leave voluntarily between 2026 and 2030.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023 saw the lowest birth rate in U.S. history, with approximately 1.62 births per woman on record. That’s well below the 2.1 replacement rate needed to maintain the population. Despite that, immigration was expected to help the country's economy stave off any economic or labor issues, according to Michael Betz, an associate professor in Ohio State University’s Department of Human Sciences.

Immigrants typically come to the U.S. to work, meaning they're of working age and likely family-building age, which contributes not just to the economy but also the birth rate — an overlooked benefit of immigration, Frank said.

The CBO acknowledges that these projections could change again as quickly as they did from January, due to legislative or administrative decisions.

Where does Ohio stand?

Roughly 5.5% of Ohio's population is made up of immigrants, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. That's far behind the country's 15.4%, though Columbus is at nearly 10%.

Ohio has a population decline problem, according to sociology experts and state officials. A report issued by the Ohio Department of Development in 2023 projects that the state's population will fall by about 675,000 people by 2050, and the lowest number of births on record in Ohio was in 2023.

Betz warned that conversations around immigration crackdowns often put focus on illegal immigration without considering what could be considered ""high skill"" immigration, which he calls ""America's superpower.""

""If it becomes such a hostile environment for all immigrants, then those high-skilled immigrants are less likely to come to the United States,"" he said, adding that the U.S. risks those immigrants taking their talents elsewhere.

""The real issue here is that immigration has once again become highly politicized,"" Frank noted. ""It does not bode well for our country's projected demographic trajectory, as the CBO update shows.""","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/11/NCOD/84142312007-ice-out-protest-ac-026.JPG?crop=4499,2531,x0,y234&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-20 06:56:33.588505

H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited.
The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers.
""This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers.

President Trump signed an executive order late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.

""We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,"" Mr. Trump said.

The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have relied on the program to hire foreign workers.

The plan was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.

The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.

Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.

""This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,"" a White House aide said.

Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.

""The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,"" Anderson told CBS News.

Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.

President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.

The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March study from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.

“The main thing is, we’re going to have great people coming in, and they’re going to be paying,” he told reporters at the White House.

H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills – such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers – to work in the US, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.

Administration officials said the change to the H-1B programme would ensure that companies would only sponsor workers with the most rarefied skill sets.

“If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.

However, such a prohibitive fee will likely vastly transform the H-1B system, which was created in 1990 and awards 85,000 visas per year on a lottery system.

The programme has come under increased scrutiny from the Trump administration amid a wider crackdown on immigration, which the US president has tied to boosting domestic labour.

As part of that campaign, the Trump administration has also sought to introduce more restrictive policies on international students studying in the US, including requiring access to social media accounts and a ban on foreign travellers from several countries.

‘Taxing away innovation edge’

The Trump administration has previously considered changing the H-1B visa rules to favour higher-paying employers, essentially doing away with the lottery system.

Supporters of the H-1B programme say it brings the best and brightest to work in the US, creating an edge against foreign competitors. Critics have long charged that companies have abused the programme, using it to pay lower wages and to impose fewer labour protections.

Lutnick said on Friday that “all the big companies are on board” with $100,000 a year for H-1B visas.

“We’ve spoken to them,” he said.

He added that the visa would cost $100,000 a year for each of the three years of its duration, but that the details were “still being considered”.

Trump’s move could add millions of dollars in costs for companies, which could hit smaller tech firms and start-ups particularly hard.

Adding new fees “creates disincentive to attract the world’s smartest talent to the US”, said Deedy Das, partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, on X. “If the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy.”

Some analysts suggested the fee may force companies to move some high-value work overseas, hampering the US’s position in the high-stakes artificial intelligence race with China.

“In the short term, Washington may collect a windfall; in the long term, the US risks taxing away its innovation edge, trading dynamism for short-sighted protectionism,” said eMarketer analyst Jeremy Goldman.

Others questioned the legality of the new fees.

“Congress has only authorized the government to set fees to recover the cost of adjudicating an application,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director of the American Immigration Council, wrote on Blue Sky.

Under the current system, entering the lottery for the visa requires a small fee and, if approved, subsequent fees could amount to several thousand dollars.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said at a Friday press briefing that “all the big companies” had been briefed on the new fee.

“A hundred-thousand dollars a year for H-1B visas, and all of the big companies are on board. We’ve spoken to them,” Lutnick said at an Oval Office event with the US president.

“If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs,” he said.

Trump’s threat to crack down on H-1B visas has become a major flashpoint with the tech industry, which contributed millions of dollars to his presidential campaign. The tech industry relies, more than any other sector of the US economy, on H-1B visa holders. Roughly two-thirds of jobs secured through the H-1B program are computer-related, government figures show, but employers also use the visa to bring in engineers, educators and healthcare workers.

In the first half of 2025, Amazon had more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved, while Microsoft and Meta Platforms had more than 5,000 approvals each. The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.

Critics of the program, including many US technology workers, argue that it allows firms to suppress wages and sideline Americans who could do the jobs. Supporters, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, say it brings in highly skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping firms competitive. Musk, himself a naturalized US citizen born in South Africa, once held an H-1B visa.

Adding new fees “creates disincentive to attract the world’s smartest talent to the US”, Deedy Das, partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, wrote on X. “If the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy.”

The new fee could significantly push up costs for companies, particularly smaller tech firms and startups.

“Either the person is very valuable to the company and America, or they are going to depart and the company is going to hire an American,” Lutnick said at the briefing. “And that’s the point of immigration. Hire Americans and make sure the people coming in are the top, top people. Stop the nonsense.”

Immigration experts are questioning whether the executive branch has the authority to impose the exorbitant annual fee.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said on Bluesky: “the president has literally zero legal authority to impose a $100,000 fee on visas. None. Zip. Zilch. The only authority Congress has ever given the executive branch here is to charge fees to recover the cost of processing the application.”

Under the current system, H-1B applicants pay a small fee to enter a lottery and, if selected, subsequent fees that can amount to several thousand dollars, depending on the case. Nearly all the visa fees have to be paid by employers. H-1B visas are approved for a period of three to six years.

The move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to curb, or raise more money from, legal immigration. Last month, the US launched a pilot program allowing consular officers to demand bonds of up to $15,000 for tourist and business visas from countries with high overstay rates or limited vetting data. That followed Trump’s June travel ban restricting entry from 19 nations. Trump’s first-term administration issued several regulations that aimed to limit access to H-1B visas and give them to higher-paying employers, but the regulations were blocked in federal court.

Earlier this month, Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his final ruling against the administration. Chen and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put that ruling on hold while the administration appeals it.

The Justice Department said the lower courts are disregarding the high court's earlier intervention, a move it called ""indefensible.""

""This Court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said in his request. ""Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them − as the lower courts did here − is unacceptable.""

The court's May decision included no explanation for why it let the administration proceed.

""We can only guess as to the Court’s rationale when it provides none,"" the appeals court said when explaining why that ruling did not control the outcome at this stage of the litigation.

In addition, the appeals judges said, the courts have more evidence now to consider, including that the Department of Homeland Security ran a ""barebones process"" when it ended the program with ""unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner.""

""Neither we nor the Supreme Court had the benefit of reviewing this evidence when the Government first sought an emergency stay of the district court’s March 31 postponement order,"" they wrote.

In February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered an end to the program called Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans. She concluded that the immigrants burden local governments and said some Venezuelans were members of the gang Tren de Aragua, which President Donald Trump has declared a foreign terrorist organization.

The advocacy group National TPS Alliance and a handful of Venezuelans sued, arguing it’s not safe for them to return to their home country.

Jessica Bansal, TPS counsel with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said the Trump administration ""has been systematically de-documenting lawful immigrants, spreading fear and chaos by stripping people of their immigration status and work authorization in unprecedented ways and on little to no notice.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/19/USAT/86247320007-usatsi-27033472-168410238-lowres.jpg?crop=1408,793,x0,y100&width=1408&height=793&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-20 02:57:12.650116

“We’re here today to denounce all the attacks on migrants rights, all the attacks on Filipino activists by the Marcos-U.S. dictatorship,” said activist Brendan Lee, an organizer with the San Francisco Committee for Human Rights in the Philippines.

“We have Filipino migrants who aren’t being assisted by their Philippine government, who are being arrested and deported by the Trump administration,” said Andan Bonifacio, a Stanford graduate and Filipino activist. Filipinos in the country, he said, “are among those being targeted by the ICE crackdown right now, including crew ship workers, hospital workers, caregivers.”

“We went to the U.S. immigration court. We had speakers talk about how immigrants are being pulled off the street, they’re being pulled out of the courthouse, abducted and deported,” added Lee, a San Francisco native with Chinese ancestry who was shot four times by the Filipino military for his work as an activist. The attack left him paraplegic.

The Filipino government, organizers said in a statement, “has offered little to no assistance to Filipino migrants in detention.” The number of Filipinos in San Francisco immigration court has decreased dramatically since the late 1990s, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

In 2024, 82 Filipinos went through immigration court in San Francisco, down from a high of 531 in 1998, according to TRAC. Across California, migrants from the Philippines are the ninth most populous in ICE proceedings, behind Colombia and ahead of Armenia.

Outside of the San Francisco immigration court, speaker Pilar Castille denounced ICE tactics against her countrymen. “Trump directs ICE agents to terrorize migrant communities to kidnap our people. Filipino migrants are left to languish in ICE detention while the Philippine state washes their hands of responsibility.”

The consulate did not immediately respond to a request for comment but in July said in a statement that allegations of the government neglecting Filipinos in ICE custody were inaccurate. “Consulate officials conducted an onsite visit and welfare check on Filipino nationals” held by ICE, it wrote.

The protest, which was organized by BAYAN USA, the Malaya Movement, ICHRP-US and the Tanggol Migrante Movement, also took aim at the Filipino consulate and denounced the government for corruption, among other things.

The federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to put on hold the ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen while the case continues.

In May, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary order from Chen that affected another 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. The high court provided no explanation at the time, which is common in emergency appeals.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the new court filing that the justices’ May order should also apply to the current case.

“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this Court’s orders on the emergency docket,” Sauer wrote.

The result, he said, is that the “new order, just like the old one, halted the vacatur and termination of TPS affecting over 300,000 aliens based on meritless legal theories.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending TPS for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection during Joe Biden's presidency. TPS is granted in 18-month increments.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary.

Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security acted ""with unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner … for the preordained purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela’s TPS” status.

In denying the administration's emergency appeal, Judge Kim Wardlaw wrote for a unanimous three-judge appellate panel that Chen determined that DHS made its “decisions first and searched for a valid basis for those decisions second.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c6ddf93e-0ed2-4b7d-a9b2-8eac1cf08735/wirestory_693aa73df19f5a899133ebb5bf440f03_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-20 04:56:34.852618

""Over 70% of people arrested by ICE have no criminal conviction,"" said California State Senator Jesse Arreguin in a statement demanding Harjit Kaur's release.
""Harjit Kaur has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals and LOST each time.
Harjit Kaur's family, meanwhile, say she never questioned her deportation and should not have been detained.
A single mother, Harjit Kaur had formed deep roots and relationships in the US over the past 30 years.","The visiting room of the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Centre in Bakersfield, California, is small, loud, and crowded. When Harjit Kaur's family arrived to see her, they could barely hear her - and the first words they caught shattered them.

""She said, 'I would rather die than be in this facility. May God just take me now',"" recalled her distraught daughter-in-law, Manjit Kaur.

Harjit Kaur, 73, who unsuccessfully applied for asylum in the US, and has lived in California for more than three decades, was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials on 8 September, sparking shock and sympathy from the Sikh community across the state and beyond.

Harjit Kaur had filed several asylum appeals over the years which were rejected, with the last denial in 2012, her lawyer said.

Since then, she had been asked to report to immigration authorities every six months. She was arrested in San Francisco when she had gone for a check-in.

It comes amid a wider crackdown by the Donald Trump administration on immigration, and especially alleged illegal immigrants in the US.

The issue is a sensitive one - the country is grappling with how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers who arrive at its borders every year. More than 3.7 million asylum cases are pending in immigration courts. An increased budget for immigration enforcement means ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency.

Trump has said he wants to deport the ""worst of the worst"", but critics say immigrants without criminal records who follow due process have also been targeted.

""Over 70% of people arrested by ICE have no criminal conviction,"" said California State Senator Jesse Arreguin in a statement demanding Harjit Kaur's release. ""Now, they are literally going after peaceful grandmothers. This shameful act is harming our communities.""

US Congressman John Garamendi, who represents the Californian district where Harjit Kaur lives, has submitted a request to ICE for her release.

""This administration's decision to detain a 73-year-old woman - a respected member of the community with no criminal record who has faithfully reported to ICE every six months for more than 13 years - is one more example of the misplaced priorities of Trump's immigration enforcement,"" a spokesperson said.

In an emailed statement, ICE told the BBC that Harjit Kaur had ""exhausted decades of due process"" and that an immigration judge had ordered her removal in 2005.

""Harjit Kaur has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals and LOST each time. Now that she has exhausted all legal remedies, ICE is enforcing US law and the orders by the judge; she will not waste any more US tax dollars,"" it added.

Trump orders increase in migrant deportations

India 'will do what's right' on illegal immigration - Trump

Harjit Kaur came to the US in 1991 with her two minor sons after the death of her husband, her lawyer Deepak Ahluwalia told the BBC. Her daughter-in-law Manjit Kaur said that the young widow wanted to shield her sons from and escape the political turbulence in India's Punjab state at the time.

Over the next three decades, she worked modest jobs to raise her sons, one of whom is now a US citizen. Her five grandchildren are also US citizens.

Harjit Kaur, who lives in Hercules city in the San Francisco Bay Area, was working as a seamstress at a sari store for the past two decades and pays her taxes. Asylum applicants across the US are allowed to live, work and pay taxes legally once their claim is officially filed and in process.

Even after her final asylum appeal was rejected in 2012, her job permit was renewed every year.

After the rejection, her deportation seemed imminent, but she didn't have the right documents to travel to India.

Indian missions in the US issue emergency certificates - a one-way travel document - to Indians of invalid status to enable them to return. This would require verifying Harjit Kaur's origin and identity in Punjab through photos, cross-checking with relatives or acquaintances or finding old records, which would take at least a few weeks.

More than a decade since the rejection, neither Harjit Kaur nor US immigration officials have been able to get a travel permit for her. Manjit Kaur said they visited the Indian consulate in San Francisco in 2013 for this but didn't succeed. India's Consul General at San Francisco K Srikar Reddy told the BBC they had no record of Harjit Kaur applying for travel documents to India.

ICE did not respond to a question about why it did not get a travel permit in the past 13 years.

Mr Ahluwalia said he is following up with the Indian consulate for the documents which ""ICE was unable to procure for the last 13 years"". The consulate says they are ""facilitating all necessary consular assistance"".

Harjit Kaur's family, meanwhile, say she never questioned her deportation and should not have been detained.

""Provide us the travel documents and she is ready to go,"" Manjit Kaur said. ""She had even packed her suitcases back in 2012.""

Right now, their immediate concern is getting her out of the detention centre.

""You can put an ankle monitor on her. We can check in with immigration when you want,"" said Manjit Kaur. ""Just get her out of the facility and when you provide us the travel documents, she will self-deport to India.""

Her lawyer said that when he met Harjit Kaur on 15 September, she had not been provided with her regular medication. He alleged that she had been ""dragged by guards"", ""denied a chair or a bed"" and was ""forced to sit on the floor"" for hours in a holding cell despite having undergone double knee replacement.

He also alleged that she was ""explicitly refused water"" and not provided a vegetarian meal for the first six days.

ICE did not respond to specific questions on these allegations, but had earlier told BBC Punjabi that ""it is a long-standing policy that as soon as someone comes into ICE custody, they are given full health care"".

Detainees have access to ""medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care"" and no-one ""is denied essential care at any time during detention"", it added.

Kulvinder Singh Pannu, president of the gurdwara committee at The Sikh Centre in San Francisco Bay Area, says that Bibi Harjit (a respectful way to refer to an elderly Punjabi woman) is well-liked in the area.

""She always helped people in our community with whatever she had financially,"" he said.

""A couple of hundred people turned up by themselves to protest against her arrest,"" he said, referring to a 12 September agitation outside the Sikh temple in California.

As the uncertainty continues, Harjit Kaur's supporters are planning to hold more protests, including in other US cities, with many saying they are touched by her plight.

A single mother, Harjit Kaur had formed deep roots and relationships in the US over the past 30 years. Her parents and siblings in India are no longer alive, says Mr Ahluwalia.

""She has no-one, no home, no land to return to.""

The justice department filed an emergency application asking the justices to lift a federal judge’s ruling that the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, lacked the authority to end the protections for Venezuelans under the temporary protected status, or TPS, program.

“So long as the district court’s order is in effect, the secretary must permit over 300,000 Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so even temporarily is ‘contrary to the national interest’,” the justice department said in its filing.

The supremecourt previously sided with the administration in May to lift a temporary order that US judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued at an earlier stage of the case that had halted the TPS termination while the litigation played out in court.

Chen issued a final ruling in the case on 5 September finding that Noem’s actions to terminate the program violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies.

Trump has made a crackdown on legal and illegal immigration a central plank of his second White House term and has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees.

The TPS program is a humanitarian designation under US law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the US deportation protection and access to work permits.

Biden designated Venezuela for TPS in 2021 and 2023. Just days before Trump returned to office, Biden’s administration announced an extension of the status .

The Oregon man, Rigoberto Hernandez Hernandez, and one other firefighter were part of a 44-person crew fighting a blaze in the Olympic National Forest on Aug. 27 when the agents took them into custody during a multiagency criminal investigation into the two contractors for whom the men were employed.

Lawyers with the Innovation Law Lab said during a press conference that his arrest was illegal and violated U.S. Department of Homeland Security polices that say immigration enforcement must not be conducted at locations where emergency responses are happening.

The Bear Gulch Fire, one of the largest in the state, had burned 29 square miles (75 square kilometers) by Friday and was 9% contained.

The Border Patrol said at the time that the two workers were in the U.S. illegally so they were detained. Federal authorities did not provide information about the investigation into the contractors.

Lawyer Rodrigo Fernandez-Ortega said they filed a petition for habeas corpus and a motion for a temporary restraining order that seeks the man's release from the Northwest ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email to The Associated Press that the two men were not firefighters — they were working in a support role cutting logs into firewood.

“The firefighting response remained uninterrupted the entire time,"" she said. ""U.S. Border Patrol’s actions did not prevent or interfere with any personnel actively engaged in firefighting efforts.” A spokesperson for the Border Patrol declined to comment, saying they don't comment on active or pending litigation.

After Hernandez was taken into custody in August, his lawyers were unable to locate him for 48 hours, which caused distress for his family, Fernandez-Ortega said. He has been in the Tacoma facility ever since, they said.

Hernandez, 23, was the son of migrant farmworkers, his lawyer said. He was raised in Oregon, Washington and California as they traveled for work. He moved to Oregon three years ago and began working as a wildland firefighter.

This was his third season working as a wildland firefighter, “doing the grueling and dangerous job of cutting down trees and clearing vegetation to manage the spread of wildfires and to protect homes, communities, and resources,” his lawyer said.

Hernandez had received a U-Visa certification from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Oregon in 2017 and submitted his U-Visa application with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services the following year. The U-Visa program was established by Congress to protect victims of serious crimes who assist federal investigators.

He has been waiting since 2018 for the immigration agency to decide on his application and should be free during the process, his lawyers said.",https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 22:56:46.202870

Tensions have been rising in the Chicago area for the last two weeks, since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents intensified their push to arrest people in the country illegally, under an effort called Operation Midway Blitz. Demonstrators have typically gathered outside the federal detention facility in the suburb of Broadview, Ill., on Friday mornings, and their numbers have grown in recent weeks.

During the standoff with protesters on Friday, ICE deployed tear gas and pepper balls at the group, including several local officials. A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Chicago operation has resulted in almost 550 arrests, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement on Friday.

Advocates for immigrants have repeatedly raised concerns about conditions at the detention facility, which is used for processing immigration arrests.

“This facility should be shut down, that’s what it comes down to,” said Byron Sigcho-Lopez, a member of the Chicago City Council, who was there during the standoff. Mr. Sigcho-Lopez, who represents a ward with many Latino residents, has been a vocal opponent of ICE’S presence in Chicago.

Mayor Daniel Biss of Evanston, Ill., after wiping tear gas from his eyes, called the actions of ICE “a performance in brutality.”

“They are trying to send a message of public violence and oppression,” he said. “Our job is to resist it as visibly, vocally and aggressively as we can while staying nonviolent.”

Before the clash, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton had stopped outside the Broadview facility and said that she and Gov. JB Pritzker, both Democrats, were monitoring ICE activities in Illinois.

Last Friday, an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a 38-year-old man whom officers were trying to arrest during a traffic stop in Franklin Park, a suburb of Chicago near O’Hare International Airport with a significant Latino population. The ICE officer “followed his training, used appropriate force and properly enforced the law,” Ms. McLaughlin, the Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in a statement.

But immigration rights advocates and Mr. Villegas-Gonzalez’s family have questioned whether the arrest was warranted, saying that he was a father who had led a quiet life and had no violent criminal history.

“The violent targeting of law enforcement in Illinois by lawless rioters is despicable and Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson must call for it to end. The men and women of ICE put their lives on the line to protect the people of Illinois and all Americans,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Make no mistake, Democrat politicians like Hakeem Jeffries, Mayor Wu of Boston, Tim Walz, and Mayor Bass of Los Angeles are contributing to the surge in assaults of our ICE officers through their repeated dehumanizing and demonization of ICE. From comparisons to the modern-day Nazi gestapo to glorifying rioters, the violent rhetoric of these sanctuary politicians is going to get law enforcement killed.

The case then returned to Judge Chen, who in September again ruled in favor of the challengers after receiving additional evidence.

The case will be familiar to the justices. In May they temporarily paused a federal trial judge’s earlier order in the case, over the noted dissent of only one member of the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. The trial judge, Edward M. Chen of the Federal District Court in San Francisco, had blocked the administration’s efforts to remove the protections while the case moved forward.

The majority opinion in May, which was unsigned, gave no reasons. Nor did Justice Jackson’s dissent.

The case then returned to Judge Chen, who in September again ruled in favor of the challengers after receiving additional evidence. He said he was not bound by the Supreme Court’s order in May, noting that it “did not provide any specific analysis.”

In his emergency application asking the Supreme Court to pause that second ruling, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, said that Judge Chen’s actions were another example of “the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court’s orders on the emergency docket.”

Citing a recent concurring opinion from Justice Neil M. Gorsuch chastising federal trial judges for what he said was defiance of the Supreme Court, Mr. Sauer wrote that “lower courts cannot treat this court’s orders as good for only one stage of only one case by gesturing at irrelevant distinctions, subjectively grading the persuasiveness of the court’s perceived reasoning or faulting the court’s terseness.”

The court’s emergency docket, which critics call the “shadow docket,” uses truncated procedures that tend to produce terse provisional orders, ruling only on whether a policy can be implemented while its legality is being litigated. The justices often do not include an explanation of how they arrived at these decisions, making it difficult for lower courts to parse whether and how the orders amount to binding precedent.

The case involving the Venezuelans started in February, when Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, terminated an 18-month extension of Temporary Protected Status that had been granted to Venezuelans by the Biden administration. People affected by the change sued, saying that the move violated administrative procedures and was influenced by racial bias.

She added in a reply: “What ICE just did to me was a violent abuse of power — and it’s still nothing compared to what they’re doing to immigrant communities.”

The video shows a masked agent in camouflage fatigues picking up Abughazaleh by her torso and tossing her onto the pavement, where she landed abruptly on her right side, making a loud thud. She told MSNBC that she received minor injuries, without specifying.

Abughazaleh also said that ICE agents shouted “your First Amendment rights are on the sidewalk” at her and other protesters, while using tear gas and shooting pepper balls, some of which she said hit her.

“This escalation isn’t surprising,” she said. “We shouldn’t be shocked that ICE agents that are allowed to operate outside the law operate outside the law.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, called the move ""almost certainly illegal and likely to be struck down in court,"" in a social media post.

(AP) — Immigration enforcement officials have arrested more than 400 people as part of an operation in the Chicago area that launched a little less than two weeks ago, a top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said Friday.

Marcos Charles, the acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, gave the figures during an interview with The Associated Press. The figure, which has not been widely reported, offers an early gauge of what is shaping up as a major enforcement effort that comes after similar operations were launched in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

WATCH: Woman wrongfully detained in immigration raid describes what she endured

When asked whether he thought that amount of arrests at this point in the operation was positive, Charles said 400 is a “solid number,” adding that the figure includes arrests made by other federal agencies besides ICE who are assisting in the campaign.

“We’re going to be conducting this operation until we feel that we’ve been successful,” he said. “There’s not an end date in sight.”

ICE launched its Chicago area operation dubbed “Midway Blitz” on Sept. 8, drawing concern from activists and immigrant communities who say there’s been a noticeable uptick in immigration enforcement agents. That has deepened dread in communities already fearful of the large-scale arrests or aggressive tactics used in other cities targeted by President Donald Trump ’s hardline immigration policies.

The operation has brought allegations of excessive force and heavy-handed dragnets that have ensnared U.S. citizens, while gratifying Trump supporters who say he is delivering on a promise of mass deportations.

The Trump administration has promised to send an influx of immigration agents and National Guard troops to Chicago, over the fierce of objections of local leaders and residents. A military deployment to Chicago has yet to materialize even as immigration enforcement operations continue.

Officials and activists in the Chicago area opposed to the enforcement surge argue the approach is dangerous and imprecise, pointing to accounts of two U.S. citizens who were briefly detained this week by federal officers focused on immigration enforcement. Advocates also have protested the death of a man shot by an ICE officer on Sept. 12 after authorities said he tried to flee during a traffic stop, dragging the officer.

Charles said roughly 50% to 60% of the Chicago operation arrests were targeted arrests, meaning they were specific people that ICE was trying to find because they had committed a crime, had a final order of removal or had done something that put them on ICE’s radar.

The rest were what’s often referred to as “collateral arrests,” meaning people that ICE comes across during their operations who aren’t the person they’re looking for but are in the country illegally, so ICE can arrest them.

Collateral arrests were not allowed during the Biden administration but the Trump administration threw out those restrictions almost immediately after coming into office as part of Trump’s efforts to beef up deportations.

“It doesn’t mean that the collateral arrests are non-criminal. Some of our collateral arrests … also have criminal convictions and arrests. They just weren’t the people we were looking for at the time,” said Charles.

The Department of Homeland Security launched “Midway Blitz” after months of Trump administration criticism of Chicago and Illinois over state and local policies that restrict law enforcement cooperation with ICE.

ICE says these policies mean that immigrants who’ve committed crimes in the U.S. and can be deported as a result are instead released into the community. ICE says it then has to go out into the community and track them down to remove them.

Many local officials and activists have said that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility and that if they cooperate with ICE, it makes it less likely that immigrants who are victims or witnesses to crime will come forward to work with police.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/2025-09-08T203630Z_1123438712_RC2VNGATSPMK_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CHICAGO-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 20:57:27.918126

The incident garnered widespread attention after Abughazaleh shared the footage online.

Abughazaleh, a New Republic contributor, was among a crowd demonstrating outside the facility, which is being used in a controversial immigration enforcement operation underway in Illinois. Ostensibly a “processing facility” intended to hold detainees for no more than 12 hours at a time, the center has reportedly held detainees “for days or even weeks,” Abughazaleh said in a recent YouTube video. Protesters have gathered weekly outside the facility and on Friday were reportedly met with severe force: They were tackled, detained, tear-gassed, and pepper-sprayed by ICE agents, who were masked and clad in tactical gear.

Speaking with TNR hours after the protest, Abughazaleh described the abuses she witnessed and experienced earlier in the day.

Could you walk me through the sequence of events this morning that led to the moments you shared online?

For the past three weeks, I’ve been attending protests at the Broadview ICE facility. There’s been a vigil there for almost two decades at this point, but they started ramping up after three protesters were arrested four weeks ago.

Three weeks ago, we went, and it was very peaceful. We ended up actually getting a car to turn around. Last week, when we went, ICE assaulted a lot of us. We went early because they changed their deportation time to around 6 a.m. ICE threw me to the ground then and assaulted other protesters, as well. That was the same day as the Franklin Park murder, and someone else was shot with pepper balls then.

And then today, my friend and I woke up at 3 a.m. and went to the facility. We got there and were sitting on public property. ICE agents told us to essentially go away: “Your First Amendment rights are on the sidewalk.” Around 6 a.m., they started bringing out a van, and we were in the way, so an ICE agent once again picked me up and threw me to the ground—they love throwing me. The video that people saw was after that. But during that first altercation, they took one of the protesters inside the facility—that’s the first time this has ever happened. We don’t know what happened to that person—we still don’t know where they are.

What happened in the video that has been going around social media for most of the day?

The second altercation was when a car came out of the facility. I went to go aid another protester—once again, on public property. This is all on streets of the town of Broadview. That is when that video happened, when the officer picked me up and threw me on the ground.

And then around 8:30, 9 a.m., we saw that the protester that was arrested was being put in chains and brought into a van. And so I and about 40, maybe even 50, other people that stayed were arm-in-arm to block this car because someone was detained just for exercising their right to protest. ICE tried to run us over, like, plain and simple. A guy fell to the ground, and they kept driving. We got him up, thank God. They kept driving to the point that my friend was on the hood of the car. They started shooting us with pepper balls, and then they deployed tear gas.

The van drove away, and we don’t know where that protester is. In the chaos, they took two other people in. A little bit before that, they actually tried to take another protester, and I and two other guys—it was literally like tug-of-war—ended up keeping him out of the facility.

What have you made of the response to the video of you being thrown to the ground?

I mean, frankly, I’m shocked that people are shocked about this. They did similar [things] last week. This was the most aggressive action they’ve taken. But once last week, twice today, ICE has picked me up and thrown me on the ground.

Honestly, it doesn’t compare to what our neighbors who are trapped inside the Broadview processing facility are going through. They’re committing crimes against humanity there. This is a processing facility, so people are not supposed to be held for more than 12 hours at a time, but they are being held for days or even weeks. They are not given beds. They sleep on the concrete. They are not given hygienic products. They are not given hot meals. And these aren’t criminals. There are literally pregnant women and grandmothers in there. Last week when we saw them being loaded into a van, they were wearing the same clothes that they were detained in.

This is what ICE is. And we need to recognize that. It’s unfortunate that, just because I’m a congressional candidate, this is more newsworthy than if it would have happened to another protester. This shouldn’t be happening to anyone. And we don’t even know what is happening to the protesters who were kidnapped. We don’t know what is happening to our neighbors who were kidnapped and are being detained there. This is what Trump’s America looks like.

You tweeted, “This is what it looks like when ICE violates our First Amendment rights.” Could you expand on that?

The right wants to eliminate free speech. They want to eliminate the First Amendment. They only want people to express speech that they specifically allow. There is no type of capitulation that will satisfy them except complete and utter submission, which is why solidarity is so important. It’s why having companies like ABC cowering to Trump, or universities cowering to Trump, why that does so much harm to all of us.

And ICE is being able to operate with impunity. They are able to operate outside of the law. I don’t know who any of the men who have shoved me, pushed me, picked me up, shot pepper balls at my body—I don’t know who any of them are. They don’t have badge numbers. They don’t have names. They don’t have identification. They’re wearing masks. They’re wearing sunglasses at night. They’re wearing hats. They’re complete ghosts. For all I know, they’re just some guy that was like, “Today I want to work at the ICE facility and rough up some 110-pound girl.”

And that means that they can do whatever they want. This is the secret police. There’s no ifs, ands, or buts about it. And that means that they can designate anything a crime. They can designate protesting as a crime. They can say that speech is a crime. They can just assign any idea, ideology, condition, or act to you, and say, “Well, I saw it happen, so that’s what the truth is. And I can do whatever I want to this citizen, to this civilian, to this person who did nothing wrong, because I’m an ICE officer and I’m above the law.”

What would you like to see from your fellow Democrats?

We need Democrats to put up an aggressive response to ICE. This facility in Illinois needs to be shut down, but these facilities across the country need to be shut down. We need more representatives like [New York City Comptroller] Brad Lander to be standing up for our communities. We need elected representatives at all levels of government to be demanding these facilities have any sort of transparency and abide by our own laws. And it is not controversial or tearing us apart to insist that basic humanity, basic decency, is not only respected but expected in our country.",https://images.newrepublic.com/ee55f1a18ac0601f908abff21a889482337ef35f.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-09-19 18:57:26.217898

In another order, Trump set up a new ""gold card"" to fast-track visas for certain immigrants in exchange for fees starting at £1m.
Since 2004, the number of H-1B applications has been capped at 85,000 per year.
Until now, H-1B visas have carried various administrative fees totalling around $1,500.
At the time, tech companies pushed back, harshly criticising the Trump administration's H-1B order.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will add a $100,000 (£74,000) fee for applicants to the H-1B visa programme aimed at bringing in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.

The proclamation mentions ""abuse"" of the programme and will restrict entry unless payment is made.

Critics of the programme have long argued that H-1Bs undercut the American workforce, while supporters - including billionaire Elon Musk - argue it allows the US to attract top talent from around the world.

In another order, Trump set up a new ""gold card"" to fast-track visas for certain immigrants in exchange for fees starting at £1m.

Joining Trump in the Oval Office on Friday was US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

""A hundred thousand dollars a year for H1-B visas, and all of the big companies are on board,"" he said. ""We've spoken to them.

""If you're going to train somebody, you're going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs.""

Since 2004, the number of H-1B applications has been capped at 85,000 per year.

Until now, H-1B visas have carried various administrative fees totalling around $1,500.

Data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shows that applications for H-1B visas for the next fiscal year fell to about 359,000 - a four-year low.

The greatest beneficiary of the programme the previous fiscal year was Amazon, followed by tech giants Tata, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google, according to government statistics.

The BBC has contacted these companies for comment.

Tahmina Watson, a founding attorney at Watson Immigration Law, told the BBC that the ruling could be a ""nail in the coffin"" for many of her clients that are mostly small businesses and start-ups.

""Almost everyone's going to be priced out. This $100,000 as an entry point is going to have a devastating impact,"" she added, noting that many small or medium-sized companies ""will tell you they actually can't find workers to do the job"".

""When employers sponsor foreign talent, more often than not, they're doing that because they have not been able to fulfil those positions,"" Ms Watson added.

Jorge Lopez, the chair of the immigration and global mobility practice group at Littler Mendelson PC, said a $100,000 fee ""will put the brakes on American competitiveness in the tech sector and all industries"".

Some companies might consider setting up operations outside the US, though doing so can be challenging in practice, he added.

The debate over H-1Bs had previously caused splits within Trump's team and supporters, pitting those in favour of the visas against critics such as former strategist Steve Bannon.

Trump told reporters at the White House in January that he understands ""both sides of the argument"" on H-1Bs.

The year before - while seeking to attract support from the tech industry while on the campaign trail - Trump vowed to make the process of attracting talent easier, going as far as to propose green cards for college graduates.

""You need a pool of people to work for companies,"" he told the All-In Podcast. ""You have to be able to recruit these people and keep these people.""

Early in his first term in 2017, Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B applications, seeking to improve fraud detection.

Rejections rose to an all-time high of 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared to between 5% and 8% under Barack Obama and then between 2% and 4% under Joe Biden.

At the time, tech companies pushed back, harshly criticising the Trump administration's H-1B order.

The potential for additional restrictions to the H-1B programme has caused considerable concern in countries such as India - which is by far the largest source country for such visa applications.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fa5f/live/38c3b210-95af-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 20:57:12.040468

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the action as a “military attack” on civilians and accused the United States of trying to provoke a war.","Democratic Sens. Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Tim Kaine (Va.) have introduced a new resolution under the War Powers Act that would stop U.S. military strikes against boats from Venezuela that President Trump says are smuggling fentanyl into the United States.

The resolution is privileged, which means it is guaranteed a vote on the floor, even though it has little chance of passing the Senate or the House and would be vetoed by Trump if it ever made it to his desk.

At the very least, it will put Republican senators on record on the question of whether Trump’s use of force against the ships is legally justified. Critics of the president’s actions argue it violates the law and Constitution.

“Congress alone holds the power to declare war. And while we share with the executive branch the imperative of preventing and deterring drugs from reaching our shores, blowing up boats without any legal justification risks dragging the United States into another war and provoking unjustified hostilities against our own citizens,” Schiff said Friday in a statement.

Democrats say the administration has ignored requests from Democrats to provide more information about the strikes or details about their legal underpinnings.

“President Trump has no legal authority to launch strikes or use military force in the Caribbean or elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. The administration has refused to provide Congress with basic information about the multiple strike it has carried out, including who was killed, why it was necessary to put servicemembers’ lives at risk, and why a standard interdiction operation wasn’t conducted,” Kaine said in a statement.

The resolution will be referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must discharge it to the Senate floor for a vote within 60 days of the president’s announcement of the use of force.

Schiff and Kaine unveiled their resolution after U.S. forces sank a second Venezuelan boat Monday.

Trump announced on Truth Social that military officials “positively identified extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists.”

Trump signed a secret directive this summer ordering the Pentagon to use deadly force against Latin American drug cartels, which his administration have identified as terrorist organizations.

She said the group was tear-gassed and shot with pepper balls — and that one activist was dragged into the facility.

Videos taken at the scene show an ICE officer picking up Abughazaleh and slamming her to the ground. She landed on her backside with an audible thud.

Commenting on the shocking encounter on her social media account, Abughazaleh said: “My body hurts and will probably hurt way more tomorrow.”

She added: “What ICE just did to me was a violent abuse of power — and yet it’s nothing compared to what they’re doing to immigrant communities.”

Abughazaleh later posted the video on her X account, warning, “This is what it looks like when ICE violates our First Amendment rights.”

Some right-wing social media accounts were quick to pounce on Abughazaleh, accusing her of interfering in the ICE operation, and implying she got what she deserved.

Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 294 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Sept. 12 through 18.

Among the new cases, Mexican national Ramiro Barrera-Gonzalez was charged in San Antonio with assault on a federal officer after he was initially arrested for illegal entry by an alien. A criminal complaint alleges that while he was in U.S. Border Patrol custody on Sept. 11, Barrera-Gonzalez ingested bleach and was transported to a San Antonio hospital for medical treatment. Two days later, as a Border Patrol agent escorted Barrera-Gonzalez to a hospital restroom, Barrera-Gonzalez allegedly lunged toward the agent’s holstered firearm. An altercation ensued, causing both the Barrera-Gonzalez and the agent to fall to the ground and resulting in an injury to the agent’s forearm.

Two U.S. citizens were arrested on Sept. 12 when they approached a Del Rio Border Patrol checkpoint and allegedly drove away at a high rate of speed after refusing to open the trunk of their vehicle and failing to pull over for secondary inspection. A criminal complaint alleges that Border Patrol agents caught up in a pursuit and observed the driver, Andre Limon Criston Austin, pull over before the car’s trunk opened and two females were seen attempting to climb out. As the agents approached, Austin allegedly accelerated again, causing the trunk to close with the females still inside. Austin’s vehicle allegedly stopped again, and one female exited the trunk before he accelerated another time, causing the second female to fall out of the vehicle. Both females were found to be in the U.S. illegally. Austin and a female passenger in his vehicle, Paris Engjqulique Walpool, were eventually taken into custody. Further investigation revealed that Austin and Walpool allegedly co-conspired with other facilitators after accepting a job in a Facebook group to “move” things in Eagle Pass for $2,500. Austin and Walpool are both charged with bringing in and harboring certain aliens.

Another U.S. citizen was charged in a separate incident for allegedly conspiring to transport two illegal aliens further into the United States. Sebastian Medina-Carrillo was arrested near Carrizo Springs on Sept. 11 when U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted a traffic stop on and allegedly observed physical abnormalities in an external fuel tank of his vehicle. An immigration vehicle inspection allegedly revealed two illegal aliens concealed inside the fuel tank. A criminal complaint alleges Medina-Carrillo was transporting the two aliens to Dilley and would be paid $1,000.

Three individuals, including two male illegal aliens and a female with a Permanent Resident Alien Card, were arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents after allegedly using two vehicles in an attempt to pick up and transport six illegal aliens who had crossed the border fence more than seven miles east of the Fort Hancock Port of Entry. The two vehicles were allegedly seen speeding away from where the illegal aliens had been observed. USBP agents initiated traffic stops, arresting Juan Pedro Zamarron-Navarrete, a Mexican national, who was identified as the driver of one vehicle. The alleged driver of the second vehicle, Ayde Castaneda-Rivera, and her passenger Oscar Chapa-Gomez, who was confirmed to be an illegal alien, were also arrested. Further investigation revealed that Zamarron-Navarrete had illegally re-entered the U.S. on Sept. 2, after serving six months in jail for an alien smuggling conviction and being removed to Mexico. The investigation also revealed that Castaneda-Rivera and Chapa-Gomez allegedly served as lookouts for Zamarron-Navarrete, who decided to leave the pick-up location when he saw USBP arriving.

On Monday, USBP agents in El Paso responded to a vehicle suspected of picking up seven illegal aliens who had just crossed into the U.S. A criminal complaint alleges that the agents observed an empty driver’s seat when they located the vehicle, and they found the seven aliens, including two unaccompanied illegal aliens, attempting to hide inside the vehicle. The driver, identified as U.S. citizen Miguel Arturo Corral, was allegedly located attempting to conceal himself in a nearby cotton field and was arrested on a human smuggling charge. Corral’s criminal history includes several prior convictions, including racing on the highway, driving with an invalid license, evading arrest, and two DWIs.

U.S. citizen Lucio David Rivera-Esparza was also arrested and charged with human smuggling in El Paso. USBP agents arrested two illegal aliens on Sept. 11 and noticed that one of the aliens possessed a cell phone that continuously received calls from a number originating in Mexico. A criminal complaint alleges that the cell phone led agents to a pick-up location where they met Rivera-Esparza, who had coordinated to transport illegal aliens further into the United States. Agents searched Rivera-Esparza’s vehicle and allegedly discovered a loaded handgun and an unknown amount of money in the center console. Agents also seized an additional $1,921 that Rivera-Esparza allegedly obtained by smuggling and transporting illegal aliens. Rivera-Esparza was convicted in April 2024 for a state charge of smuggling of persons and sentenced to five years in jail.

In Austin, Honduran national Jose Orellana Espana was taken into ICE custody after being encountered at the Travis County Jail. He had been arrested and charged with assault causing bodily injury to a family member and unlawful restraint. Espana was previously convicted in 2017 of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and unlawful restraint.

Ricardo Quiroz-Rincon, a Mexican national, was also encountered at the Travis County Jail where he had been charged with assault causing bodily injury. Quiroz-Rincon has been previously removed from the U.S. five times since 2009. He’s been twice convicted for improper entry by an alien, with three additional convictions for illegal re-entry.

""First off they shot pepper balls to the ground, and then said, 'Your First Amendment rights are on the sidewalk,'"" Abughazaleh told Newsweek on Friday afternoon. ""And then when we tried to get in the way of the van, they picked us up or dragged us away, for some people, shoved people. I was picked up and thrown.""

Why It Matters

While on the campaign trail last year, President Donald Trump pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Immigrants residing in the country illegally and legally, with valid documentation, including green cards and visas, as well as those in the process of obtaining legal status, have faced detentions.

Protests have been taking place in and around Chicago in recent days as federal agents have ramped up immigration enforcement in the city at the direction of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. While the department insists it is detaining the ""worst of the worst,"" advocates have raised concerns that that is not always true.

What To Know

The protest on Friday took place outside an ICE detention facility in Broadview, a neighborhood on the west side of Chicago. Among those taking part was Abughazaleh, who has attended other demonstrations at the facility in recent days.

In a video posted to YouTube two days earlier, the former journalist spoke about another experience of allegedly being thrown to the ground by DHS agents as she tried to stop vans outside the processing facility being used as the base of ICE action in Chicago.

Abughazaleh told Newsweek on Friday that federal agents took one protester away in chains, prompting a longer-than-planned protest.

""No one was violent. No one did anything that could possibly warrant being detained by federal officers. But they didn't care,"" she said.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responded by pointing a previous press release from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

""The violent targeting of law enforcement in Illinois by lawless rioters is despicable and Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson must call for it to end,"" McLaughlin said. ""The men and women of ICE put their lives on the line to protect the people of Illinois and all Americans.""

Other local officials were also on the scene at the protest, including Democratic Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton and Democratic Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss—another congressional candidate.

Biss shared on X that federal forces used tear gas to move protesters away from the ICE facility, with video showing clashes between agents and those vocalizing their concerns about the conditions at Broadview.

DHS later said that ""rioters assaulted law enforcement"" and that it was protesters who threw tear gas. The department added that it had asked local police for assistance but was denied.

Abughazaleh told Newsweek that the facility is supposed to temporarily hold immigrants held by ICE, but they are being held for several days.

""There have been reports of pregnant women and grandmothers being forced to sleep on the concrete. They're not given beds or hygienic products, or hot meals, actual meals,"" she said.

DHS has said it is seeking out known illegal immigrant criminals in the city and surrounding area under Operation Midway Blitz, the latest in a series of campaigns aimed at what the Trump administration calls sanctuary cities that stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.

Chicago is not alone in seeing locals clash with federal immigration efforts. In New York on Thursday, about a dozen Democratic officials were detained briefly following a sit-in protest at 26 Federal Plaza, an immigration court and processing facility.

Other sanctuary cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, have also seen demonstrations as the Trump administration continues to face resistance.

What People Are Saying

Kat Abughazaleh told Newsweek on Friday: ""We care about our community. That's why we are there. That's we are standing up. That's why we will not be intimidated.""

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, in a video on X on Friday: ""I have to tell you, it was terrifying, it was impossible to breathe and really, really scary. The point is they are trying to intimidate us, to stop us from standing up and being part of a non-violent resistance, and we will not be intimidated.""

Far-right influencer Laura Loomer, on X: ""I love watching communists get body slammed by ICE. Communist and Palestinian. Pick a struggle. @KatAbughazaleh.""

What Happens Next

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

Updates about “mass deportation” and detention: The population in ICE detention has leveled off for now as resources from the giant spending bill in July are only beginning to come online. Stepped-up ICE enforcement has sent a chill through immigrant communities in Chicago, where agents fatally shot a man from Mexico. Numerous media outlets published alarming investigations of miserable conditions in ICE detention facilities.

Defense and law enforcement officials being diverted from non-immigration cases: Several stories over the past week detailed how military personnel, and civilian personnel normally assigned to missions ranging from stopping drugs to stopping child sex slavery, have been pulled from their regular duties to assist the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort.

Expulsions of Central American children remain on hold: A Washington, DC judge issued a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from expelling a class of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, as it had sought to do during the pre-dawn hours of the Sunday before Labor Day. Evidence shows that government attorneys provided false information to the court when they claimed that the children’s families were seeking to reunite in Guatemala.

THE FULL UPDATE:

Updates about “mass deportation” and detention

Current numbers

As of late on September 18, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had still not reported the number of migrants that the agency encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border during August. This release is later than usual: CBP had provided this notification 12 days into March, 14 days into April, 13 days into May, 17 days into June, 15 days into July, and 12 days into August.

The difference may be that, at least according to a leak to the New York Post near the end of August, Border Patrol’s apprehensions of migrants stopped decreasing last month and instead increased by more than 50 percent over July. The reason, a “Homeland Security source” told the Post, was that people deported into Mexico after being apprehended in the U.S. interior have been “trying to sneak back into the United States.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data released on September 11 reported that the agency’s nationwide detained immigrant population totaled 58,766, down slightly from a likely record 61,226 on August 29 and 59,380 on August 14. Analyst Austin Kocher recalled that this number counts “people in one of 187 facilities across the country, as well as many potentially more in unmarked facilities and holding rooms.”

Of those in detention, 29 percent had been convicted of a crime and 25 percent faced criminal charges (ICE’s report does not specify the crimes or their severity). Forty-five percent had no criminal history at all.

Despite a massive new detention budget approved by Congress in early July, ICE’s “immigration enforcement blitz” is being bottlenecked by the slow pace of making new detention beds available, White House “Border Czar” Tom Homan told reporters. “The government has fewer than 65,000 beds,” about 6,000 more than the current detained population, an administration official told Politico.

ICE arrested 171,649 people in the U.S. interior between February 1 and September 7, averaging 784 arrests per day. During the first seven days of September, the average was 848 per day, down from a high of 1,052 per day in June. That month saw a sharp increase after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller’s widely reported late-May order to increase daily arrests to 3,000. Subsequent months’ modest decline in arrests, Kocher and Cato Institute analyst David Bier contend, may have been the result of a court order—overturned by the Supreme Court on September 8 (see WOLA’s September 12 Border Update)—that had limited street arrests in and around Los Angeles.

The data indicate that ICE has removed 302,192 people from the United States during the 2025 fiscal year, which started in October 2024. At the end of January 2025, this number had stood at 85,769, indicating that ICE, under the Trump administration, has deported approximately 216,423 people.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offered the conservative website Daily Wire a number that is impossible to verify: “more than 389,000 illegal immigrants already removed from the United States” so far in the Trump administration, a number that apparently takes ICE removals and adds CBP’s quick removals from the border, Coast Guard returns, and known “self-deportations.”

DHS repeated a claim to Daily Wire that another 1.6 million immigrants have left the United States on their own since January; PolitiFact looked at that number in early September and found it “half-true,” as it is based on a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey with a small sample size and large margin of error. Still, the Department’s top public affairs official apparently added the 1.6 million and the 389,000 and tweeted on September 17, “2 MILLION illegal aliens are out of the United States of America in less than 250 days.”

Chicago

In Chicago, the Trump administration’s so-called “Operation Midway Blitz” is now underway, with a surge of ICE, CBP, Border Patrol, and other federal law enforcement personnel fanning throughout the city seeking to detain undocumented people. Sweeps have so far been more “scattershot” than “massive,” Adrián Carrasquillo wrote at the Bulwark.

This deployment does not include National Guard personnel on a crime-fighting and ICE support mission, as President Donald Trump had threatened. Sending military forces against the wishes of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) promised too many “legal headaches” for the White House, as CNN put it. Trump has instead sent a new National Guard contingent to Memphis, in the Republican-governed state of Tennessee.

Word of stepped-up ICE (and accompanying agency) operations has spread a climate of fear through Chicago’s large immigrant and Latino communities. “The fear is not just overtly palpable but present in subtle ways as well,” Carrasquillo reported. “School attendance is down; parents are afraid to pick up their children from school. Community events are being canceled, and people are afraid to attend the Mexican Independence Day celebrations that started last week.” Businesses, particularly restaurants, are reporting 40 to 50 percent drops in revenue. Organizers decided to postpone a two-day “El Grito Chicago” festival that would have celebrated Independence Day in the city’s downtown.

While DHS released information on September 16 about 11 people arrested, portraying them as criminals, the total number of Chicago arrests so far is unclear. “I don’t have a sense of a number except to say that it is certainly higher than what ICE is reporting publicly,” read a statement from a spokesperson for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights reported by the Chicago-based investigative news site Unraveled.

The Chicago operation saw its first fatality on September 12, under circumstances that remain unclear in the suburb of Franklin Park. An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas González, a 38-year-old cook from Michoacán, Mexico, who had just dropped his children off at school. ICE reported that when agents sought to stop his vehicle, Villegas drove toward them, dragging one agent and injuring him, while another fired his weapon in self-defense. Villegas’s criminal record included only minor traffic violations, the local CBS News affiliate reported.

Reporting from Unraveled, citing security footage, “bystander videos,” and eyewitness accounts, casts doubt on the official narrative. “The sedan eventually reverses from the two agents, and the officer on the passenger side points his firearm at the vehicle. As Villegas-Gonzalez drives away from the agents—not toward them, as DHS claimed—the agent on the passenger side aims his weapon at the back of Villegas-Gonzalez’s car.”

The Mexican government’s Foreign Affairs Secretariat “condemns the violence” and has called for a “rigorous investigation” of the Villegas case, read a tweet from the agency.

Joe Botello, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, was briefly detained in a pre-dawn ICE raid on the house where he was living with several roommates, some of whom remain detained, in the suburb of Elgin. Masked, armed agents destroyed the home’s front and back doors. A camouflage-clad DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, visiting Chicago, was present for the raid; the Department shared a video including images of Botello, handcuffed. “I’m still a little bit in shock. I’m just glad that I’m OK,” he told the Chicago Tribune. “I recommend that everyone always have their documentation—their passport if they can, and any type of ID that would identify them. … Stay safe.”

L.A. and D.C.

Los Angeles continues to reckon with a surge of immigration operations that began in June. The Border Patrol agent placed in charge of the “at large” mission in the city and in Chicago, El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, testified in the trial of Brayan Ramos-Brito, a protester charged with assaulting agents on June 7. Ramos-Brito’s defense attorney recalled a past misconduct investigation, citing Bovino referring to undocumented immigrants as “scum, filth, and trash”; Bovino said that he was referring to a specific individual.

The jury acquitted Ramos-Brito, as video indicated that agents shoved the defendant first. The Los Angeles Times noted that the court had a difficult time building a jury in a community where “many potential jurors have negative views of immigration enforcement, or may be immigrants themselves.”

Miriam Jordan of the New York Times covered another June incident in Los Angeles, profiling 48-year-old Narciso Barranco, an undocumented Mexican citizen who has been in the United States since 1994 and raised three sons who served in the Marine Corps. Masked agents, at least some clearly Border Patrol, arrested Barranco on June 21 when he was landscaping the exterior of an IHOP. DHS tweeted a brief video of the arrest showing Barranco holding a weed whacker aloft and running, with the text “Perhaps the mainstream media would like our officers to stand there and be mowed down instead of defending themselves?”

“Mr. Barranco’s family said he was scared and just trying to move away, not to harm anyone,” Jordan reported. “Mr. Barranco’s memory of his arrest is fragmented: the blinding sting of pepper spray; beefy federal agents taking him down and pinning him to the pavement; their relentless blows; the pain radiating from his left shoulder.” Barranco is currently out of detention, on bond.

In Washington, DC, where increased ICE operations also continue, Chabeli Carrazana at the 19th reported on undocumented childcare workers forced to “go underground,” unable to take kids to parks, libraries, or other public spaces. “Nationwide, about 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrants, but in D.C. it’s closer to 40 percent; about 7 percent nationally are undocumented. Nearly all are women.”

Family separations

A Washington Post investigation revealed that, in an echo of the 2018 family separations crisis, ICE is taking children away from parents pursuing asylum cases. Agents are detaining parents in the U.S. interior and offering them a choice: give up their cases and be deported together, or persist in seeking asylum and have the children placed in Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody. As a result, “ICE has sharply increased the number of migrant children it is sending to federal shelters for unaccompanied minors,” more than 400 since the Trump administration began.

Death of Estela Ramos

Jacob Soboroff and Kay Guerrero of MSNBC reported on the September 8 death of 45-year-old Estela Ramos, the mother of a 17-year-old honors student who was the subject of a September 2 profile. The mother and daughter had been deported to their native Guatemala on July 4, just days after being apprehended at a routine ICE check-in in Los Angeles. Both had said that agents confiscated Estela’s blood pressure medications and did not return them. While in Guatemala, she was so afraid of the Barrio 18 gang members whom she had initially fled that she did not dare to seek medical help to replace them.

Detention

A Washington Post investigation revealed that an ICE inspection of the Trump administration’s sprawling new “Camp East Montana” tent detention facility at Fort Bliss, outside of El Paso, Texas, found that contractor Acquisition Logistics and medical contractor Loyal Source were in violation of at least 60 federal detention standards. These include failures to provide adequate medical care, proper recordkeeping, functioning plumbing, outdoor recreation, sufficient food, and reliable access to legal counsel or contact with relatives.

Even as the facility is “expected to hold up to 2,700 migrants at a time this month and as many as 5,000 by the end of the year,” armed guards at Fort Bliss lack clear rules for the use of lethal force. Still, it is “the first of at least 10 temporary, tentlike encampments that the Trump Administration plans to build at military bases and the sites of existing detention centers in the coming months.” Initial reports that “Camp East Montana” would only be used to detain people with criminal records appear to be inaccurate.

A four-month Guardian investigation found systemic due process violations, prolonged detentions, poor medical care, and opaque practices at ICE’s Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana, which it calls a “‘black hole’ where immigrants disappear.” At the facility run by the Geo Group, a major detention and prison contractor, detainees are often denied legal representation, held without timely medical screenings, and deported before legal requests are resolved. Former detainees recounted examples of verbal abuse and ridicule from guards, as well as physical mistreatment.

The piece notes “a temporary and unexplained change to normal medical standards earlier this year.” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin countered, “This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.”

The New York Times reported on the worsening mental health of people detained in ICE facilities for long periods, with “persistent reports of suicide attempts and people expressing thoughts of suicide in detention facilities.” After one man tried to hang himself after seven months in detention, officers at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana placed him “on suicide watch. This meant solitary confinement, where he fought off biting ants and endured black mold on the wall and feces in his cell.”

Lauren Villagrán of USA Today also wrote about the increasing application of solitary confinement in ICE detention facilities. The practice began to increase during the Biden administration but has since grown as a percentage of the overall detained population. “The more data that is released the worse we realize it is,” said Dr. Katherine Peeler of Physicians for Human Rights and Harvard Medical School, part of a team that released a new report on September 17.

At the family migrant detention center that the Trump administration reopened in Dilley, Texas, “the tap water is cloudy, smells strange and upsets stomachs,” attorneys, citing families, told the court in a case emerging from the administration’s effort to terminate a 30-year-old judicial agreement governing treatment of minors in immigration custody. “Children also struggle eating the food, like the snacks of graham crackers, apples, juice, and milk,” the Associated Press reported, adding that those in detention are charged $1.21 for a bottle of water, $5.73 for deodorant, $1.44 for soap, $2.39 for toothpaste, and $1.30 for a dose of Tylenol. “Parents said there are no organized activities for the children and only an hour of instruction from workbooks.”

A federal judge in New York issued a preliminary injunction strengthening an August 12 order to ICE to improve conditions in its short-term holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza in downtown Manhattan. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan found that conditions in the cells—designed for stays of 12 hours or less—likely “violated the First and Fifth Amendments,” the New York Times reported. Migrants, the report continued, have been “complaining about being held in the cells for days, and even up to three weeks. They said they were forced to sleep on the floor or sitting upright, and were deprived of showers, sufficient medical care, and legal representation. Some migrants said they had to contend with a stench emanating from shared toilets, which were in plain view of other detainees.”

The Women’s Refugee Commission launched a new Detention Pregnancy Tracker, which it describes as “the first nationwide tool designed to collect real-time reports on pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in U.S. immigration detention.” This is necessary, the organization notes, because DHS “has effectively gutted its monitoring and oversight agencies and is no longer submitting the previously required reporting to Congress on the number and treatment of pregnant detainees.”

Defense and law enforcement officials being diverted from non-immigration cases

WOLA’s September 5 Border Update cited data, obtained by the Cato Institute’s David Bier, regarding the large number of federal law enforcement personnel that the Trump administration has pulled away from their agencies’ missions and assigned to immigration enforcement. The call to support “mass deportation,” according to this data, has diverted one in five US marshals, one in five FBI agents, half of DEA agents, over two-thirds of the ATF, and nearly 90 percent of Homeland Security Investigations.

These diversions, along with drawdowns of military personnel and resources, were the subject of several media outlets’ investigations over the past week.

A Wall Street Journal investigation of the booming cocaine market found the migration mission hampering U.S. drug interdiction efforts. “The president’s campaign to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally has taken federal agents away from drug-traffic interdiction. In Arizona, two Customs and Border Protection checkpoints along a main fentanyl-smuggling corridor from Mexico have been left unstaffed. Officers stationed there were sent to process detained migrants.”

A Guardian investigation found that the Trump administration’s redirection of resources to immigration enforcement has dismantled U.S. programs to combat human trafficking, undermining “decades of progress” in developing programs to combat sexual slavery, forced labor, and child exploitation. The State Department’s Trafficking in Persons office lost over 70 percent of its staff, while Homeland Security Investigations agents have been reassigned to immigration raids, which has demoralized them. Reduced access to visas for victims, and intimidating “welfare checks” carried out by ICE agents in tactical gear have further complicated efforts. Meanwhile, “Traffickers exploit the fear of immigration enforcement and the police so they [victims] don’t come forward,” pointed out Stephanie Richard, director of the Sunita Jain Anti-Trafficking Initiative at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

Pulling 20 percent of FBI agents into the immigration enforcement mission—a greater percentage than were pulled into counter-terrorism after the September 11, 2001 attacks—has crippled the FBI’s ability to investigate cases against child predators, reported MSNBC’s Ken Dilanian. “Nearly every agent on Baltimore’s domestic terrorism squad was reassigned this year to work full time on immigration enforcement, forcing them to walk away from investigations of a network of violent predators that targets and exploits children online,” two former FBI officials said.

The Associated Press reported on a letter to the military services, signed by 12 of 13 Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, voicing strong concerns about the administration’s plan to assign 600 military lawyers, or Judges Advocate General (JAGs), to the Justice Department to serve as immigration judges. “These actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces,” the letter warns.

At the Intercept, Nick Turse tallied the number of active-duty and National Guard personnel serving in border security and immigration enforcement support roles, and found that the Trump administration has now deployed roughly 35,000 military personnel on domestic missions within the United States. That is 75 percent more than an estimate the Intercept compiled in July. Most are in Arizona, California, Florida, New Mexico, and Texas. “The true number of federal troops deployed may be markedly higher.”

The annual National Defense Authorization Act, which recently passed the House of Representatives, included a provision that would allow the Defense Department to deploy private military contractors to the border. This would enable the Pentagon to outsource tasks currently performed by soldiers to companies like the controversial outfit formerly known as Blackwater or the data-mining giant Palantir, the Lever reported.

The Justice Department’s instructions to prosecutors to prioritize immigration cases have brought a sharp increase in prosecutions of undocumented immigrants in San Diego, noted the San Diego Union-Tribune. Prosecutors filed 127 felony or misdemeanor re-entry cases in December 2024 under the Biden administration; that number increased to 486 cases in May 2025, even as border apprehensions plummeted.

In Texas, state police assigned to enforce federal migration law, organized as “regional tactical strike teams,” have helped arrest 3,131 undocumented immigrants between late January and early September, reported Alejandro Serrano at the Texas Tribune. Many arrests took place hundreds of miles from the border: 700 in Austin, Dallas, and Houston.

Expulsions of Central American children remain on hold

Washington, DC federal District Judge Timothy Kelly (a Trump appointee) issued a September 18 preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. DHS had sought to expel 76 children from U.S. shelters in the pre-dawn hours of August 31, the Sunday before Labor Day, only to be blocked by an on-duty judge’s temporary restraining order (see WOLA’s September 5 Border Update).

Kelly’s opinion takes administration officials to task for telling that judge, Sparkle Sooknanan, that the children’s parents were in Guatemala and desired to be reunited with their children. Separately, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Miller had tweeted that Sooknanan, whom he called “the Biden judge,” was “effectively kidnapping these migrant children.”

This was not true. After the revelation of a document from the Guatemalan government’s General Counsel’s Office recounting unsuccessful efforts to find any parents who actually sought to bring their children back, Trump administration attorneys retracted their story. On September 16, the Government Accountability Project added a whistleblower disclosure alleging that the acting head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), career ICE Homeland Security Investigations official Angie Salazar, likely knew that at least 30 of the Guatemalan children would have faced danger if returned.

“Counsel for Defendants [the Trump administration] explained why it was ‘fairly outrageous’ for Plaintiffs [the children’s attorneys] to have sued: all Defendants wanted to do was reunify children with parents who had requested their return,” read Judge Kelly’s opinion. “But that explanation crumbled like a house of cards about a week later. There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.”

“While he limited the ruling on Thursday to Guatemalan children,” the New York Times explained, “Judge Kelly… warned the government not to interpret the opinion as an invitation to expand its operations.” This refers to indications that the administration has been discussing similar transfers of unaccompanied children with pending immigration cases to Honduras and perhaps elsewhere.

A federal judge in Tucson, Arizona issued a similar temporary restraining order on September 11 to prohibit the deportation of another class of 57 Guatemalan and 12 Honduran children. That order expires on September 26.

The Guatemalan children’s attempted expulsion was a frequent topic in a contentious Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing about unaccompanied minor migrant children held on September 17. Republican senators alleged that hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors were released to unvetted sponsors and that more than 300,000 went “missing” during the Biden years, a misreading of a 2024 DHS Inspector-General report noting that 291,000 lacked court dates. Democrats said the “missing kids” narrative is being weaponized and that the real danger is the Trump administration’s attempts at mass removals and obstacles to sponsors seeking to get kids out of ORR shelters.

Hindus for Human Rights was proud to be part of this moment, with our team showing up in two different ways to stand alongside our immigrant neighbors.

Circling 26 Federal Plaza in Prayer

Our New York City Organizer, Vrinda Jagota, joined the New Sanctuary Coalition’s weekly Jericho Walk at 26 Federal Plaza, the building where ICE operates. Together with interfaith partners, Vrinda circled the building seven times, stopping to offer a prayer at each turn. This ritual walk draws on the biblical story of Jericho, symbolizing the spiritual act of bringing down walls of injustice through persistent, loving action.

This year alone, ICE has abducted more than 3,300 New Yorkers, many of whom are held in deplorable conditions after attending court hearings at 26 Federal Plaza. Yesterday’s walk was both a mourning of that reality and a collective call to resist.

Faith Leaders, Politicians, and Direct Action

While Vrinda was at the Jericho Walk, our Executive Director, Sunita Viswanath, joined a coalition of faith leaders—including Rev. Dr. Chloe Breyer, Rabbi Abby Stein, Rev. Junia Joplin, Rabbi Rachel Kahn-Troster and others—who accompanied a group of elected officials preparing for a direct action inside the building.

The faith leaders were not permitted past security. They gathered outside, prayed together, and sent the officials forward, blessing their courage. Once inside, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and more than a dozen other city and state leaders sat down outside the 10th-floor holding cells where undocumented immigrants are detained. They unfurled a banner demanding access to the cells—and were met with force. DHS agents arrested eleven officials, including Lander and Williams, after these official had staged a dramatic act of civil disobedience by sitting outside the 10th-floor holding cells with a banner, refusing to move until they were granted access to see the undocumented immigrants detained inside.

A Movement Building Momentum

These actions are part of a growing movement to hold ICE accountable for their deplorable behavior towards our neighbors and to dismantle the systems profiting from immigrant detention and deportation. Climate refugees, families fleeing violence, and individuals simply seeking a better life are caught in a web spun by Big Oil, prison profiteers, and an inhumane immigration system.

Hindus for Human Rights stands with our interfaith partners in demanding an end to these abuses. Yesterday, our community witnessed both the power of prayerful resistance and the necessity of bold, direct action.

What Comes Next

The fight isn’t over. We invite our community to join this movement:

Follow local groups like @newsanctuarynsc, @sunrisenyc, and other grassroots partners leading these actions.

Show up for future Jericho Walks to embody hope and resistance through prayer and presence.

Call on your elected officials to demand ICE out of NYC and an end to the detention-to-deportation pipeline.

Yesterday’s actions remind us that faith and justice are inseparable.

What happens now? - WHYY,"Associated Press, Jake Offenhartz",,,,,https://whyy.org/articles/immigration-judge-orders-mahmoud-khalil-deported/,"Three months after his release from an immigration jail, Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil is facing the growing threat of deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel.
In court documents made public Wednesday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Khalil should be deported for failing to disclose information on his green card application.
His legal team has said they intend to appeal the immigration judge’s ruling, which Khalil has characterized as “further evidence of retaliation” from a “kangaroo court.” Here’s a look at where things stand in the ongoing legal battle: What did the immigration judge in Louisiana decide?
The Sept. 12 ruling by the immigration judge, Jamee Comans, builds on her previous order issued in April, which found Khalil could be forced out of the country as a national security risk.
His wife is a U.S. citizen, as is his 5-month-old son, who was born while Khalil was in federal custody.","Three months after his release from an immigration jail, Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil is facing the growing threat of deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel.

In court documents made public Wednesday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Khalil should be deported for failing to disclose information on his green card application.

The decision marked a setback for Khalil, a lawful U.S. resident and recent Columbia University graduate student who became the first person targeted by President Donald Trump’s aggressive crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists. But while the ruling puts him one step closer to a final order of removal, it is far from the last word in the case.

For now, Khalil remains protected from detention and deportation under a separate judicial order. His legal team has said they intend to appeal the immigration judge’s ruling, which Khalil has characterized as “further evidence of retaliation” from a “kangaroo court.”

Here’s a look at where things stand in the ongoing legal battle:

What did the immigration judge in Louisiana decide?

The Sept. 12 ruling by the immigration judge, Jamee Comans, builds on her previous order issued in April, which found Khalil could be forced out of the country as a national security risk.

Khalil’s attorneys had challenged that decision, citing his lack of criminal history and close ties to the United States. His wife is a U.S. citizen, as is his 5-month-old son, who was born while Khalil was in federal custody.

Khalil was a prominent figure in protests at Columbia University against the war in Gaza, which spread to campuses nationwide. He was arrested inside his campus apartment building this past March and accused by the Trump administration of supporting “pro-Hamas” activity, referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Khalil has repeatedly denied the charge and the federal government has not provided evidence for it.

Khalil has argued he is being targeted for exercising his free speech, pointing to a memo by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that justified his arrest on the grounds that his pro-Palestinian beliefs could undermine U.S. foreign policy interests.

In her latest decision, Comans said she lacked the authority “to question foreign policy determinations” and that Khalil’s “limited family ties” to the country did not amount to a compelling reason to waive her prior ruling.

Comans then sided with the government on a separate claim, finding that Khalil had “willfully misrepresented” facts about his background on his green card application, including his role in a United Nations agency that provides services to Palestinian refugees.

Khalil has maintained that any omissions on the application were unintentional.

What happens now?

Khalil’s attorneys said Wednesday that they intend to appeal the decision. But they also expressed concern about their odds of success in the reliably conservative federal appeals court with jurisdiction over the case.

If he were to lose his appeal, Khalil would be stripped of his permanent residency status, further restricting his ability to work and travel, according to his attorneys. But the government would still be prohibited from removing him under a June 11 order from a federal judge in New Jersey, Michael Farbiarz.

That order will remain in place while his civil rights case plays out in New Jersey. It may soon be “the only meaningful impediment” to Khalil’s deportation, according to a letter that his attorneys sent Wednesday to Farbiarz.

Oral arguments in that case could begin as soon as next month.

Where would he be deported?

Judge Comans has said Khalil would be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or “in the alternative” Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

Attorneys for Khalil have said the publicity surrounding his case would leave him in mortal danger if he were forced to return to either country.

Khalil, 30, fled Syria for Lebanon in 2013 after joining protests against then-President Bashar al-Assad. His family has roots in Tiberias but were displaced during the mass expulsion of Palestinians from what is now Israel, according to court documents.

Khalil has said he will continue advocating for Palestinians as his legal battle plays out. He is also currently suing the Trump administration for $20 million in damages, alleging that he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite.

Over 14 months from April 2024 to May 2025, more than 10,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in detention facilities run by the U.S. Homeland Security Department’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, the report found.

From February to March 2025, the number of detainees subjected to the practice increased by an average of 6.5% per month, more than six times the average recorded between April and November 2024 under the Biden administration.

It appears to be becoming more and more punitive, and solitary confinement is part of that.

— Dr. Katherine Peeler, medical advisor for Physicians for Human Rights

The United Nations says solitary confinement, isolation without meaningful human contact for 22 hours or more per day, should be banned except in “very exceptional circumstances” and should never be used to isolate the mentally ill or minors. No one should be held for longer than 15 days, which the U.N. considers psychological torture. But previous reporting by ICIJ has documented ICE’s misuse and overuse of solitary confinement as a form of punishment intended only as a last resort.

“This report adds to over a decade of persistent advocacy and research,” the report said. “ICE must publicly commit to ending solitary confinement entirely.”

In 2019, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ Solitary Voices investigation found that ICE detention centers had used solitary confinement to isolate thousands of the most vulnerable immigrant detainees, including people with severe mental illness or disabilities, and LGBTQI people, for weeks and months at a time. Follow-up reporting in 2020 found that ICE resorted to solitary confinement to isolate sick people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The United States maintains the world’s largest immigration detention system, with over 60,000 people in immigration detention this August — a record high hit under the second Trump administration. Solitary confinement has been used across administrations, however. A previous Physicians for Human Rights report released in February 2024 also noted an uptick in the use of solitary confinement under the Biden administration.

But the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which gave ICE a historic $75 billion in additional funding and quadrupled its detention budget, has increased the urgency of the report’s findings, according to Dr. Katherine Peeler, medical advisor for Physicians for Human Rights and assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.

“It’s important to think about this in the context of rapidly escalating detention system in the United States,” Dr. Peeler said. “It appears to be becoming more and more punitive, and solitary confinement is part of that.”

The report, based on publicly available ICE data as well as records obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, documents how the rate of monthly increases in the use of solitary confinement during the first four months of the Trump administration is twice as high as it was between 2018 and 2023.

The analysis also found that during the first three months of 2025, people with vulnerabilities — such as those with disabilities, mental health conditions or those at risk of violence due to their sexual orientation or gender identity — were held in solitary confinement for more than twice as long as they had been over the same period in 2022.

ICE did not respond to ICIJ’s request for comment but Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told The Guardian that detainee safety, security and wellbeing was “a top priority at ICE.” McLaughlin said any allegation that ICE is “weaponizing” solitary confinement against detainees was “DISGUSTING and FALSE.”

Since December 2024, new federal reporting requirements have made it mandatory for ICE to collect and report data on all solitary confinement placements, regardless of duration. But, despite the transparency measures, ICE data has continued to be notoriously barebones, and in some cases inconsistent, said Arevik Avedian, a law lecturer and the director of Empirical Research Services at Harvard Law School.

“I use, oftentimes, a web archive to be able to go back to the different versions and check and see: what are the things that are changing, and how they’re changing?” Avedian said. “There was a month during this Trump administration where the data was published, and then in the next updated version, two weeks later, that monthly information for solitary confinement disappeared, and then it was put back.”

In that way, even with some data available, ICE detention remains “a black box,” she said.

“I kind of shudder to think what it’s really like if we had a truly complete, comprehensive data set of every single placement, every single person,” Dr. Peeler said.

The report also broke down data on solitary confinement in New England, finding segregation was used to retaliate against detainees for filing grievances, sharing food or requesting access to basic necessities like showers. Between 2018 and 2023, nearly three out of four solitary confinement placements in New England lasted 15 days or longer; on average, detainees spent about a month in solitary, and some were isolated for more than a year.

In light of a forceful federal immigration crackdown and ballooning funding for the federal immigration agency, the report calls on lawmakers at all levels of government to use their powers to intervene and impose stronger oversight mechanisms in detention facilities, such as unannounced inspections or visits.

“The urgency of addressing these abuses is further heightened by ICE’s active obstruction of Congressional oversight, including denying entry to lawmakers seeking to inspect facilities in their own districts,” the report said. “ICE cannot be presently trusted to account accurately, let alone implement humane policies in its existing facilities.”",https://media.icij.org/uploads/2025/09/2221602767-Edited.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 16:57:14.509195

It is un-American and wrong to use this act of violence as a pretext for weaponizing the government to threaten nonprofit and charitable organizations, other perceived adversaries, or any class of people. They did not commit this murder, and the vast powers of the government should not be abused to threaten their constitutionally-protected free speech and other rights.

Nonprofit and charitable organizations support critical services to our nation – working with faith communities, caring for vulnerable populations, upholding the Constitution, defending the rule of law and much more. Attacks on nonprofits and charities threaten that essential work happening everywhere across our country.

We implore the government to cease its escalation of political division, and stop the unjustified targeting of organizations and people in the wake of this terrible act of political violence.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order allowing it to strip legal protections from more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants.

The Justice Department asked the high court to put on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that the administration wrongly ended Temporary Protected Status for the Venezuelans.

The federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to put on hold the ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen while the case continues.

In May, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary order from Chen that affected another 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. The high court provided no explanation at the time, which is common in emergency appeals.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the new court filing that the justices’ May order should also apply to the current case.

“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this Court’s orders on the emergency docket,” Sauer wrote.

The result, he said, is that the “new order, just like the old one, halted the vacatur and termination of TPS affecting over 300,000 aliens based on meritless legal theories.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending TPS for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection during Joe Biden’s presidency. TPS is granted in 18-month increments.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary.

Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security acted “with unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner … for the preordained purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela’s TPS” status.

In denying the administration’s emergency appeal, Judge Kim Wardlaw wrote for a unanimous three-judge appellate panel that Chen determined that DHS made its “decisions first and searched for a valid basis for those decisions second.”",https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_Tariffs_07704_b0ade8-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-09-19 16:57:27.322609

Tensions have been rising in the Chicago area for the last two weeks, since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents intensified their push to arrest people in the country illegally, under an effort called Operation Midway Blitz. Demonstrators have typically gathered outside the federal detention facility in the suburb of Broadview, Ill., on Friday mornings, and their numbers have grown in recent weeks.

During the standoff with protesters on Friday, ICE deployed tear gas and pepper balls at the group, including several local officials. A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Advocates for immigrants have repeatedly raised concerns about conditions at the detention facility, which is used for processing immigration arrests.

“This facility should be shut down, that’s what it comes down to,” said Byron Sigcho-Lopez, a member of the Chicago City Council, who was there during the standoff. Mr. Sigcho-Lopez, who represents a ward with many Latino residents, has been a vocal opponent of ICE’S presence in Chicago.

Mayor Daniel Biss of Evanston, Ill., after wiping tear gas from his eyes, called the actions of ICE “a performance in brutality.”

“They are trying to send a message of public violence and oppression,” he said. “Our job is to resist it as visibly, vocally and aggressively as we can while staying nonviolent.”

Before the clash, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton had stopped outside the Broadview facility and said that she and Gov. JB Pritzker, both Democrats, were monitoring ICE activities in Illinois.

Last Friday, an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a 38-year-old man whom officers were trying to arrest during a traffic stop in Franklin Park, a suburb of Chicago near O’Hare International Airport with a significant Latino population. The ICE officer “followed his training, used appropriate force and properly enforced the law,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/19/multimedia/19trump-news-ice-topart-gpfm/19trump-news-ice-topart-gpfm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 16:57:18.555810

Some, like the trade agreements Mr. Trump announced with Vietnam and South Korea in July, have yet to be completed.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent first announced that the United States had a “framework” for a deal to keep TikTok operational in the United States at a news conference in Madrid on Monday.
“We’re trying to get it back because they need things from us,” Mr. Trump said.
It stated that the United States would “withdraw from Afghanistan all military forces of the United States.” During its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the United States left behind thousands of weapons and other pieces of military equipment and a sprawling embassy compound that sits vacant in the center of Kabul.","“This is what restoring sanity to America’s immigration system looks like,” Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said in a statement. “Conditions in Syria no longer prevent their nationals from returning home. Syria has been a hotbed of terrorism and extremism for nearly two decades, and it is contrary to our national interest to allow Syrians to remain in our country. T.P.S. is meant to be temporary.”

Some immigration policy experts criticized the decision, saying that conditions in Syria were still unstable and that Syrians did not pose major terrorism risks. After more than a decade of civil war, rebels ended the Assad family’s brutal rule in Syria late last year. Although Syria’s new leaders have sought to move away from dictatorship, concerns over sectarian conflict and violence remain.

Amanda Baran, the former head of policy for Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said the decision to end the program was “gutting for the thousands of Syrians here with T.P.S. and the communities in which they live.”

“Conditions in Syria remain dangerous and unstable, clearly warranting an extension under the law,” Ms. Baran said. “This administration’s disregard for the expertise of human rights experts is having real, dire consequences on the lives of everyday people as demonstrated by this reckless decision.”

David J. Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that favors more legal immigration, said that Syrians historically did not pose significant terrorism risks, and that federal officials could choose to deny an individual from the program if they believed that person was a threat to national security.

Mr. Bier said he also thought it was contradictory for the department to assert that Syria was a “hotbed” of terrorism, while saying that it was safe for Syrians to return there.

Syrians with T.P.S. will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country before they are subject to arrest and deportation, department officials said. The program, which was first authorized for Syrians in 2012 and extended several times, was slated to end on Sept. 30 after receiving an extension from the Biden administration.

The Obama administration first authorized the protections because of the civil warfare in Syria. In a statement announcing the designation, Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary at the time, said Syrians in the United States “would face serious threats to their personal safety” if they were forced to return home. She also said applicants would undergo full background checks to gain approval for T.P.S.

The end of the T.P.S. program is the latest effort by the Homeland Security Department to terminate deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants who had been authorized to temporarily live and work in the United States. The administration has also moved to end the status for people from countries including Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Cameroon and Afghanistan.

The actions are part of the Trump administration’s broader initiative to ramp up deportations and crack down on immigration. The administration has also moved to end other programs that temporarily authorized hundreds of thousands of migrants to live and work in the country lawfully, including a Biden-era program that granted protections to people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Administration officials have said the protections were always meant to be temporary and that conditions in certain countries have improved, making it safe for migrants to return home.

The protections for Syrians have been extended multiple times. During President Trump’s first term, his administration extended the designation twice, though it excluded migrants who came to live in the United States after Aug. 1, 2016. Administration officials said at the time that the ongoing armed conflict in Syria had justified allowing Syrians to remain in the country.

The Biden administration extended the program three times. It also opened up the program to more people, allowing Syrians who had been living in the United States since Jan. 25, 2024, to apply for T.P.S.

Some of the Trump administration’s efforts to end deportation protections have been met with legal challenges. After the administration tried to terminate temporary protections for Haitians by September, for example, a federal judge blocked it from doing so until at least next year. Before he left office, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. extended those protections through February 2026.

Still, the administration is insisting on a guarantee of more than $36 million, representing about 30 percent of the federal financial aid that has flowed to the university during the past year, because of financial risks posed by more than a dozen government investigations targeting the university.

Harvard officials have never suggested that the university’s financial footing is in any immediate danger. The school has the largest endowment of any in the nation, but most of that $53 billion fund is restricted for specific purposes.

University leaders have, however, expressed concerns about the potential long-term effect of the monthslong battle with the administration, which has resulted in the freezing of billions of dollars in federal research funds.

In a separate letter, the administration on Friday also warned Harvard about additional enforcement actions from the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights unless the university provides more documents related to its admissions policies, including individualized student data on race, gender and standardized test scores.

The Trump administration’s targeting of Harvard is the most prominent part of its broad assault on higher education this year, rooted in conservative concerns over diversity practices and the handling of campus antisemitism. The pressure campaign has plunged campuses into financial and political crises as the government cuts research grants, opens investigations and demands steep settlement payments. Some colleges, including Columbia University, have negotiated deals with the Trump administration.

Harvard has privately considered a settlement, but has so far resisted government pressure. A Harvard spokesman declined to comment on the latest inquiries.

The university previously criticized the government’s actions as retaliation against Harvard for defending its rights and freedom. A federal judge agreed earlier this month, ruling that the Trump administration had broken the law by freezing research money and ordering no further funding blockades “in retaliation for the exercise of its First Amendment rights, or on any purported grounds of discrimination without compliance with the terms” of civil rights law.

The White House has vowed to appeal the ruling, but has restarted the flow of research funds to the university, including $46 million from the Health and Human Services Department on Friday, said Jason Newton, a spokesman for Harvard.

“We are pleased to see the disbursement,” Mr. Newton said. “This is an initial step, and we hope to continue to see funding restored across all of the federal agencies.”

The Education Department opened its investigation into Harvard’s admissions policies in May, and the university has provided a trove of documents. But the administration has maintained that Harvard has refused to provide individualized and anonymized data for each student — such as race, ethnicity, gender, standardized test scores and grade point average — that the government says will show whether the university is discriminating against white and Asian students.

The aggressive actions from the Trump admini stration come as negotiations between Harvard and the White House have stalled over a landmark settlement that would restore the university’s research funding and resolve the multitude of federal investigations aimed at addressing a perceived liberal bias on campus.

The Cambridge, Mass.-based university has challenged the administration in court and resisted the White House’s push to include an independent monitor to ensure compliance with any agreement. The administration views a monitor as a way to strengthen the current framework of a deal that some on Mr. Trump’s team view as too favorable to Harvard. University negotiators have consistently opposed the idea of a monitor.

Harvard and the White House engaged in a steady back-and-forth earlier this year over how to resolve the administration’s concerns about antisemitism on campus, the legality of the college’s admissions polices and additional issues raised by more than a dozen separate federal investigations opened since February.

Still, the government has continued to ramp up the pressure. The State Department demanded a trove of detailed records about the university’s international students in July. In August, the Commerce Department opened a new investigation into Harvard’s patents.

Now, the Federal Student Aid office is raising questions about the university’s financial stability by pointing to risks presented by the flurry of federal investigations aimed at Harvard.

The letter from the student aid office also said Harvard’s sale of $750 million in bonds in April, layoffs of staff over the summer and a salary freeze initiated this year “call into question the ability of Harvard to meet its financial responsibility obligations.”

And the panelists said they felt unready to decide whether to limit the use of a vaccine for hepatitis B that is typically given to all newborns. Some said they still had questions about the vaccine’s safety, while others seemed relieved that the panel did not make what they saw as a rash decision that might harm children.

“We are more prudent when we are cautious,” Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a neuroscientist formerly at the National Institutes of Health, said as he voted to table the vote.

Thursday’s session ended with the panel members at odds. A hot microphone caught one panelist calling another committee member “an idiot,” although it was unclear who was speaking.

Friday’s session, too, at times devolved into raised voices and sharp-toned remarks. Dr. Jason Goldman, a liaison to the committee from the American College of Physicians, accused the committee’s chair, Martin Kulldorff, of muting him.

“You want debate and discussion, but you’re muting people and silencing them,” Dr. Goldman said. “If you could respectfully tell the public how you are going to be analyzing all of these vaccine decisions, we can have confidence in this committee.”

Dr. Kulldorff retorted: “You made that comment before, and I responded to that comment in a very nice and polite manner.”

The decisions of the committee, which is meeting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, are of enormous importance. Most private insurers are required to cover the shots it recommends — although they may choose to cover those not recommended — and many state policies on vaccines are tied to the committee’s guidelines.

At least some members seemed aligned with Mr. Kennedy’s goal of making sweeping changes to routine childhood immunizations. Mr. Kennedy has maintained for years that children receive too many shots, and he has incorrectly claimed that the vaccines in use today were never properly tested.

The indecision of the panelists was a sign of the hurried way that Mr. Kennedy assembled the committee. Most of the panelists are first-time members, and their inexperience seemed to lead to the confusion that marred the meeting. About half of the committee members were appointed to the panel earlier this week.

On Thursday, the committee voted to rescind the M.M.R.V. vaccine’s use in children under 4. A second vote was on whether the Vaccines for Children program, which provides shots to about half of American children, should continue to cover the cost of the shot. The committee voted yes on Thursday and then reversed that decision on Friday, in another vote.

Such a contradiction was a first for the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, as was the decision the next day to redo the vote.

Approving which shots the vaccine program should cover is a key function of the committee, but some members did not appear to know how their decision would affect coverage. Several members said Thursday that they were unclear what they were voting for. One abstained from the vote, citing his confusion as the reason.

The members themselves seemed uncomfortably aware of the optics.

The panelists have “enormous depth and knowledge” about vaccines, Dr. Kulldorff acknowledged on Friday, but they are “rookies” when it comes to how the A.C.I.P. committee typically makes decisions.

In June, Mr. Kennedy fired all 17 previous members of the committee, and appointed seven new members, many of whom are aligned with his vaccine skepticism. He announced another five members earlier this week. Members of the A.C.I.P. are typically vetted for months to years before they are invited to join.

Some medical organizations sharply criticized the committee’s skipping of the methods the A.C.I.P. has typically followed, with detailed discussions on the feasibility and acceptability of the decision, the cost-benefit ratio and equity concerns.

Instead, the panelists were “distracted” by small studies that raised safety concerns, said Dr. Amy Middleman, who heads pediatrics and adolescent medicine at Case Western Reserve University. She is a liaison to the committee from the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Every vaccine and drug carries risks, she said, but “the committee’s scientific challenge is to determine whether the benefits outweigh the risk.”

Public health experts who study hepatitis B said they were pleased that the committee postponed the vote on that vaccine.

“Tabling the vote is appropriate and a relief,” said Dr. Noele P. Nelson, a senior author on the current guidelines for the vaccine and a former leader of the C.D.C.’s hepatitis vaccines work group.

“This discussion should not be rushed and would benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation of the public health impact,” she said.

Babies are routinely immunized for hepatitis B within 24 hours after birth. The committee was scheduled to vote on whether the shot should instead be recommended only for those newborns whose mothers were known to be infected. Other babies, the motion said, should be immunized only after they are at least one month old.

Hepatitis B experts noted that the vaccine has nearly eliminated maternal transmission of the disease in the United States, slashing the incidence to fewer than 20 cases a year from about 20,000 a year before 1991, the experts said.

They said delaying the first dose of the vaccine would increase the risk to newborns because many cases in pregnant women are missed, despite a longstanding recommendation to test them routinely.

Infected women may also not be identified because of inaccurate results or because of problems reporting or interpreting the results.

“A universal birth dose recommendation is the only way to ensure we don’t miss vaccinating newborns exposed to this virus, including those whose mothers were not tested during pregnancy,” said Dr. John. W. Ward, director of the Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination and a former head of the C.D.C.’s viral hepatitis division.

Hepatitis B experts also questioned the panel’s focus on the vaccine’s safety, despite years of data from millions of babies showing that the shot is safe. Some committee members were also unhappy with the discourse.

The discussion about the hepatitis B vaccine’s potential harms was veering into “speculation,” Dr. Hibbeln said on Thursday, sounding frustrated. “We need data on real risks and benefits.”

The committee is scheduled to vote on Covid-19 vaccines later on Friday and is expected to restrict access to those shots.

A readout of the call from a Chinese state-run news agency was similarly vague, but Mr. Xi appeared to support a commercial solution to TikTok. It reported that Mr. Xi said the Chinese government “respects the wishes of the company in question and is glad to see business negotiations in line with market rules and a solution that conforms to Chinese laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides.”

TikTok’s future has been in limbo in the United States since January, when a federal law took effect requiring the company to find a non-Chinese owner or face a ban in the United States. The law was intended to address national security concerns that the app’s ownership could give Beijing a channel to spread propaganda or to collect sensitive data about Americans. Mr. Trump has extended the deadline four times.

ByteDance has for months been in talks to spin out the app’s American operations into a new company, and to bring on new U.S. investors, like the software giant Oracle, to dilute its Chinese ownership and satisfy the law’s requirements. The list of other potential investors has been in flux, two people familiar with the talks said.

In a statement on Friday, ByteDance thanked the two leaders for “their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States.” The company added that it would “work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.”

The fate of the app has also become entangled with trade negotiations between the United States and China, as the two sides have haggled over tariffs, China’s supply of minerals and other topics. In his post Friday, Mr. Trump said that he would meet Mr. Xi at a summit in South Korea this fall and go to China early next year, and that Mr. Xi would reciprocate.

Mr. Trump has in the past heralded major deals that ended up falling short. The president has announced a flurry of trade deals this year, only to have some foreign trading partners subsequently dispute the terms he described. Some, like the trade agreements Mr. Trump announced with Vietnam and South Korea in July, have yet to be completed.

His deals with China have not always materialized, either. In 2020, the president announced a trade deal in which China would commit to buying an additional $200 billion worth of American goods and services by 2021. A 2022 analysis of the trade data found that China had bought only 57 percent of the exports it promised.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump added a detail to the TikTok agreement: The United States would be receiving a “tremendous fee” for putting the deal together. If that occurs, it would be the latest example of the government’s incursion into corporate deal making. In recent months, the Trump administration has negotiated and obtained a 10 percent stake in Intel, and a “golden share” in U.S. Steel as part of its sale to Nippon Steel.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent first announced that the United States had a “framework” for a deal to keep TikTok operational in the United States at a news conference in Madrid on Monday.

Chinese officials had previously vowed to oppose a forced sale of TikTok, and in 2020 it amended its export control list to include technology like algorithms and source codes.

China decided to reach an agreement with the United States on TikTok because “this consensus serves the interests of both sides,” Li Chenggang, China’s vice minister of commerce, said in Madrid on Monday after meeting with American officials, according to a readout published in Chinese state media.

On Tuesday, one day before a deadline for TikTok to separate from ByteDance, Mr. Trump issued an extension — the fourth this year — to mid-December. With the president’s suggestion on Friday of a deal approval, the extension could prove to be the final one.

Republicans have offered a plan to keep federal spending mostly at current levels through Nov. 21 and provide $88 million in emergency funding to bolster security for the members of the executive branch, the Supreme Court and Congress after the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. The House passed that plan on Friday in a 217-to-212 vote, with all but one Democrat in opposition.

Democrats have put forward an alternative that would extend funding through Oct. 31 and add more than $1 trillion to extend Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and roll back Medicaid and other health program cuts that Republicans included in their marquee tax cut and domestic policy law enacted over the summer. G.O.P. leaders have flatly ruled out those changes.

On Friday, neither bill could muster the 60 votes necessary to move ahead, with each party dug in against the other’s measure. If they fail to break their impasse and enact at least a temporary spending plan by Sept. 30, the government will shut down.

The Democratic plan failed in a 47-to-45 vote. The Republican plan failed in a 44-to-48 vote.

All Democrats but one, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, opposed the G.O.P. proposal. Two Republicans, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky, joined Democrats to oppose their party’s bill.

Democrats refused to provide the votes to move forward with the Republicans’ plan because, they said, the G.O.P. has not negotiated with them on what should be included at a time when President Trump has sought to usurp congressional spending power.

“Republicans cannot expect that another take-it-or-leave-it extension of government funding that fails to address health care costs is going to cut it for the American people,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “What we should do instead is move forward with our Democratic proposal to work to keep the government open, to lower people’s premiums, protect people’s health care.”

Republican leaders have said there is nothing to negotiate because their funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or “C.R.,” keeps spending levels flat and has no policy changes attached.

“The Republican bill is a clean, nonpartisan, short-term continuing resolution to fund the government to give us time to do the full appropriations process,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader. “And the Democrat bill is the exact opposite. It’s what you might call not a clean C.R.; a dirty C.R. laden down with partisan policies and appeals to the Democrats’ leftist base.”

Mr. Thune said that he would call up the Republican proposal for another vote when senators return to Washington on Sept. 29. Lawmakers are set to spend the next week working at home.

Democrats argue that their plan includes vital measures to help Americans deal with health care costs.

If the Obamacare tax credits are allowed to lapse, around four million people are projected to lose coverage starting in 2026, and prices would go up for around 20 million more. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that 10 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 as a result of the health cuts in the new tax law.

Democrats’ stopgap spending plan also would restrict the Trump administration’s ability to claw back funding Congress previously approved, following the White House’s repeated efforts to unilaterally cancel such spending.

And it would provide far more funding to strengthen security measures for government officials than House Republicans have proposed — $326 million in total, compared to the $88 million boost sought by the G.O.P.

In March, the last time Congress faced a government funding deadline, Senate Democrats agonized for days over whether to allow Republicans’ stopgap measure to move forward. They ultimately allowed it to advance, prompting an outpouring of anger from liberal voters and activists who had urged their leaders to deny their votes in protest of Mr. Trump’s assault on the federal bureaucracy and unilateral defunding of programs.

This time, Democrats have not hesitated to signal their refusal to go along with Mr. Trump and Republicans, arguing that they are in a much different position after passage of the tax cut and domestic policy bill.

That measure, Mr. Schumer said, “is highly unpopular with the American people.

“Democrats are unified,” he went on. “We have been strong on the same message for a very long time, which is: We need to help the American people lower their costs, particularly on health care.”

It was not clear who wrote the draft congressional authorization or whether it could pass the Republican-led Congress, but the White House has been passing it around the executive branch.

The broadly worded proposal, which would legally authorize the president to kill people he deems narco-terrorists and attack countries he says helped them, has set off alarm bells in some quarters of the executive branch and on Capitol Hill, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity about sensitive internal deliberations.

Three people familiar with the matter said that Representative Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and combat veteran who sits on the Armed Services Committee, was involved in developing the draft. Mr. Mills, a staunch Trump ally, declined to comment on the potential legislation or his role. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, declined to comment, citing a policy against discussing “drafts that may or may not be circulating.”

An administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, said the draft originated with a member of Congress who had asked for technical assistance in improving it. The official portrayed its circulation for input by executive branch agencies as a routine courtesy that should not be interpreted as support for the idea.

The measure has emerged amid an escalating debate in Washington over the president’s war-making power and Congress’s role in authorizing the use of American military force, after the Trump administration opened a deadly campaign against the boaters.

The two boat attacks — killing what Mr. Trump has said were 14 people he accused of smuggling drugs toward the United States — were the latest in a series of military operations the president has taken without congressional authorization, raising constitutional concerns among some lawmakers in both parties, who say their branch should play a greater role in such decisions.

Critics have also said that Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have given illegal orders, causing Special Operations troops to target civilians — even if they are suspected of crimes — in apparent violation of laws against murder.

The U.S. Coast Guard, with help from the Navy, has long treated drug trafficking as a law enforcement problem, interdicting boats and arresting their crews if a search confirmed suspicions of drug smuggling. Regular forces repeated that approach with a Venezuelan fishing boat last week, releasing its crew after the suspicions apparently proved to be inaccurate.

But the administration has insisted that Mr. Trump has legal authority, under his constitutional power as commander in chief, to direct Special Operations forces to instead summarily kill those suspected of drug running as if they are combatants on a battlefield. Citing the roughly 100,000 overdose deaths of Americans each year, the administration has invoked self-defense and the law of armed conflict.

Congress has not authorized any armed conflict with drug cartels. The draft legislation, which the White House Office of Management and Budget has circulated within the executive branch for comment, would address that potential weakness in the administration’s argument — at least as a matter of domestic law.

Following the first boat strike, on Sept. 2, Democrats and some Republicans expressed concern about the White House’s legal basis for the attack, even as administration officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, said there would be more to come.

Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said he would introduce a measure under the War Powers Resolution, a 1973 law aimed at checking a president’s power to wage war without the consent of Congress, that directs the executive branch to curtail the operation.

Before Mr. Schiff did so, Mr. Trump on Monday announced a second deadly strike against what he described as a Venezuelan boat in international waters. Together with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, Mr. Schiff on Friday morning introduced the measure, which would direct the administration to end any additional planned strikes and reassert congressional authority over the use of military force.

The resolution also states that Congress has received insufficient information about the vessels, their threat level or the legal basis for using force against them. It also reaffirms a commitment to funding intelligence gathering, diplomatic tools and counternarcotics efforts to fight drug trafficking.

At a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing on Thursday, several Democrats asked questions about the legal authority for the military strikes. But a Pentagon nominee said he was unable to answer them. At the end of the hearing, the Republican chairman of the panel, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, said the administration must respond.

“The questions about what happened in the Caribbean are going to have to be answered,” Mr. Wicker said. “This committee has congressional oversight responsibility. Members are entitled to ask the questions that they’ve asked, and answers will be given. And I just think it’s important for every American to understand that obligation.”

Some Republicans have discussed ways to shore up Mr. Trump’s legal authority. Mr. Mills, who served during conflicts in Kosovo and Iraq, advised the Pentagon in Mr. Trump’s first term before launching his bid for Congress in 2021 and winning election the following year.

The draft, which was described to The New York Times, would cover groups that the executive branch designates as terrorists and that Mr. Trump determines, in consultation with Congress, have either trafficked in drugs to finance terrorist activities or used terrorist tactics to advance narcotics-related enterprises. Nations that harbored such groups would also be covered.

It does not define what constitutes sufficient consultation with Congress or what counts as terrorist tactics.

Such an authorization would amount to giving Mr. Trump “a blank check,” said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and a former senior Justice Department official in the Bush administration.

“It’s insanely broad,” Professor Goldsmith said. “This is an open-ended war authorization against an untold number of countries, organizations and persons that the president could deem within its scope.”

Professor Goldsmith said that Congress had the authority, as a matter of domestic law, to authorize the use of military force against nonstate groups. But deliberately killing civilians who are not directly participating in hostilities — even those suspected of being criminals — would still violate international law, he added.

The draft appears to be modeled on the broad authorization that Congress granted President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Like that one, it does not name a specific enemy — empowering the president to decide whom to target — and is not confined to geographical limits.

The 2001 law was originally understood to target Al Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan. But over the years, as the original Al Qaeda splintered and morphed, administrations of both parties stretched it into standing legal authority to fight related groups of Islamist militants, like the Islamic State and Al Shabab, in places like Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

The draft has one key difference: It would expire after five years if Congress did not act to extend it. The 2001 law will remain on the books until lawmakers repeal it. Repeated efforts in Congress to do so have foundered over disagreements about what should replace it.

Any decision to push the draft legislation to Congress is likely to set off a pitched political fight over how to weigh a serious problem against fatigue with open-ended “forever wars,” and the wisdom of what would be a massive expansion of Mr. Trump’s ability to use the military as he sees fit. It would also raise the question of whether Congress was effectively giving Mr. Trump the authority to wage a regime-change war in Venezuela.

Mr. Trump’s administration has been ratcheting up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicolás Maduro, calling him an illegitimate leader and accusing him of directing the actions of criminal gangs and drug cartels.

Starting in February, the Trump administration broke new ground by labeling various Latin American criminal gangs and drug cartels as “terrorist” organizations, including some from Venezuela. That label and status has traditionally been given only to violent groups with religious or ideological ends, as opposed to criminals seeking illicit profits.

Mr. Trump claimed the right to use an 18th-century wartime deportation law, the Alien Enemies Act, to summarily remove Venezuelans suspected of belonging to one of the criminal gangs his administration had deemed to be terrorists, Tren de Aragua, without due process hearings.

To invoke the law, Mr. Trump claimed that Tren de Aragua was committing crimes in the United States under the direction and control of Mr. Maduro. But the U.S. intelligence community, weighing the available evidence about the gang, believed that accusation was false, a memo declassified in May showed.

Mr. Trump used the law to send several planeloads of Venezuelan migrants to a notorious Salvadoran prison. But courts have for now blocked more such transfers, and have raised doubts about whether the law could be legitimately invoked under present circumstances.

A congressionally authorized armed conflict, however, would provide a new basis for the administration to claim a right to resume using it for summary deportations.

In July, Mr. Trump signed a still-secret order directing the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American criminal gangs and drug cartels, while stepping up rhetorical attacks on Mr. Maduro. And in August, the U.S. Navy sent a heavy amount of firepower into the southern Caribbean Sea, leading to the Sept. 2 and Sept. 15 attacks.

This week, before Mr. Trump announced the second boat strike, Mr. Maduro condemned the Sept. 2 attack as a “heinous crime” and “a military attack on civilians who were not at war and were not militarily threatening any country.”

He said that if the United States believed that the boat’s passengers were drug traffickers, they should have been arrested. He accused the administration of trying to start a war.

Helene Cooper and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

“We’re trying to get it back because they need things from us,” Mr. Trump said. He added that Bagram was strategically important for the United States because “it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.”

Mr. Trump has said in the past that the United States should not have abandoned the air base, but his comments on Thursday were the first public acknowledgment that negotiations to reclaim it might be underway.

The Taliban government was quick to respond, suggesting that it was open to conversation but not the return of U.S. security personnel.

“Without the U.S. having any military presence in Afghanistan, both Afghanistan and the U.S. need to engage with each other, and they can have political and economic relations based on mutual respect and shared interests,” Zakir Jalaly, an Afghan foreign ministry official, said on social media.

“Afghans have never accepted the military presence of anyone throughout history,” Mr. Jalaly added. “But for other kinds of engagement, all paths remain open for them.” He called Mr. Trump “a good businessman and negotiator, more than just a politician.”

Other officials were less diplomatic. Muhajer Farahi, a deputy minister, posted part of a poem on X: “Those who once smashed their heads against the rocks with us, their minds have still not found peace.” He ended his post with “Bagram, Afghanistan.”

Mr. Trump did not specify in his comments on Thursday what he envisioned for Bagram. The United States has kept a minimal level of public engagement with Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, restricting it to hostage negotiations. In a rare visit to Afghanistan last week, Adam Boehler, the Trump administration’s special envoy for hostage response, met with the Afghan foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, in Kabul.

The State Department referred any comment about Bagram to the White House, which referred comments to the Department of Defense. It said in a statement on Thursday that “we are always ready to execute any mission at the president’s direction.”

In Washington, congressional Democrats assailed Mr. Trump’s comments.

“It’s deeply, deeply troubling that the president of the United States can be that idiotic,” Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said in an interview.

Afghanistan has remained largely isolated on the global stage since the Taliban took control, in August 2021. The Taliban government has not been recognized by any country other than Russia. Its economy is struggling to attract foreign support and private investments. And as high-level meetings at the United Nations General Assembly are set to begin on Monday, Afghanistan will once again not be represented because its officials face a U.N. travel ban.

Bagram, which sits 25 miles north of Kabul and was built by the Soviet Union in the 1950s, was the largest U.S. base in Afghanistan during its 20-year occupation of the country.

Mr. Trump said in March that the United States should have stayed at Bagram “not because of Afghanistan but because of China, because it’s exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles.” At the time, he claimed that Bagram was “now under China’s influence,” which the Taliban denied.

The 2020 deal signed between the Taliban and United States under the first Trump administration contained no provision to retain Bagram Air Base or any other foothold. It stated that the United States would “withdraw from Afghanistan all military forces of the United States.”

During its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the United States left behind thousands of weapons and other pieces of military equipment and a sprawling embassy compound that sits vacant in the center of Kabul. U.S. military uniforms and shoes can still be found in Kabul’s bazaars, and a message in graffiti greets international visitors coming from the airport: “Our nation defeated America with the help of God.”

“Targeting activists for deportation is not a rule of law, it’s a rule of fear. This sets a dangerous precedent: using immigration enforcement to penalize political dissent and silence protest.

Jennifer McKiernanPolitical reporter

The UK military is focused on defending the nation rather than stopping asylum seekers from crossing the Channel, a cabinet minister has said.

US President Donald Trump suggested that military intervention could be used to deal with illegal migration to the UK during his state visit this week.

But Trade Secretary Peter Kyle has rejected that call, telling BBC Breakfast the UK Border Force has specific responsibility for policing UK borders.

Hundreds of migrants attempted to cross the Channel earlier on Friday, as the second deportation under the government's ""one in, one out"" deal with France took place.

Six boats are believed to have set off from northern France, as the smugglers made the most of a break in the windy weather in the Channel. There had been no crossings for a week before then due to choppy seas.

People were then seen being taken from the Port of Dover by coach, including two small children.

On Friday morning, an Eritrean man became the second migrant to be deported under the government's deal with France, after he lost a High Court bid to halt his removal.

The Home Office tightened the rules around human trafficking claims to win that case.

On Friday afternoon, Home Office sources said an Iranian male had also been returned to France after crossing the Channel in a small boat.

Speaking at a press conference at Chequers on Thursday, Trump suggested military force was a better deterrent than the Labour government's approach of diplomatic negotiations agreeing returns and toughening up court guidance.

Speaking alongside Sir Keir Starmer at the prime minister's country residence Chequers, Trump suggested such force was needed as illegal migration ""destroys countries from within"".

He said: ""You have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn't matter if you call out the military, it doesn't matter what means you use.""

Asked about the US president's claims, Kyle told BBC Breakfast: ""Well, what he suggested was the military are used, but we have the UK Border Force that is now established and has been reinforced and bolstered and have new powers under this government.

""The navy actually does have a working relationship with the UK Border Force, and the navy can be called upon if needed, so we do have the functional relationship that we need between our military and keeping our borders safe and secure.

""But what we really need at the moment is our military focused on all of those really key issues around the world, directly relating to our national defence.""

Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge dismissed Trump's suggestion that military could be used to cut illegal migration, saying it would be ""extremely complicated"".

He told BBC Look East that ""we have a border force…we need a deterrent"" and cited the Conservative government's Rwanda plan, which he said would have been ""extremely effective"".

The Supreme Court ruled that the African country could not be considered to be safe at all, because of human rights abuses, and the plan was scrapped almost immediately after Labour took office last year.

'Different geography'

Trump has issued a series of executive orders implementing a broad ban on asylum for migrants entering at the southern US border and has sent in troops to assist border security efforts.

The arrests of migrants by the US Border Patrol have been decreasing since Trump took office.

The Conservatives and Reform UK are calling for tougher action on migration, with Reform saying it would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum.

Neither party has proposed using military force, although Nigel Farage has said a Reform government would tow small boats back to France ""as an absolute last resort"".

The Ministry of Defence recently said that military assets had been bought ""for defence tasks"" and were ""not optimised"" to be used in tackling illegal migration.

General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of UK Joint Forces Command, cautioned that the involvement of the British military would be limited by the ""very different geography"" involved in migration flows.

Speaking to The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4, he added: ""I don't think France is going to be very enthusiastic about British troops on French beaches, unless they were very carefully co-ordinated.""

He added that the military was unlikely to ""add very much"" to existing efforts to spot boats using commercial drones.

""When migrants arrive in the UK, the Home Office has a system for gathering them up and the military would add manpower to that but they're not going to make the problem any different.""

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has vowed to fight what she called ""vexatious, last-minute claims"" and Kyle described her as ""straining at the bit"" to make sure the pilot one-in-one-out scheme for migrant returns was a success.

""We're making sure we get as many people as don't have the right to be here returned as swiftly as possible,"" he said, adding there are ""a lot of cases"" going through court.

Asked whether there was any target figure for the number of returns, Kyle said: ""Our target is to make sure that everybody who comes to our shore and doesn't have the right to stay is removed from the country, that is our target.

""We want to get a full grip on the system, we want to make sure people see a functioning system that's delivering so rapidly, efficiently and swiftly that people don't come here in the first place, that's the deterrent that we need.""

About 100 men who arrived in the UK by small boat are currently in immigration removal centres near Heathrow and may be removed to France under the scheme.

The Home Office said more deportation flights are planned into next week and a government appeal has been launched, aimed at limiting the time migrants have to provide evidence to challenge their removal.

More than 5,500 migrants have reached the UK since the scheme came into effect at the start of August but the government is hoping continuing removal flights will act as a deterrent.

CNN's Jake Tapper explains the business practices going on as a result of ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" being taken off the air and how the Trump administration plays a role in it.

President Donald Trump criticized Jimmy Kimmel and dismissed questions over whether his suspension amounted to an attack on free speech during a press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel came after FCC Chariman Brendan Carr, threatened to take action against Disney if they did not address Kimmel’s comments about the reaction to Charlie Kirk’s murder.

President Donald Trump was greeted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his wife, Victoria, at their country residence, Chequers, as the two leaders meet to discuss a range of geopolitical issues.

Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk, appeared virtually for his first court hearing since he was formally charged with aggravated murder, among other charges. Prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty in the case.

A New York judge on Tuesday dismissed two terror-related murder charges against Luigi Mangione, finding they are “legally insufficient,” according to the judge’s ruling.

Dashing actor, Oscar-winning director, and environmentalist Robert Redford has died at 89, according to his publicist. Known for his starring roles in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and “All the President’s Men,” Redford also directed award-winning films such as “Ordinary People” and “A River Runs Through It.” Redford was also a dedicated environmentalist and led efforts to preserve the natural landscape of the American West.

Several homes were damaged or destroyed in San Juan County, Utah, on Saturday. The state rarely sees destructive tornadoes, with only three confirmed in that county since 1950, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.

The US military killed three people in another deadly strike on a vessel in international waters near South America.

A Fox News crew caught the moment a teen stomped on a memorial to Charlie Kirk in Arizona. Police identified the man as Ryder Corral. The 19-year-old was taken into custody and police say he has been booked into the Maricopa County Jail on one count of criminal damage and another count for disorderly conduct.

Gov. Spencer Cox (R-UT) told CNN’s Dana Bash that the nation faces a “dark chapter” following Charlie Kirk’s assassination, calling the violence a “direct assault” and urging Americans to look inward to repair divisions.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/114063-icearrest-ilfamilyvertical.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-19 14:57:29.878363

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can use this funding to further escalate the administration’s unprecedented and indiscriminate deportation agenda that separates families, detains students and children, and terrorizes communities. A new report from the Center for American Progress details how by supercharging the Trump administration’s deportation agenda, the OBBBA threatens local communities and economies across the United States.

ICE is already operating with impunity in response to the Trump administration’s demand to arrest 3,000 immigrants per day. The deployment of the National Guard to support federal immigration officials in Los Angeles and the nation’s capital has spread fear in local immigrant communities. And with no end in sight to the administration’s cruel and unwise policies, the full extent of the economic and human impact on families and communities will only multiply as the OBBBA funds are expended. In fact, ICE’s annual budget will nearly triple—from approximately $9.9 billion to $28 billion. At the same time, the administration has essentially dismantled the congressionally created watchdog agencies that provided oversight of DHS. The report demonstrates the need for Congress to hold the Trump administration accountable for its reckless and indiscriminate immigration enforcement actions.

Specifically, the report outlines several frightening and wide-ranging uses of the OBBBA funds, which provide $45 billion to expand ICE’s detention capacity to 100,000 beds and nearly $30 billion to dramatically increase ICE’s personnel and enforcement operations. These funds will:

Turbocharge the rampant and reckless targeting of immigrants for arbitrary arrests and detentions by ICE agents who are often masked and unidentifiable.

Dramatically increase the detention of people in inhumane conditions at private facilities with insufficient oversight.

Likely lead to a massive financial windfall for private prison companies, since nearly 90 percent of immigrants in ICE custody are held in private facilities.

The report also lays out the widespread harm of the Trump administration’s aggressive enforcement tactics on people, communities, and the economy:

Undocumented immigrants make up an estimated 45 percent of the agricultural workforce, and an estimated 1.6 million undocumented immigrants work in construction. The Trump administration’s deportation efforts will drain workers from these critical fields, harming housing and infrastructure projects while also driving up food costs.

Immigrants contributed an estimated $29.3 billion to state and local taxes in 2022, and small businesses across the country report that the administration’s reckless enforcement tactics have led to drops in sales as immigrant families stay home for fear of detention.

The OBBBA’s blank check to fund the administration’s mass deportation agenda will escalate indiscriminate immigration raids, ensnaring long-time immigrants and tearing families apart.

Giving the Trump administration a slush fund for ICE to operate above the law and arrest anyone—even those who have contributed to our country for years and pose no threat—is not the answer to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system. A secure border is mandatory for a functioning, efficient immigration system, but, as the report underscores, an actual solution to fix what’s broken must also respect due process and the rule of law; reflect our values; and strengthen the American economy and local communities.

What we know:

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Tuesday's five arrests were part of Operation Midway Blitz, a targeted initiative aimed at undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem joined the effort, which included serving a felony arrest warrant.

Among those arrested, according to DHS:

Carlos Gonzalez-Leon, of Mexico, convicted of assault of a family member causing bodily harm. He has previously been deported.

Jose Morales-Rodriguez, of Mexico, convicted of aggravated DUI with a child passenger under 16 and driving with a revoked or suspended license.

Juan Eduardo Solarzano-Morales, of Mexico, arrested on domestic violence, harassment, obstruction, and felony stalking charges. He was served a protection order earlier this year.

Victor Manuel Rodriguez-Pantoja, of Mexico, accused of entering the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and location.

Ruben Antonio Gonzalez-Querales, of Venezuela, who DHS said was released into the country under the Biden administration.

What they're saying:

Secretary Noem praised the operation, saying, ""President Trump has been clear: if politicians will not put the safety of their citizens first, this administration will… Our work is only beginning.""

The backstory:

Operation Midway Blitz is one of two federal immigration efforts underway in the Chicago area. DHS is also leading Operation At Large.

Last week, federal authorities announced at least 13 arrests in Chicago linked to Operation Midway Blitz, describing those taken into custody as the ""worst of the worst.""

DHS has been ramping up its mass deportation efforts since President Donald Trump took office in January, including in large cities such as Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

In recent weeks, Trump has expressed interest in cracking down on crime in Chicago after a multi-agency surge in D.C. led to a reported decrease in crime and hundreds of immigration-related arrests.

The other side:

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and other state leaders have criticized the immigration enforcement operations, saying they create fear in immigrant communities and undermine trust in law enforcement.

""People are frightened about the potential of military troops coming to our neighborhoods. People are fearful of masked men in unmarked vans who could grab them on a street corner because of how they look or how they sound,"" Pritzker said.

""I’d rather see a dozen ICE agents here at the office standing off against peaceful protestors than out on the streets terrorizing my neighbors,"" social worker Quinn Pennington said.","Federal agents shot pellet guns and deployed tear gas on a crowd of protesters Friday morning gathering outside the Broadview ICE processing center.

Protesters returned to the facility for a day of demonstrations, vowing to keep pressure on federal immigration officials after previous tense confrontations.

What we know:

Crowds gathered outside the facility at 1930 Beach St. from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. They plan to return at 7 p.m., with organizers expecting a larger turnout after work hours.

The site has long been a focal point for activists opposing ICE operations in the Chicago area.

Dozens of protesters gathered outside the facility for the third straight Friday, trying to block vehicles from entering or exiting.

Kat Abughazaleh, a candidate for Congress in the 9th district, was captured on video being thrown to the ground by federal agents. She said she was bruised but not hurt.

Two other protesters were detained inside the facility during the confrontation for trying to stop transport vans from moving detainees captured by ICE.

Aerials from Sky Fox showed the view behind the gate, where detainees were cuffed and on their knees, waiting to be taken to holding facilities.

As agents prepared to move more vehicles, agents on the roof fired pellets near the crowd gathered in front of the gate. They released tear gas cannisters, the smoke grew and the chemicals spread.

Several protesters were seen gagging, coughing and vomiting. They shared water and poured it over their faces.

Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) was right up front when it happened.

""We were kind of on the front line of it as a vehicle was coming, and so we were looking to block the vehicle. It still kept driving, almost ran over someone and at that point, we started seeing the pellets. So it was tear gas, it was pepper spray, a little mix of both. So you could feel it even under the mask and start coughing and spitting out to get everything,"" Vasquez said.

Vasquez was wearing a mask at the time.

""Even through the mask, you can feel it, like right now you can still feel a little burning in the eyes, the back of the neck, just because of the chemicals themselves. I was able to walk, cler my head a little bit and grab water, one to take care of myself but then make sure other people were okay,"" Vasquez said.

Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton was one of several local officials present at the protest. She said the crowd would not disperse while they are exercising their First Amendment rights.

""They want us to be afraid. They want us to step back and kind of go into our little corners and not do anything so that this president can make a military presence on American soil normalized. We're not going to let that happen,"" Stratton said.

What they're saying:

A week ago, protesters said they were met by more than a dozen ICE agents wearing military clothing and carrying guns, and that agents twice fired ""chemical weapons"" into the crowd.

""ICE doesn’t make me or my community safer,"" demonstrator Britt Hodgdon said in a statement. ""If exercising my right to free speech gets me tear gassed, then I’m not safe. If my neighbors go missing into a deportation system where their families can’t find out where they’ve been taken, then my neighborhood is not safe.""

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson recently announced federal officials plan to use the facility as the ""primary processing location"" for people detained in the Chicago area by ICE this fall.

Last week, protesters blocked a vehicle they believed was being driven by an ICE agent as it attempted to enter the facility. Activists said they remain determined to continue their demonstrations.

""I’d rather see a dozen ICE agents here at the office standing off against peaceful protestors than out on the streets terrorizing my neighbors,"" social worker Quinn Pennington said. ""If coming out means I can keep my community even a little bit safer, I’m going to keep showing up.""

Dig deeper:

ICE has been ramping up its mass deportation efforts since President Donald Trump took office in January, including in large cities such as Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

In recent weeks, Trump has expressed interest in cracking down on crime in Chicago after a multi-agency surge in D.C. has led to a reported decrease in crime and hundreds of immigration-related arrests.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/ed2e3a48-snapshot-5.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-19 14:57:40.666744

The recruitment push has appeared in Chicago with one commercial that appeared on ESPN asking law enforcement officers to apply for ICE, urging recruits to “fulfill your mission” to “protect America.”

“Attention Chicago law enforcement,” the ad says, with a backdrop of the city’s skyline. “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city safe. But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down.”

The commercial, like other recent ICE advertisements on TV, radio and social media, lauds a signing bonus of up to $50,000, student loan repayment of up to $60,000 and loan forgiveness options, as well as other benefits.

Chicago has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign, and it has accelerated with this month’s launch of “Operation Midway Blitz” under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

A spokesperson for Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office said in a statement that the ads targeting Chicago officers set back the work he and Chicago Police Supt. Larry Snelling have done to increase the police department’s retention rate, which has been notably poor in the last decade.

“The president’s desire to poach officers from CPD’s ranks has the potential to decrease the number of police officers serving on the streets of Chicago and would only undermine our public safety efforts, which have led to historic decreases in violent crime,” Johnson’s spokesperson said.

ICE’s marketing campaign aims to help bring in 14,050 new hires and generate more than 42 million views among its target audience, which includes former military and law enforcement personnel, legal professionals, Gen Z and early career professionals, according to procurement documents filed by ICE last month.

“ICE is facing a critical and time-sensitive need to significantly increase its workforce to meet expanding operational demands,” the documents state. It states the agency is looking to hire enforcement officers, Homeland Security investigations agents, lawyers and support staff.

The agency already has around 21,000 employees. In July, funding for the DHS and ICE increased drastically, with $170 billion allocated to immigration and border enforcement, and ICE’s budget tripled to about $30 billion.

DHS officials said Tuesday that the agency has received more than 150,000 applications for ICE from across the country, and it has extended more than 18,000 job offers, though the recruitment timeline is unclear.

The procurement documents also said ICE was looking to contract with a women-owned small business for its ad campaigns.

Virginia-based Marcom Group, which describes itself as a woman-owned small business, has a $47.5 million contract with DHS through Sept. 25 for “marketing and advertising recruitment services.”

Marcom Group couldn’t be reached for comment. An ICE official didn’t expand on details of the agency’s marketing campaign.

John Paul Rollert, University of Chicago’s professor of behavioral science, likened ICE’s advertising blitz to the U.S. Army’s “We Want You” campaign featuring Uncle Sam during World War I and World War II. He said it’s a similar call to join the federal government to take action and address an “urgent problem.”

“When you’ve decided that the scope of the need is as big as the Trump administration believes it to be, you have a personnel issue. You need to hire as many people as you possibly can and cast as wide a net as you can and get people as quickly as you can,” Rollert said. “If Chicago is one of those parts of the country that they have determined they need to catch a lot of people, then you’re going to have to hire a lot of people who are already there to do it.”

ICE said in its procurement documents that it wants to advertise on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and streaming platforms like Hulu and HBO Max.

In Chicago, commercials have aired on ABC, ESPN, CBS, Fox, Telemundo, Univision and WGN. Spokespersons for those companies either did not return a message seeking comment or declined to comment.

“Clearly they [media companies] neither have a principled objection against what ICE is doing nor do they fear reprisal for running those ads,” Rollert said.

Other commercials call on people to “join the mission” to “catch the worst of the worst.”

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has appeared in commercials as part of a multimillion-dollar ad campaign “warning illegal aliens to leave our country now or face deportation with the inability to return to the United States.”

She and Trump have also appeared in social media ads calling on people to “Defend the Homeland.”

Rollert said ICE’s advertising bombardment doesn’t come as a surprise because of Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement and because a niche audience is most likely to apply.

“These are people who will be entrusted with the use of violence, lawful violence, to accomplish government goals,” he said. “It’s not just that you need 14,000 people. You need 14,000 — ideally —very specific people.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba36ca2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3705x2115+23+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2F11%2Ff5f7e45c4f06b7fcdfd4e9d0728c%2Fimg-1572.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 12:58:16.572021

Latest on Litigation

Doe v. Noem is a case challenging the mass termination of the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) parole processes and thehalting of adjudications of immigration applications for parolees who entered on CHNV and other parole programs including Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) and family reunification parole.

Here’s where we are:

On September 12, the First Circuit Court of Appealsheld that the administration’s early mass termination of CHNV parole was likely lawful. In its opinion, the court interpreted that the language of the parole statute and its legislative history do not require parole to be terminated on an individualized basis. The court did not think Secretary Noem needed to further consider the “urgent humanitarian reasons” motivating the CHNV program – and their continued relevance for CHNV beneficiaries. However, the court did recognize:

“the risks of irreparable harm [that mass termination has wrought]… that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month – a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries… or staying after the loss of their legal status, which means the risk of removal proceedings and detention, the loss of any work authorization, and potential effects on their eligibility for other forms of immigration relief in the future.”

The September 12 decision means termination of parole and work authorization remains in effect for CHNV beneficiaries while litigation over the lawfulness of the CHNV parole termination continues at the district court. The September 12 decision does not affect the district court’s May 28, 2025, order, which requires the government to process the immigration benefits applications – including for asylum and green cards – for humanitarian parole beneficiaries.

CHIRLA v. Noem is a case challenging the administration’s placement of people who entered through parole into expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process.

Here’s where we are:

On September 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the government’s request to stay the district court’s order to protect people paroled into the United States from expedited removal. This ruling leaves in place the district court’s order, issued on August 1, which found that it was unlawful to place those who entered on humanitarian parole into expedited removal. This means that any person who entered on parole and is detained should insist that ICE cannot place them in expedited removal per the lower court’s decision. Please contact Hilary Li at JAC, if you hear of cases of ICE nonetheless pursuing expedited removal.

Latest on Enforcement Policies

Dismissals of cases and arrests by ICE at immigration courts have dropped off significantly (and these practices are being challenged in federal court in New York.) But, on September 8, the Supreme Court ruled that immigration agents can stop, question, and demand papers from anyone they guess to be here illegally based on how they look, what language they speak, what work they do, or where they happen to be. This sanctions the ongoing violent, racialized immigration enforcement by masked agents in Massachusetts, Los Angeles, Washington DC, and Chicago that has led to arrests of, among others, people who arrived on parole and are seeking asylum and who are legal permanent residents and U.S. citizens. Communities have mobilized to protect their neighbors, including through alerts about the presence of immigration enforcement and through protests – in Washington DC, in upstate New York, and near the Midway Airport outside Chicago – to stop arrests. Congregations and communities are coming together to support families impacted by immigration arrests and organizing protests at ICE detention facilities.

The administration’s effort to turn USCIS into an agency that hinders application processing and handles immigration enforcement is happening on many fronts, including:

USCIS hampered the ability of Venezuelans to take advantage of a court order reinstating their TPS by making it impossible to re-register electronically through the USCIS website – a problem that was only fixed by bringing additional litigation.

A regulation giving USCIS officers not only the power to issue orders of expedited removal but to carry weapons and make arrests – including potentially arresting sponsors or supporters accompanying relatives to interviews and appointments – will go into effect on October 6.

Forthcoming proposed regulations will limit eligibility for work authorization. This will come on top of the already lengthening adjudication times for work authorization applications, partly caused by USCIS’s eliminating efficiencies and adding dilatory and unnecessary vetting to their procedures.

These changes at USCIS have had, and will have, important impacts on people who entered on parole. Though USCIS has been ordered to resume processing applications by parolees per the Doe v. Noem lawsuit, attorneys in that case have complained of lack of “meaningful action” on diversity visa applications. USCIS has told E-verify employers to check status reports that list revoked work permits, though some people who entered on humanitarian parole may be eligible to work based on other applications.

People who have come in on parole should be aware of resources such as the Legal Pathways Learning Tool and others that may help them find alternative authority to work. A legal challenge – Sileiri Doe v. Noem – to the mass termination of parole and revocation of work permits for people who arrived through CBP One appointments is ongoing.

Latest from Congress

On September 18, the Congresswoman Jayapal of the House Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement (House Judiciary Committee) hosted a shadow hearing titled “Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s Assault Destroys U.S. Families and Communities.” Members highlighted how they have had to navigate information blackouts, instances when they have not been able to locate constituents across ICE detention facilities, the shortage of publicly available data, and limited responses from the administration.

The hearing featured witnesses who testified about the traumatic arrest, detention, and deportation of loved ones and underscored the damage wrought on American communities and the economy by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies. Witnesses also proposed solutions including the creation of legal pathways to citizenship, greater transparency to challenge indiscriminate enforcement practices, and amplifying constituents’ stories to help shape public understanding of the issue.

FY26 Appropriations Update: The House GOP leadership released bill text for a continuing resolution to keep the government open through November 21. Separately, Democrats released bill text for a proposal of their own to keep the government open through October 31. At the time of writing, Speaker Johnson is eyeing a vote on the GOP CR by September 19, and if passed, would then move to the Senate where Democrats have already come out in strong opposition to a stopgap bill. Relatedly, while the House had already released its Homeland Security funding bill and approved out of committee on June 24, the Senate is yet to release its version.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: Is this like pro bono?

XIAO WANG: So two things. One is, yes, we offer our services free of charge, right?

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah. [LAUGHING] The students aren't making billing hours for this.

XIAO WANG: You could see the car that I drove in on.

[LAUGHTER]

It was not a Lamborghini, so.

[THEME MUSIC]

NATALIE BLAZER: This is Admissible. I'm Natalie Blazer, Dean of Admissions at UVA Law. I'm so excited for today's episode not only because it's something I get questions about all the time from prospective students, but also because I think the topic we're discussing today is very relevant to the times that we're living in.

My guest today is Xiao Wang, director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at UVA Law. He has led appeals and argued cases before the US Supreme Court, the federal courts of appeals, and other federal courts and agencies. In addition, he organizes the En Banc Institute and supervises the National Appellate Clinic Network, which was recognized as a finalist for Bloomberg Law's Law School Innovation Program.

Professor Wang previously worked as a litigator at Williams & Connolly and Wilkinson Steklov, where he led investigations or litigation on behalf of Mars, Under Armor, and the National Football League. Professor Wang writes about federal courts, constitutional law, and law and religion. His work has appeared in the Michigan Law Review, Vanderbilt Law Review, and Columbia Law Review Forum. And his popular writing has appeared in Bloomberg, The Chicago Tribune, and The Los Angeles Times.

Prior to joining the Law School, Professor Wang taught at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law as a clinical assistant professor and director of the Appellate Advocacy Center, where he supervised the Supreme Court and federal appellate clinics. Professor Wang clerked for Judge Karen N. Moore of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and Judge Lucy H. Koh of the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Although, I believe she's now on the Ninth Circuit.

Professor Wang earned his BA in economics and master's in public policy from the University of Virginia, where he was a Jefferson Scholar. He earned his JD from Yale Law School, where he was a Truman Scholar. Before law school, Professor Wang worked as a consultant at McKinsey & Co. What a bio. [LAUGHS] Welcome to the show, Professor Wang.

XIAO WANG: Hey, thanks so much for inviting me to be here. I'm really looking forward to it.

NATALIE BLAZER: I am, too. I am, too. So as a little icebreaker, I love asking people who were here for a time as students in Charlottesville and then went away and then came back-- because that's what I did-- but did you have any favorite spots as a student and either the same spots now as a professor or different?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah. There are some spots that have stayed constant favorites. So when I was a student here, the Bodo's on the corner actually opened--

NATALIE BLAZER: Mm!

XIAO WANG: --after a long awaited construction timeline. And so--

NATALIE BLAZER: Wow. Opened for the first time?

XIAO WANG: The Bodo's on the-- I think it opened in 2007 when I was an undergrad.

NATALIE BLAZER: Wow. So that's when I was in law school. I don't even think I realized that it was new at that point. That's cool.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, so that. The herb cream cheese and everything bagel has always been a steadfast constant for me. I would say one thing that's changed is, when I was a student here, for maybe a special once-a-year, maybe once-every-two-year treat, I would go to TenSushi or, you know. And luckily the Law School pays me well enough that I can go there a little bit more regularly-- not that much more regularly, but a little bit more. And they're obviously standouts in the Charlottesville dining.

NATALIE BLAZER: For sure. So speaking of your time here at UVA, even though you didn't go here for law school, you are a Double Hoo--

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: --because you got your undergrad and your masters. So how did you decide to come to UVA?

XIAO WANG: It was sort of a little bit on a lark. One of my friends from high school, his brother had come to UVA. And I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio. And one of my friends from high school, his brother, had gone to UVA. And I'd been like, oh-- his brother was this three-sports star and head of the class. And when you're growing up in Ohio, not everyone even goes out of state.

NATALIE BLAZER: For sure.

XIAO WANG: So I asked him, I was like, well, why'd you decide to go out of state? And why did you decide to choose UVA and all that? And he said, well, it turns out I got this really great scholarship, the Jefferson Scholarship. And he told me all about it. And it sounded like this amazing package. It truly is an amazing package.

And I remember thinking, well, we were going to go on an East Coast college visit swing with my parents. And we decided to stop in Charlottesville. We literally took the scenic route and stopped by and saw the mountains and everything. And I sort of loved it.

And I remember going to the admissions committee open house. And I asked them about the Jefferson Scholarship because I was like, wow, this is a sweet deal, such a great deal. It's such a beautiful campus. How could you say no? And they were like, well, yeah, no one gets that.

[LAUGHTER]

So just try to apply and get in, and you'll have a great time here. So I sent in my application and applied to a couple other schools, as well. And I think each round of the Jefferson Scholarship-- it's this multi-round process. Each round, I don't know how it happened, but I would just make it to the next round and make it to the next round. And I ended up getting it.

I was incredibly fortunate, very privileged, very blessed to get it. And I mean, that makes the decision really easy, I think, because UVA is such an amazing school. The people here are just incredibly nice and kind and wonderful. The other students, the faculty at the undergrad are just fantastic. And it just made it a really easy decision to come here, and I've never regretted it.

NATALIE BLAZER: I love that story. ""Nobody gets that."" It just goes to show you you have to try. Don't let people get you down.

XIAO WANG: Exactly, exactly. So I'm very happy to report-- I don't even remember who the person from the admissions office was, but--

[LAUGHTER]

--yeah, definitely my parents and I laugh about that sometimes.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, I love it. So I think I read somewhere that it was during your time here in undergrad that you were maybe taking some law-related courses, I think even maybe from one of our current law school faculty.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: So tell me how that worked. And was that when your interest in maybe going to law school sparked?

XIAO WANG: Yeah. I think my interest-- my mom says my interest started when I was conscripted into doing mock trial as a sixth grader. And she was like, you become so passionate about this. And I think my parents were like-- my parents are both in the medical field. And they're like, he's never this passionate about Petri dishes.

[LAUGHTER]

And so I was like, yeah, I mean, fair, fair. But more seriously, at UVA, yeah, I got to know Micah Schwartzman quite a bit. And he had been a mentor for me when I was an undergrad. He had helped me navigate the Jefferson Scholarship process. He helped me navigate the Truman Scholarship process and some other postgraduate scholarships.

And I got to know him, and I thought, wow, what a fascinating career that he's had at that point. I was sort of a super dork in the time, and I read a little bit-- or tried to read a little bit-- of his Law Review work on academic scholarship. I was so fascinated.

So my last year in undergrad, I said, well-- [CHUCKLES] --I hope I can go to law school someday and maybe someday go to UVA. But in the meantime, do you mind if I just sit in on your constitutional law seminar? And I thought it was just amazing to see him and to also see the students really wrestle with these tough questions that the Supreme Court was wrestling with. And it just brought a level of rigor and a level of discussion that I didn't see in some of my other classes.

And so I think that was the time where I thought, well, yeah, I really do want to go to law school at some point. But I don't know if this is something that I should be telling on a podcast. So on a lark, I decided to take the LSAT without studying my senior year, and I did not do very well on it. [CHUCKLES] So I had to take a few years off to work for a few years and concentrate a little bit on studying for the LSAT and doing a lot better on it. And that opened a lot of doors.

NATALIE BLAZER: I'm glad you shared that, though, because I always say the LSAT is not a diagnostic, right? Like, you need to study for it.

XIAO WANG: For sure.

NATALIE BLAZER: Although, I have had guests on here who are like, I just took it, and then, yeah, great. I was like--

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I don't believe that.

[LAUGHTER]

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah. So you got your master's in public policy here.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: And then, like you said, you worked for-- was it a couple years, McKinsey?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I worked for a couple years.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK. And then, ultimately you went to Yale Law School.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: How was that experience?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I mean, I think Yale is really quite a different place than UVA in some ways. I mean, it took me a while to find my footing there. There were a couple other folks also that had gone to UVA undergrad that were there, and that was really nice to have that community.

In some ways, navigating Yale as just a different place at first. But I ended up finding a really good group of friends, a really good group of professors. I tried to spend none of the winters in New Haven, or the springs in New Haven.

[LAUGHTER]

And I really look back fondly, ultimately, on my law school experience. I think I have some lifelong friends and lifelong mentorships there.

NATALIE BLAZER: I think I saw you were in the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at Yale Law School. So was that kind of-- I'm just curious. Were you sort of-- that's where your interests were going, this appellate-level litigation and the real clinical work?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I had a-- actually, this is one of the mentors I got to meet, was my first year. I got to take a class with Linda Greenhouse, who was then the New York Times' Supreme Court reporter.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, that's so cool.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I mean, I know she does some short courses here every few years. But it was just interesting to hear her talk about being at the Supreme Court, listening to argument, distilling it, and then teaching it to students, and all in the course of a week and a half.

And I really enjoyed the seminar. And she encouraged me to apply for the Supreme Court Clinic. And I ended up getting in. I think there's an application process. I can't really remember. And ended up getting in. And yeah, it took this idea of, hey, here's the cases you read, and now you're going to work on one that might end up setting law. So yeah, I thought that was really fun and interesting and unique to do in law school, also intimidating at first.

NATALIE BLAZER: I cannot even imagine. When you were in law school-- I'm curious-- because Yale's known for-- if you want to get into academia, I think a lot of people think about Yale and Harvard.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: So were you surrounded by people who wanted to be law professors? Is that what you wanted to do? Or what was that like?

XIAO WANG: Oh, yeah. I mean, I think this podcast is trotting out all my embarrassments of my bombing the LSAT and-- in law school, actually, it's weird. There are a ton of people that want-- especially at Yale-- they want to be law professors one day. And I think I had entertained that. My dad is a professor of medicine. And I've always been interested a little bit in research. [CHUCKLES]

But it's sort of embarrassing. I think UVA has this, too. The Virginia Law Review has a similar process. But at Yale, you can write a student note, which is like this-- essentially, this short law review piece for-- a student writes it, a form of student scholarship. And you're encouraged to write your student notes and submit it and have them review it. And the best notes or whatever get chosen and published in the Yale Law Journal or the Virginia Law Review or whatever law school you're going to.

And-- [LAUGHS] --I mean, this is so embarrassing. When you send in a student note at Yale, they'll always send you back-- try to give you some feedback and try to send you back a memo. And usually the memo has three boxes that they can put your student note in. One is like, hey, this is amazing, and we're going to publish it. And we just need you to make a couple small changes and work with us to do that.

And the second box is, there's some idea here, but you really need to make all these changes and revise and maybe come resubmit. And then the third box is like, no, just don't come back. Please don't come back.

[LAUGHTER]

And I would say that-- they tell you up front. They're like, maybe 5% of pieces get in that first box that are accepted. And then 90% or 92% are in that second box of like, we think there's something here. And try to keep on improving and refining. They're like, very rare-- they tell you this at the start. They're like, very rarely will we ever put you in box 3, which is like, please don't come back, like do not pass Go again.

NATALIE BLAZER: [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: And I remember I submitted two notes for consideration. And both of them got box 3.

NATALIE BLAZER: Oh, my God!

XIAO WANG: [LAUGHS] And it was just like, I remember seeing that and being like, well, [CLICKS LIPS] probably just too dumb to be a law professor. Probably should give up this idea, this thing, and just be a big law lawyer or something.

So it did not work out as well when I was in law school. I'm happy to say it's worked out a little bit better since. But yeah, there were definitely a lot of people that were interested in it. And I just honestly didn't know if I was cut out for it.

NATALIE BLAZER: I love that story. It's very real. And I think it helps people who-- first of all, when I welcomed our 1Ls on Friday, I said, while you are here in law school, try out for things, go for things. You will fail sometimes, but you have to try. And that story is just such a great example of like, what if you had just decided, I guess I'm not cut out for it. I mean, you can't take those things to heart. You have to keep trying. So I love that story.

XIAO WANG: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think one thing that was helpful, I had a professor in law school, and I had gone up to her. She was a real mentor to me. I was her RA. I was her TA. Got this amazing, fantastic record, like a Rhodes scholar, Yale Law School, and everything, and this incredible CV. And I talked to her about some of these struggles, and I was pretty candid about it.

And she said something that was really helpful for me to think about. And she was like, the CV that you see on the website or the resume you see for your professors or for these big law partners or whatever, those are the greatest hits of their lives. And they never talk about any of their greatest misses. And sometimes you learn the most from your greatest misses. And I think that helped a lot because I think that all of us have things that we wish it panned out differently, but we learn a lot from when they don't-- when they don't work out.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, I love that advice. I'm going to remember that. It's like what people say about social media. You see people's highlight reel--

XIAO WANG: Exactly.

NATALIE BLAZER: --not their random day of just doing nothing. So I love that. So you ultimately did get a couple of clerkships.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: How did that work? Did you do them back to back?

XIAO WANG: I did.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK. Tell us a little bit about your clerkship experience. What was your favorite part? Was it challenging?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think my favorite part is that you get a front-row view of how arguments get made and what works and what doesn't work. And usually you wouldn't get that. And usually you wouldn't be able to peer inside the head of a judge.

I mean, there's so many times now when I'm in court and arguing that I'm like, oh, I wish I could understand what the judge is thinking. But as a clerk, you actually do get to see that. And that's a skill that, as a litigator, I just always go back to, of saying, well, when I was a law clerk, my judge would think about these couple things. How do I think about that and reverse engineer that when it comes to working with my clients?

NATALIE BLAZER: That's so cool. And then, from there, you went to your law practice, right, as an appellate litigator.

XIAO WANG: I worked at Williams & Connolly first for several years. And you're sort of thrown in. And it's a firm that does a lot of different work-- trial work, appellate work. And I wasn't-- you're not really assigned to a group. But it's a little bit based on, hey, if you show an interest in this stuff, if we lose a trial, there's usually going to be going to be an appeal. So if you want to be on the appellate team, have at it, and stuff. So it was a lot of trying to seek out those opportunities and develop some of my skills at the law firm.

NATALIE BLAZER: When I was at my law firm, I don't know if you're just being humble or what, but I remember our appellate group, that was the all stars. It was like, when you guys mess up at the trial level, they're going to take it from here. I remember a co-associate who I was very close with. We did a lot of pro bono cases together. He was in our appellate group. And I was in a trial group.

And I just remember he was always writing briefs. He was always-- our work was very different, is my point. So for listeners who may not know, can you explain just what an appellate-- if someone's in an appellate group versus a trial group, what's the day-to-day difference?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think the day-to-day difference is, in trial, you're trying to find facts, shape narratives, and interview witnesses, figure out what your experts have to say, and build this thing called a record, build a factual record. And that takes a ton of work. And especially if you're working with a big company, they have a ton of documents you have to sift through. And sometimes that can be a little bit monotonous.

[LAUGHTER]

And I think there's a different form of-- I suppose-- monotony at the appellate level because, at the appellate level, you're not supposed to build the record anymore. The record's set. You're not supposed to find new facts. But in some ways, it's monotonous in the sense that you're trying to craft these legal arguments.

And for instance, for one case that the clinic has worked on, one of our legal arguments depended a lot on what 17th-century British common law had to say. And so I don't know if it's more interesting, less interesting, more monotonous, or less, but it takes a certain type of grit and perseverance to just sift through what old bailiwick story Fishbourne had to say in the Court of Common Pleas and figure out how that fits into your legal theory.

So yeah, I think that's the difference between trial and appellate practice. I think, in some ways, there's certainly commonalities. You want to understand how the law applies to the facts. But there are differences in the day to day, for sure.

NATALIE BLAZER: It's good for listeners to know there's going to be some level of monotony in any area of your law practice, but also a lot of really exciting, interesting things. So you did go from there, I believe, to Northwestern Law.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: How did that-- were you like, OK, I've really liked my time practicing, but I'm really ready to get into academia? How did that decision play out for you?

XIAO WANG: This is one thing where COVID actually was a little bit of a silver lining. I know it feels so long ago. But one of the great things about COVID is it gave a lot of folks, especially in law practice, a breather if you were going at a hundred miles an hour. You couldn't do in-person depositions. You couldn't do certain meetings anymore.

And so the pace slowed down a lot at my law firm. And it was one where I had been thinking about a few different ideas, scholarship ideas. I mean, I sort of, I think, recovered and licked my wounds from law school. And I thought, well, why don't I try my hand again? I'll write some short pieces, and I'll send them out to these law reviews and especially their online supplements.

Maybe this is also embarrassing, but I sent it to a dozen online supplements, this first piece. And it was like, one by one, they'd be like, no, no, no. And I was like, well, this is just replaying my trauma.

[LAUGHTER]

And then I think, one day, California Law Review, so the law review for Berkeley Law School, which is a very well regarded law review, reached out and were like, we love this piece, and we'd love to publish it. And I think it would be really, really fitting. And we'll dedicate the resources to make it better. And we're sure you have other offers. Listener, I did not. [LAUGHS] And it was like, we're sure you have other offers, so take your time.

And it must have been one of those where immediately I responded, probably as they were getting their cup of coffee in California. And I was like, I accept. And so I think that was-- and then I think once you write one piece and you go through the editorial process, you figure out a little bit how your own style works and how that style works with what other law reviews are looking for.

So my next piece got published by Michigan. And once, I think, you start publishing a little bit more, I started looking a little bit more into teaching and teaching jobs. And this opportunity at Northwestern came up.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, that's so fascinating to me because I did read just the title of some of the law review articles that you've had published. And I'm like, these all, to me, sound super interesting, the topics. I was actually curious if you're writing anything now.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: I imagine you have to keep going.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, sort of. I mean, I think I've been really fortunate that I have a number of incredibly bright students that work as my RAs. And there will be a figment of an idea that I have. And I ask them to look at something, and they'll come up with this incredibly detailed perspective. And that really informs me.

So yeah, I have a few things that I'm working on right now. They're in different stages of development. They're in the areas that I have traditionally studied, so law and religion, judicial organization. And we'll see where they get placed.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, that's awesome. So while you were at Northwestern, just tell me quickly-- because I really want to dive into the UVA experience-- I read that you created some sort of-- and I mentioned in your bio-- a network. Basically, my understanding of it is like a database for clinics to use. So can you explain that?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah. And a lot of the idea, the credit for the idea, goes to Scott Ballinger, who's also on our faculty, and another very close friend of mine who's at NYU, Daniel Harawa. And basically, both of them said, if you're working in an appellate clinic, if you're directing an appellate clinic, you end up seeing similar issues. And you see that other clinics have similar viewpoints or issues because a lot of clinics work on cases like habeas cases, criminal defense cases, plaintiff's side civil cases.

And you'll see a lot of overlap in terms of the types of issues, the type of cases, the type of plaintiffs that get represented by appellate clinics. And so Daniel and Scott both independently told me like, hey, it'd be great if we had a listserv and a briefs database because, every fall, I feel like we reinvent the wheel with our students about, how do you write a brief that presents a habeas question? Or how do you write a brief that presents a prison conditions and confinement question?

And I guess this is where my value comes in. I said, well, we can do all that. If people start sending me the briefs, I have a very, very, very rudimentary understanding of how to code and put things in a database form that's accessible. And so I said, maybe we can do that. And I can put that together. And that can actually be a database that people can search and use and students can look at so they can know that they're not starting from scratch.

And so we started with a couple schools. I think now we're up to two dozen. And we've got 300 or 400 briefs, maybe more than that. And I think it's been-- people have told me it's been very helpful because, instead of, again, starting from scratch in the fall, they'll already have this template ready to go. And I think, when you're an appellate litigator, if you have the template ready to go, that just gives you more time to devote to some of the more difficult, challenging issues.

NATALIE BLAZER: For sure, yeah. So are you using that still in your clinic today?

XIAO WANG: Oh, yeah. For sure.

NATALIE BLAZER: Oh, awesome.

XIAO WANG: For sure. [LAUGHS] I also don't want to start from scratch--

[LAUGHTER]

--when we write briefs. So definitely I'll encourage my students to look and see if other clinics have briefed similar issues. And if they don't find it, I'll try to find it, too, just because it's such a time saver.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, what is the En Banc Institute? Maybe first explain what ""en banc"" means, if people don't know.

XIAO WANG: Totally, totally. So across the country, there are, I think, 12 to 13-- depends on how you count one of the circuits-- but there's 12 to 13 federal courts of appeals. And they hear appeals from these trial courts, which is where cases start. And they're the intermediate layer between the trial court and the Supreme Court.

And usually, when you bring an appeal in those courts, your appeal is heard by this panel of three judges. And they end up voting. And because there's three judges, they always come up with a decision. It's like two to one, or three-nothing, or what have you.

And after they come up with the decision, if you're not a big fan of that decision, you can do something called seek en banc review. And what that means is that the court itself, the appeals court itself, might have 15 or 18 judges. And when you seek en banc review, you say, look, I think these three judges that heard my first appeal didn't get it right. I want it to be heard by the big 15-judge court.

Sometimes folks will choose that route. And other times, they'll choose to just go straight to the Supreme Court. Either way, en banc courts end up-- when the court decides to take up a case and hear it en banc, all the judges in that court, it's usually a pretty big deal. And often, it's a preview of what might come up in the Supreme Court going forward because if 15 judges on the appellate court say this is an important enough issue we want to take up, the Supreme Court might be like, well, this is an important issue. We might--

NATALIE BLAZER: Because to get 15 judges to come together, that's-- I mean, yeah. You would think that this is going to be an issue that they're like, OK, we want to talk about this. OK, cool.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, and I think one of the reasons I wanted to do it is because when you get a case that's before the Supreme Court, a lot of people want to help you prepare for that argument. There are institutes and programs and other professors. And when you end up, in fact, arguing for the Supreme Court, usually you've had a couple different practice runs. But it's not like that on the en banc side.

Basically, we're the only people in the country that will reach out and say, do you want to come here for a moot and we'll help you? And people have said, well, [SCOFFS] this will be my first and only practice. And I think that's a really good public service to have and to offer.

And it gives us a sense, from the Supreme Court clinic side, to say, well, hey, maybe we're not working on this case en banc. We're not representing the party. But now we know what the issue is, and we can track this issue. We can help navigate it as it maybe pops up elsewhere and might show up in front of the Supreme Court.

NATALIE BLAZER: So basically, you become aware of a case that's going to be heard en banc. And you reach out to them. And you say, hey, if you, the lawyers, want to come moot, like a full dress rehearsal-- for people who don't really understand what mooting is-- full dress rehearsal in front of your clinic to prepare them because, like you said, typically you only do that before a Supreme Court argument. But as we've said, en banc is nearly as important because of the issues at hand. Do the students get to play the other sides?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, all the students get to attend the moots. And one or two of the students will usually stand in for the other side because I think what's helpful for the advocate is not just to rehearse your own arguments. But usually, how appellate arguments are is like, one side goes up, and then the other side goes up. And then the first side gets to do a rebuttal.

And I've been in moots where I go up, and I don't hear the other side. And then they just tell you, now's your time to do a rebuttal. And that's not super helpful because usually in the rebuttal you want to talk about what was said and what was asked for your opponent and opposing counsel.

So usually, we'll have a student stand in for the other side. And that's always a little fun. I mean, I think we have students who are really interested in certain topics. We've had a mood about voting rights. And sometimes the clinic wouldn't be necessarily involved in that at the Supreme Court stage, but they get to basically represent the other side in a voting rights case in front of their professors, in front of practitioners, in a moot.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK, now I want to get to our time at UVA.

XIAO WANG: OK.

NATALIE BLAZER: So you were at Northwestern for a few years.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: And then you returned to UVA, I believe, in 2023.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: Was that just always in your head, that you wanted to come back? Or how did that come together?

XIAO WANG: I think there were two different warring sides on it. I loved my time at UVA. But I remember when I was at UVA just thinking, I'm not going to be a townie one day.

[LAUGHTER]

I'm not going to be a townie, like these people that love UVA and just stick around and stick around. That's not going to be me. But then the other part of me said, well, I loved and have really gotten to know folks like Micah Schwartzman really well. And Scott Ballinger has been a mentor of mine. And it'd be really, really amazing to be able to work with these folks every day.

So I think I saw this opening come up. And a few people reached out to me and encouraged me to apply. I applied, and I didn't know if I would get very far. But I definitely-- I think the side of me that was like, look, I really love this place. And I don't know why I have this irrational worry about being a townie. And now I think I can say it on the other side. I enjoy being a townie. And the summer months when the students aren't here is actually great. [LAUGHS]

NATALIE BLAZER: I know.

XIAO WANG: There's never any traffic. And I can actually go to all the places and restaurants and plays that I want to see. So I would say the side of me that always really loved this place and the people here won out, and I'm really glad it did.

NATALIE BLAZER: Well, and-- I mean, again, similar to my experience-- we went away. We did stuff. We did big-city stuff. We saw the world.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, to come back, and you know it's a great place. For those who don't know, Micah Schwartzman, who Professor Wang mentioned earlier, he's also a UVA alum, teaches at the Law School, is actually married to Leslie Kendrick, the Dean of the Law School. And Scott Ballinger-- also an alum of the law school and runs our appellate litigation clinic.

So I want to talk about the clinic. I've done an episode before on clinics. It was a while ago now. And it was with a student who was in the Innocence Project Clinic, so we talked a lot about that. I'm really curious because the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic seems to me like it's very prestigious. It's maybe competitive. Tell listeners, how does one get into the clinic to begin with?

XIAO WANG: So the clinic is open to 3Ls, third-year law students. And in their summer between their second and third year, they'll send in an application. The application is not super involved. Right now, I ask for a cover letter, a resume, and a transcript, and a writing sample.

And then I have a co-director of the clinic, Bob Long, who works at a law firm, Covington & Burling. And usually Bob and I will see the applications come in. We'll talk through and say, how do we-- we have an incredibly qualified group of applicants. How do we narrow this down to a dozen students? And that's a really tough process.

I mean, honestly, I wish we could take more students. There are a lot of amazing, amazing applicants every year. But we want to also make sure that each of the students that's in the clinic gets an incredible amount of mentorship and experience and the opportunities that continue to make people interested in the clinic going forward.

NATALIE BLAZER: So how much do grades play a role?

XIAO WANG: I think they definitely play a role. I won't sugarcoat it. And I think the reason that they play a role-- for instance, we have a case right now that we're working on about venue, which is where a lawsuit gets filed. And that has to do with civil procedure, which is one of the core first-year law classes.

And it's not a big deal for me that you get an A or an A-plus or an A-minus in civil procedure. I think it's more to say, look, all the questions that we're trying to answer, they're not necessarily answered in the casebook. I mean, that's why they're going in front of the Supreme Court.

And so why grades matter is I think they're a signal to say, I've read the decision below. I've read some of the cases. Am I going to be committed to take a deeper look, to go that extra step of the way in my research and in my thinking about this in order to come up with an innovative or novel line of thought?

Now, of course that's not the only way you can show that. You can also demonstrate it through work experience and other items in your resume. So certainly grades are not dispositive. I think it's just one way to signal.

NATALIE BLAZER: Right. I mean, hey, I do admissions. I get it.

[LAUGHTER]

It's really tough. Sometimes it is going to be things like that that help you decide when you have so many wonderful people. I know it's difficult. So it's a year-long clinic.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: Are there any prerequisites? Do they have to have taken fed courts or something?

XIAO WANG: I don't think there are any prerequisites. [CHUCKLES] I think, unlike some of the other clinics at UVA, like, say, the immigration clinic or some of these other specialty clinics, for us, our case matter is really varied. So sometimes we'll be working on a securities class action. Sometimes we'll do a criminal case. Sometimes we'll do a case about employment law.

And so to me, it actually is really great to have students that have a variety of different interests. If I had 12 students that were only interested in constitutional law, it would be really tough sometimes, maybe, with a securities law case.

NATALIE BLAZER: Right. That makes sense. So I'm curious, what is the breakdown between, what are you doing when the class meets versus what are they then doing on their own the rest of the time?

XIAO WANG: Yeah. So I think our big class meeting is a way to convene for this overall team huddle for all 12 students. And I think that's important because sometimes we'll have what are known as case rounds, where the smaller-- usually, for the 12 students, we usually break them up into three or four teams of three or four students.

And so on a weekly basis, maybe those three or four students will do a presentation to the whole class about their case round. And I've actually found that to be really incredibly helpful because I think, between myself and the three students that are dedicated to a case, that's all we think about. But then when you have someone else who's really, really bright and hasn't really thought about the case that much but has these other background concepts or experiences, they can really provide a lot of insight.

I mean, in both of our cases that were argued for the Supreme Court this year, we had arguments that we made that just came out of a case round. A student was like, well, I haven't really thought about this, but what about this idea? And I was like, honestly, brilliant. [LAUGHS]

NATALIE BLAZER: Wow! Cool.

XIAO WANG: So we'll do that. And I think that's a good way for the whole class to feel invested in everyone's work. We'll also try to do speakers during the case rounds so people learn a little bit more about how the Supreme Court and appellate advocacy works. Sometimes we'll do moot courts. But it's not necessarily supposed to be this intensive class session.

I think the bulk of the work, the bulk of what happens is these individual case team meetings that happen on a weekly basis or more frequently, depending on how busy a case is. And that's when I meet with the three or four students, sometimes in my office, sometimes in a small conference room. And we start talking about what they found on the research, how to craft an argument, how to recraft an argument. And so that's pretty intense, I would say. And yeah, it definitely is more work than the 80 minutes that is blocked off on the schedule.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, because they're participating in writing briefs and obviously, yes, like you said, coming up with arguments and things like that, and research.

XIAO WANG: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, and just on each one of those takes a ton of time, I mean, especially in front of the Supreme Court. I mean, last year we had one brief-- I was looking this up the other day. I always save new versions or different versions of briefs as version 1, version 2, version 3. And I think on one of our briefs it was like-- I think we were at, like, version 47. [LAUGHS]

NATALIE BLAZER: Oh, my God.

XIAO WANG: And then we just renamed it. So it's definitely more than version 47. But we really, really try to make things as perfect as we can be in front of the Supreme Court. And I think the learning that happens-- the learning that takes place happens between version 1 and 47. And I think that's how you become a better writer, a better thinker. And it takes a ton of work. There's really no shortcut there.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah.

[THEME MUSIC]

It's September, which means a lot of you may already be hard at work on your law school applications. But I also realize that a lot of Admissible listeners out there are folks who are much earlier on in the process. You may be wondering, is law school even right for me? What's it all about? And what do lawyers do anyway?

If you're thinking about applying to law school but don't really know where to begin, be sure to check out season 3, episode 1 of the show. UVA law professor Joe Fore joined me to discuss all the things you should be thinking about when it comes to this rather big life decision.

For someone out there who's listening to this episode, maybe it's the beginning of their college career. Maybe they haven't even gone to college yet. But let's pretend they're in a relatively early stage of thinking about law school. Do you have advice in terms of what they should study in undergrad? What kind of internships? What kind of advice would you give to a person who's maybe just embarking on their college career?

XIAO WANG: I don't think there is really a particularly one track to prepare you. I think, stereotypically, a lot of people would say, well, I'm going to major in history. Or maybe I should take some Latin or whatever. I should take English if I want to write a lot. I'd actually say, no, take all different things because what I think students should do is study what you're interested in, study what you're passionate about, study broadly.

At this point, I'm closing in on a thousand or so students that I've taught in my courses. And I've had students that run the gamut for majors. I've had everybody from your stereotypical history, English, business person, to people that were computer programmers and engineers. And they've all been super successful. There's not one recipe. Don't try to fit yourself to the mold of, quote, a ""lawyer."" Bring yourself to that role.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK, this is, to me, the most fascinating part of the clinic. How is it even guaranteed that you're going to have a case? Why don't we start with the Ames case?

XIAO WANG: Sure, sure.

NATALIE BLAZER: So for people who don't know, can you just give a brief background of what the case is, what are the issues, how it got to the Supreme Court?

XIAO WANG: Yeah. So the case is a case involving Title VII, which is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which is a part of the Civil Rights Act that essentially seeks to root out discrimination in the workplace. There are other titles that seek to address discrimination in other forms. But Title VII is the one that seeks to root it out at the workplace.

And the Ames case was a Title VII case where this individual alleged that she was subject to discrimination on the basis of her sexual orientation. So she brought her case first in federal trial court. She didn't get very far. She lost. She appealed it to the Sixth Circuit. And the Sixth Circuit also dismissed her claim.

And that's where we came in. And we called and said, hey, we think your case has some potential to go to the Supreme Court. And we'd be happy to file a cert petition for you and represent you before the Supreme Court because that's a pretty specialized version of practice, I think.

When we talked about earlier, like, how is trial practice different from appellate practice, we said, look, trial practice is different from appellate practice. And appellate practice is a little bit different from Supreme Court practice. So we really want to help you. We think that there's a chance that the lower courts got it wrong. And we'd like to take this up to the Supreme Court. And that is a case that I think many other folks reached out to. And we were really lucky to be able to be selected among the many that reached out.

NATALIE BLAZER: Are you then working alongside her counsel who represented her at the Sixth Circuit?

XIAO WANG: Totally, totally.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think this is an area where I think some Supreme Court specialists differ. My understanding is that there are some clinics and some law firms that say, look, you give us the case files when we go to the Supreme Court. And then you, as the trial counsel, just sit back and watch and let us work.

And I really disagree with that. I think that that's not right because, first of all, it's their client. They've worked with them for a long time. They've built that trust. And secondly, I think that the life cycle of a case is such that the lawyers need to work together. They really need to work in partnership.

And so do we, as UVA, do we do the bulk of the writing and the research and the work? Certainly at the Supreme Court stage. But at the same time, we always share drafts with our co-counsel. We always say, look, I'm not really sure if this is right, so let me know. And sometimes there are things that are not necessarily in the factual record but you would really want to know and really want to get a sense of.

And so for the Ames case, for instance, I just flew out to Akron, Ohio. And I sat down with her and her trial counsel and said, hey, let's spend a day here. And let me just really understand the case. And I'm not going to be able to know everything in a day, but I'll get a better sense. And at least you'll who I am. And then if I have other questions, it's not like I'm a blank person on voicemail. You know who I am.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah. I mean, that's what advocacy really is all about. I'm sure she wanted to you. You wanted to her. What is it about this case that you think made so many people reach out?

XIAO WANG: One of the key questions that the Supreme Court usually wants to tackle is when there's something known as a circuit split, which means that the appellate courts around the country-- like I mentioned, there are 12 appellate courts around the country-- whether they come to different conclusions on the same legal question.

And there was a circuit split here. And everyone acknowledged that there was a circuit split. And so that suggested that the Supreme Court wanted to-- might be interested in taking up this case. So that's, I think, part of why other people wanted to reach out. I think there are other-- I mean, certainly there are other-- there's discussion about the case in terms of its sociocultural, political ramifications that made people want to reach out. I think most of the times when we reach out and offer our assistance, there are other people that have also reached out and offered assistance, not just in Ames, but in almost all of our cases.

NATALIE BLAZER: And is that pretty common of how you get a case, of how the clinic gets a case? You're reaching out to somebody at that level?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I mean, it depends. It depends. I mean, I think the best model and probably the model that would allow me to have more hobbies and sleep more and be a better tennis player is if folks just came to us. And they are coming to us more. I will say they are coming to us more. One of our cases last year, someone just came to us and said, I heard you'd done really great work. And we really would be super privileged and excited to work with you.

NATALIE BLAZER: That's cool.

XIAO WANG: And the other-- and I think the more grueling-- way is get up really early in the morning, and you read these opinions. And you're like, all right, I think there's a circuit split here. I think I'm going to try to reach out. And here's how I would pitch UVA. And here's how I would say that we can offer an advantage. And here's the questions that I would have for the local counsel. And here's how the conversation I think should go.

And it's similar to the CV resume comment that I said earlier. I mean, I think it's easy to say, look, hey, UVA has landed some great things. But we've also lost a few of them, you know? And it sucks to lose. But I think that's a learning experience that you just go through, that, look, I can do the best and try to pitch us as well as I can. And sometimes people will end up going for another law firm or another law clinic.

NATALIE BLAZER: Well, I was going to say it's pretty remarkable, if you think about it, that the client would choose a clinic of law students versus a Williams & Connolly or Covington, right?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think--

NATALIE BLAZER: Or are they-- so this didn't even occur to me until right now. Is this pro bono?

XIAO WANG: So two things. One is, yes, we offer our services free of charge, right?

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah. The students aren't making billing hours for this.

[LAUGHTER]

XIAO WANG: You could see the car that I drove in on. It was not a Lamborghini.

[LAUGHTER]

So we offer our services free of charge. But a lot of law firms do, too. And I think--

NATALIE BLAZER: Because of the prestige?

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK.

XIAO WANG: Because of the prestige, because of the marketing value, the experience that it affords. First of all, I certainly lead with and talk about how remarkable our students are. And that's because of your work, honestly. You find really great folks.

NATALIE BLAZER: Aw, thank you.

XIAO WANG: And so I just coast on your laurels, Natalie.

NATALIE BLAZER: [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: I say it's not just the students. It's certainly not just me. I mean, we have an incredible faculty here and an incredible librarian staff and an incredible set of staff and researchers. And that's something that a lot of other places don't have.

And so I've been on pitch meetings where I say, look, the lower court that decided your case, also, in deciding your case, cited an article by Aditya Bamzai. Guess where he works? He works four doors down from me, and I can just call him.

NATALIE BLAZER: Right, he's a law professor here. So cool.

XIAO WANG: And so I think that that provides us a comparative advantage. But it's an incredibly competitive clinic.

NATALIE BLAZER: So competitive. Any case that goes before the Supreme Court, I imagine-- I mean, there's going to be some venue issues, I know, that maybe are not that controversial. But this one, I know, had some controversy surrounding it. And so, first of all, how do you talk students through that?

I'm just curious because for-- I'll just reiterate for listeners, this was a reverse discrimination issue, basically a straight, cisgender, white woman saying, if I'm discriminated against-- in other words, she was not promoted in favor of an LGBTQ+ person who was promoted, and then she was demoted. Basically, my understanding is, OK, well, if you are claiming reverse discrimination, you actually have a higher burden to meet than if the reverse fact pattern was true. And so you could see that that would push some people to--

XIAO WANG: Yeah, totally.

NATALIE BLAZER: So what conversations happen either within the clinic, or do you hear from people even outside of the clinic? How does that work?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, well, certainly I hear from people outside of the clinic, for sure. For sure. I mean, I think it's incredibly tough to land one of these cases. But it's also incredibly tough to advocate and figure out what the strategy is and to hear all the noise from outside. I mean, that can be really distracting. And it can be really tough at times. I'm definitely not going to sugarcoat it.

And to your point, it's not relegated to just this more high profile case. I mean, in our other case that we argued had to do with retirement benefits. And a few of my friends who work in finance, who aren't in law, would call me and be like, I can't believe you're doing this! This is going to ruin my relationship with my clients and everything!

NATALIE BLAZER: And meanwhile, I'm thinking, that's pretty dry.

XIAO WANG: I know, I know!

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, yeah.

XIAO WANG: And so whenever it gets to the Supreme Court, there's going to be some level of controversy, whether it's the broader public or it's a smaller section of people that are really invested or interested in the issue. And I think what I try to tell our students is like, we're not going to be-- our clinic will never be like Michael Avenatti. We're not going to be out in the press, trying to advocate our case.

I think what we want to do is we want to work with our clients. We want to come up with the best legal strategy. And we want to put that forward and base that based on research, precedent, fact, text, and see where we go. And I think we have a good track record there. And I'm really proud of that track record.

But I think, with our students, to me, I've tried to emphasize that when it gets tough and when there's-- I certainly don't want them to feel that-- feel any opprobrium or anything like that. But I think I try to flip it around and say, look, this is a really good learning experience.

It really is a way to-- I mean, because when you're at a big law firm, often you're going to take positions that are unpopular and may, in fact, be wrong. Like, who knows? And I think figuring out and navigating like, hey, what's real out there and what's the law say, and how do we advocate for this fairly and with integrity, I mean, those are really key questions that we want students to really develop and learn and think about as they navigate through law school.

NATALIE BLAZER: It's like what moot court is all about, or what mock trial is all about. You're arguing for a position that you don't necessarily agree with. When I was in big law, one of our biggest clients was like Philip Morris. Do I agree with anything that Philip Morris does? Not necessarily. But you see how arguments get made. You see the creativity of arguments for a client like that. And I think that's all toward the good for developing young lawyers.

I also tell students like, the Supreme Court is what it is right now. So any chance you have to see how they-- this is going to be probably the makeup of the court for many, many years to come. And so for our students who are graduating and practicing, this is going to be where we're at. I'm curious actually, now that we're talking about that, do you talk to them about the Supreme Court itself? Like, in this day of 2025, they are under scrutiny. Are they really independent? What's going on with the Trump administration? How much does that come into play, or not really?

XIAO WANG: Yeah. Well, I want to hop back really quick. I think this will tie back into your question. One thing that I think did make a difference-- and it is something really, really critical for me as a professor, especially that I want to bring to my students-- is to really get a sense to know our clients.

So I made sure they all got to know Marlene Ames because it's really, really easy to make generalizations and come up with narratives or stories or stereotypes or whatever. But if you meet her, I mean, such a sweet woman.

And to get a chance to meet her and talk to her and see, hey, this is a woman that went from working her decades at a social services agency, ending up well-reviewed, well-regarded, ended up pulling herself up to make about $100,000 a year, and was a single mom supporting two kids, and to lose that and to have her salary cut in half for something that she really doesn't why she got, I think that puts a human face to things. And it becomes a lot harder to say, well, we should be up here, when really what's going on is working with an individual and trying to get them to have the courthouse doors open for them. So I think that really matters.

I think your broader question about the Supreme Court, to me, I think working with the students on the cases and seeing how we were able to craft arguments that had support from all sides really, actually, I hope gave them some faith in the system to say, like, hey, at the end, you really want to come up with arguments that appeal to everybody and really sound and work for everyone. But there's no question that there's a broader discussion about the Supreme Court's role and the makeup of the court and how it plays within our society today.

And I don't want to-- I certainly don't shut the door to those discussions. I mean, the last couple of years, I've had Bertrall Ross, who used to be part of our faculty, come in. He was part of President Biden's commission to look at the Supreme Court. And I've had him come in and talk about the broader structural place of the Supreme Court. And we do have those discussions, for sure. And I think those discussions enrich the experience.

That said, there are, I think, so many classes at UVA that have those discussions. I think our thought is, we're working there in front of them. How do we do the best and get justice for our clients?

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, I think both are important. Like, we're working-- like I said, this is what we have.

XIAO WANG: Exactly.

NATALIE BLAZER: We're not changing the Supreme Court anytime soon. We're working with what we have. But also, I think, to Bertrall's point, we can also think critically about where this is going and all that. So Ames was your second time arguing before the Supreme Court. Walk me through-- the clinic is mooting you, my guess.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, totally.

NATALIE BLAZER: So how long are you preparing before this?

XIAO WANG: We were so busy. Once the case is granted, you'll file what's known as your opening merits brief. The other side files their response brief. And you file a reply brief. And our cases were back-to-back months. And so our reply brief-- I argued in front of the Supreme Court, I think, January 22. That was my first argument, January 22 of this year.

NATALIE BLAZER: And that was the Cunningham retirement benefits case.

XIAO WANG: Yeah. And my birthday was two days later.

[LAUGHTER]

And so I took, I guess, two or three days off for my birthday. So that's late January. And then by February 7, we had to file our reply brief in Ames. And when you're filing your reply brief, you're not thinking about oral argument. You're just trying to get the reply. This is the last written word you get in front of the Court.

So that's February 7. And I think the argument was February 24 or 26. So it's like 2 and 1/2 weeks. And basically, those 2 and 1/2 weeks, I think I did three or four moots at different places. But yeah, I remember we sent in our reply brief. I think I took a nap. And then the next day--

NATALIE BLAZER: [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: I mean, this is the great thing. Usually, my first moot is with our students. And it is always hilariously bad.

[LAUGHTER]

And honestly, I think it would not get past the quarterfinals of the Wild Moot Court Competition. It's so bad. I think, for my first moot in Cunningham, I'll be honest, I think some of the students had some questions.

[LAUGHTER]

But then my last moot is also with the students. And I think they can see-- and I think that's helpful because I think, in the end when you see it, you're like, wow, they were able to answer the questions. They were cool under fire. And they had a ready answer. And it's not like that. It's this random set of pieces at the start. And you see it coming together over moot 1, 2, 3, 4. And it ends in a good place. But to see it build, I think that's a good learning opportunity for the students.

NATALIE BLAZER: So you basically had your first-ever Supreme Court argument and your second-ever Supreme Court argument like a month apart.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: We're kind of flip-flopping now between Cunningham and Ames, but I think that's OK. What was your first argument like? Were you terrified?

XIAO WANG: I felt pretty prepped. I don't know if I was terrified as much as-- there's a certain amount of pomp and circumstance that goes with arguing before the Supreme Court. And that's really interesting and really fun. I mean, you get to be on the stage. And you get to be in the lawyers lounge beforehand and prep your notes. And the person that I was arguing against, my opposing counsel, had argued 33 times or something beforehand.

NATALIE BLAZER: [GASPS] Wow.

XIAO WANG: And so I think that-- I wouldn't say I was terrified. It was just sort of like taking the court for the first time and trying to understand what it was like. I will say we were the second argument that day. And the first argument was about this police shooting, Fourth Amendment question.

And when you're the second argument, you sit behind the first argument. And you sit behind the first argument, and the Supreme Court is like, I don't know, 30 feet high. It's incredibly-- it's this cavernous, majestic building courtroom. And where you sit, if you're the second argument, is right under the lights. And it's like a heat lamp.

[LAUGHTER]

So I remember going to the bathroom a couple times just because you would be--

NATALIE BLAZER: Just sweating.

XIAO WANG: You're baking. You're baked Alaska out there. And then you're trying to drink some water. And then you're like, I need to go to the bathroom. And you're like, I hope they don't call my case.

[LAUGHTER]

And so I think that actually takes some pressure off because instead of thinking about, what am I going to say, you're like, I honestly need to just have an empty bladder and a not sore throat when I get up there.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, yeah. And so, that case, was it 9-0?

XIAO WANG: Yes. Yeah, yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: Congratulations.

XIAO WANG: Oh, thank you.

NATALIE BLAZER: That's incredible.

XIAO WANG: Oh, thanks.

NATALIE BLAZER: And Ames was also 9-0.

XIAO WANG: Yep, yep. Thank you.

NATALIE BLAZER: I mean, so this is why now you don't have to go out and find cases anymore. [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: I definitely still do. I definitely still do. I wish I didn't, but yeah, it's always great to see that for the clients. But yeah, they're still hard work to be done. Don't worry about that.

NATALIE BLAZER: I have no doubt. Did these clinic students just get extremely lucky to have two cases going on at the same time? Or is that normal?

XIAO WANG: I don't know if they would say they were extremely lucky. I think in retrospect they would. But during the time when we were working on it, I mean, I think we put in a lot of hours and a lot of time. And the students were remarkable. This isn't just all we were doing. We had some other cases we were working on. And they put in really, really fantastic work.

They hold a really special place in my heart for all the work, but really all my students because I tell them-- and when I say that they've done such great work, it was actually-- they worked on the merits cases. But the last year, the students before that worked on the cert petition. So it's like, I've really been blessed with multiple classes of incredibly hardworking and incredibly intelligent students.

I think they were very fortunate this year. They got to go to the Supreme Court several times to watch the argument, to see how the Justices react. They got to go-- the Biden and Trump administration supported us in both cases. And when that happens, you actually work as a tag team with the Solicitor General's office, which is the office within the Justice Department that argues Supreme Court cases. And so we'll go up there, and we'll just sit around a table with members of the Solicitor General's office and think about strategy, think about argument. And that's an opportunity that I almost never got in a law firm.

NATALIE BLAZER: I was gonna say, that's very rare. I mean, and they're getting that? That's awesome.

XIAO WANG: We got to moot at what's known as Georgetown Supreme Court Institute and got to see Georgetown faculty ask us tough questions on both of our cases. And so I think that they had an incredible amount of opportunities. I'm really glad we were able to give it to them. And I think, in exchange, they all put in a lot of time. And very, very grateful for that.

NATALIE BLAZER: That makes me so happy, makes me so proud of them. Do you know what this upcoming year-- what cases you're working on?

XIAO WANG: I do.

NATALIE BLAZER: If you can't share, that's OK.

XIAO WANG: No, no, no, I can share a little bit about it. I think we've had a case that's been pending, which is this Fourth Amendment case about dog sniffs.

NATALIE BLAZER: Oooh.

XIAO WANG: And basically there's a question-- there's an open question in the lower courts that if you get stopped and a dog goes around and sniffs your car-- if they just go around and sniff your car and they don't touch your car, it's actually constitutional. The Supreme Court has already decided that question.

But there's an open question of, what happens if the dog walks around and say you have your window open and they just jump through your window and then-- they jump through the window because they think they smell drugs or whatever? Is jumping through your window, is that considered a trespass? And if that's a trespass, is that a Fourth Amendment violation?

So we represent an individual out of Iowa. Her name's Ashley Mumford. And we are arguing that that is considered a Fourth Amendment search. And so right now, that's in the very final stages of briefing. I actually need to finish writing the reply brief by next Tuesday. So--

NATALIE BLAZER: Oh, my goodness!

XIAO WANG: --four days from now.

[LAUGHTER]

NATALIE BLAZER: So just so I understand, you're arguing that that is a lawful--

XIAO WANG: An unlawful search.

NATALIE BLAZER: Unlawful, OK.

XIAO WANG: Unlawful search, yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: Fourth Amendment violation.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, and the other side, represented by the Iowa Attorney General's Office, says that that's totally fine.

NATALIE BLAZER: And presumably this would only come up if something was found when the dog jumps through the window. So student listeners out there, you will learn all about this in crim law, fruit of the poisonous tree, and all that stuff. So wow, ooh, I can't wait to hear how this goes.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think we really hope for the best for our client. I mean, I think that this is an issue that definitely comes up. I mean, police use dogs all the time. And often, they ask you to roll down your window to give your license and registration. So I think that what-- I think it's definitely an interesting issue.

We have another case that involves what's known as venue, which I mentioned earlier. It's, where do you file a lawsuit? Incidentally, that case has to do with a dog bite. So we are the canine--

[LAUGHTER]

--canine-themed clinic this year. And then, finally, we're working on some other matters that have to do with environmental law, with retirement law-- employee benefits law, and voting rights. So those are operating in the background.

NATALIE BLAZER: Really cool. Do a lot of students in the clinic have aspirations to clerk or to even clerk for the Supreme Court?

XIAO WANG: Certainly, I think probably more so than the general population of students at the law school. And--

NATALIE BLAZER: I imagine it helps them be competitive for a clerkship to go through the clinic.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I mean, I think it's just a conversation. And I'm sure that Scott Ballinger has the same conversation with his appellate litigation clinic. But a lot of the times-- or many times, judges-- if you apply for a clerkship, judges will call your references or your recommenders. Or they'll call me, for instance. And I can say really great things about all my students, that I do end up saying.

But it's one thing saying, like, hey, this is a great student, to say-- it's one thing to say that. And it's another thing to say, this is a student that worked on a merits case for the Supreme Court. And they wrote this section of the brief. I can tell you that. Their name can't be on it, but I can tell you that.

And if I trust them with an argument that goes before the Supreme Court, I think that that's a level of credibility and legitimacy that would be really helpful for a judicial law clerk. So I think that those conversations really matter. And I think it's been really, really supportive of our students in being able to apply for and land clerkships.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah. Before we wrap up, because I know you have this reply brief to work on-- [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: It's all good.

NATALIE BLAZER: --I really want to return to what you said about human client. All these cases before the Supreme Court involve people. At the end of the day, they involve people. This venue question that might sound super boring-- someone got bitten by a dog, presumably-- just because you hear ""Fourth Amendment"" or whatever Amendment, it's like, this is a person, or these are people.

So I'm curious. Now that you've argued before the Supreme Court twice and you see the judges, do you see students feeling conflicted about clerking for certain judges? I'm asking because of how political everything is now. Everything is political. But like we were talking about before, this is the Supreme Court we have.

And you have made two arguments where all nine agree. So in theory, we can agree on things, right? So I just feel that this is so important to talk about today. How would you talk to a student or counsel a student who maybe is someone who could clerk on the Supreme Court but feels conflicted because of their own personal values?

XIAO WANG: Well, first, I'd say apply and hopefully be in our clinic because I think every year that I've taught, including the time when I taught at Northwestern, but certainly at UVA, we've had students of all political persuasions, backgrounds, racial, gender, religious backgrounds. And that is a real strength of UVA.

And really thanks to the admissions committee for finding those folks because what it means is that we can talk about these issues. And we can't talk about it just in the abstract. We have to represent our client. And we can say, all right, I know you guys come from different backgrounds. You have different views. But how do we come up with something that would make sense, that you could understand, that you could agree with? Because that's going to be what's going to work with the Supreme Court. And I think that is something that I really value and treasure.

I think for the students, though, I would also say, look, you learn a ton from clerking and from working and from seeing how the law is formed and established and how to be a great advocate. And you'll use those skills. And there are definitely going to be times where you work for a judge or where you work for a law firm that you may not agree with everything, and that's OK. People don't agree with a lot of things. And that's OK.

I think what is something that you can take from it is like, what can I learn? How can I be a better advocate? How can I work with my clients? How can I come up with what I hope are arguments that folks can really agree with from across the aisle? And if that works, I think that's-- then I'm doing my job.

And I would really counsel students to say, certainly there's a degree of politics, there's a degree of partisanship and polarization in society at large, and in the legal system perhaps, as well. But you can either add to it, or you can try to work through it and maybe turn down the temperature a bit. And I've always mentioned to my students that I really want to be a person that turns down the temperature and thinks about how we can really advocate for our clients and come up with things that are workable for everyone.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, I love that. You can add to the polarization. You can do what you're doing, which is turn down the temperature. Or you can sit out entirely, which is almost the worst option. So getting in there, understanding how it works, the difficulty of crafting an argument, that will get that 9-0 ruling, I mean, I think that's what it's all about.

XIAO WANG: I mean, I think it's totally right. And I think that one thing with Ames in particular, I remember, is one of the professors-- I'm not going to name names-- one professor-- a couple professors actually told me-- they were like, well, if you just change this argument and really played into a grievance narrative or whatever, you could just win it 6-3, and it could be a lot easier for you.

And I just told them-- I just looked at them. And I said, like, yeah, we're not going to do that. We're definitely not going to do that because I don't think that gets us anywhere. And I think that it's certainly probably harder to come up with universal arguments, to come up with the research, and to listen through to the precedents and the texts and to really investigate the history behind certain clauses and how to interpret them.

But I think what comes out is a better product for everyone that we can agree with. And that takes work for me. It takes a ton of work for me. It takes a ton of work for my staff. It takes a ton of work for our students. But I think that's what we want to teach our students at the end of the day. And I am really fortunate for the Law School's support behind that.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, that resonates with what I tell our students all the time. I mean, it is going to be hard work. Trying to do it the easy way or trying to do-- that's never going to get us where we want to be. I mean, we're UVA Law. Why should we be trying to take the easy route?

XIAO WANG: Well, when you said something about, you could turn up the temperature or turn it down or sit on the sidelines, I think that-- and I don't want listeners to take this the wrong way, but I think that if you're a UVA Law student, I really don't think you can or should sit on the sidelines. You have already proven that you're incredibly gifted and talented, sharp and precocious. And you have this privilege to be able to really help people and to work in a legal system and improve that legal system. And I think sitting out on that is something that society loses out on, but you definitely lose out on.

NATALIE BLAZER: For sure, yeah. I tell them, remember why you applied to law school in the first place. Sitting out is-- I agree-- completely not an option. And I have been, honestly, so inspired by this conversation. It makes me so happy that you're here.

It makes me so proud of all of the students. I'm going to go back and look up who was in the clinic each year because it makes me so excited for our 3L's who are about to have this experience. So before we go, because most listeners are thinking about applying to law school or they're getting ready to apply to law school, what advice would you give based on everything we've talked about, your own experience?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, when it comes to applying to law school, I think that, in some ways, as you craft your application, some things are set, like your LSAT score and your undergraduate GPA. But I think what I would say is, hey, what's not said are, make sure you have a great set of recommenders and references. Make sure you keep up with those folks. And write a personal statement that reflects who you are.

And I think, as things come in, have an open mind about where you want to attend and go to. I'm certain, for some people, they may not think of Charlottesville, Virginia as a place that they could imagine themselves. But then they come here, and they fall in love with this place. So I would just say, have an open mind. And if UVA is something that you're interested in, my email is on the website. I'm happy to talk and be a booster for this place.

NATALIE BLAZER: That's so nice. And as we've talked about, in the middle of everything you're working on, that's very generous. So thank you. This was awesome.

XIAO WANG: Thank you. I appreciate it. This was great.

NATALIE BLAZER: This was so, so fun. Thank you so much for taking the time. I know you have just so much going on. You just got married.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: Congratulations.

XIAO WANG: Thank you.

NATALIE BLAZER: I'm glad you're back from all your travels. And I'm excited to see what you guys do this year.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah. Same, same. Hopefully we'll be able to get some great opportunities again for our students.

Whether we’re Black, White, Brown, Latino, Asian, Arab, or Indigenous, Native or newcomer, LGBTQ+or not, disabled or not, and regardless of faith, we believe in the freedom to speak out against injustice, organize for change, and fight hate and discrimination through peaceful means. It is not just a right, but a duty to the communities we represent. That’s why civil rights groups have criticized acts of this administration and denounced offensive and dangerous rhetoric.

This administration has made clear its intent to protect discrimination over civil rights and use any opportunity to silence dissent and target nonprofits that oppose its policies. It attacks philanthropic institutions, unions, teachers, and universities that support diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, the freedom to protest and to learn our history. We cannot be silent as they turn government power against our rights.

We continue to unequivocally condemn all forms of violence, including political violence, as our communities have long been targets of white supremacists’ hatred. America’s civil rights movement is rooted in nonviolence – as championed by Dr. King and Bayard Rustin—from the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington to today’s fight for equal opportunity for all.

Our communities face the highest rates of hate and violence –including anti-Arab, anti-Asian, anti-Black, anti-homeless, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino, anti-LGBTQ+, anti-Muslim, antisemitic, and gender-based violence— and this administration’s actions and rhetoric have only intensified the dangers of hate crimes and violence by militarizing our cities, demonizing these communities, and enabling mass raids based on race and immigration status.

In an effort to silence opposition, the administration now also threatens to designate civil rights groups as “domestic terrorists,” revoke their non-profit status, and launch criminal investigations. But no group or individual should be considered a “criminal” for documenting hate incidents, protecting vulnerable communities, and pursuing justice through courts and legislation rather than violence.

The First Amendment protects our right to assemble, petition our government, and speak truth to power. These are not privileges—they are fundamental rights. Our strength has always come from unity built on freedom, not fear; on debate, not silence. When an administration seeks to stifle dissent, it rejects the very spirit that carries this nation forward. That’s why we:

Call on Congress to reject these attacks and publicly defend organizations exercising their constitutional rights,

Call on our allies to speak up now, because in unity, there is strength, and

Call on all Americans to recognize this attack for what it is: an assault on the institutions that protect all our rights.

Further attacks will only strengthen our conviction—a conviction driven not by greed, power, or envy, but by the fundamental belief that all people, regardless of race or identity, deserve equality, fairness, and dignity.

Laye Sekou Camara, 47, of Mays Landing, New Jersey, entered the United States on an immigrant visa and lied on his immigration forms by failing to admit he was involved in Liberia’s civil war.

“As a leader in Liberia’s civil war, Mr. Camara facilitated atrocities against civilians in his own country — including the use of child soldiers,” said ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations Philadelphia Special Agent in Charge Edward V. Owens. “By concealing his crimes in Liberia, Camara was able to obtain immigration benefits and use those documents to seek employment and a new life in the United States. HSI will not allow the U.S. to become a refuge for human rights violators or for individuals who secure lawful status through deception. We will continue to work with our federal, state and international partners to identify fraud, protect the integrity of the immigration system, and support the prosecutors that hold these offenders accountable.”

According to the investigation, in 2010, Camara obtained lawful permanent resident status by falsely stating on immigration forms that he had never participated in extrajudicial killings or other acts of violence; had never been involved with a paramilitary unit, rebel group, or guerilla group; and had never engaged in the recruitment or use of child soldiers.

Officials in Canada said they have received more than 5,500 asylum claims since the beginning of July at one border crossing – Quebec’s Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle border crossing, south of Montreal.

The figure represents a 263% increase from the same period last year, according to data from the Canada Border Services Agency.

The spike in border crossings comes as President Trump ramps up military-style raids by armed, masked, agents of the Department for Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency as the White House presses them to hit deportation targets.

The Trump administration’s operation is targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally with criminal records, and has seen over 200,000 people arrested, and over 50,000 detained so far this year. Many are being seized from their homes, while going to work, outside courthouses and at store parking lots.

Many of those arrested and detained have had previous protections allowing them to legally remain in the U.S. removed by the government.

Earlier this year the Trump administration revoked temporary legal status granted to more than 800,000 immigrants who fled violence, disasters and instability in countries like Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

This week, Trump deployed the National Guard to Memphis and suggested he could also send troops into Chicago. The White House has previously sent them into Los Angeles and Washington D.C.

As well as those who may face deportation from the U.S. trying to flee the country, increasing numbers of U.S. citizens are also trying to leave, the Canadian figures suggest.

Data from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada covering claims of alleged persecution within the U.S. last month revealed there were 245 refugee applications made by U.S. citizens in the first six months of this year.

This represents a sharp rise in claims, with 204 referrals filed by Americans in the whole of 2024.

Canada’s acceptance of U.S. refugees has historically been low. Applicants must convince the board that nowhere in the U.S. offers them safety to gain asylum.

Trump took it away. • Stateline,"Shalina Chatlani, Anna Claire Vollers",,,,,https://stateline.org/2025/09/19/biden-offered-health-insurance-access-to-daca-immigrants-trump-took-it-away/,"A new Trump administration rule bars immigrants living in the United States under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) from buying health insurance from Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
More than 20% of all DACA recipients reside in just two of those states: Texas (17%) and Florida (4%).
Mohyeddin and her colleagues surveyed 433 DACA recipients in 2024, before DACA recipients were eligible for the marketplace.
Eighty-one percent had health coverage, the vast majority through their employer or a union or professional association.
“The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general,” Mohyeddin said.","A new Trump administration rule bars immigrants living in the United States under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) from buying health insurance from Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

The change, announced in June, took effect at the beginning of this month. It reverses a policy change enacted by the Biden administration for last November’s annual enrollment period.

DACA, which President Barack Obama established in 2012, applies to certain immigrants who are here illegally but were brought to the U.S. as children. The program was enacted to protect them from deportation and allows them to work for renewable two-year periods. To be eligible, an immigrant must have come to the U.S. at age 15 or younger before June 15, 2007. DACA participants also must be high school graduates, high school students or veterans of the U.S. military.

The oldest are now in their early 40s, some with children of their own.

Even though there are some 525,000 active DACA recipients, only about 10,000 were getting their health insurance from the marketplaces before the policy change, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. However, critics of the new Trump administration rule say participation would have grown as more people became aware of their eligibility.

Under pressure, some immigrants are leaving American dreams behind

DACA recipients from 19 states were blocked from the marketplaces, though, because of pending litigation. More than 20% of all DACA recipients reside in just two of those states: Texas (17%) and Florida (4%).

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules, said DACA was an “abuse of executive authority” and should not have entitled some immigrants to benefits. The rule change simply restores the status quo, Vaughan said.

“It was kind of an experiment or an end run around our legal immigration system that was set up by the rules that were set up by Congress to try to offer an amnesty to this particular group,” Vaughan said. “Because it’s not a legal status, these individuals are not, under the law, eligible for certain public benefits, and one of them is subsidized health insurance.”

But critics of the change say it’s cruel to cancel health care coverage for people who were brought to the country as children.

“Health care is a fundamental human right all of us, no matter where we were born, how much money we have, what we look like, what language we speak, we should be able to access quality and affordable care when we need it,” said Isobel Mohyeddin, a policy associate at the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrants.

Mohyeddin and her colleagues surveyed 433 DACA recipients in 2024, before DACA recipients were eligible for the marketplace. Eighty-one percent had health coverage, the vast majority through their employer or a union or professional association. But nearly 20% lacked coverage, more than twice the national uninsured rate of 8%.

Mohyeddin said that many of the DACA recipients without coverage reported skipping recommended medical and dental appointments or declining to fill prescriptions, because they couldn’t afford it or were fearful of being targeted for their status.

“The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general,” Mohyeddin said.

While DACA recipients were only recently allowed to purchase coverage on the marketplace, it was a huge step toward better health outcomes for them, said Arline Cruz Escobar, director of health programs at Make the Road New York, a group that provides legal and social services to immigrants.

Most refugees and asylees will be denied food stamps under Trump’s new law

“We see a lot of mixed-status households, and so I think people are just very confused about what this means for them, and what it means for their families,” Cruz Escobar said. “We already know that the immigrant community doesn’t access enough preventive care and screenings and so, I can only imagine that we will see an increase in a lot of chronic conditions, or undiagnosed chronic conditions that could have been prevented.”

The impact of the new Trump administration rule on DACA recipients will vary, as some states offer other health care options to noncitizens.

States are going to have to decide whether they can afford to offer state-subsidized health coverage to DACA recipients and other immigrants who are no longer eligible for federal help, said Jessica Altman, executive director of California’s marketplace exchange, Covered California.

California has the most DACA recipients, at 147,440. Altman said more than 2,300 of them have purchased plans on the California marketplace and will lose their coverage. She said many DACA recipients in the state were not aware of their eligibility, and more would have enrolled if the Trump administration hadn’t made the policy change.

California provides state-funded health coverage to all income-eligible immigrants, regardless of their legal status. But Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a budget that scales back that coverage because of budgetary issues.

In light of federal changes and financial obligations on states, Altman said, California will have to make the same choices as other states about how or whether to help DACA recipients with their health care.

“The hard part is, to actually make coverage affordable for the populations that we’re talking about, you have to fund financial assistance at least somewhat comparable to what’s available on the federal marketplace,” Altman said. “So the state dollars are really where the rubber meets the road.”

Per my last post, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) responded to the Thursday’s vaccine advisory panel meeting with a statement that said the committee (which health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr completely replaced earlier this year) “promoted false claims and misguided information about vaccines as part of an unprecedented effort to limit access to routine childhood immunizations and sow fear and mistrust in vaccines”.

The academy also reshared their guidance for vaccines, which includes “giving newborns a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth” and a combination MMRV vaccine should “remain an option” for families. The AAP advises that children receive the shot “at 1 year and again at 4-6 years”.

We’ll get more from the second day of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) later. A reminder that on Thursday the panel voted on recommending that children receive multiple vaccines to protect against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox (MMRV), instead of a single vaccine that can protect against all four diseases.

As my colleague, Carter Sherman, reports, the committee is scheduled to focus on Covid vaccines today. It will also hold two votes on the recommended timing of the vaccine for hepatitis B – an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease and death.

The committee was originally scheduled to vote on the hepatitis B vaccine on Wednesday, but delayed the vote after the committee chair, Martin Kulldorff, noticed “slight discrepancies” in the wording of the planned votes.

Following Kirk shooting, new poll shows drop in positive direction of the country among Republicans

A new Associated Press-NORC poll shows that there has been a significant drop, among Republicans, that the country is heading in a positive direction.

51% of Republicans said the country is heading in the wrong direction, in a poll conducted between 11 and 15 September. A 22-point increase from the 29% of Republicans who expressed the same feeling in June of this year.

For Democrats, 92% say the country is heading in the wrong direction – a number that’s stayed consistent since Donald Trump returned to the White House for a second term.

More broadly, 39% of adults approve of the way Trump is handing his job as president, while 60% disapprove.

Congress prepares to vote of funding bills to avert government shutdown

Today, lawmakers in the House will vote on legislation, known as a “continuing resolution” (CR), to prevent a looming government shutdown at the end of September.

The bill, introduced by Republicans, would fund the government until 21 November. According to Politico, House GOP whip Tom Emmer was confident, as of Thursday, that his party had enough votes. “We’re going to pass this,” he said in an interview.

A reminder, Republicans only have a very thin majority in the lower chamber, and have already heard push back from some members on certain provisions in the bill.

Democrats have, almost unanimously, said they’re bucking the CR as is, taking issue with its lack of health care provisions. “The House Republican-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis,” senate minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a joint statement.

Democrats in the lower chamber also released their own legislation that would keep the government funded until the end of October.

For their part, GOP lawmakers only need a simple majority for their CR to advance to the Senate, where Democrats can use the filibuster to tank it if it lacks 60 votes. However, that requires Schumer to ensure that moderate members of his party don’t end up voting for the legislation if the threat of a shutdown inches closer.

This is the problem the top Democrat faced the last time this happened, back in March, when Schumer ended up voting for the Republican-written bill that kept federal agencies funded. At the time, Schumer faced immense pressure from his Democratic colleagues in the House to push back, but ultimately believed a shutdown would carry “consequences for America that are much, much worse”.

Trump expected to focus on TikTok and trade in call with Xi Jinping

The president doesn’t have any public events scheduled today, according to the White House.

He’s due to sign executive orders at 3pm EST, but that is closed press for the time being. We’ll let you know if that opens up.

In less than an hour, Trump is expected to have a call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. It’s the first time the pair have spoken since June, and Trump said to reporters yesterday that they’ll focus on TikTok and trade on their call. “We’re very close on all of it,” the president added.

When we have a readout we’ll make sure to bring you the latest lines.

US president Donald Trump suggested that TV networks which cover him “negatively” could be punished by the government, after celebrating ABC suspending late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.

Speaking to reporters on his flight back to the US from his state visit to the UK, the president said major US networks were “97% against me”, though he did not offer evidence to prove this figure or detail how this conclusion was evaluated.

Taiwan’s top representative in the United States met privately in Washington this month with a little-known group of intelligence advisers.

The meeting with Alexander Yui, Taiwan’s de facto US ambassador, was described by two sources with knowledge of the matter and amounted to one of the higher-level Taiwan-US contacts to date during Donald Trump’s second term, Reuters reports.

It was also an unusually sensitive meeting for the previously obscure group, the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB), which includes members who have jobs outside of the federal government and has historically played a low-key role in policymaking.

A White House official downplayed the encounter, saying it was not an official, sanctioned PIAB gathering but rather an informal conversation between some PIAB members and a foreign diplomat that was put together by a mutual contact.

Kamala Harris critical of Joe Biden in new book: ‘angry and disappointed’

David Smith

Kamala Harris has revealed she was left “angry and disappointed” when Joe Biden called her hours before her US presidential debate with Donald Trump to suggest powerful associates of Biden’s brother refused to support her.

The former vice-president and Democratic nominee recounts the episode – and other criticisms of Biden – in her campaign memoir 107 Days, obtained by the Guardian before its publication next week.

Harris writes that in September she was in a hotel room in Philadelphia, poised to take on Trump in a potentially decisive debate, when the then president called to wish her good luck – and to ask if she would be back in Philadelphia before the election.

Harris wondered why Biden would ask such a non sequitur. According to the book, he told her: “My brother called. He’s been talking to a group of real power brokers in Philly.” He offered several names and asked if Harris knew them. She did not.

Harris writes: “Then he got to his point. His brother had told him that those guys were not going to support me because I’d been saying bad things about him. He wasn’t inclined to believe it, he claimed, but he thought I should know in case my team had been encouraging me to put daylight between the two of us.”

The then vice-president asked Biden to put the group in touch with her directly. But he was not done with the call. He sought to rewrite the history of his own disastrous debate performance against Trump three months earlier.

The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show has prompted impassioned calls for a boycott against Disney, ABC’s parent company, and other major media conglomerates that have refused to air Kimmel’s show.

Boycott calls grew after ABC announced it would indefinitely suspend the popular show following complaints from the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr. Carr’s complaints stem from Kimmel’s recent monologue in which he addressed the killing of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk by saying:

Many in Maga land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.

Carr, who was appointed by Donald Trump earlier this year, said Kimmel’s comments were “truly sick” and that ABC had violated its “public interest” broadcast obligations. ABC’s suspension of the show also came after Nexstar Media, one of the US’s largest owners of TV stations, said it “strongly object[ed]” to Kimmel’s comments and would pre-empt, or halt, any of the show’s episodes set to air on its stations “for the foreseeable future”.

Meanwhile, the conservative TV conglomerate Sinclair announced it would run a tribute to Kirk during Kimmel’s time slot on Friday. It also called on Kimmel to issue a formal apology and make a personal donation to Kirk’s family and his rightwing political advocacy group, Turning Point USA.

Overnight, calls to boycott ABC and Disney emerged, with Nelini Stamp, organizing director of the pro-labor union political group Working Families Party, sharing a viral boycott resource guide online that says:

Jimmy Kimmel wasn’t suspended because of what he said. He was suspended because the FCC threatened his employer. That’s state-sanctioned censorship and it is a giant red flag … Authoritarianism isn’t coming, it’s already here. Today it’s Jimmy. Tomorrow it’s the rest of us.

A Los Angeles protester charged with assaulting a border patrol agent in June was acquitted on Wednesday after US immigration officials were accused in court of lying about the incident.

The not guilty verdict for Brayan Ramos-Brito is a major setback for the Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in southern California and for Gregory Bovino, a border patrol chief who has become a key figure in Trump’s immigration crackdown. The 29-year-old defendant, who is a US citizen, was facing a misdemeanor and was the first protester to go to trial since demonstrations against immigration raids erupted in LA earlier this summer.

Border patrol and prosecutors alleged that Ramos-Brito struck an agent during a chaotic protest on 7 June in the south Los Angeles county city of Paramount outside a complex where the Department of Homeland Security has an office. But footage from a witness, which the Guardian published days after the incident, showed an agent forcefully shoving Ramos-Brito. The footage did not capture the demonstrator assaulting the officer.

The jury delivered its not guilty verdict after a little over an hour of deliberations, the Los Angeles Times reported. Bovino testified earlier in the day and faced a tough cross-examination from public defenders.

Bovino was one of four border patrol agents who testified as witnesses, but was the only one to say he saw the alleged assault by Ramos-Brito, according to the LA Times. Videos played in court captured the agent shoving Ramos-Brito, sending him flying backward, and showed the protester marching back toward the agent, the paper reported. The videos did not capture Ramos-Brito’s alleged assault.

There were multiple factual discrepancies in DHS’s internal reports on the protest, which initially led to charges against five demonstrators, the Guardian reported in July. A criminal complaint suggested Ramos-Brito and others had attacked agents in protest of the arrests of two sisters, but records showed the women had been arrested in a separate incident that occurred after Ramos-Brito’s arrest.

A supervisor later documented the correct timeline and “apologized” for errors, records showed.

DC Democrat challenges long-serving House delegate amid age concerns

Chris Stein

Washington DC’s long-serving delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton is under renewed pressure to step down after a city council member announced on Thursday he would challenge her in next year’s election, saying the federal district needs its “strongest fighters” as it faces unprecedented interference from Donald Trump and the Republican party.

Robert White’s decision to jump into the race for the non-voting role in the House of Representatives comes amid mounting concern over the 88-year-old Norton’s ability to continue doing the job at a tense moment for the city.

Trump in August ordered a temporary federal takeover of the Washington DC police department and dispatched national guard and federal agents onto its streets to fight what he called an “out-of-control” crime wave, a claim city leaders disputed.

In a video announcing his candidacy, White, an at-large council member who made an unsuccessful bid for mayor in 2022, referred to Norton as “our lion on the Hill” but implied it was time for new leadership.

“I have never seen my city more vulnerable than we are right now, and in this entire Congress, there is one person whose job it is to protect and stand up for our residents, and we need our strongest fighters,” said White. “I’m ready to take this torch.”

The announcement comes days after Donna Brazile, a former chief of staff to Norton who rose to serve as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, said that she should not seek a 19th term in the office she has held since 1991.

Though not allowed to cast votes in the House, Norton was known as a tenacious advocate for the rights of the federal district, but has appeared subdued in recent years.

She had been pictured requiring the help of an aide at public appearances, and reads haltingly from prepared remarks at committee appearances, even when the topic concerns contentious proposals to change Washington DC’s laws.

Representatives Don Bacon and Ro Khanna plan to introduce bipartisan legislation that would exempt coffee products from any tariffs imposed after 19 January, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing a copy of the draft legislation.

The exemption would apply to roasted and decaffeinated coffee, as well as coffee husks, skins, and other drinks or substitutes containing coffee, the report said.

Republican Bacon and Khanna, who is a Democrat, said they focused on coffee because they want to help Americans save on a daily staple, according to the report.

“Why are we tariffing American citizens on something that we don’t even grow? It doesn’t make sense,” Bacon told the newspaper. Representatives for Bacon, Khanna and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Coffee is one of the items that are keeping food prices in the United States persistently high since the Trump administration applied a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports at the end of July, including green coffee.

Prices for arabica coffee, the mild variety mostly used by coffee chains such as Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts, have since jumped around 50% at the Intercontinental Exchange in New York. Brazil used to supply a third of all the coffee used in the US, but shipments have dried up since the tariffs were imposed.

Opening summary

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with news that Donald Trump suggested on Thursday that TV networks which cover him “negatively” could be punished by the government after his celebration of ABC suspending late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.

On Air Force One, the president spoke to reporters on his flight back to the US from his state visit to the UK. The president said major US networks were “97% against me”, though he did not offer evidence to prove this figure or detail how this conclusion was evaluated. He said he read the statistic “someplace”.

“Again, 97% negative, and yet I won easily. I won all seven swing states,” Trump said. “They give me only bad press. I mean they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their licenses should be taken away.”

The president’s claim that US TV networks need to be licensed by the government to operate is, however, incorrect. While local TV stations do require a license from the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC says clearly on its website that it does “not license TV or radio networks (such as CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox)”.

Trump supported ABC’s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show, saying that the comedian was “not a talented person” who “had very bad ratings”.

“Well, Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else, and he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk,” Trump told reporters during his state visit to the United Kingdom, adding “they should have fired him a long time ago”.

According to Nielsen ratings as reported by LateNighter, although Stephen Colbert’s Late Show leads the time slot in total viewers with 2.42 million, Kimmel’s show averaged 1.77 million viewers in the second quarter of 2025 and edged out Colbert in the key 18-49 demographic.

However, there was an 11% drop-off in his show’s viewership the last month. Kimmel also has over 20 million subscribers on YouTube.

In other developments:

Barack Obama condemned what he called a “dangerous” escalation by the Trump administration over the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s show. “After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn’t like,” Obama wrote on X.

The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show has prompted impassioned calls for a boycott against Disney, ABC’s parent company, and other major media conglomerates that have refused to air Kimmel’s show. Boycott calls grew after ABC announced it would indefinitely suspend the popular show following complaints from the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr.

Kamala Harris watched mortified as her running mate, Tim Walz, fell into JD Vance’s trap in last year’s vice-presidential debate and “fumbled” a crucial answer, she writes in a campaign memoir. The former Democratic presidential nominee also admits that Walz had not been her first choice for vice-president in her book 107 Days, obtained by the Guardian ahead of its publication next week.

The Trump administration asked the US supreme court to allow it to fire the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, as it continues its extraordinary attack on the central bank’s independence. In a filing on Thursday, Donald Trump’s officials requested an emergency order to remove Cook from the Fed’s board of governors, after an appeals court refused to go along with efforts to oust her.

Donald Trump accused Vladimir Putin of letting him down in a joint press conference with Keir Starmer during which the US president piled criticism on his Russian counterpart. Trump said he had hoped to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine soon after entering office, but that Putin’s actions had prevented him from doing so.

Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, has been appointed as the new CEO and chair of the board for Turning Point USA. The organization announced on Thursday that the late CEO and co-founder of Turning Point USA, who was shot and killed at an event last week, had previously expressed that he would want his wife to lead in the event of his death.

On July 4, 2025, President Donald Trump signed into law a massive, partisan budget bill: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). This bill—which congressional Republicans passed—makes devastating cuts to programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that help Americans meet their basic needs while giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy.1 The OBBBA—combined with other changes to the Affordable Care Act enacted by the president and congressional Republicans—will leave 15 million more people without health insurance and cause about 4 million people to have their food assistance terminated or cut substantially.2

However, the harmful impacts of the law don’t stop there. The new law provides an unprecedented increase in funding to implement the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda with zero accountability, after congressional Republicans rejected multiple requests to amend the bill to place checks on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) use of these funds.3 The law provides $45 billion—available through fiscal year 2029—to dramatically expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention capacity to 100,000 beds.4 Additionally, the law appropriates nearly $30 billion for ICE personnel and enforcement operations.5 It pushes ICE’s overall annual budget of around $9.9 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $28 billion.6 The OBBBA will nearly triple ICE’s budget with this infusion of additional funding while taking away valuable support for vulnerable populations, including more than $1 trillion in cuts to medical care for children, the elderly, and disabled people.7 Even prior to the OBBBA, ICE and its contractors have operated without sufficient accountability and oversight.8 This funding increase will only enhance the Trump administration’s cruel immigration actions without making Americans safer.

The OBBBA will nearly triple ICE’s budget with this infusion of additional funding while taking away valuable support for vulnerable populations.

In response to the Trump administration’s arbitrary demand that DHS arrest 3,000 immigrants per day, ICE has operated with impunity.9 The administration has essentially dismantled congressionally created watchdog agencies that provided oversight of DHS, including monitoring immigration detention and ensuring the protection of detainees’ civil rights.10 Unless Congress steps up and demands accountability for the slush fund, DHS under the Trump administration now has at its disposal the additional funding provided by the OBBBA. This funding will be used to further escalate the Trump administration’s unprecedented and indiscriminate deportation agenda that separates families, detains students and children, and terrorizes communities. Although we are already seeing the effects of the administration’s cruel, anti-immigrant policies, the full extent of the economic and human impact on families and communities will only multiply as these funds are expended.

A secure border is mandatory for a functioning, efficient immigration system, but an actual solution to fix what’s broken must also respect due process and the rule of law, reflect our values, and strengthen the American economy and local communities.

Giving the Trump administration a slush fund for ICE to operate above the law and arrest anyone—even those who have contributed to our country for years and pose no threat—is not the answer to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system. A secure border is mandatory for a functioning, efficient immigration system, but an actual solution to fix what’s broken must also respect due process and the rule of law, reflect our values, and strengthen the American economy and local communities.11

The frightening and wide-ranging use of the OBBBA funds

The OBBBA appropriates nearly $30 billion to massively increase ICE’s deportation force through the hiring and training of an unprecedented number of new ICE officers.12 These funds will also go toward bonuses for signing, performance, and retention as well as expanding transportation and information technology to support immigration enforcement operations.13 This increased funding will cause further harm in communities across the United States by turbocharging ICE’s ability to operate with impunity on a massive, countrywide scale.

Rampant and reckless targeting of immigrants

Despite campaign promises pledging to focus on deporting criminals, under the Trump administration, ICE has recklessly targeted hardworking immigrants to meet extreme arrest quotas rather than prioritizing removal of people who pose a genuine threat to public safety.14 ICE personnel—frequently masked and unidentified—have arrested pregnant women; high school students; a grandmother gardening outside her home; and people who are trying to comply with the law by reporting for routine ICE check-ins or appearing at scheduled court hearings.15 Officials have detained members of religious groups, including a Florida pastor who has been in the U.S. for 20 years and Iranian Christian asylum seekers.16 Even U.S. citizens are getting caught up in the immigration enforcement dragnet, with reports of them being wrongfully detained by ICE and sometimes kept in detention facilities.17

ICE personnel—frequently masked and unidentified—have arrested pregnant women; high school students; a grandmother gardening outside her home; and people who are trying to comply with the law by reporting for routine ICE check-ins or appearing at scheduled court hearings.

In carrying out arbitrary arrests and detentions while masked and unidentifiable, ICE is stoking fear in communities across the country.18 By greatly increasing funding for ICE operations with no checks, the OBBBA will turbocharge this reckless campaign against immigrants and Americans, increasing fear without any meaningful improvements to the safety and security of our nation.

Massive expansion of unaccountable immigrant detention

The OBBBA also materializes the Trump administration’s plan to spend a staggering $45 billion to expand ICE’s immigration detention capacity.19 These detention centers will include facilities to detain families with children under conditions that are not appropriate for children, despite the well-documented detrimental impacts that such detention can have on children’s well-being.20 The additional funding will magnify the horrific conditions that characterize immigrant detention under the second Trump administration and have already contributed to multiple deaths.21 This includes detention centers in extreme locations such as the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, where detainees reported a “lack of access to water, inadequate food and denial of religious rights.”22

ICE is also considering reopening shuttered prisons across the U.S. to increase its detention capacity.23 Some private entities are already cashing in at the expense of the immigrants who are kept at detention centers in inhumane conditions.24 For example, Acquisition Logistics Company, with no significant experience managing large-scale federal projects, was awarded a $1.26 billion contract to build a massive 5,000 bed immigration detention facility at Fort Bliss—an Army base in the Texas desert—to house single adults, raising serious concerns about the welfare of those who will be detained there.25 The reason as to why this small company that apparently does not even have a functioning website won the contract to build and operate “the nation’s largest immigration detention complex” is a mystery, allegedly prompting at least one competitor to file a complaint.26

The additional funding will magnify the horrific conditions that characterize immigrant detention under the second Trump administration and have already contributed to multiple deaths.

Given that nearly 90 percent of immigrants in ICE custody are held in private facilities operated by for-profit corporations—such as GEO Group and CoreCivic—that multiple reports found have insufficient oversight, the tens of billions of dollars in new detention funding will likely be a financial benefit to private companies.27 In addition to increased profits from expanded immigration detention facilities, GEO Group could also greatly benefit from the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts via the expanded use of an ankle-monitor tracking program entirely run by one of GEO Group’s subsidiaries.28 GEO Group has a track record of supporting pro-Trump Super PACs, according to an analysis of the Trump campaign’s finances.29 In addition, months before the OBBBA was enacted, CoreCivic was keeping its investors informed about communications the company was having with the administration.30 Expanding private prisons and ankle-monitor tracking will thus serve as a windfall to the Trump administration’s wealthy supporters on top of the tax breaks included in the OBBBA that benefit the rich while harming vulnerable Americans.31

More authoritarian and lawless immigration enforcement activities

As part of its mass deportation efforts, the Trump administration has already violated due process and disrespected court orders.32 The OBBBA’s massive influx of funding will enable the Trump administration to intensify these actions that flout rights and upend democratic values. Expanding ICE’s personnel and resources without sufficient guardrails will likely lead to further abuses, such as detaining foreign students for exercising free speech; targeting people who show up for their hearings at immigration courts; detaining foreign journalists for covering protests; and racial profiling.33

In September 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed a federal district court’s ruling that granted a temporary restraining order blocking ICE from conducting operations in Los Angeles.34 The district court said these operations were likely done with improper reliance upon race, ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, or type of work to target people to detain.35 The Supreme Court’s stay allows ICE to resume arrests of people they suspect are undocumented based on their appearance, the language they speak, and their type of work, paving the way for more indiscriminate arrests and detention.36 In a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted, “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”37 The Supreme Court’s ruling opens the door for ICE to rely on racial stereotypes and target anyone who “is perceived as Latino,” putting Latino and other immigrant communities, including U.S. citizens, at risk of unconstitutional seizure and detention during immigration enforcement activities.38

We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job – Justice Sonia Sotomayor

In addition to expanding unaccountable funding to fuel the administration’s racial profiling, the OBBBA fails to hold the Trump administration to account for its authoritarian attacks on other independent branches of government. These attacks have included restricting members of Congress from conducting unannounced oversight visits to ICE facilities, which they have a right to do under federal law.39 The Trump administration has also attacked the separation of powers by filing a lawsuit against all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland over court orders slowing deportations, which was thrown out and founded to be “potentially calamitous” by a federal judge appointed by President Trump.40

The OBBBA funds could also be used by the Trump administration to continue to rapidly deport immigrants without due process, such as what occurred when the administration deported more than 200 migrants, including Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison, CECOT.41 Multiple courts, including conservative judges, have ruled deporting migrants without due process unlawful.42 And, as ICE operations expand across the country, the Trump administration could continue to utilize the National Guard as part of its immigration enforcement efforts, further endangering civil-military relations.43 In June 2025, the administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles to support federal immigration officials, a move a federal judge later ruled illegal.44 National Guard members have also been seen appearing alongside ICE agents to lend support to the Trump administration’s authoritarian power grab in Washington, D.C., spreading fear in local immigrant communities.45

One current ICE employee told The Atlantic that pressure to increase the number of deportations has led supervisors at the agency to keep agents off of new cases involving drugs, human trafficking, and child exploitation in order to be able to continue “arresting gardeners.”

Many ICE employees are also feeling burned out and morally conflicted due to the Trump administration’s focus on expanding mass deportations at the expense of keeping American communities safe from serious crimes.46 For example, one current ICE employee told The Atlantic that pressure to increase the number of deportations has led supervisors at the agency to keep agents off of new cases involving drugs, human trafficking, and child exploitation in order to be able to continue “arresting gardeners.”47 Moreover, former ICE officials worry that by receiving increased funding to rapidly hire agents, while simultaneously lowering its hiring standards, ICE will open the door to extremist candidates.48

Each of these unwise policies and actions demonstrate why the OBBBA’s huge expansion of ICE’s funding for the Trump administration to use unchecked is likely to have negative consequences for our democracy and the rule of law.

Inappropriate use of other law enforcement agencies for expanded interior enforcement

The OBBBA also provides more than $6 billion in funds to hire, train, and provide bonuses for Border Patrol agents, which sets the stage for expanding the agency’s involvement in immigration enforcement activities far beyond the border.49 Using a provision that allows DHS to deploy up to 100 miles from any external U.S. boundary, including the coastline, Border Patrol agents have recently conducted immigration enforcement actions in the interior of the country—far away from the southern border—including in New York City.50 The Trump administration could use the funds provided in the OBBBA for hiring new personnel to greatly increase the Border Patrol’s involvement in these interior immigration enforcement operations, further encroaching on places where up to two-thirds of Americans live.51

Finally, the Trump administration is forcing federal law enforcement officials from other agencies to abandon their respective missions to support its cruel and unnecessary mass deportation efforts. Agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; and the U.S. Marshals Service are being enlisted to help DHS detain undocumented immigrants through at least the end of the year.52 This move harms national security by pulling these officials away from their efforts to keep Americans safe from drugs, guns, and violent crime.53 In addition, the administration ordered the FBI to assign more agents to assist ICE’s operations.54 The FBI has subsequently begun to reassign agents back from immigration to focus on counterterrorism citing insufficient resources to pursue terrorism and cyber threats.55 The reckless reassignment of federal law enforcement personnel across multiple agencies from their essential duties further demonstrates how the Trump administration is disregarding real national security priorities at the expense of driving its extreme mass deportation efforts.

The impact of the Trump administration’s cruel enforcement operations on people and the economy

The OBBBA funds will exacerbate the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that are causing fear and will further impact the economy and communities across the United States. These impacts will be broad since immigrants are interwoven in our communities and are not a monolith, as they can be workers, caregivers, business owners, consumers, and other community members.

Major industries are adversely impacted by raids

Reckless deportation efforts—including work site raids—will drain America’s workforce, hitting critical industries such as agriculture and construction that rely on undocumented labor. In agriculture, where undocumented immigrants make up an estimated 45 percent of the workforce, increased worksite raids such as those across California’s Central Coast and San Joaquin valley are driving workers to stay home out of fear.56 Cherry farmers in Oregon and Washington are seeing unharvested crops—and potential financial losses—mirroring challenges farms face nationwide.57 Eventually Americans will feel this impact in their pockets. A study found that deporting 8.3 million undocumented immigrant workers could lead to a more than 10 percent increase in agricultural prices over the next decade.58 This additional burden threatens further financial devastation on families who already feel squeezed by high grocery prices, particularly as the president’s tariffs push items such as coffee, beef, fresh fruit, and vegetables to all-time high prices.59

Furthermore, a CAP study from 2021 estimated that there are nearly 1.6 million undocumented immigrants who are working in construction.60 These raids will worsen the labor shortage in construction, a field which has already been facing a deficit of 200,000 to 400,000 workers every month over the past decade.61 The industry is also losing workers with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), many of whom have legally lived in the United States for decades but now face deportation after President Trump ended protections for TPS recipients from several countries.62

The OBBBA funds will exacerbate the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that are causing fear and will further impact the economy and communities across the United States.

Without these workers, housing and infrastructure projects will be delayed, driving up housing costs for American families who already face daunting home prices and interest rates.63 Recent raids on construction sites in states such as Florida, Louisiana, and Texas have stalled housing and infrastructure projects with workers afraid to show up for fear of detention.64

Small businesses suffer from retreating customer base

Fear of immigration raids echoes through local economies and small businesses. Small businesses are the cornerstone of local economies and communities. They buy goods and services from local vendors; inspire innovation; create jobs; and contribute tax dollars that support schools and public safety.65 When these businesses are disrupted, owners may be forced to lay off employees or cut worker hours, leading to less spending and ripple effects across local economies.66

While immigrants contributed an estimated $29.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2022, small businesses across California, Wisconsin, and Maryland have reported drops in sales as immigrant families stay home—afraid to shop or go to work for fear of detention.

While immigrants contributed an estimated $29.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2022, small businesses across California, Wisconsin, and Maryland have reported drops in sales as immigrant families stay home—afraid to shop or go to work for fear of detention.67 One restaurant owner in Los Angeles said the recent ICE raids were “hurting everybody’s business … It’s worse than COVID.”68 Restaurant workers across California, Texas, and Pennsylvania have been arrested and detained in worksite raids, exacerbating the fear.69 In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and parts of Massachusetts, some businesses have seen revenues fall by 50 percent, leaving small business owners concerned for their future.70 As one business owner in Milwaukee put it:

It’s unknown what will happen to my shop that I’ve worked so hard to have for 27 years. I’m concerned for my family, my kids, grandkids and community.71

In Nebraska, small businesses were still struggling a month after a large immigration raid.72 Additionally, areas with a high number of Latino immigrants have been hit the hardest with families staying home and cutting back on groceries.73 These ripple effects show that the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies undermine small businesses that anchor local economies. As sales fall and workers lose hours, entire neighborhoods feel the strain, threatening jobs, public revenue, and long-term stability of communities.

Family separation

Beyond the economic impact, raids devastate communities and tear apart families. Communities are witnessing silent streets, empty stores, and families canceling celebrations.74 Additionally, during the school year, schools recorded an increase of student absences due to immigration raids.75 In Los Angeles, between June 6 and June 22, more than 1,600 people were detained in car washes, clothing wholesalers, and outside of Home Depots—where day laborers gather to find work—sending shockwaves through the community.76 Increased raids are ensnaring long time immigrants and tearing families apart. In Michigan, Jose Guadalupe Jaimes, a father and small business owner who lived in the United States for 30 years, was detained outside his son’s school.77 In California, Narcisco Barranco, father of three U.S. Marines, was violently detained despite having lived in the country for decades.78

Beyond the economic impact, raids devastate communities and tear apart families. Communities are witnessing silent streets, empty stores, and families canceling celebrations.

Among those impacted by increased immigration enforcement are American children with immigrant parents who are separated from their families.79 While some follow their parents to their country of origin, others stay in the United States, living with family members while they wait to be reunited with their parents.80 Cases like these show how the OBBBA’s blank check to the Trump administration’s deportation force will escalate indiscriminate immigration raids, leaving deep scars on families, communities, and the American economy. As Archbishop Thomas G. Wenski of Miami recently warned:

[A] mass deportation campaign, which this legislation funds, will prove detrimental to the future of our nation, as long-term residents with U.S.-citizen children who work hard and contribute to our economy and culture will be removed. This does not serve the long-term interests and the values of our country.81

Conclusion

While the OBBBA funnels unprecedented funds to supercharge deportation and detention activities without any guardrails, it cuts funds for agencies and programs designed to help strengthen public safety, such as funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and community violence intervention programs.82 The OBBBA is also putting millions of Americans at risk of losing access to basic and lifesaving health care services and gutting services for children.83 In addition, under the OBBBA, taxpayer dollars are poised to line the pockets of the wealthy, such as private prison companies, some of which have donated repeatedly to President Trump’s campaign.84

The Trump administration’s anti-immigrant actions have already illustrated what is to come, harming local economies and communities. This overreach of power should terrify not only immigrants directly affected but also all Americans. The OBBBA boosts ICE’s funding without guardrails to create a slush fund for President Trump to abuse—and this does not make us safer. Instead of further fueling the Trump administration’s harmful immigration actions, the American public needs a new system that respects due process and the rule of law, prioritizes public safety, grows the economy, and makes communities safer.85 Actually fixing the immigration system will ensure high economic benefits for the United States, better competitive advantage, and an overall stronger country.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/ICESlushFundReport-2219519292.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 10:57:01.951449

Oliver-Barker Vormawor said the deportees had not violated any Ghanaian law, and their detention in a military camp was therefore illegal.

He wanted the government to produce the group in court, and justify why they were being held against their will, the lawyer added.

The government has not yet commented on the law suit, but has previously said that it plans to accept another 40 deportees. Opposition MPs are demanding the immediate suspension of the deportation deal until parliament ratifies it, saying this was required under Ghanaian law.

Last week, Ghana's President John Mahama said that 14 deportees of West African origin had arrived in the country following an agreement reached with the US.

He later said that all of them had been returned to their countries of origin, though Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa contradicted him by saying that only most of them had been returned.

Mr Vormawor's court application contradicts both of them, saying that 11 deportees are still in detention in Ghana.

The 11 were held in a US detention facility before being shackled and deported in a military cargo aircraft, according to papers filed in court.

The deportations are part of the US government's hard-line approach towards immigration since President Donald Trump took office in January.

He has vowed to conduct record-level deportations of migrants in the country illegally.

Ghana's foreign minister was quoted on Monday by Reuters news agency as saying the decision to accept the deportees was based on ""humanitarian principle and pan-African empathy"".

Dominic Cascianihome and legal correspondent and

Will Vernonin Paris

An Eritrean man has left the UK under the government's ""one in, one out"" deal with France, after a last-minute court bid to delay the departure failed.

The Home Office tightened rules around human trafficking claims to win Thursday's case - the first time ministers won a legal challenge that led to an immediate removal under the scheme.

Earlier this week, the removal of another migrant was temporarily blocked, though later an Indian national did become the first person to be sent to France under the pilot scheme, in a case without a legal challenge.

The UK and France have agreed a year-long scheme of exchanges of migrants to deter small boat crossings - although three more boats were seen leaving France on Friday morning as winds eased.

The man was accompanied by Home Office officials on an Air France flight from Heathrow Airport and handed over to police in Paris.

He told BBC News he felt ""very bad"" to be back in France and he did not know what he would do now before being led away to a different part of the airport.

French officials told the BBC he would be taken to a migrant accommodation centre. Under French rules, he will have eight days to either claim asylum in France or return to his home country.

The ""one in, one out"" deal is intended to deter people from turning to smugglers to cross the Channel because of the risk they could be sent back.

It proposes that, for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in the UK will be allowed to come in return, the first of whom is expected in the coming days.

Trade Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Breakfast this week's removals were ""the first steps and we will be ramping up from here"".

But he refused to comment on how many people the UK hoped to remove, saying: ""We're not going to put a number that would cap our ability to get a grip on this situation.""

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the government's removal of two migrants under the returns deal was ""pathetic"" and that ""boasting about it is absurd"".

""Hundreds of illegal immigrants crossed the Channel today alone and Labour want applause for removing just two - both of whom will be replaced,"" he said.

The Eritrean man removed on Friday arrived in England on a small boat in August, and told an emergency High Court hearing he had fled his home in 2019 because of forced conscription.

He said he spent time in Ethiopia, South Sudan and Libya before coming to Europe, where he slept rough in France before making his way to Dunkirk.

His removal is legally far more significant for the government's strategy than the failure on Tuesday to win permission for a flight to leave.

In that case, a 25-year-old Eritrean man won a temporary reprieve because the Home Office slavery assessment team, who rejected his case, said he could make further representations.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood then told officials to make clear that anyone who has been turned down for protection as a victim of slavery could continue their claim after being put on a flight to a safe country.

That saw the court rule there was no reason to stop Friday's removal flight. The judge, Mr Justice Sheldon, said France was a safe country abiding by the same safeguards as the UK under the European Convention of Human Rights.

He said there was no evidence that a migrant sent there would be treated unfairly - and if he were, he had a legal route to return to the UK by continuing his claim from there.

The ruling was in stark contrast to the failed £700m Rwanda plan under the last government, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the African country could not be considered to be safe at all, because of human rights abuses.

The judge then added that it was in the public interest for the flight to depart because it was part of a policy to disrupt criminal smuggling gangs who were posing a serious risk to life.

His ruling strengthened the Home Office's hand, after a separate unreported case concerning a stateless Palestinian fighting removal.

In its first two years, Operation Lone Star resulted in 340,000 immigrant detentions, over 23,000 criminal arrests, and 355 million doses of fentanyl seized.
Moreover, if SB4 — the law currently blocked — were to take effect, local sheriffs would be required to cooperate with federal immigration agents.
Civil rights organizations have expressed concerns about the new version of Lone Star.
“Under the current president, I don’t anticipate any resistance or lawsuits from the federal government against Texas over immigration enforcement,” says Lincoln-Goldfinch.","Operation Lone Star began as Texas’ strategy to curb migrant crossings at the southern border during Joe Biden’s presidency. Four years later, it has become a detention machine that reinforces the immigration crackdown launched under the Donald Trump administration. Now, under what several experts are calling Lone Star 2.0, Texas has taken on a role that normally belongs to the federal government: so far this year, more than 3,100 undocumented migrants have been arrested by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).

“Constitutionally, it’s very clear that immigration law is a federal matter, not a state matter. The difference here is that Texas isn’t interfering with the wishes of the current president,” explains immigration attorney Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch.

During Biden’s term, Texas faced federal lawsuits for trying to manage immigration on its own. Courts blocked the state from placing barbed-wire buoys in the Rio Grande and struck down SB4, a law that authorized local police to detain and deport people suspected of being in the country illegally.

However, under Trump, that federal opposition disappeared. As a result, the Texas government, led by Republican and Trump ally Greg Abbott, has intensified its operations and begun acting with near-total freedom.

According to official records obtained by The Texas Tribune, nearly 700 of the 3,131 arrests made by the DPS this year took place in cities like Austin, Dallas, and Houston — hundreds of miles from the border. Lone Star is no longer just a border issue. With Trump back in the White House, “any immigration enforcement actions the state can or wants to take are now welcomed by the White House,” says Lincoln-Goldfinch, who is currently running for a seat in the Texas House of Representatives.

The original initiative

Operation Lone Star has been one of the most expensive operations in U.S. history, costing nearly $11 billion to date, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a national organization that provides legal training and advocates for immigration policy reform. That amount is more than double Texas’ usual annual budget for its public university system and exceeds the combined budget the state allocates for child healthcare, housing subsidies, and rural community development. Although exact figures for Lone Star 2.0 are not yet available, the operation is likely to increase spending significantly — for example, to fund DPS special units deployed across the state.

In its first two years, Operation Lone Star resulted in 340,000 immigrant detentions, over 23,000 criminal arrests, and 355 million doses of fentanyl seized. A statement from Governor Abbott’s office at the time said the goal was to “secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal activity between ports of entry.” The statement also boasted that the operation had transported more than 9,100 immigrants to Washington, D.C., more than 4,900 to New York City, over 1,500 to Chicago, and more than 840 to Philadelphia in just a few months. Texas was essentially dumping arriving migrants in cities run by Democrats.

However, a report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) revealed that most arrests involved people with minor offenses. The program “spends billions of dollars to racially profile and arrest people who pose no threat to public safety, then forces them into a separate and unequal legal system run by the state,” the ACLU said.

“The immigrant community sees DPS as equivalent to ICE”

Traditionally, the Texas Department of Public Safety focused on public safety issues, such as traffic accidents. Now, much of its resources are devoted to immigration enforcement. Immigration attorney Pedro López considers it dangerous that this agency has effectively taken on the role of deporting people from the country. “For citizens, it’s an imminent danger to have state police directly involved in these arrests without oversight. Officers who make arrests can be subject to lawsuits for violating civil rights,” López points out.

Attorney Lincoln-Goldfinch points out that “the problem with state police or state law enforcement officers collaborating, cooperating, or enforcing immigration enforcement is that it destroys the relationship between the immigrant community and state law enforcement.” According to the attorney, the community now “sees DPS as equivalent to ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], and so they will flee. They will refuse to talk to or cooperate with DPS because they perceive it as a danger. That breaks the relationship between law enforcement and the immigrant community, which is very large in Texas, and harms public safety for everyone,” she adds.

Moreover, if SB4 — the law currently blocked — were to take effect, local sheriffs would be required to cooperate with federal immigration agents. “This essentially turns Texas into an immigration police state,” Lincoln-Goldfinch warns.

Civil rights organizations have expressed concerns about the new version of Lone Star. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center said it was misallocating resources that should be directed toward meeting Texans’ basic needs. The ACLU, for its part, has questioned the operation’s lack of transparency. In a recent report, the organization noted that DPS data do not match court records and that in many cases there is no clarity about what happens to people once they leave state custody. It also said the operation undermines the immigrant community’s trust in authorities and creates a “separate and unequal” system that allows DPS to act as an immigration enforcement force without sufficient judicial oversight.

“Under the current president, I don’t anticipate any resistance or lawsuits from the federal government against Texas over immigration enforcement,” says Lincoln-Goldfinch. “On the contrary, the only thing expected is cooperation.” She is also concerned that other states may implement similar programs, particularly because “the more Republican states do this, the more it will be welcomed by the Trump administration.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/BBWGSE2ZAUMZ3CYS3FKQG4TJOM.jpg?auth=6d6b5c10ae86010a64bac4f2aafab59846bef448bed5bdd2b5cfd6630648a3f5&width=1200,N,,2025-09-19 10:57:56.994389

Shadow hearings, unofficial congressional hearings typically held by the minority party when the majority party refuses to hold an official one, have been utilized by Democrats more frequently in the Trump administration. Thursday's hearing was Jayapal’s third time holding one.

Rep. Jayapal began the day’s hearing, titled “Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s Assault Destroys U.S. Families and Communities,” by saying, “Donald Trump lied to the American people. He lied when he said he would bring grocery prices down. He lied when he said he would release the Epstein files. And he sure as hell lied when it came to immigration enforcement.”

Jayapal said that even though Trump said he would focus on “deporting the worst of the worst” and “serious national security threats,” immigration officials are “targeting everyone that they think they might be able to deport, including veterans, farmworkers, green-card holders, students and U.S. citizens.” She said, “The American people see right through this deception and lies.”

Chelsea White, a witness from Nashville, tearfully recounted the events leading up to the deportation of her husband, Hilario Martinez Garzia, whom she described as a “devoted husband and father.”

“For 25 years, Tennessee was his home, where he built a life and contributed to his community,” White said. White said she and her husband were pulled over in what she thought was a normal DUI stop when they were quickly surrounded by officers and separated, with no information about where he was being taken.

“Driving home alone, four months pregnant and in shock, was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I kept thinking, ‘How am I going to explain this to our kids?’ Hilario had never spent a single night away from us. How do you prepare yourself to do it all alone?” White asked, adding that no one told her where her husband, who suffers from high blood pressure, was being detained for a week. And she didn’t know if he had his medication. After he was eventually deported to Mexico, White said she sold everything she could and took their three children, all of whom are U.S. citizens, with her to join him “in an unfamiliar country.”

“Families belong together without being forced to choose between love and survival,” White said.

Mimi Lettunich and her husband are currently caring for the four young children of her friend, a Canadian national, who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a picnic in June. Despite the fact that the children all have American citizenship, Lettunich testified at the hearing that Customs and Border Patrol officials “expedited passports to send children out of the United States, their country of birth,” interrogated them without their parents, threatened them with foster care and separated them from each other.

Janessa Goldbeck, a former U.S. Marine and CEO of a military family nonprofit, criticized the administration for “turning the National Guard and active duty military into an immigration police force,” which she said “dishonors their oath and corrupts their mission. The Guard exists to protect Americans in times of crisis, flood, fires and war — not to police families on our streets.

Recently, the number of unpermitted migrants crossing from France to England in small boats hit the milestone of 30,000 in record time, including over a thousand on one day in September. That is more people than live in many English villages. The political response so far has been feeble. The Labour government has vowed to dismantle the people-smuggling networks that ferry migrants, but it is wishful thinking to believe that the problem can be resolved so easily when these networks span not only countries but whole continents. The last Conservative government made similar vows, but left office without delivering.

The impasse has allowed the insurgent Reform UK led by Nigel Farage, an ally of President Donald Trump, to tap into public anxieties over porous borders. Founded less than a decade ago, the party now consistently ranks first in surveys. Reform promises to deport 600,000 migrants over its parliamentary term, to withdraw Britain from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and to scrap the 1998 Human Rights Act (HRA) by replacing it with a “British Bill of Rights.” Critics have framed this proposal as a veiled fascist plan to take away the human rights of ordinary British citizens, pointing out that Russia and Belarus are the only non-signatories in Europe.

“The rights of citizens to security and social cohesion must take precedence.”

But the reality is that the current human-rights framework and asylum process are not fit for purpose, because they prioritize the individual rights of foreign nationals over the collective security of British citizens. The ECHR, a supranational international treaty which is incorporated into British law through the HRA, is described by critics as an obstacle to border security and public safety, both of which are the responsibility of the Home Office (the UK’s interior ministry). Against the backdrop of a worrying lack of public confidence in the judicial system, recent court rulings have revealed just how inadequate the ECHR framework is when it comes to protecting the interests of law-abiding British citizens. For instance, back in June 2022, the European Court of Human Rights grounded a flight which was deporting asylum seekers (in the eyes of many, illegal migrants) from Britain to Rwanda under a “migration partnership” between the two governments. This dramatic 11th-hour intervention seemed to vindicate those who believe the ECHR is meddling inappropriately in the political affairs of its signatories.

It was once the case that many of these concerns could be waved away with the mere accusation of “racism.” But Reform’s surging popularity should force a serious conversation about what a new human-rights framework might look like. While the details must be discussed at a societal level, there can be some clear guiding principles based on what is and is not working with the status quo. The current legal settlement tends to prioritize individual rights over public institutions having a fundamental duty to remove threats to the safety and well-being of the wider public. This means that judges often end up privileging the claims of foreign nationals, including those who have broken the law, over the collective security of law-abiding British citizens. A new framework would seek to restore balance.

There is also a strong case for a reformed legal arrangement of “national preference.” In other words, the rights of citizens to security and social cohesion must take precedence over the claims of non-citizens. This should include “protective” measures that would give public authorities not just the power but the duty to prevent crime and disorder linked to immigration and asylum. Finally, a British human rights framework would also offer the ability to adequately balance rights with responsibilities, whether it is the expectation that foreign nationals behave appropriately in the host country where they are seeking asylum, or the duty of public authorities to remove them as swiftly as possible if they fail to do so.

Leaving the ECHR comes with both political and legal risks. But doing so would make it easier for a future government to improve on a human-rights framework that is far too protective of the individual rights of foreign nationals, and does not adequately account for collective safety, social cohesion, and public order. There are no easy solutions when it comes to addressing the small-boats emergency. But politics will eventually force a radical reordering of our existing legal architecture. Internationalist governance will—and should—give way to the democratic desire for national preference.",https://api.microlink.io?url=https://www.compactmag.com/article/toward-a-national-conception-of-human-rights/&screenshot=true&meta=false&embed=screenshot.url,N,,2025-09-19 11:59:34.478405

More than 20% of all DACA recipients reside in just two of those states: Texas (17%) and Florida (4%).
Mohyeddin and her colleagues surveyed 433 DACA recipients in 2024, before DACA recipients were eligible for the marketplace.
Eighty-one percent had health coverage, the vast majority through their employer or a union or professional association.
“The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general,” Mohyeddin said.","A new Trump administration rule bars immigrants living in the United States under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) from buying health insurance from Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

The change, announced in June, took effect at the beginning of this month. It reverses a policy change enacted by the Biden administration for last November’s annual enrollment period.

DACA, which President Barack Obama established in 2012, applies to certain immigrants who are here illegally but were brought to the U.S. as children. The program was enacted to protect them from deportation and allows them to work for renewable two-year periods. To be eligible, an immigrant must have come to the U.S. at age 15 or younger before June 15, 2007. DACA participants also must be high school graduates, high school students or veterans of the U.S. military.

The oldest are now in their early 40s, some with children of their own.

Even though there are some 525,000 active DACA recipients, only about 10,000 were getting their health insurance from the marketplaces before the policy change, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. However, critics of the new Trump administration rule say participation would have grown as more people became aware of their eligibility.

Under pressure, some immigrants are leaving American dreams behind

DACA recipients from 19 states were blocked from the marketplaces, though, because of pending litigation. More than 20% of all DACA recipients reside in just two of those states: Texas (17%) and Florida (4%).

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules, said DACA was an “abuse of executive authority” and should not have entitled some immigrants to benefits. The rule change simply restores the status quo, Vaughan said.

“It was kind of an experiment or an end run around our legal immigration system that was set up by the rules that were set up by Congress to try to offer an amnesty to this particular group,” Vaughan said. “Because it’s not a legal status, these individuals are not, under the law, eligible for certain public benefits, and one of them is subsidized health insurance.”

But critics of the change say it’s cruel to cancel health care coverage for people who were brought to the country as children.

“Health care is a fundamental human right all of us, no matter where we were born, how much money we have, what we look like, what language we speak, we should be able to access quality and affordable care when we need it,” said Isobel Mohyeddin, a policy associate at the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrants.

Mohyeddin and her colleagues surveyed 433 DACA recipients in 2024, before DACA recipients were eligible for the marketplace. Eighty-one percent had health coverage, the vast majority through their employer or a union or professional association. But nearly 20% lacked coverage, more than twice the national uninsured rate of 8%.

Mohyeddin said that many of the DACA recipients without coverage reported skipping recommended medical and dental appointments or declining to fill prescriptions, because they couldn’t afford it or were fearful of being targeted for their status.

“The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general,” Mohyeddin said.

While DACA recipients were only recently allowed to purchase coverage on the marketplace, it was a huge step toward better health outcomes for them, said Arline Cruz Escobar, director of health programs at Make the Road New York, a group that provides legal and social services to immigrants.

Most refugees and asylees will be denied food stamps under Trump’s new law

“We see a lot of mixed-status households, and so I think people are just very confused about what this means for them, and what it means for their families,” Cruz Escobar said. “We already know that the immigrant community doesn’t access enough preventive care and screenings and so, I can only imagine that we will see an increase in a lot of chronic conditions, or undiagnosed chronic conditions that could have been prevented.”

The impact of the new Trump administration rule on DACA recipients will vary, as some states offer other health care options to noncitizens.

States are going to have to decide whether they can afford to offer state-subsidized health coverage to DACA recipients and other immigrants who are no longer eligible for federal help, said Jessica Altman, executive director of California’s marketplace exchange, Covered California.

California has the most DACA recipients, at 147,440. Altman said more than 2,300 of them have purchased plans on the California marketplace and will lose their coverage. She said many DACA recipients in the state were not aware of their eligibility, and more would have enrolled if the Trump administration hadn’t made the policy change.

California provides state-funded health coverage to all income-eligible immigrants, regardless of their legal status. But Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a budget that scales back that coverage because of budgetary issues.

In light of federal changes and financial obligations on states, Altman said, California will have to make the same choices as other states about how or whether to help DACA recipients with their health care.

“The hard part is, to actually make coverage affordable for the populations that we’re talking about, you have to fund financial assistance at least somewhat comparable to what’s available on the federal marketplace,” Altman said. “So the state dollars are really where the rubber meets the road.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-9164056561758272795.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=2Ndl_F0m,N,,2025-09-19 11:59:38.415509

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Somalia on Thursday, a day after a resolution to formally reprimand the Minnesota Democrat and remove her from committee assignments failed in the House.
Appreciate them safeguarding first amendment protections and the usage of the censure,” Omar said on social media after the vote.
“Finally some sanity in the House.” Trump, who has gone after Omar’s Somali roots before, also hammered Somalia on Thursday.
Trump then accused Omar of marrying her brother to get U.S. citizenship.
“All of this, and Ilhan Omar tells us how to run America!","President Trump slammed Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Somalia on Thursday, a day after a resolution to formally reprimand the Minnesota Democrat and remove her from committee assignments failed in the House.

“I think she’s terrible. I think she should be impeached. I think she’s terrible,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday.

“So how are they doing? How’s your government? Do they have a president? Do they have a council? Do they have anything? Do they have police? I love these people,” Trump added. “They come from a place with nothing, nothing, no, anything, and then they tell us how to run our country.”

“If she got censured, that’s great, if she got impeached, that’s even better,” he added.

Trump’s remarks about Omar, who was born in Somalia before her family came to the U.S. in the 1990s, came after the House voted to table the resolution, brought by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), to rebuke the Minnesota lawmaker. Mace alleged Omar “smeared Charlie Kirk and implied he was to blame for his own murder” in retweeting a video on social media.

On Wednesday, the House voted 214-213 to table the resolution. Four GOP lawmakers joined the Democrats to defeat the resolution.

“Thank you to my colleagues for having my back and not furthering lies on the House floor. Appreciate them safeguarding first amendment protections and the usage of the censure,” Omar said on social media after the vote. “Finally some sanity in the House.”

Trump, who has gone after Omar’s Somali roots before, also hammered Somalia on Thursday.

“Ilhan Omar’s Country of Somalia is plagued by a lack of central Government control, persistent Poverty, Hunger, Resurgent Terrorism, Piracy, decades of Civil War, Corruption, and pervasive Violence,” the president wrote in a Thursday evening post on Truth Social.

Trump said that “70 percent of the population lives in extreme Poverty, and widespread Food Insecurity. Somalia is consistently ranked among the World’s Most Corrupt Countries, including Bribery, Embezzlement and a Dysfunctional Government.”

The Hill has reached out to Omar’s office for comment.

Trump then accused Omar of marrying her brother to get U.S. citizenship. Omar has long denied these accusations.

Other people who spoke with CNN noted the fraught history of alleged racial profiling by law enforcement in America — from stop-and-frisk policies in several major US cities to the government’s surveillance against mosques and Muslims shortly after the 9/11 attacks.
“It makes race itself, speaking Spanish, or looking Hispanic like a pretext for suspicion on anything now,” she said.
In one case, a citizen briefly detained by federal law enforcement agency said he was told he looked like someone the agents were looking for.
“So we’re all fearful of the worst, and that’s really what daily life is like here in Los Angeles.”","Cesar, a green card holder and student at Washington, DC’s Georgetown University, never used to think he needed to carry proof that he was allowed to be in the United States.

But that changed last week, when the Supreme Court cleared the way for a person’s ethnicity to be at least a partial factor behind immigration stops by law enforcement. “Now I have to carry it all the time,” he says.

“And that is very scary, because if I lose it, that’s a whole other process, fees, and consequences,” said Cesar, who spoke to CNN on the condition that only his first name be used.

Since the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term, immigration-advocacy groups have recommended that migrants, green-card holders and non-White US citizens carry their documents as an added protection against being errantly caught up in his immigration sweeps.

It was an arduous request for people like Cesar, who feared losing the links that proved they are legally in the United States, and the fees, long waits and possible persecution that could come with misplacing their papers.

The calculus is different in the wake of the September 8 Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to continue what critics describe as “roving” immigration patrols in California, immigrants and advocates say. It’s a decision they fear endorses racial profiling by proxy and enables federal agents to make indeterminate judgements about who they think may or may not belong in the country.

Other people who spoke with CNN noted the fraught history of alleged racial profiling by law enforcement in America — from stop-and-frisk policies in several major US cities to the government’s surveillance against mosques and Muslims shortly after the 9/11 attacks.

The ruling, Cesar said, “makes what we’ve already noticed true. It just put it on paper.”

‘A show-your-papers nation’

In its emergency ruling, the conservative-majority court rejected lower courts’ rulings which said parts of Trump’s immigration operations in Southern California — which in some cases involved armed and masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulling aside people who look Latino to ask if they are US citizens — violated Fourth Amendment rights.

Those rulings, now overturned, prohibited the government from detaining people to ask their status solely based on four factors: the race of the person being stopped; whether they spoke Spanish, or English with an accent; their presence at places frequented by immigrants; or their employment at jobs usually held by immigrants.

While that litigation only dealt with seven counties in Southern California, the court’s decision could be read as a green light for those types of immigration-related pre textual stops across the country — especially in cities like Chicago, DC and Boston, where the administration has directed a surge of immigration enforcement, and Memphis, where Trump says he will deploy the National Guard and law enforcement personnel from several federal agencies.

Immigration attorneys, immigrants living in the US legally and non-White US citizens now worry that innocuous activities that aren’t indicative of illegal behavior — speaking Spanish, working certain jobs or looking like someone from South or Central America — will be used as reasons for law enforcement to stop and question them.

“This is going to affect everyone, no matter whether they are an immigrant that’s documented or undocumented, or whether it’s somebody that’s a citizen,” said Jennifer Bade, a Boston-based immigration attorney. “I’m very, very concerned, because this effectively makes us a ‘show-your-papers’ nation where appearance and language is going to make everyone a suspect.”

“It just green-lit racial profiling,” she added.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, described the Supreme Court decision as a “a win for the safety of Californians and the rule of law.” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the agency, said law enforcement “will not be slowed down and will continue to arrest and remove the murderers, rapists, gang members, and other criminal illegal aliens.”

Taking extra precautions

Andrea, a Venezuelan woman living in Washington, DC, who works as a government contractor, said “anybody that reads a basic history book can see the danger of this decision.” She also asked that CNN only use her first name.

“It makes race itself, speaking Spanish, or looking Hispanic like a pretext for suspicion on anything now,” she said. “Today it’s being Hispanic and speaking Spanish—tomorrow, what other group are they going to demonize?”

She described taking extra precautions in Washington, a city that has seen a surge in federal law enforcement and National Guard members as part of Trump’s crime crackdown in the city. Recently walking down the National Mall with friends, Andrea said: “We made it a point not to speak Spanish.”

The Supreme Court did not provide any analysis explaining their decision to overturn the lower courts’ rulings. But in a 10-page concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that in cases where legal immigrants are stopped by law enforcement, “the questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U. S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.”

He also wrote: “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

In June, prior to the ramping up of immigration enforcement in several large American cities, CNN had already identified several cases of people being detained by ICE despite them describing themselves as American citizens. In one case, a citizen briefly detained by federal law enforcement agency said he was told he looked like someone the agents were looking for.

In another, a citizen said he was held against a fence by ICE agents and asked what hospital he was born in, despite him telling them three times he was an American citizen.

Some said they had been taking precautions for months, or since Trump took office, that now feel justified in light of the ruling.

Francisco Moreno, the executive director of the Los Angeles-based Council of Mexican Federations in North America and a naturalized citizen, said he has been carrying around his proof of US citizenship since wide-spread immigration raids began in that city in June.

“I’m a US citizen and I carry my citizenship card because I don’t know if they’re going to stop me at some point, ask me questions simply for being brown, for speaking Spanish, or because I’m also advocating for immigrants,” he said. “So we’re all fearful of the worst, and that’s really what daily life is like here in Los Angeles.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01-gettyimages-2224603707.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-19 06:57:07.197600

For more than six months, the Trump administration has been trying to deport Mahmoud Khalil. He's the former Columbia University grad student who ICE agents arrested back in March when the government started cracking down on pro-Palestinian student activists. An immigration judge in Louisiana has now ordered him deported on charges that he committed fraud on his green card application. Camille's (ph) - Khalil's lawyers are promising to fight this. His case highlights how aggressively the government is continuing to try to expel foreign-born students for their political activism. For the latest, I want to bring in NPR's Adrian Florido, and Adrian, tell me a little bit more about what exactly this judge in Louisiana ruled.

ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Well, Mary Louise, the judge is Jamee Comans, and she ordered Khalil deported either to Algeria, where he holds a passport, or to Syria, where he was born and where he grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp. This does not mean that Khalil will be immediately deported or even soon. There's still likely a long legal fight ahead. But the judge, in ordering him deported, relied on the government's accusation that Khalil purposely left information off of his green card application last year, specifically some work that he'd done with the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians and his involvement in a pro-Palestinian activist group at Colombia. His lawyers have long said that these claims are bogus.

KELLY: And what are they saying today? How are they responding to this deportation order?

FLORIDO: Well, in a statement, Khalil said that it was no surprise. He and his lawyers have always said that these fraud charges are a pretext and that they're really targeting him for his political activism, which they say is unconstitutional. Now, the Trump administration first arrested Khalil back in March, claiming that his pro-Palestinian activism was antisemitic and that he was a Hamas terrorist sympathizer - all claims that Khalil denies and that the government has never actually provided evidence for. Now, I spoke with Baher Azmy, one of his attorneys, today.

BAHER AZMY: They're making up charges to remove him because they disagree with his dissent from U.S. foreign policy.

FLORIDO: You might remember, Mary Louise, that Khalil spent more than three months in a detention center in Louisiana before his lawyers were able to get him released on bail in June.

KELLY: I do indeed remember. OK, so timing here, you said this could be tied up in courts for a while. How quickly might he be deported?

FLORIDO: Well, it's hard to say, assuming that he is ultimately ordered, you know, deported by a court...

KELLY: Right.

FLORIDO: ...Because his lawyers are promising a long legal fight. His case is actually playing out in two different court systems - in this immigration court, where the government has been moving aggressively to try to expel him and where it has succeeded in getting this order against him this week, but also in a New Jersey federal court, where he's challenging his deportation on claims that the government is retaliating for his activism and violating his right to free speech. The judge in that federal case issued an order months ago prohibiting the government from deporting Khalil while he considers those constitutional claims, and that could take a long time. In a statement to NPR, Tricia McLaughlin, spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, reiterated today the government's claims that Khalil advocated for violence and supported terrorists, and she said that he should not be in this country.

KELLY: And just briefly, Adrian, catch us up on some of the other cases. There have been quite a few other high-profile cases, pro-Palestinian student protesters detained for campus activism.

FLORIDO: Yeah, they're all in various stages of litigation. All of these students are fighting their deportations on free speech grounds. They've had a lot of success in federal courts so far, but there are big questions as the cases make their way through the federal court system. Will appeals courts ultimately protect their right to protest or allow the Trump administration to deport them?

KELLY: NPR's Adrian Florido - thanks, Adrian.

FLORIDO: Thanks, Mary Louise.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The city said it would issue its formal notice to ICE Thursday. It’s the result of an investigation conducted by the city’s permitting bureau that began in late July after the city received formal complaints.

For months, some community members have pressed Portland leaders to close the facility by revoking the land use agreement that has allowed ICE to operate since 2011 at 4310 S. Macadam Ave.

The government building, home to immigration court, the FBI‘s New York field office and other federal offices, has become a hotbed of arrests and detention amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Eleven officials were arrested inside the building while attempting to inspect holding rooms on the 10th floor that are the subject of ongoing litigation alleging squalid conditions and overcrowding, according to a coalition of politicians, advocates and faith leaders involved in the protest. They were given summonses and released. The building was later locked down because of a telephoned bomb threat, authorities said.

The officials had gone to the holding facility to see if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was complying with a preliminary injunction issued Wednesday that requires the agency to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats, among other remedies, the coalition said.

But federal agents barred them from entering the holding rooms and arrested them as news reporters and photographers documented the scene. The arrests happened as the officials were conducting a sit-in in the hallway, encircled around a sign showing a slash through the word “ICE.” Agents bound their hands with plastic ties, lined them up against a wall and paraded them down a hall.

In a statement, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin singled out the city’s comptroller, Brad Lander. She accused the Democrat of showing up “unannounced with agitators and media” and yelling that he wouldn't leave until detainees were released. Lander was previously arrested at the building in June after he linked arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain outside immigration court.

“Another day, another sanctuary politician pulling a stunt in attempt to get their 15 minutes of fame while endangering DHS personnel and detainees,” McLaughlin said, adding that “Lander’s obsession with attacking the brave men and women of law enforcement, physically and rhetorically, must stop NOW.""

Another arrested politician, state Sen. Jabari Brisport, said immigration officials used zip ties to lock the doors to the holding areas and put duct tape over cracks to prevent them from seeing inside.

“What I saw on the 10th floor today was both disgusting and cowardly,” the Brooklyn Democrat said. After the immigration officials were finished, “they laughed, and I heard them laugh about what they were doing, and they should absolutely be ashamed of themselves.”

Outside, police arrested dozens of people, including politicians, advocates and religious leaders, who were protesting in front of a garage entrance used by vans transporting immigrants to and from the detention facility.

Other officials who were detained included the city’s public advocate, Jumaane Williams; Democratic state Sen. Julia Salazar; and City Council Member Tiffany Caban.

“A federal judge has indicated that the federal law is not being followed — the conditions are cruel and inhumane, that ICE is not respecting their rights,” Lander told reporters after his release. “And no elected official or other oversight agency has been allowed in to see it.”

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan issued a preliminary injunction keeping in place requirements that the agency give detainees adequate space; thoroughly clean the cells three times a day; provide soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products; and make accommodations for confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

The injunction followed a temporary restraining order last month in the wake of a lawsuit that immigration and civil rights organizations filed on behalf of people held at the Manhattan facility. In court filings, detainees complained they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets.

According to three employees at GSA, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive internal operations and to avoid retribution, the agency has created an “ICE surge” team in recent weeks, referring to an effort to lease private offices to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency officers to establish long-term work space in the cities where they are operating.

Last week, the GSA’s Public Buildings Service posted a solicitation for “as-is, fully-finished and furnished office space in support of administrative operations for law enforcement” in 19 cities across the country. The listing estimates each lease would include workstations for 70 people and notes the “unique” quick period of one week to submit bids.

One of the GSA employees said ICE has urgently requested the agency find around 300 fully furnished properties with private office space to lease by this winter.

The push is happening just months after the informal White House advisory group, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, fired a large number of GSA employees and terminated a huge chunk of government leases, decisions that are now being reversed in many cases in order to accommodate government procurement needs. There’s no clear evidence those cuts saved significant amounts of taxpayer money.

It’s also happening alongside a government-wide effort to divert resources towards immigration enforcement, from federal leasing efforts to law enforcement expertise from other agencies like the FBI. Limited enforcement resources, including a lack of funding to bring on more people to conduct arrests and investigations and litigate cases, have been one of the biggest challenges to scaling up the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.

Congress this summer provided ICE with $75 billion to hire more officers, expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests and deportations. The agency, which started the year with about 20,000 people, is looking to hire more than 10,000 new officers by the end of the year. The agency is offering candidates large signing bonuses of tens of thousands of dollars in a streamlined hiring effort that immigration policy experts and other critics fear could compromise vetting standards.

The agency is also increasing its detention capacity and launching enforcement operations across the country aimed at increasing the number of people arrested and detained. The administration has promoted large-scale operations in cities like Boston and Chicago.

The most recently available immigration detention data publicly published by ICE shows that there are 58,000 people in detention. Immigrant rights advocates have warned that the rapid expansion of arrests and detention is leading to widespread concern over human rights and due process violations for immigrants.

Public polls have increasingly shown that American voters disapprove of how ICE is carrying out its operations, particularly in places like hospitals and other “protected areas.”

Meanwhile, GSA employees are finding themselves swept into the immigration crackdown.

“It’s been incredibly chaotic,” said one of the GSA employees familiar with the new “emergency” lease project.

In addition to finding new office space to lease for ICE, the agency has also requested that GSA identify existing federally owned or leased property that might be suitable for their use in a range of cities across the country. Those cities include Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, New York City, Denver, Chicago, Kansas City, Mo., Greensboro, N.C., and Fort Myers, Fla., according to a list shared with NPR. The list mentions that the properties would be used in enforcement and removal operations. In Boise, Idaho, ICE is looking to spend over a million dollars to expand an existing, leased office space, according to a permit application filed with the city uncovered in reporting by the Idaho Statesman.

The efforts are causing frustration among some GSA employees, who dealt with months of DOGE downsizing and reorganizing at the agency. Now, with around half the staff they had before the government restructuring efforts began, they’re being forced to renegotiate cancelled leases with landlords who are “increasing their rates substantially,” said one of the GSA employees.

“It’s hypocrisy at its finest,” said another GSA employee.

In a statement, a GSA spokesperson told NPR that GSA is “proud to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in fulfilling their mission to protect America. We are working closely with our agency partners to ensure they have the facilities that fit their workforce needs.”",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-thepublicsradio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2234329401-scaled.webp?fit=2560%2C1708&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-19 12:58:03.869981

In a July letter, New Jersey members requested the Pentagon stop plans to restructure a series of Army weapons sites, including Picatinny, a munitions site known for making weapons.
The Senate has not voted on its version of the military bill.
The report would include descriptions of military sites used for immigration detention; the number of people held at such sites and their demographic information; and records about aircraft the military has used for removal flights.
While the Pentagon this year reverses those changes, the House bill would block that reversal.","WASHINGTON — Congress inched ahead with a plan to halt a Trump administration proposal to change a weapons program at Picatinny Arsenal, a military base in Morris County, a move New Jersey lawmakers said would cost jobs and money.

An amendment Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) filed to block federal funding from being used to shift the Picatinny program until the Army submits a report about its proposal was included in the House version of the annual military policy bill.

But efforts by New Jersey senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, to counter the Trump administration’s efforts to use military sites to hold and then deport undocumented immigrants are likely to fall short. And Rep. Chris Smith (R-4th) tried, also unsuccessfully, to amend the bill by blocking offshore wind projects unless the military certified they did not interfere with radar.

For weeks, both chambers of Congress, the House and Senate, have been debating, altering and voting on the annual bill that sets broad U.S. military policy — an opportunity for members to tack on amendments on issues they care about to what is considered “must-pass” legislation.

The legislation in question contains no funding but lays out Pentagon operations.

House lawmakers voted 231-196 last week to pass their version of the bill.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) and New Jersey’s three Republicans — Reps. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), Chris Smith (R-4th) and Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th) — voted for it, while every Democrat but Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) voted against it.

A spokesman for Gottheimer did not respond to a request for comment about his vote for the bill, which has historically passed with comfortable bipartisan margins.

Sherrill, the Democratic candidate for governor, has missed multiple votes in recent months as she campaigns, though none have been on significant legislation.

The House voted down Smith’s amendment, 209 to 224, as the state delegation split along party lines, with Van Drew and Kean voting for it and Democrats voting no.

In a July letter, New Jersey members requested the Pentagon stop plans to restructure a series of Army weapons sites, including Picatinny, a munitions site known for making weapons.

“We write to you to express our grave concern over the Army’s proposed restructuring of its acquisition enterprise,” the letter said. “This would damage the Army’s ammunition acquisition efforts and would have a devastating impact on Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey where that effort is managed. There is no other DoD installation with the same uniquely experienced and qualified staff in arms and ammunition.”

The lawmakers continued: “Moving these missions to other installations would inevitably lead to reduced lethality and poorer weapons being delivered to our soldiers.”

Members sent the letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.

Along with Sherrill, Booker, Kim, Van Drew and Kean, Reps. Donald Norcross (D-1st), Herb Conaway (D-3rd), Josh Gottheimer (D-5th), Frank Pallone (D-6th), Rob Menendez (D-8th), Nellie Pou (D-9th), LaMonica McIver (D-10th) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12th) signed the letter.

The Army’s proposal places at risk as much as $1 billion and 1,000 jobs at Picatinny, according to Sherrill’s office.

The Senate has not voted on its version of the military bill.

Kim tried without success to attach an amendment to allow access to government-provided legal counsel for immigrants detained on military bases. He also offered an amendment to allow members of Congress to access immigrant detention sites on military facilities and a separate amendment to block the military from work “to engage in or support immigration enforcement.”

Booker offered an amendment to require a federal report about how “military readiness” has been affected by the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

The report would include descriptions of military sites used for immigration detention; the number of people held at such sites and their demographic information; and records about aircraft the military has used for removal flights.

The Republican-majority Senate accepted none of those amendments.

The administration this summer approved the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to use Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst to hold and deport undocumented immigrants, though neither base nor administration officials have confirmed immigration activities are happening on the base.

One measure slipped into the House version would thwart an administration decision to rename Army bases after Confederate leaders.

In 2020, Congress moved to rename nine Army bases in southern states — Alabama, George, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia — named after Confederates to honor women, racial minorities and other military leaders.

While the Pentagon this year reverses those changes, the House bill would block that reversal.

Hegseth has said that “DEI is dead” at the Pentagon, using the shorthand for “diversity, equity and inclusion.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2024/12/Picatinny-Arsenal-sign.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 00:56:21.024859

Here, Realtek’s success in converting the dismissals to “with prejudice” ensured that Future Link could not reassert the same claims.
This clarity benefits both patent owners and accused infringers by setting predictable standards for fee-shifting and sanctions in federal court.","The Federal Circuit’s recent decision in Future Link Systems, LLC v. Realtek Semiconductor Corporation offers important guidance on what it means to be a “prevailing party” and the standards for awarding attorney fees, costs, and sanctions in patent litigation. This ruling, which vacated in part, affirmed in part, and remanded the district court’s decisions, is particularly instructive when compared to other recent Federal Circuit cases addressing exceptionality and litigation misconduct.

Background

Future Link Systems, LLC filed two patent infringement suits against Realtek Semiconductor Corporation in the Western District of Texas, alleging Realtek’s integrated circuit products infringed U.S. Patent Nos. 8,099,614 and 7,685,439. The litigation involved electronic circuitry technology, a complex procedural history, including motions to dismiss, requests for sanctions, and discovery disputes.

Some of the conduct argued by Realtek to be egregious included Future Link’s agreement with third party MediaTek, Inc., where MediaTek would pay Future Link a lump sum amount if Future Link filed a lawsuit against Realtek. Notably, after Future Link voluntarily dismissed both cases, the district court converted those dismissals to dismissals with prejudice as a sanction for litigation misconduct by Future Link. However, the district court declined to find Realtek a prevailing party and, as a result, denied Realtek’s motion for attorneys’ fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 in one case and fees and costs under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 in both cases.

Prevailing Party Status: The Gateway to Fees and Costs

A central issue on appeal was whether Realtek qualified as a “prevailing party” entitled to attorney fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 and costs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure § 54(d)(1). According to Supreme Court precedent:

[t]he touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.

[and]

[w]hen a plaintiff secures an enforceable judgment on the merits… that plaintiff is the prevailing party because he has received a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.

To be clear though, securing an enforceable judgment on the merits is not a predicate for achieving prevailing party status. Rather, Supreme Court precedent emphasizes that a party prevails when it successfully rebuffs the opposing party’s claims, regardless of whether the case is resolved on the merits or through procedural means.In this aspect, the court cited cases such as CRST Van Expedited, Inc. v. EEOC and B.E. Technology, L.L.C. v. Facebook, Inc., reinforcing that a defendant can prevail even if the dismissal is for reasons such as mootness or lack of standing. Here, Realtek’s success in converting the dismissals to “with prejudice” ensured that Future Link could not reassert the same claims. On this basis, the Federal Circuit found that the district court’s conversion of the voluntary dismissals to dismissals with prejudice (even if not intending to do so) constituted a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship between the parties making Realtek a prevailing party.

While Realtek was deemed a prevailing party by the appellate panel, the Federal Circuit remanded the case for the district court to determine whether the case was “exceptional” under § 285, which is a prerequisite for awarding attorney fees. On remand, the district court will surely consider other Federal Circuit decisions, such as OneSubsea, IP v. FMC Technologies, Inc. and United Cannabis Corp. v. Pure Hemp Collective Inc., when deciding whether the case was exceptional under § 285. Federal Circuit precedent makes it clear that aggressive litigation tactics or hard-fought disputes between competitors do not, by themselves, make a case exceptional. Instead, exceptionality requires litigation misconduct or a case that “stands out” due to its substantive weakness or unreasonable conduct. Indeed, the court must find something more — such as objectively baseless claims or clear litigation misconduct — to warrant exceptionality under § 285.

Sanctionable Conduct: Not Enough Bad Behavior Here

The Federal Circuit also addressed Realtek’s requests for Rule 11 sanctions, which was denied by the district court. The panel found that Future Link’s pre-filing investigation met the minimum requirements for a reasonable inquiry with a reminder that “testing of an accused product is not necessarily a required part of an adequate pre-filing investigation.” Because Future Link performed a comparison of the claims against the accused products prior to filing suit, the panel held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Future Link’s infringement claims were sufficiently factually supported. Moreover, the panel explained that “[i]f a reasonably clear legal justification can be shown for the filing of the paper in question, no improper purpose can be found and sanctions are inappropriate.”

Key Takeaways for Patent Litigants

Prevailing Party Status – A defendant can be a prevailing party entitled to fees and costs even if the case is dismissed with prejudice for reasons other than a merits determination.

Exceptionality Standard – Attorney fees under § 285 require more than just aggressive litigation; there must be clear evidence of misconduct or a case that is objectively baseless.

Sanctions – Rule 11 sanctions are reserved for egregious conduct, not for mere litigation losses or strategic decisions.

The Future Link decision reinforces the Federal Circuit’s consistent approach: While courts will not hesitate to sanction true litigation misconduct, they will not penalize parties simply for vigorously defending their interests in complex patent disputes. This clarity benefits both patent owners and accused infringers by setting predictable standards for fee-shifting and sanctions in federal court.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.13676_5142.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 09:57:08.488380

KELLY: NPR's Adrian Florido - thanks, Adrian.","MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

For more than six months, the Trump administration has been trying to deport Mahmoud Khalil. He's the former Columbia University grad student who ICE agents arrested back in March when the government started cracking down on pro-Palestinian student activists. An immigration judge in Louisiana has now ordered him deported on charges that he committed fraud on his green card application. Camille's (ph) - Khalil's lawyers are promising to fight this. His case highlights how aggressively the government is continuing to try to expel foreign-born students for their political activism. For the latest, I want to bring in NPR's Adrian Florido, and Adrian, tell me a little bit more about what exactly this judge in Louisiana ruled.

ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Well, Mary Louise, the judge is Jamee Comans, and she ordered Khalil deported either to Algeria, where he holds a passport, or to Syria, where he was born and where he grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp. This does not mean that Khalil will be immediately deported or even soon. There's still likely a long legal fight ahead. But the judge, in ordering him deported, relied on the government's accusation that Khalil purposely left information off of his green card application last year, specifically some work that he'd done with the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians and his involvement in a pro-Palestinian activist group at Colombia. His lawyers have long said that these claims are bogus.

KELLY: And what are they saying today? How are they responding to this deportation order?

FLORIDO: Well, in a statement, Khalil said that it was no surprise. He and his lawyers have always said that these fraud charges are a pretext and that they're really targeting him for his political activism, which they say is unconstitutional. Now, the Trump administration first arrested Khalil back in March, claiming that his pro-Palestinian activism was antisemitic and that he was a Hamas terrorist sympathizer - all claims that Khalil denies and that the government has never actually provided evidence for. Now, I spoke with Baher Azmy, one of his attorneys, today.

BAHER AZMY: They're making up charges to remove him because they disagree with his dissent from U.S. foreign policy.

FLORIDO: You might remember, Mary Louise, that Khalil spent more than three months in a detention center in Louisiana before his lawyers were able to get him released on bail in June.

KELLY: I do indeed remember. OK, so timing here, you said this could be tied up in courts for a while. How quickly might he be deported?

FLORIDO: Well, it's hard to say, assuming that he is ultimately ordered, you know, deported by a court...

KELLY: Right.

FLORIDO: ...Because his lawyers are promising a long legal fight. His case is actually playing out in two different court systems - in this immigration court, where the government has been moving aggressively to try to expel him and where it has succeeded in getting this order against him this week, but also in a New Jersey federal court, where he's challenging his deportation on claims that the government is retaliating for his activism and violating his right to free speech. The judge in that federal case issued an order months ago prohibiting the government from deporting Khalil while he considers those constitutional claims, and that could take a long time. In a statement to NPR, Tricia McLaughlin, spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, reiterated today the government's claims that Khalil advocated for violence and supported terrorists, and she said that he should not be in this country.

KELLY: And just briefly, Adrian, catch us up on some of the other cases. There have been quite a few other high-profile cases, pro-Palestinian student protesters detained for campus activism.

FLORIDO: Yeah, they're all in various stages of litigation. All of these students are fighting their deportations on free speech grounds. They've had a lot of success in federal courts so far, but there are big questions as the cases make their way through the federal court system. Will appeals courts ultimately protect their right to protest or allow the Trump administration to deport them?

KELLY: NPR's Adrian Florido - thanks, Adrian.

FLORIDO: Thanks, Mary Louise.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Welcome back to the Culture & Compliance Chronicles, the podcast that gives you new perspectives on legal, compliance and regulatory challenges faced by organizations and individuals worldwide. The clue is in the title—culture is at the heart of everything. It’s the endlessly shifting patterns that govern our environment and behaviors. The magic is in amplifying certain patterns and dampening others. Let’s see if we can pique your curiosity, get you to challenge some of your perceptions and give you space to think differently about some of your own challenges. I’m Nitish Upadhyaya, and I’m joined by Amanda Raad and Richard Bistrong. Hello, Amanda and Richard.

Amanda Raad: Hello. Good to see you.

Richard Bistrong: Nitish and Amanda, it’s great to join you today. That was such an interesting episode with Guido Palazzo talking about his co-authored book, The Dark Pattern, where he took us through what he called “corporate hellscapes” but was nice enough to return us to the light pattern. Nitish, with that said, who do we have joining us today?

Nitish Upadhyaya: Delighted to welcome Archana Kotecha, CEO of The Remedy Project.

Archana Kotecha: Thanks for having me on this podcast, Nitish.

[1:15] Getting to Know Archana

Nitish Upadhyaya: I’ve had the absolute pleasure of working with you on a really fascinating project mapping safety of women in industry and agriculture roles across Asia. I’ve been so inspired by the passion for what you do and your desire to push boundaries, and so, I couldn’t wait to have you on this podcast, and I’m really glad we’re here. Just recently, we were talking about a research method that you’d read about, eliciting honest opinions to sensitive questions, and these sorts of conversations where you’re continually pushing the boundaries and searching for new ways of doing things, I’m hoping that will come across to our listeners in a very different cultural context to what they might be used to. Now, we always help our audience get to know you a little bit better before we dive into the detail and your experience. Let’s do a rapid-fire round—give us three things we should know about you.

Archana Kotecha: I’m originally from Mauritius. I am an avid weightlifter and a fitness freak. And I’m the proud mum of two teenagers.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Very snappy. Now, what’s one thing you’re curious about?

Archana Kotecha: I think one thing I’m really curious about is whether worker-driven social responsibility can really take off in Asia. There are examples of it in different parts of the world, but the context and the rule of law, the setup is very different—Asia has its own particularities. And I’ve always been very curious to know whether empowered and supported workers within the right context could also make it in Asia.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Let’s see if we can touch on that during the course of this recording. What’s the last thing that surprised you?

Archana Kotecha: One of the things that always amazes me is how our children get taught the curriculum at school: very carefully and very diligently by their teachers and by school. But actually, they don’t really get taught many skills that are so vital for later in life. For me, one of the key skills that they need to be taught is resilience. My daughter surprised me by demonstrating really good resilience in the face of rejection recently. And I think this is something that is surprising in this day and age, particularly where everybody is instantly gratified or feels instantly entitled to get what they want. So, that was a pleasant surprise.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Let’s get to understand your career path, because all of the points you talked about around social responsibility, working across it in Asia, what brought you to where you are now?

Archana Kotecha: I started out my career as a corporate lawyer. I qualified as a barrister in the U.K., lived the high life, did M&A work, worked the hours, had the training, and had the benefit of working in Big Law for a number of years. I was still looking for something, I didn’t quite find it, and was very grateful for everything I had learned in Big Law, and decided to start looking elsewhere, and very accidentally stumbled into an opportunity at the UNHCR doing refugee work. That’s the first time I found lawyering with purpose and for a purpose—I could use my skills, and knowledge, and expertise to touch the lives of people. And that was almost over 18 years ago. Subsequent to doing refugee work, I had a chance encounter with a victim of human trafficking in London, and that changed the course of my career. I decided from that point onward, I wanted to focus on human trafficking and forced labor. I came to Asia about 17 years ago and had an opportunity to be part of an NGO startup and to work on counter-trafficking across the region. So, very quickly, I became a go-to person for governments in the region, prosecutors, judges, worker groups, CSOs in relation to forced labor and human trafficking.

Five years ago, I decided that I wanted to take my work to another level. One of the issues of being with an NGO platform is your ability to reach and interact with businesses can be very limited. There are inherent trust issues and various gaps between these two stakeholders. So, I set up on my own—I set up The Remedy Project. The idea was really to try and reach as many workers in global supply chains by working with businesses and essentially to leave the world in a better place than I found it. At The Remedy Project, we basically do human rights risk assessments, human rights impact assessments. We create tools for businesses so that they can better understand their footprint on human rights issues of their stakeholders. And we pay particular attention to migrant workers, to women, and to children. For us, it is really important to be partnering and co-creating with businesses while maintaining that human rights lens. We are not about designing and giving it to the business, but rather, working with business, understanding their challenges, the opportunities to scale, and creating real pathways and inroads into the way business understands risk, responds to it, and prevents it rather than constantly reacting to risk.

[6:30] Tools for Assessing Culture

Amanda Raad: I love that, especially the point about partnering with the business, I think, is such an important point. Digging in a little bit, how do you go about thinking about assessing culture at a manufacturing site, for example? How do you approach that?

Archana Kotecha: We do a lot of investigations or human rights impact assessments where we go to visit farms, we visit factories and various sites. I think one of the things that I always insist on—and electronics companies get very nervous about allowing this—is a visit to the production floor, because I want to be able to experience what the temperature is like on the floor. I want to be able to see how workers are interacting with each other. Do they look at ease? Do they look nervous? Do they look stressed? And just ask them, “Are you able to go to the bathroom when you need to? Are there enough bathrooms on the facilities? What sort of facilities are there for workers? Is there a canteen where people can sit and eat?” Another thing that’s quite interesting is knowing whether the canteen provides food only for the workers while management have a separate canteen. That’s also telling in some cases, and you can see the differences in the quality of both. Where are workers sitting to eat? If it’s under corrugated sheets of iron that are attracting sun at midday and it’s uncomfortably hot, that’s also very telling.

We talk to workers. We do focus group discussions. We ask them about how they feel about their workplace. We do one-on-one interviews as well. Before we go in, we also look at audit reports. We look at what sort of grievances workers might have reported, so we have a fairly good idea of where to direct some of our inquiries and questions. We look at how signage is for workers within the factory. Are grievance mechanisms well advertised? Would people know where to go? Is it in a language that they would understand? And the management interviews also give us a real sense of: What is management’s vision for the workforce?” How do they feel about their workforce? Are they contributors to the factory who are recognized as contributors, or are they just there doing their job, and they’re supposed to be there because we pay them to be there”?

Worker welfare committees are also very telling. How clean the production floor is. And more recently, we’ve been very, very attentive to the needs of women in particular. You have women in their 40s, in their 50s who might be going through menopause, who experience hot flashes, and when the factory floor is hot, it is so difficult for these women to stand there—let’s say they’re at the ironing station the whole day—and do that job. So, all those are really important things, and they give you a real sense of how workers feel about their workplace, what the culture is, how they’re treated. Do they have freedom of association? Are they able to air grievances? If not, why not? Do they feel threatened? We also look at how workers interact with each other. In many large factories, it’s very common to see a large population of internal migrant workers, but also, maybe foreign migrant workers. You might also have a lot of contract workers who are basically there for two months, three months, six months depending on production needs, and full-time workers. They both have different entitlements and different packages. It’s also important to see how they interact with each other. How do they feel about each other? How do they feel about management? And do they feel valued in the workplace? All of those are really interesting.

One of the projects we’ve been working on with Ropes & Gray, and with Nitish and his team in particular, are these surveys called She Voices. The idea is really to have women share what they feel about their workplace. And it’s so important to have that, because actually in many places, women become silent and passive participants in the workplace. They’re not seen, and they’re not heard. That’s also something we look out for. What sort of channels do you have to really tap into the female workforce and understand their needs?

[10:50] Engaging with Stakeholders

Amanda Raad: It’s so important that you started there, right at the beginning, about how important it is to actually get on the site, see for yourself, and start to ask questions directly. How much of a struggle is it to actually get the access that you feel like you need? Practically speaking, how does that go? Are there tools that you’ve used to be able to get people to be more willing to engage in this process in a productive manner?

Archana Kotecha: We don’t get access unless a brand gets involved and says to the supplier, “You need to allow them on field because there is a nonconformance, and we want them to investigate this independently.” But I’ve found, even when suppliers are very reluctant, the success of my mission relies on how collaborative they’re going to be when I get there. So, the first thing I do is to spend time with the supplier management so that they understand fully that I’m not here to find problems—I’m here to find a solution, and we’re going to find it together. I’ll sit, and I’ll spend the time it takes with them first to get them on board and on-site for them to understand fully, “What is my role? What am I trying to do here? And what is the overall objective?” Then, we’ll move from there. And when we end the process, we will do a closing meeting. At the closing meeting, I will always remember to thank them for their time, but also, to share with them some of our thinking, and that will include both positives and perhaps areas for growth. It’s so important to be constructive and not finger-pointing.

Now, there have been occasions where suppliers have simply said, especially when the brand doesn’t have much leverage, “We’re not going to give you access.” In those cases, I’ve requested whether I can have a call with the supplier, and part of that call is making them feel at ease with who this third party is, what the role of the third party is, and why this visit is necessary. And usually we will draw on regulations, we will draw on reputational risk, we will draw on the importance for their other brands that might be also sourcing from them and how they could be a lot more competitive in the market if they allowed us to go ahead with the visit. It really is massaging at both ends and really trying to be as constructive and bringing people together as possible. So, again, it’s that idea of co-owning the process.

[13:20] Diving into The Supply Chain

Richard Bistrong: When you’re working with your business partners, how deep do you go into the levels of the supply chain? I was thinking about your sharing, “How clean is the factory? How clean is the manufacturing operation?” Would you then go and say, “We’d like to talk to the people that are responsible for maintenance of this factory and to see what those conditions are like,” or, “The people that you’ve subcontracted to operate your canteen, we want to also look at those working conditions”? So, it seems to be this common debate and frequent debate in our compliance field, how far down the supply chain levels should we go? What would be your specific advice, let’s say with your business partners and for those elsewhere, how should they look at this issue?

Archana Kotecha: I think in relation to this, if I’m doing a site visit, I will go into the canteen, and I will see what’s happening there. I will go talk to the maintenance guy. I’ll talk to the electrician. I’ll speak to the security guard at the gate. I’ll speak to the workers on the floor. Because at the end of the day, if anything happens to any one of these people, it is a reputational, a legal, and a financial issue for the brand—it doesn’t matter what function they’re in. So, for me, you can’t do a good job from a risk assessment perspective unless you’re really looking at everything that’s on-site. It gets a lot more complicated when you start going to Tier N, which is raw materials sourcing, etc. That’s another layer of complexity, and that’s where we often lose business partners, because right now, the way regulations are, there’s a lot of legal uncertainty, there’s a lot of blocks. Unless they are clearly aware of something going on in the raw materials supply chain, it’s very rare for them to want to go beyond and to look there, particularly as there’s often multiple layers in between the supplier and the raw materials sourcing process. If it’s electronics, there may be layers of smelters, brokers, etc., in between, and the distance created means that there is almost that, I’ll say “safety” within air quotes, between the supplier, the brand, and those parties where there are higher risks.

However, we’ve seen in the case of many high-profile American businesses, for example, that that does not stop lawsuits being filed in relation to risks that arise in the raw materials supply chain. But if I was advising a client, I would definitely say to them, “If you’re subcontracting your security services, your janitorial services, or your canteen services, you need to have a good understanding of what those contracts look like and whether there might be any risks sitting there.” So, those are the documents that we request to see even before we get to the site. And in an ideal world, we get access to those documents. In a not-so-ideal world, we may get access to those documents but only when we are on-site, and that’s okay, too.

Richard Bistrong: Just out of curiosity, when you take on a business partner in your work—and I’m thinking about some of the collective action NGOs that are out there—is there a least common denominator where if your business partner isn’t willing to commit to certain things, that you’re not going to take them on because it could just be window dressing as opposed to looking for real change?

Archana Kotecha: This is our fifth year as a social enterprise, and we have a select group of private sector clients, large clients, who have been repeat clients from the time we set up. The reason why I love working with them is I know them really well. I know what they can do. I know where their limitations are. And I understand the dynamics between legal and compliance, procurement, and the sustainability team. So, it makes for a much more productive relationship. And I know those people are committed to doing right. We don’t always get everything through that we want to, but we’re able to have difficult conversations. We’re able to take and implement some recommendations while others remain work in progress, but such is life. It doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t work with them because they can’t do everything we want at the same time. I think I learned from my NGO days that wanting the absolute position is very often not achievable and not possible, but that still means we can continue to make those steps toward progress. The way I choose to see it, and I think clients particularly appreciate this, is this is a journey that we take together. There are milestones along the journey, but we remain less attached to the outcomes so that the process itself is rich, and that in itself is worth so much.

I have had situations where clients have asked me, for example, to change my findings in relation to a report. They say, “Our legal team doesn’t like the use of this word. Our legal team doesn’t like that. They don’t like this. They don’t like that.” Now, there’s an extent to which I’m willing to accommodate language and semantics as long as we don’t alter the core meaning and the recommendations that are attached to it. I think the beauty of being independent and the beauty of not being driven by profit, but rather by purpose, is that I’m quite happy to step away and walk away from something where I have to compromise the vision of the organization or its values.

[19:10] Bringing Stakeholders Together

Nitish Upadhyaya: You spend so much time bringing lots of these stakeholders together. You talked about the brands, you talked about the suppliers, and you talked about the people on the ground as well, and, of course, you’re an accredited mediator as well. Do you have any lessons for our audience on how to facilitate conversations to bring about alignment or understanding of these different perspectives to actually allow people to then move forward?

Archana Kotecha: I think, for me, a lot of this is leading with commonalities in agenda. I think we do tend to be very hyper-focused on differences, on divergences, on perspectives and positions, but actually, if we leave those aside, there’s always commonalities in agenda. For me, finding that is really important to understanding what makes them tick. What would they be happy to see? Actually, I find the other party is not so dissimilar—they’re just looking at it from a different perspective. So, I think first leading with commonalities in the agenda. The second thing is demonstrating good listening skills, understanding, and having an open mindset to receive. It might be something you’re not really prepared or happy to receive, but actually being willing to receive it, to think about it, and to process it. You don’t have to react to it—you can respond to it. I think that’s really important.

There are different cultures. For example, child labor. In an Asian community, it’s very acceptable for a family that has a farm to have the child be helping out at the farm. The perception from different parts of the world where children do not work but they go to school, they stay in school, and they come home, and they relax—they have a different life. There isn’t some one perspective that is right and one that is wrong—they’re different perspectives that work for different communities in different parts of the world coming from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and therefore, that nuance is really important. I think we forget very often, in a bid to get what we want, that we’re all human—we’re very different. The human condition is complex, and it’s sometimes just really difficult to arrive at one strand that represents everybody or one thing that everybody has in common. But actually, that thing is there—it’s just nuanced, and it looks and feels different in different parts of the world. I think being open to that is critical, and finding opportunities to align rather than constantly focusing on where there are gaps—and where there are gaps, being constructive about it. “I hear you. I hear that this is an issue in your country. Here’s how we think about this issue. How do you feel about that?” We don’t have conversations like that very often, where you’re putting something on the table, you’re asking people how they feel about it. It’s about finding solutions together. I do find that where you try to impose a view, a solution, or a perspective, you are less likely to evolve to a solution that is acceptable and something that can be implemented and be successful.

[22:30] Using Pilots

Amanda Raad: The finding the solutions together, I think even if you try that with the very best intent, sometimes it’s hard to know what the right solution is. So, you’re hearing a bunch of different perspectives, and you try to come together with what the right proposed change is, or how to try to move along a particular remediation, for example. Have you found any use in pilots or smaller interventions? And how does that work for you in the context of bringing people along together?

Archana Kotecha: Being a female founder in a sector where there isn’t ever any money available or resources for self-development, I’m an avid devourer of podcasts and anything that helps me do some self-development as a leader and as a female leader. One of the things I learned was that if you’re building a tool or you’re building a product, quit procrastinating over building the perfect thing. Have something that you can pilot, and then just keep refining it till it gets really good. So, pilots, for me, are an absolutely critical way of learning and tweaking so that the product can be created to fit the needs and the purpose of the people it’s designed to serve rather than being something that I think is the right thing to serve people. I just get something that is good enough out so that we’re constantly playing and learning.

For example, She Voices, we’ve got four pilots that have gotten underway. There have been lots of lessons learned, including how some questions are very difficult to translate. Women find it very hard, depending on levels of literacy, around imagining or eliciting the right responses or a response that we hope will help us get an insight into how they’re thinking, because the image that they’re looking at is too abstract, and they respond better to concrete images and the image of an object, for example. We would never know that unless we went out and we tried, we tested, we spoke to women, we spoke to those who are working with these women, those who are administering the pilots, etc. And I think, for me, a pilot also offers the opportunity to eliminate contextual externalities that can actually hamper launching a product at scale. So, there are so many particularities, and the particularities of each pilot allow you to really learn so that if you are creating a product that you want to be deployed at scale, you can really eliminate those externalities that might stop deployment from being effective. So, it really is a critical, critical part of not just creating products but also co-owning and co-creating products.

Amanda Raad: I love it so much because I think it also plays into normalizing or making it easier to welcome feedback, because you almost go in from the very beginning not looking for perfection—which I’m guilty of often, and you can get paralyzed—but seeking out that input to know what the next right thing is, so taking a step and making it easier to get more feedback, and to take away a negative attribution to whatever that feedback might be but see it really as a positive.

[26:00] Key Takeaways

Nitish Upadhyaya: Lots of useful wisdom and tips, I think, coming out of this from talking about pilots to bringing stakeholders together, and talking about how you even go about assessing something as amorphous as culture in a manufacturing site. Richard, what’s your key takeaway from this?

Richard Bistrong: I think I have an appreciation that name-and-shame doesn’t spark social change or corporate change. And the whole concept—and we’ve seen this before, Archana—of being a good listener and to try to understand cultural nuances, see where there can be alignment so that you’re better able to then say, “Let’s also take a look at the gaps.” It’s not just about everything that’s wrong. And all of that ends up, as you shared, to how we find solutions. So, being a good listener, understanding where those gaps are to find those solutions, I think, is just great global counsel, and thank you for being so open in sharing it.

Nitish Upadhyaya: And what about you, Amanda?

Amanda Raad: You had me hooked at the very beginning when you talked about your journey and lawyering with purpose. I’ve been thinking a lot about the purpose and the meaning in all that we do, and I think there’s so much. I think all of us can really dig into that, because if we do our jobs the best we can, we are really interacting with people on a daily basis on issues that are just hugely important in the world. The approach that you talked about from start to finish really highlights how if we’re aware and sensitive to what our purpose and our goals are, and work with each other, and are open to change, there’s a lot we can accomplish together. So, I loved it—it was a really great discussion. Thank you very much.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Archana, if you had one key area that listeners should take away or that you wish for them to explore further, what would it be?

Archana Kotecha: Thanks, Nitish. I think over the years, I learned that my skill was the ability to do storytelling. I think as human beings, we fundamentally respond so well to stories. When we are babies, parents tell you stories. Sometimes you can’t go to sleep without stories. It gives you a sense of security, a sense of enchantment, being taken to another world. It’s no different in the work that we do. A lot of what I do is to take stories from the ground and translate those stories and those needs into businesses so that I can get them to respond to those stories by creating new narratives and new stories. A lot of this is about human connection, and I find that sometimes we’re so busy doing our role, our jobs in our little silos, collecting data, we forget why we’re collecting data. Data has to be actionable, it has to tell a story, and it has to be responsive to the needs of the business, but also, of those featuring in those stories. So, for me, over the years, it has been, “How can I perfect that skill so I can really bring the plight, the experiences of workers in a manner that is the most constructive so as to get decision-makers to move the needle?” For me, that’s what it’s about—that’s what life is about. It’s about connecting, it’s about connecting for the better, and it’s about connecting for change.

Nitish Upadhyaya: What an inspirational way to finish the episode. Thank you so much for sharing your story and for encouraging everyone else to think about theirs, but also, the stories that their colleagues, the stakeholders, and others have on the ground. So, I’m looking forward to feedback, seeing what people do off the back of this episode in their own stories, in their compliance functions as they think about risk, and maybe giving a voice to folks that don’t often get to be heard. Thank you so much, Archana, for all your ideas and thoughts, and we’re really looking forward to hearing more from you in the coming months.

Archana Kotecha: Absolutely. And thank you for the partnership with Ropes & Gray. I’m so grateful for this, and I’m excited to see where we go with this partnership.

This debate matters because the EU deportation law would affect not only migrants but also the communities they live in.","19 Sep 2025

Over 300 civil society groups from Europe and beyond have called on the European Parliament and EU governments to reject a proposed deportation law. They said that it would expand detention, surveillance, and forced removals, violating basic rights.

The European Commission introduced the proposal in March 2025, calling it a “Return Regulation” to replace the current Return Directive.

Critics warned that the draft law would set up offshore deportation centers, allow detention for up to two years, weaken appeal rights, and send people to countries where they have no connections.

The groups argued that the plan would lock in harsh measures that put migrants, asylum seekers, and racialized communities at greater risk of abuse.

A broad coalition opposing the plan

Over 300 groups signed the statement opposing the law.

The signatories include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Médecins Sans Frontières, the European Network Against Racism, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, and many refugee support organizations across EU countries.

They urged the European Commission to withdraw the proposal and called on the European Parliament and the Council of the EU to reject it as it stands.

They described the draft as “driven by detention, deportation, [externalization], and punishment,” warning that it would trap more people in legal uncertainty and unsafe conditions.

Offshore deportations and “return hubs”

One of the most disputed parts of the proposal is the option to deport people to countries outside the EU where they have no ties.

Articles 4 and 17 would allow transfers to third countries that people may have only passed through briefly or never entered at all.

The plan also calls for “return hubs” outside EU territory, which campaigners said would serve as detention centers. They argued that this would lead to automatic detention, forced returns, and denial of legal protections, raising questions about compliance with international law and whether rights could be properly monitored.

The groups compared the plan to offshore asylum models used by Australia and the United Kingdom, which critics say led to high costs, rights abuses, and diplomatic conflicts.

Expansion of surveillance and policing

Article 6 of the proposal requires EU states to set up systems to identify people living irregularly on their territory.

Civil society groups warned this would lead to racial profiling, discriminatory policing, and immigration raids that spread fear in migrant communities. They also cautioned that these measures could stop undocumented people from seeking healthcare, reporting abuse, or asking for protection.

The proposal further allows sensitive personal data, including health records, to be shared with EU and third-country authorities, raising concerns about violations of data protection standards.

Prolonged detention, impact on children

The proposal would raise the maximum detention period from 18 to 24 months and expand the reasons people can be detained. Under the draft rules, simply lacking documents or being homeless could be enough.

Children could also be detained, despite international agreements stating that immigration detention is never in a child’s best interests.

Campaigners warned the law would make detention routine, permit indefinite confinement of people labeled as “security risks,” and fuel a “detention industry” by creating business opportunities for private contractors.

Weakened safeguards, appeal rights

The plan also weakens protections for people who cannot be deported because they are stateless or face other barriers.

It would require deportation orders to be issued at the same time as any decision ending legal stay, even before options like humanitarian permits are considered.

The proposal further limits appeal rights. It removes the automatic suspensive effect of appeals, meaning people could be expelled while waiting for a court ruling.

It also shortens the deadline to file appeals to 14 days, raising concerns that many would lose their chance to seek an effective remedy.

Punitive measures, sanctions

Articles 10, 12, 13, 16, 22, and 29 of the proposal set new obligations for people facing deportation. These include providing identity documents, submitting to searches, and cooperating with third countries to obtain travel papers.

Failure to comply could lead to penalties such as fines, re-entry bans, denial of benefits or work permits, and limits on voluntary departure.

Civil society groups warned these measures would unfairly punish vulnerable people and make forced removals the default, weakening the idea of voluntary return.

Expanded digital surveillance

The draft law allows the use of intrusive technologies like GPS tracking and mobile phone surveillance as supposed “alternatives to detention.”

Rights groups and the European Data Protection Supervisor warned these tools amount to detention in practice and create lucrative markets for surveillance companies.

The proposal also introduces a new “European Return Order” to be stored in the Schengen Information System and shared across law enforcement. Past abuses of EU police databases have raised concerns about privacy, discrimination, and misuse.

Lack of consultation, impact assessment

Statewatch reported that the European Commission released the proposal without a human rights impact assessment or formal consultations with social partners.

This goes against the EU’s own “Better Regulation” guidelines, which require such reviews when laws have major social effects.

Without an assessment, the proposal has not been properly checked against EU obligations on fundamental rights, including the ban on torture and degrading treatment, children’s rights, and protections against discrimination.

Alternatives to forced returns

The coalition of organizations argued that the Commission’s focus on deportation ignores alternatives that could reduce irregular migration while respecting rights.

They called for more residence permits based on humanitarian needs, family ties, or statelessness, as well as regular migration pathways that let people contribute socially and economically to EU societies.

They stressed that deportation should not be the only option for people whose asylum claims are rejected, urging the EU to invest instead in policies built on safety, protection, and inclusion.

Uncertainty for travelers, migrants

For short-term visitors, the new deportation proposal combined with upcoming border systems could mean stricter checks and less room for mistakes.

Starting in October 2025, the Entry/Exit System (EES) will replace passport stamps with digital records, collecting biometric and facial data from non-EU nationals.

By late 2026, the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) will also require travelers from 59 visa-exempt countries to get prior authorization before entering the Schengen Area.

If the deportation regulation passes, data from EES and ETIAS could be tied directly to expanded removal powers. Civil society groups warned this could increase deportations, even for minor overstays or paperwork delays.

Long-term residents and migrants may also face greater insecurity, since deportation orders would become automatic once residence permits expire, with no regard for humanitarian needs or family ties.

Together, these systems point to tighter monitoring and enforcement of mobility within the EU, with harsher consequences for irregularities.

EU officials present EES and ETIAS as tools for efficiency and security, but rights groups argue that, paired with the deportation law, they risk creating a climate of surveillance and fear for both visitors and migrants.

A choice that shapes Europe’s future

More than 300 groups have spoken out against the EU deportation law, warning that it would expand detention, increase surveillance, and weaken basic rights.

The question now is whether Europe will handle migration by enforcing punishment or by protecting people. Lawmakers must decide if they will build a system that deepens fear or one that supports dignity and safety.

This debate matters because the EU deportation law would affect not only migrants but also the communities they live in. The decision will show what values Europe wants to uphold in the years ahead.",https://etias.com/assets/uploads/imagery/blog/european-union-flags-outside-modern-building.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 23:57:36.556690

After new rules were introduced requiring the majority of temporary visa holders—including H-2A temporary farm workers—to attend in-person interviews, the State Department said Thursday that it is lifting the requirement for that group.

""With heightened scrutiny of applicants, particularly students, social media vetting, and the regular security screenings already in place, officers are facing a steep increase in time spent per case, meaning their time is more limited and the number of cases they can process is lower,"" Matt Mauntel-Medici, an immigration attorney with Brown Winick in Iowa and a former U.S. consular officer, told Newsweek.

""This affects employers of all kinds, from financial services firms to manufacturers, but the agricultural sector is more hindered than others. All delays in processing create opportunity costs and can hinder operations.""

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has left many farm owners concerned about maintaining staffing, with a large proportion being temporary migrant workers. Trump has voiced his support for the industry, but enforcement raids have continued, leaving farms struggling to recruit and keep those without long-term security.

What To Know

Early this month, the Trump administration introduced new visa interview requirements, essentially removing waivers that had been in place for many temporary immigrants already in the U.S. or with existing visas living abroad.

Many first-time applicants, such as those under 14 and some elderly people, had been able to get a waiver, but that was dropped on September 2. The new rules allowed only certain government and diplomatic officials, and some visitor visa holders, to skip an in-person interview when renewing their documents.

On Thursday, another category was added to the list of those who are eligible for an interview waiver—H-2A visa holders, who are temporary farm workers. That means workers may be granted a waiver but are not guaranteed one.

The visa category is temporary, and workers generally must renew every year. Adding in-person interview requirements would likely lead to difficulties for those with little means of traveling, and the farming industry has called for a modernized approach to ensure continued workforce levels.

There are still caps on H-2A terms, with immigrants allowed a maximum of three years in the U.S., then must return home for at least 60 days before applying again.

Whether the change by the State Department leads to other adjustments to the H-2A program remains to be seen. The U.S. Department of Agriculture previously told Newsweek that it was working to streamline and strengthen the process, but official announcements on program changes have yet to be made.

What People Are Saying

Matt Mauntel-Medici told Newsweek: ""Here in Iowa our corn and soybean yields help to not only provide nutrition for people and livestock but also bring in critical dollars for our rural communities. If farmers are left with their yields unpicked, that directly translates to dollars lost for them, their families, their communities, states and country. That is hugely important across the country and especially here in Iowa.

""The reversal of the interview waiver restrictions on H-2A agricultural workers will speed up their processing, allowing these experienced workers to renew their visas and return to the U.S. to help our farmers in such a critical and time sensitive period. I am glad to see the administration putting farmers first and hope that they expand this to other industries.""

Ben Tindall, executive director of Save Family Farming, in a statement shared with Newsweek: ""The heavily-regulated program, while costly and cumbersome, provides a lifeline for American farmers to continue producing food here, rather than watching American consumers eat even more food imported from foreign countries.

""Save Family Farming applauds the federal government's efforts to keep this program as efficient as possible, even while maintaining border security, safeguarding domestic workers, and protecting guest workers.""

The State Department, in its September 18 update: ""Consular officers may still require in-person interviews on a case-by-case basis for any reason. Applicants should check embassy and consulate websites for more detailed information about visa application requirements and procedures, and to learn more about the embassy or consulate's operating status and services.""

A USDA spokesperson previously told Newsweek: ""President Trump is putting America First and that includes strengthening the farm workforce and streamlining H-2A and H-2B visa programs. Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world.""

The updated guidance will go into effect October 1.

The precedent-setting UNEF operation was authorized in connection with the Uniting for Peace resolution via the first emergency special session.
The Potential for other General Assembly Recommendations and Determinations to Shift the Situation Mandating a peace operation is of course not the only recourse for the General Assembly.","Today marks the expiration of the General Assembly’s one-year deadline for Israel to comply with its legal obligations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), those outlined in the International Court of Justice’s July 2024 advisory opinion on the “Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem” (“Legal Consequences” opinion). As that deadline has approached, experts, commentators and even Member States themselves have increasingly offered proposals for what more the General Assembly could do to spur action on the increasingly dire situation in the Gaza Strip – from providing armed protection to humanitarian aid workers or naval relief convoys, to recommending or even directly mandating a peacekeeping or stabilization operation.

On July 29, 2025, the global body that appraises hunger levels officially declared famine in Gaza. After the Israeli Knesset passed legislation in October 2024 that effectively halted the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the main body providing basic services and humanitarian aid to the territory for decades, the UN Secretary-General appealed to Member States and the General Assembly. Since the renewed Israeli blockade on aid in March 2025, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been one of the few outlets bringing food, medicine and other aid into the territory. But its background, setup and means of operating are controversial, and aid distribution points have repeatedly come under attack. UN experts estimate that 2000 Palestinians have been killed at distribution sites for humanitarian aid, the vast majority (70%) in areas served and protected by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. As a result, attention has focused not only on getting a much higher volume of relief into Gaza, but also on finding ways to ensure protection for those humanitarian convoys and distribution sites.

The Security Council has considered the situation in Gaza regularly over the last two years, and in June 2024 passed resolution 2735 endorsing a ceasefire proposal and setting out several phases for its implementation. However, since then, even the most stripped down of resolutions have not proved veto-proof. In June 2025, the US vetoed an extremely limited draft resolution that would have simply reinforced resolution 2735, and demanded an immediate ceasefire and the lifting of all restrictions on humanitarian aid. All total since October 2023, there have been no less than eight vetoes cast on resolutions related to the situation in Gaza: seven vetoed by the US (S/2025/353, June 2025; S/2024/835, November 2024; S/2024/173, February 2024; Amendment to S/PV.9520, December 2023; S/2023/970, December 2023; S/2023/792, October 2023; S/2023/773, 18 October 2023); and one vetoed by the Russian Federation and China (S/2024/239, March 2024). The only resolutions that have passed did so by virtue of an abstention by either the US, the Russian Federation or both (these were: S/RES/2712, November 2023; S/RES/2720, December 2023; S/RES/2728, March 2024; S/RES/2735, June 2024).

Given the deadlock on this issue in the Security Council, policymakers and international experts have increasingly looked to other decision-making bodies for a response. In June the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, proposed that the General Assembly might authorize armed peacekeepers to accompany and protect humanitarian aid convoys, including (but not limited to) the situation in Gaza. On Sept. 5, a group of 27 UN high-level UN experts called on the General Assembly to convene an emergency meeting and facilitate humanitarian aid by recommending a peace operation, demanding the opening of all crossings, and to “request the authorization of UN-led international humanitarian convoys” to supervise humanitarian aid flows. Then last week, the General Assembly endorsed the concluding recommendations from a July 2025 high-level conference on Palestine and a two-state solution. The endorsed final outcome document of that conference included proposals to deploy a temporary UN “stabilization mission” to Gaza to monitor implementation of a prior ceasefire agreement (negotiated in January 2025) and any future peace agreement. The proposal was for a Security Council-authorized stabilization mission, however, given the standoff in the Council, the General Assembly may be the more likely body to take such proposals forward.

With operations in Gaza now approaching their second year, and no end in sight for the humanitarian crisis, could the UN General Assembly provide the muscle to support humanitarian or peacekeeping intervention? The proposals for it to do so raise a number of questions about the legal remit of the General Assembly, as well as of any practical or procedural limitations. Can the General Assembly authorize (armed) peacekeepers and aid convoys? Under what UN Charter provisions or other legal authority? What other measures might the General Assembly take to create more pressure for humanitarian relief or Member State action on this?

In the spirit of full-disclosure, I co-authored the 2024 Digital Handbook on the General Assembly’s peace and security practice, resources from which are cited throughout this article in parentheticals and hyperlinked text.

Can the General Assembly Authorize Peace Operations, including Armed Peacekeepers?

The General Assembly has mandated peace operations throughout its history, from the first armed UN peacekeeping force in 1956, the UN Emergency Force (UNEF), in response to the Suez Crisis, to the first UN peace operation to administer a territory, the UN Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA) in 1962 in West New Guinea (now Indonesia). While not all have included armed peacekeepers (as UNEF and UNTEA did), past General Assembly-mandated peace operations have undertaken the range functions that might be required to take forward the various proposals for humanitarian relief or ceasefire monitoring operations in Gaza. Past General Assembly-mandated peace operations have monitored ceasefires and overseen withdrawal of forces (UNEF), taken up policing, rule of law, and stabilization tasks (UNTEA, UNMIH), facilitated mediation and regional good offices (UNSMA, UNSCOB), monitored human rights and international humanitarian law (IHL) violations (MICAH, UNSMA, MINUGUA), and facilitated and coordinated humanitarian aid and support to refugees and those displaced (UNSMA). Although not extensive, General Assembly-mandated peace operations have also incorporated maritime operations and functions (notably UNEF), which might be necessary to carry out some of the proposals regarding Gaza for protecting (naval) humanitarian aid convoys, unblocking access, or directly carrying provisions by sea.

Peace operations can also have something of a mixed model, with the General Assembly authorizing the overall mission, but that mission later (when political conditions were more favorable) incorporating armed peacekeepers mandated by the Security Council. This happened with General Assembly-authorized operations in Guatemala and in Haiti. The General Assembly has also mandated missions jointly with regional organizations, for example one with the Organizations of American States in Haiti in 1993. This is an important but under-explored facet, given growing suggestions that perhaps given Security Council deadlock and budget cuts, the future of peacekeeping will be one in which missions are primarily led by regional organizations, rather than by the UN (but with Security Council and General Assembly political and financial support). The most recent example of a jointly authorized peace operation was the General Assembly’s authorization of a joint Special Envoy position for Syria in 2011 and 2012, jointly mandated with the League of Arab States. Notably, it was linked to a League of Arab States monitoring mission, which General Assembly resolutions also lent support to (A/RES/66/176; A/RES/66/253) after several Security Council vetoes.

This sort of mixed model and interoperability with regional organizations could be particularly relevant for some of the proposals for maritime relief or protection operations in relation to Gaza. Given that the UN does not have a standing navy, where UN peace operations have included maritime components, or where these have been authorized by the Security Council alongside other peace operations, they have often been provided by regional organizations or coalitions of multi-national Member States operating under color of this broader authority (for example, with EU and US-led multinational maritime missions around Yemen’s maritime borders). Thus it might be more likely that we would see a General Assembly-authorized peace operation that included naval functions if it was done in conjunction with a regional organization or some other already identified multinational coalition.

Some of the measures proposed for General Assembly intervention would not require a full peace operation, but simply an operational body capable of facilitating aid, taking preparatory steps toward a ceasefire or the monitoring of it, or taking on other conflict management tasks. The General Assembly also has the capacity to authorize other operational bodies short of a full peace operation, including those involved in coordinating or supporting humanitarian aid delivery. The longest running example of this is the agency at the center of the humanitarian and political storm in Gaza, UNRWA, which was established by General Assembly resolution 302 (IV) in December 1949. The size of UNRWA and length of its operations illustrates the power of the General Assembly to authorize and maintain quite substantial operational bodies.

These sorts of operational bodies can also be useful in bridging gaps when the Security Council is deadlocked. In the past, when Security Council missions lapsed, or when there was not yet sufficient support to authorize a new one, operational bodies mandated by the General Assembly have filled the gaps by taking up immediate monitoring or good offices tasks or engaging in the preparatory work that would lay the groundwork for future monitoring missions or operations. One example of this was a UN office in Afghanistan that picked up the tasks of a Security Council-mandated peace operations that lapsed in 1990, and was designed to lay the groundwork for future operations. It also included military advisors, but not armed peacekeepers.

There is a similar General Assembly origin story behind the other main UN office involved in Israel-Palestine issues outside of UNRWA, the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO), which started as a General Assembly-appointed coordination position to boost good offices after the Oslo Accords. In the current context, some have suggested expanding UNSCO’s mandate to take on additional humanitarian, operational, or ceasefire support tasks. These proposals for expanding its mandate might also face blockages in the Security Council. Here again, the history of General Assembly engagement with peace operations is instructive: it has not only created peace operations, but also expanded the tasks and mandate of those created by the Security Council, as in Lebanon in 1958 and the Congo in 1960.

What is the Legal Basis for the General Assembly to Authorize a Peace Operation, and What are the Limitations? Is the Uniting for Peace Resolution Necessary?

The legal authority for the General Assembly to mandate these peacekeeping and operational bodies stems from its overall remit under the UN Charter to pass recommendations related to the “maintenance of international peace and security” and the peaceful resolution of disputes (Articles 10, 11, and 14 of the UN Charter), as well as its Article 22 power to create “subsidiary organs” or bodies. The peace operations bodies thus have the technical status of “subsidiary organs” to the General Assembly.

The General Assembly’s legal authority to do this was affirmed in the International Court of Justice’s 1961 advisory opinion on Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter) (which had been requested by the General Assembly in resolution 1731(XVI)). The opinion hinged on whether the General Assembly had the legal authority to mandate UNEF and to extend another peace operation in the Congo, or if these sorts of powers only resided with the Security Council; if the General Assembly had overstepped its powers under the Charter then the costs associated would not be valid “expenses of the Organisation.”

The ICJ’s opinion on this question offered what still stands as the most decisive articulation of the balance of powers between the Security Council and the General Assembly, with specific application to the question of authorizing peace operations. It offered that responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security conferred on the Security Council by Article 24 of the UN Charter was “‘primary,’ not exclusive,” and that “the Charter makes it abundantly clear that the General Assembly is also to be concerned with international peace and security” (Certain Expenses case, p. 163). It emphasized that while only the Security Council has mandatory, enforcement authority, this does not mean that General Assembly powers are “merely hortatory” but that its recommendations and decisions can “have dispositive force and effect” and could constitute taking or enabling “action” (Certain Expenses case, p. 163). As examples of General Assembly decisions that could result in “action,” the Court pointed both to the General Assembly’s budgetary authorities and to its Article 22 power to create subsidiary organs (Certain Expenses case, pp. 163, 165).

However, the Court did introduce one important legal limitation. Because the General Assembly does not have the mandatory, coercive power of the Security Council, peace operations or other subsidiary bodies mandated by the General Assembly can only deploy with the consent of the country involved. This has been interpreted as applying not only to the particular structure of peace operations but also to other bodies or individuals that might deploy on Member States’ territories to carry out their General Assembly mandate. For example, the General Assembly has also provided the authority for mediators or envoys undertaking good offices and diplomatic initiatives, or fact-finding bodies or investigators. Where they were not able to obtain consent (for example, to enter Hungary and Syria), these individuals or fact-finding bodies have had to perform their roles remotely. The same would undoubtedly apply to armed peacekeepers or protection services not embedded in a particular peace operation or “subsidiary body” structure, if they did not first obtain consent. The particular legal challenges of consent in the case of Gazan territory are explored further below.

How Does the General Assembly Usually Authorize a Peace Operation and is the Uniting for Peace Resolution Necessary?

When UN experts recommended a list of measures for the General Assembly in early September, at the top of the list was for it to: “Call on Member states to act under ‘uniting for peace’ in line with General Assembly resolution 377(V) and recommend a peace operation.” Other commentators have gone even further, framing the Uniting for Peace resolution as an under-utilized exception or loophole by which the General Assembly could step in to “mandate a UN protection force” where the Security Council will not. Neither view is exactly on point: the Uniting for Peace resolution is not necessary for the General Assembly to take up most of the proposals for it to take action on Gaza, but nor is it sufficient to cure all the legal issues that would prevent the most forceful of them.

The Uniting for Peace resolution (adopted in resolution 377(V)) is a special procedure created in 1950 in response to Security Council deadlock over the Korean War. It created a procedure by which the General Assembly can consider a matter immediately through an emergency special session where there has been a veto (or arguably threat of veto) in the Security Council in relation to a threat to peace or act of aggression. It is not automatic: it does not come into play whenever there is a veto. Either 9 members of the Security Council or the majority of the General Assembly have to vote to activate the Uniting for Peace resolution, and they have only done so 11 times. Where an emergency special session is called in relation to the Uniting for Peace resolution, it does not necessarily mean that the General Assembly will then pass a resolution, or even if they do, that they will meaningfully take up the provisions that triggered a veto.

Most importantly, the Uniting for Peace resolution does not create or unlock any special powers for the General Assembly, other than those already granted it under the UN Charter. It does not grant the General Assembly powers to do what the Security Council might have done had there been no veto (i.e. to issue a mandatory resolution). On the other hand, this also means that the General Assembly does not need to invoke the “Uniting for Peace” resolution ((A/RES/377A(V)) for it to authorize a peace operation.

As a matter of practice, General Assembly decisions adopted during Uniting for Peace-linked emergency special sessions have been the basis for mandating or extending the mandate of peace operations, including the two missions at issue in the Certain Expenses case (UNEF and ONUC) as well as the extension of a border monitoring force in Lebanon in 1958. But there have been as many instances of the General Assembly providing the mandate or other support to peace operations or related operational bodies outside of these emergency special sessions.

While the Uniting for Peace resolution doesn’t lend any additional powers, it does give political expediency and momentum, which can be helpful in getting over the collective action problem and inertia that can be the main block to getting new initiatives and resolutions through the General Assembly. As a result, considering some of these proposals in a reconvened 10th emergency special session (first convened in connection with the Uniting for Peace resolution in 1997) would be the path of least resistance. As noted, to initiate an emergency special session requires that there first be a veto on a situation representing a threat to peace, and then a vote of 9 members of the Security Council or a majority of the General Assembly that the conditions of the Uniting for Peace resolution have been met. However, where the General Assembly has left an existing or prior emergency special session open, any Member State can request to the President of the General Assembly that it be reconvened at any time. This has happened repeatedly with the 10th emergency special session since it was first initiated in 1997. It was reconvened three times in the 79th session alone (the 2024-2025 period), directly in relation to the situation in Gaza – twice directly following vetoes in the Security Council but also in response to another matter for which there was not an immediate, precursor veto, responding to the ICJ’s July 2024 “Legal Consequences” opinion. The emergency special session remains ongoing and can be reconvened at any time, upon the request of Member States.

A last procedural point concerns the authorizing language: where the General Assembly has mandated peace operations or operational bodies in the past, how has it framed this in its resolutions? The UN experts’ proposal was that the General Assembly “recommend a peace operation.” Where the General Assembly has mandated a peace operation in the past, it has not “recommended” a peace operation but has simply “decided to establish” a mission, decided to “authorize the deployment” of the mission, or “requested” the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps to set up the mission, or for the Secretary-General to “carry out the tasks entrusted” to him/her (where the mission scope is set out in another agreement or legal document). The General Assembly could of course recommend that the Security Council set up a peace operation (as was proposed by Member States recently), but among its many recommendations to the Security Council over the years (especially following vetoes), the General Assembly has not typically recommended that the Council establish a peace operation. In any case, given the number of vetoes on the Gaza situation, such a recommendation would likely not be taken up.

Would General Assembly-Authorized peacekeepers have the Necessary Level of Consent, Legally and Practically?

Because the General Assembly does not have mandatory or coercive powers, any peacekeepers, civilian missions, or operational bodies authorized by the General Assembly can only deploy to the territory with the consent of the State in question. As a matter of principle and standing practice, Security Council-supported peace operations also rely on the consent of the host State, but the Security Council’s Chapter VII authority at least allows for the scope for mandatory or coercive authority.

It is important to re-emphasize that a resolution being passed in conjunction with the Uniting for Peace resolution (through an emergency special session) does nothing to alter this fundamental consent requirement. The precedent-setting UNEF operation was authorized in connection with the Uniting for Peace resolution via the first emergency special session. And yet there were elaborate negotiations with the government of Egypt before the force was authorized, and again throughout its planning and deployment. Further, the ICJ noted the consent of Egypt in their analysis of the situation’s legality, and Egypt’s consent was a pivotal part of their conclusion that this was within the bounds of the General Assembly’s powers, as it meant that this action did not then constitute mandatory enforcement powers (Certain Expenses case, p. 170-171).

This means that even if the General Assembly authorized a “stabilization force,” monitoring mission, or a peacekeeping force to accompany relief convoys, it would need consent for those forces to enter the territory of Gaza. It seems unlikely given the restrictions on UNRWA and on other emergency aid over the last two years, that Israel would provide this consent. However, there is some legal ambiguity over whose consent would be required, and there are those who would argue that Israel is not in a position to withhold or offer its consent, or alternatively, to prevent delivery of humanitarian aid or the presence of UN agencies. The ICJ’s July 2024 “Legal Consequences” opinion offers some grounding for these arguments, but does not entirely settle the question. A matter currently under consideration by the ICJ as to Israel’s legal obligations with regard to provision of humanitarian and development assistance in Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) may flesh out this issue, depending on how the ICJ chooses to interpret the question. The opinion was requested by the General Assembly in December 2024, by resolution 79/232.

One legal theory for why Israel’s consent is not necessary would be that although Israel has “unlawfully” (in the words of the ICJ) occupied Gaza, this does not give it sovereignty over the territory, and thus the consent cannot come from Israel. In its 2024 “Legal Consequences” case, the ICJ offered detailed historical context on the status of the OPT, stretching back to the General Assembly Partition Plan proposed in resolution 181 (II) in 1948 (which proposed separate Israeli and Palestinian States), up to the 2024 resolution ES-10/23 determining that the State of Palestine is qualified for membership (paras. 51-71). The opinion also emphasized the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force and the fundamental rights of self-determination of the Palestinian people at multiple points. The Court concluded “that Israel is not entitled to sovereignty over or to exercise sovereign powers in any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory on account of its occupation” (para. 254). An argument could therefore be made that given that Israel is not the sovereign power, it is not for Israel to withhold or grant consent for peace operations with respect to the OPT, including Gaza, but that this authority resides with Palestinian authorities.

A second argument would engage not with this question of sovereignty but with Israel’s obligations as an occupying power. Under the Geneva Conventions and international law, the occupying power has the obligation to administer the territory for the benefit of the population, to ensure that basic needs of the population are met, and to ensure to the fullest extent possible that food and medical resources are available and adequate. The General Assembly’s request for an advisory opinion in resolution 79/232 appeared to reference this obligation, asking the Court to consider: “What are the obligations of Israel, as an occupying Power and as a member of the United Nations… to ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival of the Palestinian civilian population as well as of basic services and humanitarian and development assistance, for the benefit of the Palestinian civilian population” (para. 10). This question is less pertinent to the issue of consent for a UN peace operation or operational body, but instead tests Israel’s scope to deny or obstruct the delivery of basic services and external delivery of humanitarian aid where the needs of the population in territories it occupies is not met. If the Court decided that Israel could not bar external assistance in such situations, then the General Assembly might choose to enable humanitarian responses further by determining that the basic food, medical and other humanitarian needs were not met (the General Assembly’s scope to exercise such a “quasi-judicial” function is discussed further below).

A third argument advanced by some is that restricting UNRWA’s operations violates the 1946 General Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. While a slightly different legal issue, given that UNRWA is also a General Assembly-mandated “subsidiary organ” (an issue that few contest), the conclusions on this argument have direct bearing on what is required for authorizing (or not interfering with) General Assembly-authorized peace operations. Among its provisions the Convention on Privileges and Immunities protects UN property and assets as “inviolable,” free from search and seizure, as well as interference by administrative, judicial, or legislative action. A statement on behalf of the Secretary-General at ICJ hearings in April 2025 noted that violations of the privileges and immunities of UN personnel had occurred, and also noted the restrictions implicit in the October 2024 law passed by the Israeli Knesset as well as others (see also this letter by the Secretary-General on restrictions on UNRWA). Nonetheless, while the 1946 Convention protects the inviolability of UN personnel and property where they are lawfully authorized and have a legal basis to be there, it may not reach to the underlying consent issue. The ICJ was certainly aware of the 1946 Convention on Privileges and Immunities when it published its Certain Expenses opinion in 1962, and nonetheless insisted on consent for any General Assembly subsidiary body. This position would seem to suggest that there must first be a legal justification to have a General Assembly-mandated subsidiary body on the territory (and that given the General Assembly’s lack of coercive power, this hinges on consent); once the UN unit or body is legally there, certain rules and obligations are then implicated, including the inviolability protections of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities.

In its resolution 79/232 referral request to the ICJ, the General Assembly noted the Convention on Privileges and Immunities in the preamble and in some of the operative paragraphs (with respect to safety of UN personnel), but it did not reference the Convention in the direct question put before the ICJ. While no doubt a deliberate choice on the part of the Member States drafting the resolution, the ICJ could still decide to take up the issue given other references in the requesting resolution.

Regardless of whether any of these three legal theories were seen to prevail, any General Assembly-authorized forces or mission would undoubtedly face the practical challenge of lack of consent. Entry via Egypt or by sea without Israel’s consent raises an equally significant number of legal, political, and logistical challenges, full discussion of which is beyond the scope of this article.

Empty Promises or Legally Determinative Words? The Potential for other General Assembly Recommendations and Determinations to Shift the Situation

Mandating a peace operation is of course not the only recourse for the General Assembly. The other key demands by the UN experts were for the General Assembly to “[d]emand the opening of all the crossings to unrestricted humanitarian access under direct UN oversight,” demand the immediate suspension of all “failed or dangerous” mechanisms (presumably the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation), call on Member States to “deploy emergency navies carrying humanitarian aid,” request the “authorisation of UN-led international humanitarian convoys with full UN authority to coordinate and supervise all crossings into Gaza,” and demand “immediate, permanent ceasefire and the release of arbitrarily detained Palestinians and Israelis alike.”

Many of these reflect the regular content of General Assembly recommendations, and would be seen as fully within the scope of the General Assembly’s powers to recommend. Indeed, the last of their six recommendations, regarding a ceasefire and release of those arbitrarily detained, have already been taken up in two resolutions passed in the last session, in resolutions ES-10-26 and ES-10/27. However, as noted above, the General Assembly does not have mandatory or coercive power, even when acting in conjunction with the Uniting for Peace resolution. The General Assembly can certainly “demand” that border crossings be opened, or that UN aid convoys be authorized and allowed permission to enter, but this does not mean that they will be.

However, there is one other way that General Assembly resolutions – even if declarative or proscriptive in nature – might potentially alter the status or legal interpretation of the situation, in ways that might lend additional enforcement pressure. Scholars have identified a certain “quasi-judicial” role of the General Assembly, wherein the General Assembly’s determination of the facts surrounding a given situations can then influence subsequent judicial or legal proceedings (such as those before the ICJ or the International Criminal Court) or the way that other Member States interpret the legal obligations and respond accordingly. One example was the General Assembly’s 1967 declaration that South Africa’s claim to govern South West Africa (now Namibia) was terminated (A/RES/2145(XXI)), which effectively made it so. Henceforth, both the General Assembly and the Security Council referred to South Africa’s governance as an “illegal” ( see, e.g., A/RES/2372(XXII), S/RES/264). In a subsequent ICJ advisory opinion on “the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia,”, the Court found that the Assembly had the power to make such a determination.

Other examples raised by scholars include ICJ reliance on the General Assembly’s determination of the existence of “mass killings” or other atrocities in its finding that atrocity crimes had been committed (see, e.g., Barber, p. 33). In a similar vein, General Assembly determinations that the basic needs of the population were not met, and that the obligations of the occupying power had not been fulfilled, could buttress subsequent judicial findings about the obligation to admit external international assistance. Scholar Rebecca Barber has offered another theory for how this “quasi-judicial” or status-determining role could be used to overcome legal obstacles to providing humanitarian aid without host State consent. She argues that where there is overwhelming humanitarian need and a lack of host State consent, the General Assembly could determine a “state of necessity” with no other alternative but to provide humanitarian assistance given the exigence of the situation. On this rationale, the countermeasure of necessity would preclude the wrongfulness of the un-authorized humanitarian assistance.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1843518641.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 01:56:50.197924

It’s a busy time for the caucus, which is positioning itself to combat President Trump both on his immigration policies and other issues they say affect the quality of life for Latinos.

Garay, 31, describes the group as raising the voices of Latinos “from south Bronx to South Texas.”

“We’re going to continue to express how there is strength in our diversity, how we don’t just represent over 62 million Americans,” Garay said, pointing to estimates of the Hispanic population in the U.S., “but a growing pillar of democracy — how we cannot achieve economic well-being in America without Latinos. National security, infrastructure — we are so woven into the fabric of America.”

“The CHC moving forward is going to continue to emphasize that, but also defend those very values, because right now, there seems to be a sense of erasure of our community.”

Garay said she learned a lot about how to operate in Congress from her first boss and neighborhood representative, Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.).

“I think it really set the tone for what to expect here, and, most importantly, how to assert dominance in spaces where you know that not only does your academic and career experience matter, but your lived experience is an asset,” Garay said.

For Garay, that lived experience has included the struggles of a working-class Nuyorican family in developing Brooklyn, when a buyer of their apartment building raised the rent, forcing her family to relocate.

She later put herself through college while working an overnight shift at Gap, getting off work only to head to class, and getting through the day with the occasional nap at the library.

Garay said those experiences motivate her now as the caucus fights back against Trump’s effort to limit Medicaid and food stamps, programs she said were the difference during her childhood from her parents choosing between paying rent and putting food on the table.

The officials — including the city’s fiscal watchdog and state lawmakers — were among 77 people detained during protests at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. The government building, home to immigration court, the FBI‘s New York field office and other federal offices, has become a hotbed of arrests and detention amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Eleven officials were arrested inside the building while attempting to inspect holding rooms on the 10th floor that are the subject of ongoing litigation alleging squalid conditions and overcrowding, according to a coalition of politicians, advocates and faith leaders involved in the protest. They were given summonses and released. The building was later locked down because of a telephoned bomb threat, authorities said.

The officials had gone to the holding facility to see if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was complying with a preliminary injunction issued Wednesday that requires the agency to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats, among other remedies, the coalition said.

But federal agents barred them from entering the holding rooms and arrested them as news reporters and photographers documented the scene. The arrests happened as the officials were conducting a sit-in in the hallway, encircled around a sign showing a slash through the word “ICE.” Agents bound their hands with plastic ties, lined them up against a wall and paraded them down a hall.

In a statement, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin singled out the city’s comptroller, Brad Lander. She accused the Democrat of showing up “unannounced with agitators and media” and yelling that he wouldn’t leave until detainees were released. Lander was previously arrested at the building in June after he linked arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain outside immigration court.

“Another day, another sanctuary politician pulling a stunt in attempt to get their 15 minutes of fame while endangering DHS personnel and detainees,” McLaughlin said, adding that “Lander’s obsession with attacking the brave men and women of law enforcement, physically and rhetorically, must stop NOW.”

Another arrested politician, state Sen. Jabari Brisport, said immigration officials used zip ties to lock the doors to the holding areas and put duct tape over cracks to prevent them from seeing inside.

“What I saw on the 10th floor today was both disgusting and cowardly,” the Brooklyn Democrat said. After the immigration officials were finished, “they laughed, and I heard them laugh about what they were doing, and they should absolutely be ashamed of themselves.”

Outside, police arrested dozens of people, including politicians, advocates and religious leaders, who were protesting in front of a garage entrance used by vans transporting immigrants to and from the detention facility.

Other officials who were detained included the city’s public advocate, Jumaane Williams; Democratic state Sen. Julia Salazar; and City Council Member Tiffany Caban.

“A federal judge has indicated that the federal law is not being followed — the conditions are cruel and inhumane, that ICE is not respecting their rights,” Lander told reporters after his release. “And no elected official or other oversight agency has been allowed in to see it.”

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan issued a preliminary injunction keeping in place requirements that the agency give detainees adequate space; thoroughly clean the cells three times a day; provide soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products; and make accommodations for confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

The injunction followed a temporary restraining order last month in the wake of a lawsuit that immigration and civil rights organizations filed on behalf of people held at the Manhattan facility. In court filings, detainees complained they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets.

“What the United States is saying is that the United States does not have the power to tell Ghana what to do.” Thank you for your patience while we verify access.","Lawyers for 11 West African migrants sent by the United States to Ghana this month have filed a complaint against the Ghanaian authorities, saying they are being unlawfully detained, held in a secret location against their will and deprived of their rights.

Fourteen people were taken from their cells in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in the middle of the night on Sept. 5 and put on a military cargo plane to Ghana, with some claiming they were placed in straitjackets, according to legal filings. Three of the migrants have since been sent back to their home countries, and 11 remain in Ghana.

Ghana’s foreign minister, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, has said that the West African country took the migrants in on humanitarian grounds, in a spirit of pan-African solidarity.

But the court filing says that they were forced to go to Ghana “under the instruction or connivance of foreign and local actors” — meaning the United States. It also says they are being guarded by military personnel without having been formally charged and without access to local lawyers.

While defending the deportations this month, Justice Department lawyers did not dispute that Ghana sending the migrants to their home countries would violate their court-ordered protections. The lawyers instead argued that once a migrant had been removed from the United States and was in foreign custody, the issue was out of their hands.

“The United States is not saying that this is OK,” Elianis N. Pérez, a Justice Department lawyer, said during a hearing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “What the United States is saying is that the United States does not have the power to tell Ghana what to do.”

This is the first of dozens of similar cases in LA County to go through federal court.

Brayan Ramos-Brito was accused of assaulting a federal agent during a protest outside the Homeland Security Investigations building in Paramount. Initially, federal authorities charged him with a felony but reduced it to misdemeanor assault of a federal officer.

During the two-day trial, U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino testified that he witnessed Ramos-Brito strike the agent with an open palm. Multiple videos showing Ramos-Brito were displayed during the trial, one of which showed a Border Patrol officer shoving Ramos-Brito during the June 7 protest. The other videos did not clearly show Ramos-Brito striking the agent.

The jury deliberated for about an hour on Wednesday before delivering its verdict of not guilty.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles declined to comment on the verdict but said it has secured several guilty pleas in similar cases.

“Human trafficking is a crisis,” McBride, a Democrat from Delaware, said.
The Guardian also found that the state department had failed to publish a legally-required annual report that documents human trafficking in the US and more than 185 other countries.
She called the annual report “critical to the United States’ ability to monitor, prevent and respond to human trafficking”, making the state department’s silence “deeply concerning”.
Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, linked the Trump administration’s retreat on human trafficking to its treatment of children who enter the US on their own.","The House foreign affairs committee unanimously passed an amendment to the US Department of State’s budget late Wednesday that would require additional congressional oversight of the government’s efforts to combat human trafficking in the United States and around the world.

The bipartisan agreement came hours after the Guardian published an investigation that revealed the Trump administration had dramatically rolled back efforts to fight human trafficking across the federal government.

That included a more than 70% reduction of the workforce at the state department’s office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons (Tip office), which is responsible for leading anti-trafficking efforts across the US government.

“This is a bipartisan instance of accountability over the administration that we see far too rarely in this Congress,” the measure’s sponsor, Representative Sarah McBride, said after the move received unanimous support in the committee.

“Human trafficking is a crisis,” McBride, a Democrat from Delaware, said. “We have to respond with a seriousness of purpose that meets the crisis.”

The White House told the Guardian that it was “total nonsense” for Democrats to assert that the administration has pulled back on fighting human trafficking. A spokesperson said “President Trump has totally secured our border to stop the trafficking of children” and “implemented tough-on-crime policies” that go after human traffickers and “hold these disgusting monsters accountable to the fullest extent of the law”.

The Guardian also found that the state department had failed to publish a legally-required annual report that documents human trafficking in the US and more than 185 other countries. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act mandates the report – which charts global trends in human trafficking and provides a country-by-country assessment of efforts to combat it – be provided to Congress no later than 30 June.

The report is seen as a powerful diplomatic tool on human rights-related issues. Countries that get poor marks are ineligible for many forms of US foreign aid. Multiple sources told the Guardian that the report has been completed but had not been provided to Congress.

A state department spokesperson declined to comment on McBride’s amendment but said the department was in the final stages of vetting the anti-trafficking report and that it planned to “release it soon”.

The spokesperson said the report had undergone a “rigorous review process” to maintain its integrity. Staff cuts in the Tip office were part of “a historic reorganization” to better align the agency with an “America First” foreign policy, the spokesperson said.

McBride’s budget amendment, approved by a voice vote by the House foreign affairs committee, directs the state department to report to Congress within 180 days on the impact of staff reductions and the reorganization of the Tip office and how those actions have affected the timeliness and accuracy of the legally-required, Trafficking in Persons (Tip) Report. It also requires that Secretary of State Marco Rubio engage in “regular consultation” with Congress on these issues.

“If this admin has to defend its efforts to deplete this office the hope is they will re-evaluate their actions destroying this office,” McBride said.

The amendment was made to the House bill titled Department of State Policy Provisions Act (HR 5300), which now moves to the full House of Representatives for consideration.

In Congress’s upper-chamber, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, said her office had “not received any communication from the state department” on the status of the anti-trafficking report, including “a request for an extension”.

“I’ve seen longstanding, robust bipartisan support for the Tip office and its annual report, but the administration has regrettably gutted much of the staff responsible” for producing it, Shaheen said. She called the annual report “critical to the United States’ ability to monitor, prevent and respond to human trafficking”, making the state department’s silence “deeply concerning”.

Human trafficking has been at the center of debate on Capital Hill this week, with lawmakers in both the House and Senate grilling the FBI director, Kash Patel, about the administration’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, linked the Trump administration’s retreat on human trafficking to its treatment of children who enter the US on their own.

“They’re not protecting victims and children – they’re abandoning them,” he wrote in a social media post about the Guardian’s investigation.

At a Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing Wednesday, Padilla denounced the administration’s efforts to cut off legal services for unaccompanied migrant children that was mandated by federal law to identify and assist potential victims of exploitation and human trafficking.

“Every single one of us here has a responsibility to stand up for the children in our immigration system, whether it’s because of trafficking, physical or sexual abuse, child labor, or violations of their due process,” he said.

The White House did not answer questions about the administration’s effort to cut funding for legal services for unaccompanied minors.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a9f9c40a171c7e37f93b0ba7b4bc00f58a4f03/488_0_4858_3889/master/4858.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78243e4136808146240d5abcf75cc414",N,,2025-09-18 19:57:51.416807

The site has been the center of controversy for a while now, but recent developments have raised new concerns. Specifically, what does it mean to have effective assistance of counsel when the government builds procedural roadblocks into the very architecture of detention?

A Facility Born in Controversy

The South Florida Detention Facility was the former name of what has apparently been officially dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” It opened its doors just a couple of months ago, as part of Florida’s high-profile partnership with federal immigration authorities under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This law allows trained local law enforcement officers to perform some immigration enforcement functions, such as identifying and processing removable noncitizens, under ICE's supervision and direction. The program aims to increase the number of arrests and deportations of noncitizens, but it has also faced criticism for potentially straining local resources, leading to wrongful detentions, and damaging trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.

In Florida’s case, the state, led by Governor Ron DeSantis and with support from federal officials under President Trump, touted the detention center as a necessary tool for “mass deportation” efforts. Yet from its inception, Alligator Alcatraz was mired in controversy, and not just from immigrant rights advocates. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued that construction had violated federal environmental law by skipping an impact study required for projects in such ecologically sensitive terrain.

The First Legal Battle

That environmental challenge nearly shuttered the facility. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami granted a temporary court order last month requiring the facility to cease operations by October's conclusion, mandating that inmates be relocated to alternative detention centers and that all equipment and barriers be dismantled.

No matter, said Florida; we’ll just make a new detention center. Shorly after Judge Williams’ order, the state began accepting immigrants at a newly repurposed facility in Baker County, west of Jacksonville. This site, formerly a state prison, was hastily converted to serve as an additional immigration detention center, with a reported capacity to hold up to 1,500 people. The move signaled both the scale and urgency of the state’s immigration enforcement ambitions.

But turns out, it might have been unnecessary. Just weeks ago, a divided Eleventh Circuit panel stayed Judge Williams’ order, keeping Alligator Alcatraz open while litigation continues. As detainees continued to be sent to both detention centers, the legal spotlight shifted from environmental harm to something more fundamental: whether those inside could exercise their right to legal representation.

Barbed Wire Barriers to Counsel

For practicing attorneys who represent detained immigrants, Alligator Alcatraz has become synonymous with procedural frustration and constitutional concern. The facility’s remoteness is only the beginning; what follows is a cascade of bureaucratic hurdles that undermine both attorney-client privilege and effective advocacy.

Unlike other immigration detention centers (or even local jails), Alligator Alcatraz requires attorneys to schedule in-person visits at least three business days in advance. This might sound like a minor administrative detail until you consider what it means in practice: attorneys are routinely stymied by last-minute transfers of their clients out of the facility just before scheduled meetings. In one documented instance, an attorney who had arranged visits with ten clients was informed on the eve of those meetings that every single client had been transferred elsewhere. The result? Weeks-long delays and missed opportunities to prepare for hearings or file critical motions.

A recent court filing by attorneys for the plaintiffs details: “Defendants (immigration officials) have engaged in a pattern and practice of transferring detainees whose attorneys have requested in-person legal visits immediately prior to the scheduled visits, precluding their ability to meet with counsel at the facility.” In other words, the system appears designed not merely for security or efficiency but for obstruction.

The obstacles do not end there. Lawyers allege outgoing phone calls from detainees are monitored and recorded, rendering them useless for confidential legal strategy or sensitive disclosures. Videoconferences are similarly compromised; attorneys report that their clients are placed in open cages or makeshift tents with staff within earshot, making true confidentiality impossible. There is no system for confidential exchange of legal documents (no legal mail infrastructure), and even basic information about attorney-access protocols has not been posted publicly or provided to detainees.

The Constitutional Stakes

For those who practice law in this space, these conditions upend the basic tenets of representation. The ability to confer privately with one’s client is not just a professional courtesy; it is foundational to due process and meaningful advocacy. As such, last week, frustrated attorneys for the detainees filed a separate lawsuit in a different district, this time accusing the state and federal officials of breaking the law with these actions.

The legal arguments are rooted in both statutory immigration standards and constitutional law. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sets out clear requirements for confidential attorney-client communications at its facilities. These requirements include providing unmonitored phone calls, private meeting spaces, and unimpeded access during visitation hours without pre-scheduling. The plaintiffs allege that the reality at Alligator Alcatraz falls dramatically short.

More fundamentally, these restrictions implicate First Amendment rights, both for detainees seeking legal advice and for attorneys whose ability to advise clients is chilled by surveillance and delay. As plaintiffs’ counsel argued in their filings: “The government continues to impose significant barriers to attorney access for detainees held at Alligator Alcatraz, in violation of constitutional requirements.” The right to consult with counsel is not an abstract ideal; it is an operational necessity that shapes every aspect of defense strategy and due process.

New Legal Challenge to be Decided

The attorneys accompanied their new complaint with a motion for preliminary injunction, asking U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell for immediate relief. Specifically, they ask for an order requiring state and federal officials “to permit timely, confidential, and meaningful attorney-client communication” at Alligator Alcatraz. Plaintiffs argue that these measures are necessary because “the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”

If granted, such an injunction would force officials to bring Alligator Alcatraz into compliance with both ICE standards and constitutional norms, potentially setting a precedent for other facilities nationwide. For now, immigrant-rights groups continue their push for judicial intervention, arguing that constitutional rights do not end at the edge of the Everglades or behind razor wire fences. For practicing attorneys everywhere, this case is a stark reminder that our duty does not stop at filing complaints on the merits of the core case; it extends into every phone call denied, every visit delayed, and every document lost in bureaucratic limbo.

A child that’s two years younger than me.” The protest lasted more than 36 hours until early Tuesday, with contentious interactions with Border Patrol.
A Border Patrol vehicle arrived Tuesday morning at the entrance of the Whitefish Border Patrol station, one that Galaz said the protesters believed carried Torres and Diaz.
They linked arms in front of the vehicle, and Galaz said a Whitefish police officer stepped between them and the Border Patrol truck.
In a statement, the Whitefish Police Department said it directed protesters to not block vehicles from leaving the U.S. Border Patrol facility.","A Flathead Valley mother and daughter from Honduras who were arrested by U.S. Border Patrol last weekend arrived Wednesday at a facility in Texas, the Daily Montanan confirmed.

Luisa Torres and her daughter, Fergie Diaz, 17, were arrested Sunday after a call from the Montana Highway Patrol, leading to a 36-hour demonstration and additional arrests, according to a witness and authorities.

The mother and daughter were detained after arriving at the scene of a car crash, a friend told the Daily Montanan.

Their arrests come just weeks before a controversial new law passed during the 2025 legislative session takes effect Oct. 1 and could further complicate the role of local and state authorities in federal immigration actions, an attorney for the ACLU of Montana said.

Just before 9 p.m. on Sunday, Cortnie Brooks said she received a phone call from Torres, her English student since February 2024.

“Cortnie, ayúdame,” Torres said, and sent Brooks a dropped pin of a location along a stretch of highway three miles away in Evergreen. “Tienes que venir para acá.”

Translated to English: “Cortnie, help me. You need to come here.”

Torres and Diaz had stopped to help with a car accident they were not involved in, Brooks said, adding she could hear law enforcement in the background of their call.

“I knew that they were being detained,” Brooks said.

Brooks said she was placed on speaker and spoke with a Border Patrol officer. “When I asked why they were being detained, he asked if I was a lawyer. I said no, and he said, ‘Then we can no longer speak.’”

When Brooks arrived at the pinned location, she spoke with a Montana Highway Patrol officer, who told her neither Torres nor Diaz were involved in the accident, Brooks said. She said he told her they were arrested due to “coming on scene after the fact,” the same reason given to Brooks by the Whitefish Border Patrol officer who was also present.

Brooks said she told both officers being “on the scene” was not a valid reason to be detained. She said when she asked if Torres and Diaz would have access to a lawyer, the Border Patrol officer responded with, “We’ll see.”

U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment from the Daily Montanan.

However in a statement to MTN, Customs and Border Protection said it made five arrests Sunday of people “found to have no legal status in the United States.”

CBP said it does not disclose the identities of those it detains “due to privacy.”

A spokesperson for Montana Highway Patrol initially denied to the Daily Montanan involvement in the women’s arrests but later confirmed the agency had contacted Border Patrol to “help translate. And Border Patrol took over the investigation. MHP did not make any arrests related to this incident. Please contact the Whitefish Border Patrol station for more information.”

Sunday night’s arrests follow a string of similar incidents across the state, as federal immigration officers have increased activity in Montana communities, at times embroiling local law enforcement in controversy and legal battles.

Flathead County, Gallatin County and Montana Highway Patrol signed 287(g) agreements, allowing the agencies to carry out certain immigration enforcement duties under ICE’s supervision and direction.

“What local law enforcement is supposed to do is to protect communities and individuals from crime,” said Alex Rate, deputy director at ACLU of Montana. “Most police officers, highway patrol, sign on to conduct local law enforcement actions, not to become immigration authorities. The expansion of the federal immigration apparatus is alarming, and we should all be very concerned.”

Starting Oct. 1, the new law authorizes law enforcement officers to check a person’s immigration status at a lawful stop if the officer has “reasonable suspicion,” and it requires them to report unlawful immigration status to federal authorities.

“The law is very problematic because it essentially invites racial profiling,” Rate said. “It doesn’t require local law enforcement to check immigration status, but if they have reasonable suspicion that an individual may be undocumented they can check, and if they are [undocumented], then law enforcement are required to report them to federal immigration authorities.”

The subjective nature of the law is the problematic part, Rate said.

“What is reasonable suspicion to believe that somebody may be undocumented? It is against the law to use things like accent or the color of somebody’s skin. That is, by definition, racial profiling,” said Rate. “So it’s a problematic law on many levels, and certainly opens up local government, local law enforcement to lawsuits related to unlawful racial profiling.”

Word of the women’s arrests made its way through the Whitefish community, and late Sunday, community members gathered at the Border Patrol station.

Student Colton Little,19, said he arrived at the protest around 6:30 p.m. Monday and stayed until Tuesday morning.

“I think going after anyone who is just trying to live their life, raise their kids, work a job, be part of the community, it’s never an OK thing to do,” Little said. “It’s especially wrong that they’re going after a mother and her 17-year-old daughter. It’s a child. A child that’s two years younger than me.”

The protest lasted more than 36 hours until early Tuesday, with contentious interactions with Border Patrol. At one point, a video shows a Border Patrol vehicle pushing into Leanette Galaz, a local organizer with Flathead Democracy, as she walks backwards into the street.

“I didn’t plan to step in front of that truck the way I did,” Galaz told the Daily Montanan. “But it was a good test to see where they were at in terms of how they respect our bodies, our lives and our safety. And it showed us very quickly that they don’t. So that informed our decisions for the rest of the night in a way that made things work much better and safer.”

Galaz said the group had called the Whitefish Police Department to be on site.

A Border Patrol vehicle arrived Tuesday morning at the entrance of the Whitefish Border Patrol station, one that Galaz said the protesters believed carried Torres and Diaz.

They linked arms in front of the vehicle, and Galaz said a Whitefish police officer stepped between them and the Border Patrol truck. He informed them they’d be arrested if they didn’t move. When they refused, three people were arrested around 8:30 a.m. and charged with disturbing the peace, criminal trespassing, and obstruction. They were released on bail after a community fundraiser.

In a statement, the Whitefish Police Department said it directed protesters to not block vehicles from leaving the U.S. Border Patrol facility. They said they had received earlier complaints about noise and protesters blocking traffic along Nelson Lane and Highway 93 West before the arrests.

Brooks said she believes the arrests of the mother and daughter who work in housing construction was not in good faith.

“They came here to build communities for people living in the U.S.,” said Brooks, through tears. “They’re not making a lot of money, and whatever they make they send home to feed their kids and families. And for us to consider that criminal is abhorrent.”

The family detention center in Dilley, Texas, where they are being held has a history of documented human rights violations.

Galaz relayed a message directly to Torres and Diaz.

“Ustedes están en mi corazón,” she said. “Estoy contigo. Lo siento. Lo siento que no pudimos hacer más para ayudarte.”

“There’s this no man’s land,” said Spokane immigration attorney Sam Smith.
In theory, Ukrainian immigrants like Denys would begin to see their right to work restored.
Alternate routes Many Ukrainian immigrants have lit upon another strategy, one that uses the glacial pace of the federal immigration bureaucracy to their advantage.
But in April, he also co-authored a bipartisan letter calling for the Trump administration to continue to offer Ukrainian immigrants protection.","SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — The first time Denys’s children heard fireworks go off in Spokane, Washington, they were terrified. His kids had grown up about 20 miles from the Russian border, in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, and they knew too well the booms of Russian missile attacks and screeching sounds of Ukrainian air defenses.

In 2023, after Russians attacked the hospital where his youngest daughter, Olivia, had recently been born, Denys knew he needed a way out, and fast.

That’s when a former neighbor, living in an American city on the other side of the world, offered him an escape:

“He called me and said, ‘We have a nice program — Uniting for Ukraine,’” Denys recalled. “If you want to come, grab your family and move.”

Denys, who asked his last name not be used, leapt at the opportunity. He’s stayed in Spokane for the past three years, getting used to a place where explosions are simply celebrations of freedom. He’d spent a half year learning English, and then drawing on his Ukrainian experience making boilers, he swiftly got a job welding construction beams at Metals Fabrication Co.

Like so many of the 240,000 Ukrainians who have immigrated to this country through the Uniting for Ukraine program, his future here is precarious.

Launched by former President Joe Biden in 2022, Uniting for Ukraine is a “humanitarian parole” program. It allowed Ukrainian immigrants to temporarily stay and work in America, two years at a time, so long as they found an American sponsor willing to help support them.

In June, however, Denys lost his job — not because he did anything wrong, but because the federal government failed to reauthorize his right to work. Under Donald Trump’s administration, which is targeting humanitarian parole programs affecting nearly 1.8 million migrants, renewals have ground to a halt.

“I’m very worried about my family,” Denys said. “I need to buy food. I have three kids.”

Along with freezing the Biden-era parole programs for Ukrainian refugees, the administration completely withdrew parole protections for more than 530,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, and over 9,000 from Afghanistan.

Many Ukrainians are taking notice of what’s happening to other refugees. In Spokane, two Venezuelan immigrants who had come here legally through humanitarian parole programs were jailed and slated for deportation, despite applying for asylum. When they showed up for a scheduled meeting in June with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, they were arrested by ICE and carted off to Tacoma’s immigration detention center. A mass protest resulted in 30 arrests, federal charges for nine demonstrators, and national media attention.

Unlike Latin American, Haitian and Afghan immigrants, most Ukrainians don’t have to worry about racial profiling. They haven’t been tarred with wild falsehoods about eating pets from the presidential debate stage. But while Ukrainians were never the primary target of the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle Biden’s immigration legacy, they’ve been caught in the crossfire. At the mercy of a rapidly changing and dysfunctional federal bureaucracy, many are paralyzed by the uncertainty — faced with a choice of waiting for a government response, working illegally, surviving on charity, or leaving America entirely.

“There’s this no man’s land,” said Spokane immigration attorney Sam Smith. “There’s this in-between that they’re stuck in. There’s no good solution for them.”

Frozen in place

Whether because of its climate or its people, Spokane, a mid-sized Washington city on the Idaho border, has been a hub for Ukrainian immigration since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine brought a new surge of nearly 3,000 Ukrainians, many who quickly got to work establishing their new lives.

At a coffee stop started by another Ukrainian immigrant, Maksym Bedenko proudly hands InvestigateWest the business card for The Old Preacher, a small barbershop business he started in 2023. He was lucky enough to re-enroll in the Uniting for Ukraine program in August of last year, when it was still easy to get re-approval. But he knows a slew of other people, including Amazon workers, factory workers and caregivers, who have all lost their jobs.

The second Trump administration had launched with a salvo against nearly every aspect of the immigration system. Executive orders banned new refugees, severed contracts with refugee resettlement organizations and put any renewals of those with programs like Uniting for Ukraine on hold.

During the campaign, Trump had demonized Biden’s humanitarian parole programs, which had resulted in a surge of immigrants into some cities. On his first day back in office, Trump issued an executive order to “terminate all categorical parole programs” that were contrary to his policies.

Three days later, a freeze order went out from the acting director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: Stop processing all Uniting for Ukraine applications, including from those trying to renew their parole status. No parole status, no new rights to work.

Spokane Slavic Association Vice President Zhanna Oberemok, who immigrated to Spokane shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, said drivers for her husband’s trucking company recently started seeing some of their workers lose their commercial driver’s licenses as their work authorizations expired.

“Within the next week or so, we’re going to be losing about seven drivers because their driver license just became inactive,” Oberemok said.

Employers were frustrated to have to let perfectly good workers go.

Sara Weaver-Lundberg, vice president for Metals Fabrication Co., said by email that Denys had been a “gilded unicorn,” the rare, impossible-to-find experienced worker, and losing him “put a strain on our production.”

He was dependable, she said, always willing to work overtime when they needed it. She reached out to her corporate attorney and contacted her congressman to find help for Denys, but so far, neither route has been effective.

“I cannot imagine having to leave my country because it was no longer safe for me and my family,” Weaver-Lundberg said. “Denys did just that — he left Ukraine and entered this country legally. … Now, because of a pause in the program or backlog, he is living in this country with no job.”

Every two weeks, Denys had been sending money to his mother — still in Ukraine, where the prices of groceries and utilities have skyrocketed because of the war. He had been hoping to bring her to the United States through Uniting for Ukraine. Now, that’s out of the question, too.

Without a job, he’s been relying on the generosity of his sponsor — his former neighbor — to pay for food and rent for himself, his wife and his three kids. He’s waiting for a phone call from the state government to see if he’s eligible for unemployment benefits. He noted how he’d been turned from someone contributing to tax revenue through his work into someone costing the government money.

At a table at the Spokane refugee resettlement nonprofit Thrive International, Denys speaks through a translator, a woman who herself came here through the Uniting for Ukraine program.

“I know some families, they got mortgages,” Denys said. “They have loans for their cars. They have huge bills every single month.”

They’re left with an ugly decision: Provide for their family or follow the law. It’s a choice Denys hasn’t made and doesn’t want to.

“I should probably find some job and work under the table, but I don’t want to do that,” Denys said. “But it’s like the government pushes us to do that. We don’t want to do that. We want to work legally and follow the law.”

Pushing back

Elsewhere in Spokane, a local doctor has been fighting for months for a remedy in federal court. In February, Kyle Varner, an activist who spent a month along the Ukrainian border caring for refugees and who’d sponsored nearly 50 Venezuelan immigrants, joined a lawsuit to challenge the new policies, writing that he feels “that there is something fundamentally and morally wrong with treating people differently and giving them fewer rights simply because they were not born in this country.”

Along with immigrants from Ukraine, Nicaragua, Haiti and Afghanistan, he asked the court to force the Trump administration to start processing humanitarian parole applications again.

So far, the verdict has been mixed: New parole applications remain frozen, and in May, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to order a half-million Latin American immigrants to leave the country, a decision that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson warned could lead to “social and economic chaos.”

But thanks to a lower court ruling, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services sent out a memo on June 9, officially lifting the freeze on processing parole renewals. In theory, Ukrainian immigrants like Denys would begin to see their right to work restored. So far, few have.

“We’ve seen some cases denied. And some cases be asked for additional evidence,” said Matthew Soerens, the policy director for World Relief, a national refugee resettlement organization. “But at least the folks that we’re helping, we are not aware of cases being approved for humanitarian parole renewal from Ukraine.”

Smith, the local immigration attorney, says the parole system remains functionally frozen. He suspects it’s a matter of priorities, that the Trump administration is dumping more resources into enforcement and kicking people out instead of helping people to stay.

“It’s pretty clear what the administration thinks about … immigrants and immigration generally,” Smith said.

Alternate routes

Many Ukrainian immigrants have lit upon another strategy, one that uses the glacial pace of the federal immigration bureaucracy to their advantage. Some are filing for asylum — arguing they have a well-founded fear of political, racial or religious persecution from their home country.

And while an asylum application can sometimes take five to 10 years to process, immigrants can get work authorization while they wait.

There’s just one big hitch: It still takes six months, once you apply for asylum, to get work permits. Even if Denys applied today, he wouldn’t be able to get the right to work again until March.

Even then, Smith, the attorney, hesitates to offer any kind of certainty. Lately, federal policy has been chaotic enough that it’s hard to provide long-term assurances.

Often, the government hasn’t formally communicated at all about changes in policy, and when it has, it’s sometimes been a mistake. In April, according to The Washington Post, the Department of Homeland Security had emailed many Ukrainians across the country telling them that their humanitarian parole had been canceled, and threatening that if they didn’t leave the United States, “the federal government will find you.” The message was an error, but it was sent out so broadly that even Smith — an attorney, not an immigrant — got the email.

“There’s a lack of clarity all throughout the system, which makes an already difficult system to navigate even more difficult and perilous,” Smith said. “It paralyzes the system, but it also paralyzes people.”

Appealing to Trump

In Congress, there have been a handful of stabs at trying to make things easier for Ukrainian immigrants — a Senate bill proposes letting Ukrainians on humanitarian parole continue to work, while a bill in the U.S. House would give the Ukrainian parolees a way to become permanent residents. But while both bills have bipartisan supporters, neither has gotten much traction. The Republican Party has been starkly divided on Ukraine, the traditional anti-Russian wing in conflict with a growing isolationist wing.

Spokane’s Republican congressman, U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, embodies that tension. In February, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was booted from the White House following a combative meeting with Trump, Baumgartner called for Zelenskyy’s resignation.

But in April, he also co-authored a bipartisan letter calling for the Trump administration to continue to offer Ukrainian immigrants protection.

“Many of them have found employment, pay taxes, have their children enrolled in school, and are positively contributing to their new communities,” the letter states. “Revoking their protections and sending them back to a war-torn country before peace is secured would be devastating for both them and their families.”

Baumgartner said he did not get a response from the administration.

Still, he stressed to InvestigateWest that “the Ukrainian population have really been model immigrants. They’re hard-working folks, they are entrepreneurs, small business owners.” He was hopeful that Trump could use his tough-on-immigration reputation as a way to bring about reform of a broken system.

In a dark way, Oberemok with the Spokane Slavic Association finds a reason for optimism in the recent news about the stabbing of a young Ukrainian refugee woman in North Carolina. Trump, in his social media post calling for the death penalty for the “animal” who murdered her, had characterized her as a “beautiful young lady from Ukraine, who came to America searching for peace and safety.”

“It’s already giving us hope that he’s not planning on sending us back home,” Oberemok said.

So far, Trump has shown little sign of making it easier for immigrants. In an interview this month, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow declared that the administration plans to make it even harder, and more expensive, for immigrants to get work authorization. He accused the Biden administration of using work permits as a magnet to attract droves of foreigners to the United States.

“To the extent that we can shut off work authorization once we terminate these paroles, we’ve done that,” Edlow said. “You may be eligible for a work permit, but that doesn’t mean anymore that that’s going to result in you being able to remain in this country.”

For now, Ukrainian immigrants continue living under what Mariia Chava, Denys’s sponsor and former neighbor, calls “the big question mark.”

“What will be tomorrow?” she said. “Nobody knows.”

Denys knows he can’t return to Ukraine, where war is still raging and where many see those who left as traitors.

He loves the beauty of nature in Spokane, driving on America’s wide open roads. But he can’t live in a place where he has to fear deportation, where he’s not allowed to provide for his family without breaking the law, where he has no clear path to becoming legal.

“I love this country,” Denys said. “Just give me a chance to work.”

Underwood, who met with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials this week, said the agency reported 250 arrests as of Monday.
Noem’s social media post portrayed Botello in an unfair and inaccurate light, he said, but there’s likely little remedy because Noem has significant legal protections.","Local immigration advocates expressed anger and worry after a U.S. citizen was briefly detained — and footage of him handcuffed was posted on social media by a high-ranking member of the Trump administration — during a U.S. Department of Homeland Security raid on an Elgin home Tuesday.

Ismael Cordová-Clough, an Elgin immigration activist who witnessed the raid, said he was outraged that the operation was recorded and publicized online by the federal government, especially when one of the individuals captured on the footage was an American citizen.

“I think it’s disgusting, to be quite frank, that they utilized our community for their theatrics,” he said. “That is not putting our safety first. That is putting their show first.”

Early Tuesday, federal agents forcibly entered a home in the 900 block of Chippewa Drive in Elgin, destroying the front door and shattering a patio door in the process.

One of the residents in the home was Joe Botello, an U.S. citizen born in Texas, who described being handcuffed, questioned by armed agents and taken inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle during the immigration enforcement operation.

Botello, 37, said he showed his identification to federal agents, told them he had been born in the United States and then was released. Another roommate of his was also handcuffed and questioned but let go shortly afterward, added Botello, who described being “a bit in shock” following the incident.

A few hours after the raid, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem shared a video on social media of four men — including Botello — handcuffed and being led away from the house.

“I was on the ground in Chicago today to make clear we are not backing down,” Noem said in the message on X. “Just this morning, DHS took violent offenders off the streets with arrests for assault, DUI and felony stalking. Our work is only beginning.”

Noem’s message and video post don’t explain that Botello is a U.S. citizen and was later released.

To Cordová-Clough, the video and Noem’s message “puts an overlay of guilt on (those recorded) just associated with their faces.”

“Honestly, if I was a U.S. citizen displayed in that manner by Kristi Noem or any other government official, absolutely I would be suing them,” he said. “If this was about public safety, you would be more mindful of who is (being recorded).”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Wednesday that “no U.S. citizen was arrested, they were briefly held for their and officers’ safety while the operation in the house was under way.”

“This is standard protocol,” the statement added.

DHS officials did not answer Tribune questions about the video of the raid or Noem’s social media post. The misleading video had not been taken down as of Wednesday evening.

Botello, who had chronicled the raid and its aftermath to the Tribune on Tuesday, declined to comment on Noem’s social media post Wednesday or the DHS statement.

Federal immigration officials released information Wednesday on five allegedly undocumented immigrants arrested during the raid on the Elgin home, which was part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” the ramped-up immigration enforcement announced specifically for the Chicago area by Noem last week.

The surge began Sept. 6 and encompasses the entire state of Illinois, as well as Lake County, Indiana, according to information released by U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, a Democrat from Naperville. Underwood, who met with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials this week, said the agency reported 250 arrests as of Monday. Individuals who are detained and processed are being transferred to detention centers in Indiana and Wisconsin.

Federal court records revealed that the target of the Elgin operation appeared to be Carlos Gonzalez-Leon, a citizen of Mexico who had been previously removed from the U.S. on three separate occasions. Immigration officials had the Chippewa Drive home where Gonzalez-Leon, Botello and others were staying under surveillance as far back as Sept. 10, nearly a week before the raid, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Chicago.

A border patrol agent said in an affidavit that he observed Gonzalez-Leon’s green Mercury minivan parked at the address. Two days later, agents tailed him as he got into a different vehicle and drove to a gas station, the complaint said.

The DHS release stated that Gonzalez-Leon was previously convicted of assaulting a family member. That conviction was not mentioned in the criminal complaint, however, and did not appear in a search of local criminal records.

DHS stated the arrests occurred during service of a search warrant for one individual in the home, but did not provide a copy of the warrant or say who the target was. In a news release late Tuesday, the agency identified five men arrested in the incident, all of whom are allegedly in the country illegally.

The others who were detained were Jose Morales-Rodriguez, of Mexico; Juan Eduardo Solarzano-Morales, of Mexico; Victor Manuel Rodriguez-Pantoja, of Mexico; and Ruben Antonio Gonzalez-Querales, of Venezuela, according to the news release.

Morales-Rodriguez has previous convictions that all appeared to be traffic-related, including a 2010 conviction for aggravated DUI and driving without a valid license, records show.

According to DHS, Solarzano-Morales has convictions for domestic violence and stalking. A search of local court records did not turn up any information on those cases.

The other two men arrested had no reported criminal background.

Chicago-area criminal defense attorney Steven Greenberg said authorities have the right to briefly detain and handcuff people when serving warrants if they deem it’s necessary. Noem’s social media post portrayed Botello in an unfair and inaccurate light, he said, but there’s likely little remedy because Noem has significant legal protections.

“It’s just so obvious why it’s irresponsible … to mislabel someone as a criminal when they’re not or an illegal alien when they’re not,” he said. “Federal government officials have immunity for virtually anything they do in the course of their employment for official acts, so he likely has no recourse.”

To Cordová-Clough, the arrests didn’t justify Noem’s social media post and video, which he believes should trouble every American.

“It also means that we must not believe in our criminal justice system, where you’re innocent until proven guilty,” he said. “They’re putting guilt at the forefront to excuse their behavior. And that’s not the best way to govern.”

Immigration advocate Delani Hernandez, a volunteer who patrols the Elgin area to spot raids or other immigration enforcement activity, called Noem’s video “propaganda” for President Donald Trump’s administration.

She added that Botello and others captured in the video were just “collateral damage.”

“Not all people there were bad people,” she said. “Some people were just there because they lived there.”

In a statement, Williams said he was participating in ""a nonviolent civil disobedience to demand oversight of ICE's inhumane detention practices,"" adding, ""Together with the dozens of New Yorkers getting arrested today, I call for all levels of government to do what they can to support our immigrant communities and vulnerable, marginalized populations.""

Assemblywoman Jessica González-Rojas said she was also detained, alongside City Comptroller Brad Lander and City Councilmember Tiffany Cabán.

According to González-Rojas, the lawmakers were trying to conduct oversight of the ICE holding facility to make sure conditions were in compliance with a preliminary injunction ruling handed down by a judge Wednesday.

""We put our bodies on the line for the lives and freedom of thousands of New Yorkers who have been illegally kidnapped and detained by ICE,"" she said in a statement, in part.

The detained officials have since been released.

""Vulnerable communities are in danger. And, in history when we see this happening, what we know is that people who have a little bit more privilege have to do a little bit more to protect those who don't,"" Williams said, speaking outside NYPD headquarters.

In a statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the protest ""a stunt in an attempt to get their 15 minutes of fame while endangering DHS personnel and detainees.""

She accused Lander and protesters of obstructing law enforcement and causing a scene.

At least 11 city and state officials have been confirmed to have been taken into custody. All were zip-tied and led away by DHS officers after refusing to leave the 10th floor — where ICE has been accused of running the suspected lockup — without answers.

The elected officials had gathered with immigrant rights organizers to spotlight ICE’s operations in the federal building, where detainees have reported being held in unsafe and degrading conditions. For more than an hour, the group pressed to see the alleged holding area before DHS officers moved in to make arrests.

DHS and ICE deny that 26 Federal Plaza contains a detention facility, insisting the 10th floor is only a short-term processing space.

But court rulings and advocacy groups have documented cases of immigrants being held for days in cramped, unsanitary rooms without beds or timely access to lawyers.

By Thursday evening, the officials had been released and issued federal summonses, with Lander, State Sen. Julia Salazar (D) and Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas (D) showing their summons papers outside the building. They are due back in federal court in November.

Religious leaders and other protesters who joined the demonstration were also arrested, as police cleared both the building’s interior and surrounding plaza.

This is not the first time Lander has clashed with ICE at Federal Plaza. In June, he was briefly detained by federal agents after linking arms with a man facing immigration proceedings and demanding to see a judicial warrant before officers could take him away.

“This afternoon I faced arrest alongside dozens of New Yorkers in a nonviolent civil disobedience to demand oversight of ICE’s inhumane detention practices,” Jumaane Williams, New York City Public Advocate, said following the arrests. “We can never allow this to become normal, we can never allow ourselves to look away from the horror being inflicted on our neighbors, and we have to use every tool available to fight it — including our own bodies, privilege, and freedom.”

As professor of human rights law at the London School of Economics, Gearty was renowned for his incisive wit and ability to maintain friendships even while disagreeing with his opponents.
Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of Liberty, described his death as “a huge loss for the human rights community”.
In 1990, Gearty moved to King’s College London becoming successively senior lecturer, reader and then professor of human rights law.
In 2015, Gearty married Aoife Nolan, a law professor at Nottingham University.","As a leading authority on counter-terror legislation, Conor Gearty was incensed at the way anti-terror laws are so often enacted to stifle debate and intimidate protest.

The Labour government’s banning of Palestine Action, he argued, was “preposterous”. He told a podcast for Prospect magazine that the then home secretary, Yvette Cooper, had fallen back on the “usual claim they make in a tight corner”, that “‘you have no idea what I know’ … They calculated the ban would produce not much of a reaction.”

He has died suddenly aged 67, shortly after recording his comments, and having spent decades researching and writing about civil liberties and terror regulations. The ban on Palestine Action, he pointed out, was the first time UK terrorism laws had been extended to deal with what appears to be a non-violent, direct action movement.

The outlawing of two other bizarrely named micro-organisations at the same time, the Maniacs Murder Cult and Russian Imperial Movement, was, he suggested, political camouflage for the decision. It would have a chilling effect on all protests about Gaza.

Gearty’s stance was consistent with his lifetime’s work. His last book, Homeland Insecurity: The Rise and Rise of Global Anti-Terrorism Law (2024), which traces the history of the term through colonial insurgencies, observed that classification of an incident as terrorism depends more on the identity of the perpetrator than the nature of the event.

As professor of human rights law at the London School of Economics, Gearty was renowned for his incisive wit and ability to maintain friendships even while disagreeing with his opponents. As a skilled orator and debater, he deployed charm and curiosity to convince. His students cherished being simultaneously challenged and made to laugh.

Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of Liberty, described his death as “a huge loss for the human rights community”. The Labour peer Helena Kennedy, said: “He was a great teacher and made law so accessible. He had a strong moral take on issues.”

Born in Dublin and raised in Abbeylara, near Granard, County Longford, Conor was the second of six children born to Margot (nee Kiernan) and Enda Gearty, a solicitor.

Conor was proud of the family connections to the republican movement that drove the British out of most of Ireland: his father was related to Joe McGuinness, the first Sinn Féin MP, who was elected in 1917; his mother was a niece of Kitty Kiernan, the fiancee of Michael Collins – one of the revolutionary founding figures of the Irish Free State.

Having attended local schools, Conor boarded at the Catholic Castleknock college in Dublin. He studied law at University College Dublin, where he twice won the Irish Times student debating competition.

After graduating in 1978, he qualified as a solicitor but preferred academia – taking a master’s in law at Wolfson College, Cambridge. Switching to Emmanuel College, he became a teaching fellow and completed a PhD in environmental law in 1986. It was a subject, he later admitted, “on which I was never to write another word”. That year he married Diane Wales, originally from Los Angeles, whom he had met at Cambridge. She became a BBC producer.

In 1990, Gearty moved to King’s College London becoming successively senior lecturer, reader and then professor of human rights law. His succinct, engaging and persuasive style helped to launch a writing and publishing career. He began as a columnist for the Irish Times and contributed frequently to legal journals, the London Review of Books, Prospect, the Guardian, BBC radio and the Tablet.

As the author of almost 20 books on civil liberties, social rights and counterterrorism laws, he became an increasingly prominent commentator. His first book, co-authored with Keith Ewing, was Freedom Under Thatcher: Civil Liberties in Modern Britain (1990).

His second, Terror (1991), reached a wider audience, arguing that “the idea of global terrorism is a contrivance designed to legitimise state violence against political opponents”.

Initially sceptical about the need for a human rights act – fearing it would be undermined by conservative judges – he approved of the way the legislation operated after 1998 and gradually developed into a passionate advocate. The act provided, he acknowledged, a legal means to challenge what could be repressive anti-terror laws.

At a job interview for director of the LSE’s Human Rights Centre, he was asked: “Given your well-known objection to the whole idea of human rights, Professor Gearty, why have you applied for this post?” He nonetheless talked his way into the position in 2002.

Gearty helped to train judges in the application of the Human Rights Act and was for a time a special adviser to the Commons home affairs select committee. He became a barrister late in life, appearing in the House of Lords with Cherie Booth KC. A founder member of Matrix Chambers in 2000, he was involved in several human rights cases.

Diane died of cancer in 2011. In 2015, Gearty married Aoife Nolan, a law professor at Nottingham University. Alongside academic work, he regularly updated a personal website and hosted a podcast, Gearty Grillings, in which he interviewed fellow academics.

He was appointed an honorary QC in 2020. A fellow of the Royal Irish Academy and the British Academy, he received honorary degrees from University College Dublin and Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, as well as Brunel and Roehampton universities.

Gearty was a local school governor; he enjoyed tennis, supporting Fulham football club and opera.

Issuing that preliminary order Sept. 9., U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb reasoned that Cook would likely succeed in the litigation.
A divided federal appeals court panel declined to lift Cobb’s order Monday, ahead of a key two-day Fed meeting on monetary policy and other matters.
If the Supreme Court says judges can’t examine the president’s motives — as the majority said when it approved Trump’s travel ban in his first term — then whether Trump’s fraud claim is completely made up or not won’t matter.
The two judges in the appellate panel majority, Michelle Childs and Bradley Garcia, are Biden appointees (as are Cobb and Cook).","President Donald Trump’s bid to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve is now at the Supreme Court. It’s the latest legal test of Trump’s power in his second term, and it carries great practical implications for the economy.

In an application Thursday, the administration asked the high court to lift a district judge’s order that’s keeping Cook on the central bank board as her lawsuit proceeds against Trump’s attempt to fire her. Issuing that preliminary order Sept. 9., U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb reasoned that Cook would likely succeed in the litigation.

A divided federal appeals court panel declined to lift Cobb’s order Monday, ahead of a key two-day Fed meeting on monetary policy and other matters. Trump has been pressing the central bank to lower interest rates, which it did Wednesday, but not as steeply as new board member Stephen Miran wanted. Miran was appointed by Trump and confirmed Monday by the Republican-led Senate. Miran’s Trump-aligned dissent shows how the president hopes to shape the historically independent board and how the GOP-led Senate will let him — unless checked by the courts.

A challenge for Trump in fully controlling the board is that the Federal Reserve Act says the president can only remove board members for cause. And while the Supreme Court has been letting Trump fire members of other agencies without cause, the Republican-appointed high court majority went out of its way earlier this year to signal that it won’t let Trump do so with the Fed.

So the president seemingly needed to come up with a reason to fire Cook. That’s apparently what led his administration to develop the claim that she committed mortgage fraud prior to her Senate confirmation (her term expires in 2038). The board’s staggered terms are designed to insulate members from the whims of a given presidential administration. Recent reporting suggests the fraud claim might be false, and Cook hasn’t been criminally charged with any fraud.

But whether she stays on the board won’t necessarily turn on whether she actually committed fraud. If the Supreme Court says judges can’t examine the president’s motives — as the majority said when it approved Trump’s travel ban in his first term — then whether Trump’s fraud claim is completely made up or not won’t matter. All the president would have to do is claim he has cause to fire Cook (or anyone else) and the effect would be the same as the court saying he can fire anyone without cause.

While we don’t know how the justices will resolve the historic dispute, it’s worth keeping in mind that the appellate decision Monday to keep Cobb’s order in place came over a dissent from Trump appointee Gregory Katsas. His view of the case might more closely resemble the high court majority’s view.

The two judges in the appellate panel majority, Michelle Childs and Bradley Garcia, are Biden appointees (as are Cobb and Cook). In siding with Cook, they focused on due process, noting that the administration “does not dispute that it failed to provide Cook even minimal process — that is, notice of the allegation against her and a meaningful opportunity to respond — before she was purportedly removed.” In his dissent, Katsas wrote that Cobb was wrong to rule that Cook 1) had a constitutionally protected property interest in her office; and that 2) she can’t be removed based on conduct prior to her appointment.

The administration cited Katsas’ dissent in its application Thursday, casting Cobb as the latest lower court judge to stand in the way of Trump’s power. “This application involves yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President’s removal authority — here, interference with the President’s authority to remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote, calling due process “a flexible concept.” He wrote that if “the President provides no reason at all for removing a member, a court could properly review that decision. But once the President identifies a cause, judicial review must cease.”

When she filed her lawsuit in late August, Cook called Trump’s attempt to fire her “unprecedented and illegal.” Underscoring the stakes in her civil complaint, she noted that Fed independence “is vital to its ability to make sound economic decisions, free from the political pressures of an election cycle.” She warned that if “markets and the public believe that the central bank is making decisions based on political pressure rather than sound economic data, that confidence erodes.”

In her ruling to keep Cook on the board while her suit proceeds, Judge Cobb noted that the case involves “the first purported ‘for cause’ removal of a Board Governor in the Federal Reserve’s 111-year history,” and that it “raises important matters of first impression,” meaning issues that haven’t been legally resolved by courts before.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250826-lisa-cook-rs-ef348f.jpg",N,,2025-09-18 19:58:33.196652

According to three employees at GSA, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive internal operations and to avoid retribution, the agency has created an ""ICE surge"" team in recent weeks, referring to an effort to lease private offices to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency officers to establish long-term work space in the cities where they are operating.

Last week, the GSA's Public Buildings Service posted a solicitation for ""as-is, fully-finished and furnished office space in support of administrative operations for law enforcement"" in 19 cities across the country. The listing estimates each lease would include workstations for 70 people and notes the ""unique"" quick period of one week to submit bids.

One of the GSA employees said ICE has urgently requested the agency find around 300 fully furnished properties with private office space to lease by this winter.

The push is happening just months after the informal White House advisory group, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, fired a large number of GSA employees and terminated a huge chunk of government leases, decisions that are now being reversed in many cases in order to accommodate government procurement needs. There's no clear evidence those cuts saved significant amounts of taxpayer money.

It's also happening alongside a government-wide effort to divert resources towards immigration enforcement, from federal leasing efforts to law enforcement expertise from other agencies like the FBI. Limited enforcement resources, including a lack of funding to bring on more people to conduct arrests and investigations and litigate cases, have been one of the biggest challenges to scaling up the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.

Congress this summer provided ICE with $75 billion to hire more officers, expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests and deportations. The agency, which started the year with about 20,000 people, is looking to hire more than 10,000 new officers by the end of the year. The agency is offering candidates large signing bonuses of tens of thousands of dollars in a streamlined hiring effort that immigration policy experts and other critics fear could compromise vetting standards.

The agency is also increasing its detention capacity and launching enforcement operations across the country aimed at increasing the number of people arrested and detained. The administration has promoted large-scale operations in cities like Boston and Chicago.

The most recently available immigration detention data publicly published by ICE shows that there are 58,000 people in detention. Immigrant rights advocates have warned that the rapid expansion of arrests and detention is leading to widespread concern over human rights and due process violations for immigrants.

Public polls have increasingly shown that American voters disapprove of how ICE is carrying out its operations, particularly in places like hospitals and other ""protected areas.""

Meanwhile, GSA employees are finding themselves swept into the immigration crackdown.

""It's been incredibly chaotic,"" said one of the GSA employees familiar with the new ""emergency"" lease project.

In addition to finding new office space to lease for ICE, the agency has also requested that GSA identify existing federally owned or leased property that might be suitable for their use in a range of cities across the country. Those cities include Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, New York City, Denver, Chicago, Kansas City, Mo., Greensboro, N.C., and Fort Myers, Fla., according to a list shared with NPR. The list mentions that the properties would be used in enforcement and removal operations. In Boise, Idaho, ICE is looking to spend over a million dollars to expand an existing, leased office space, according to a permit application filed with the city uncovered in reporting by the Idaho Statesman.

The efforts are causing frustration among some GSA employees, who dealt with months of DOGE downsizing and reorganizing at the agency. Now, with around half the staff they had before the government restructuring efforts began, they're being forced to renegotiate cancelled leases with landlords who are ""increasing their rates substantially,"" said one of the GSA employees.

(WTVO) — The City of Rockford shared a “community update” on Thursday morning, informing residents of the presence of ICE vehicles.

According to city officials, an SUV with markings consistent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was seen parked at Rockford Police District 2 headquarters on Broadway.

At 8:23, authorities said ICE agents approached the building, which was closed at that time, but made no contact with anyone inside. The SUV departed at 8:40 p.m., authorities said.

“The Rockford Police Department had no contact with ICE before, during, or after this incident, and we have no information about whether they remain in our community,” the city posted.

In Illinois, the TRUST Act, signed by former Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) in 2017, prevents state law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

Earlier this year, Rockford Police Chief Carla Redd issued a statement on the department’s policy, saying, “The enforcement of civil immigration laws is the primary responsibility of federal agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Rockford Police Department does not participate in civil immigration-related investigations or actions.”

Winnebago County Sheriff Gary Caruana said in a January statement, “Local law enforcement agencies are prohibited from honoring ICE detainers or acting on an individual’s immigration status without a judicial warrant. These legal restrictions limit the ability of local law enforcement to collaborate with federal partners, including ICE, in addressing certain public safety concerns.”

ICE are currently conducting “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, in an effort to detain and deport “criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

The Department of Homeland Security said the operation was in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed by an undocumented migrant in a drunk-driving crash in Illinois.

Organizers of several Mexican Independence Day and Hispanic Heritage Month events in Rockford said they had canceled the activities due to “safety concerns” over possible ICE enforcement activities.

Earlier this month, DHS had installed a temporary perimeter fence around the federal courthouse building, at 327 S Church Street.

Mayor Tom McNamara has been a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump and his effort to deport criminal aliens from the U.S. interior, calling the president a “dictator” and “sexual predator” at a “No Kings, No Troops” rally on September 6th.

“To our immigrant neighbors: please know this — you are valued, you are cared for and you are an important part of who we are,” the city posted in a Facebook statement earlier this month.

Khalil’s lawyers said they intended to appeal against the deportation order, and that a federal district court’s separate orders remain in effect prohibiting the government from immediately deporting or detaining him as his federal court case proceeds. The lawyers submitted a letter to the federal court in New Jersey overseeing his civil rights case and said he will challenge the decision.

Khalil, in a statement to the American Civil Liberties Union, said in response to the order: “It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again.”

The order dated 12 September by the immigration judge asserted the lack of full disclosure on Khalil’s green card application “was not an oversight by an uninformed, uneducated applicant … rather, this court finds that respondent wilfully misrepresented material fact(s)”.

“It is hereby further ordered that respondent be removed from the United States to Algeria, or in the alternative to Syria,” wrote the judge, Jamee Comans.

Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States, who is married to a US citizen and has a US-born son, was detained for three months beginning in March and faced potential deportation. His wife was pregnant at the time and Khalil missed the birth of their child while in jail.

A former Columbia University student who was one of the most visible leaders of nationwide pro-Palestinian campus protests, Khalil was released from custody in June, but has faced the continued threat of deportation from federal authorities.

Donald Trump’s administration has cracked down on pro-Palestinian protesters such as Khalil, calling them antisemitic and supporters of extremism.

Protest groups, including some Jewish groups, say that criticism of Israel’s assault on Gaza and its occupation of Palestinian territories is not antisemitism, and advocacy for Palestinians is not support for extremism.

""When our communities are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back,"" chanted protesters at the rally organized by One America, an immigrants' rights group led by Executive Director Roxana Norouzi.

The rally follows KING 5's August investigation that exposed how ICE obtained access to Washington driver and vehicle data for deportation purposes, violating state sanctuary laws designed to protect immigrant communities.

Since President Trump's election last November, federal use of the state database skyrocketed 188%, with ICE searches for driver and vehicle records jumping from approximately 540 in November to over 1,600 in May - a threefold increase.

Washington passed legislation in 2018 preventing state agencies from sharing residents' personal information with federal officials for immigration enforcement as part of its sanctuary state protections.

""We need the government and Governor Ferguson to act with all of his power to protect people in our state,"" Norouzi said during today's rally.

""It has clearly not protected our folks. We have learned that that data has been shared and we need to do more,"" Norouzi said.

State Rep. Osman Salahuddin from the 48th district joined advocates in calling for stronger protections, emphasizing the need to ""demand the action that our state deserves in ensuring our immigrant communities, our refugee communities do not have their data breached similar to what we saw with the Department of Licensing and ICE.""

Following the KING 5 investigation, DOL terminated ICE's access to their database. However, advocates say that's not enough.

Their demands include:

Strengthening immigrant rights laws

Ending all data sharing agreements with federal agencies

Ensuring transparent communication with immigrant communities

NVIDIA commits £2 billion to catalyze the U.K.’s AI startup ecosystem and accelerate the creation of new companies, jobs and globally transformative AI businesses.

Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court will join NVIDIA’s investment in the U.K. market, underscoring their commitment to foster the U.K. AI ecosystem.

The investment will bring new capital and advanced AI infrastructure to major U.K. hubs like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester — empowering researchers and developers across the country to scale the next generation of AI businesses.

LONDON, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced an investment of £2 billion in the U.K. market to catalyze the nation’s AI startup ecosystem and scale the next generation of globally transformative AI businesses. The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the U.K. to compete in the AI market globally.

Scaling AI companies in the U.K. has been challenging due to limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton Capital, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court, will accelerate the U.K. AI ecosystem by providing new capital for AI startups.

“This is the age of AI — the big bang of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The United Kingdom is in a Goldilocks moment, where world-class universities, bold startups, leading researchers and cutting-edge supercomputing converge. There has never been a better time to invest in the U.K. — AI is unlocking new science and sparking entirely new industries. With new capital and advanced infrastructure, we are doubling down to empower the U.K. to lead the next wave of AI innovation.”

The investment will expand access to capital in key U.K. economic centers, AI growth zones and deep technology ecosystems like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester. NVIDIA’s investment, combined with new, world-class AI infrastructure, will empower researchers and developers nationwide, fueling the launch and growth of AI startups.

“NVIDIA’s investment is a major vote of confidence in the U.K. both today and long into the future,” said U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “By backing our startups, empowering our researchers and connecting capital with talent, this partnership will create jobs, spark new industries and ensure the U.K. remains at the forefront of global AI leadership.”

NVIDIA is committed to working closely with the U.K.’s leading company founders and VCs — especially in London, home to world-renowned academic AI labs — and partnering with top U.K.-based funds to ensure capital and compute reach the most ambitious entrepreneurs and most dynamic regions, including the U.K. government’s newly announced AI growth zone.

Following NVIDIA’s recent commitment to manufacturing up to a half-trillion dollars’ worth of AI supercomputers in America, the investment will be domiciled in the United States and activated in the United Kingdom, celebrating the transatlantic partnership between the two countries. NVIDIA is purposefully investing in the U.K.’s future, unlocking opportunities for the next generation of British innovators.

“In collaboration with NVIDIA, we're accelerating the growth of U.K. AI startups,” said Sonali De Rycker, partner at Accel. “World-class compute and fresh capital will empower the next wave of entrepreneurs and AI startups, create new jobs and further enable the U.K. to compete in the AI race. The U.K. has long been a hotbed for AI talent, with a strong community of researchers, founders and world-class universities, and this new investment will supercharge the AI flywheel.”

“We’ve embarked on a new journey where scaling AI unlocks capabilities that, when we started in this industry over a decade ago, would have been considered magic,” said Nathan Benaich, general partner at Air Street Capital. “The U.K. has world-class talent and research, but the infrastructure has not kept pace. This commitment aims to bridge that gap by providing U.K. founders with the resources needed to build globally significant AI companies.”

“We are in the midst of a seismic technology shift as people and companies around the world increasingly depend on more intelligent hardware and software,” said James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital. “The U.K. is fortunate to be home to some of the teams and companies leading that wave. The challenge facing us, however, is how to overcome constraints like the cost of energy or ability to access compute. Investment from firms like Balderton and companies like NVIDIA will help smooth the path, so more global winners can be built and thrive here in the U.K.”

“The U.K. has the talent, research institutions and entrepreneurial drive to build world-leading AI companies — but turning breakthrough ideas into global impact requires collective action,” said Hussein Kanji, founder and partner at Hoxton Ventures. “We’re thrilled to partner with NVIDIA to commit resources to help Britain’s brightest founders commercialize their innovations and build the next generation of transformational AI companies.”

“Britain has the science and the talent. This collaboration with NVIDIA puts capital and computing power in their hands to scale globally,” said Saul Klein, founder and executive chair of Phoenix Court. “With nearly 800 venture-backed U.K. companies generating revenues of over $25 million, the opportunity now is to back the next wave of truly differentiated AI companies solving real-world challenges.”

On Thursday morning volunteers canvassed the city's Northwest Side and passed ""Know Your Rights"" flyers to keep people informed.

""On Tuesday, five members of our community were detained as they traveled to work and yesterday, Wednesday, we experienced widespread ICE presence occupying our neighborhoods,"" Palenque LSNA Board Secretary Viviana Barajas said.

Elected leaders and immigrant advocates gathered across the Home Depot along Normandy and Grand Avenue. They said a day laborer was taken into custody this week.

""Here at this Home Depot we received video of a Hispanic man roughly in their 40's getting detained by two agents pretty aggressively at this parking lot...we have not been able to fully connect with the family or identify where he got taken,"" Northwest Side Rapid Response Team Sandra Puebla said.

Organizers shared cellphone video with ABC7 showing federal agents flashing lights and recording the people inside the vehicle. The footage was taken Thursday morning as volunteers say they were inside their car filming ICE activity near Kostner and Grand.

The Trump administration reiterated that they are going after criminals during their operations.

The parking lot and corner of the Home Depot remained pretty empty Thursday morning as we are told many day laborers have been scared to return following ongoing immigration enforcement.

On the city's Southwest Side, a lunchtime visit to Little Village Thursday told a story. The business corridor on 26th Street, once bustling, is now more of a bust.

Vendors and businesses are struggling as people in the community remain on high alert for ICE.

Luz Martinez and her brother set up her hot dog stand shortly before noon, wondering how many customers might come by and how many might stay away, concerned about ICE showing up.

""Well, the sales had decreased. Like, really bad. There's barely any people out here, and if they're out here, they're like, in a hurry, trying to get home safe to their family,"" Martinez said. ""But we gotta come out. We have family to feed, and we have no other choice but to be out here working.""

She said the ICE crackdown has cast a sense of fear over many people in Little Village. Before, she says she sold about 150 bacon-wrapped hot dogs a day.

""We put mayo, ketchup, mustard, grilled onions, tomato and sliced pepper,"" Martinez said.

Now she sells maybe 50, a two-thirds decline in sales. It's a common report from vendors, including some in the very not busy discount mall.

""It's just been very quiet, very everyone just kind of is, you know, living out of fear. Especially, it's been a lot of workers who just are choosing not to come in,"" said Jack Santiago with Georgie's Ice Cream Shop.

It is a problem not limited to Little Village, but the restaurant industry as a whole, which provides employment for many undocumented immigrants.

""They are very on edge about ICE coming into the businesses,"" said Sam Toia, President of the Illinois Restaurant Association. ""We've heard from some members that it's up to 20% of their team members not showing up to work.""

The Democrats said they would continue to speak out against the detention of DACA recipients and provide assistance in litigation for families.","WASHINGTON — Advocates Thursday raised alarm over immigrants with special deportation protections facing detainment across the country, as the Trump administration continues its aggressive mass deportation campaign.

Home is Here, a coalition of advocates for immigrants with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, status, has documented a pattern of immigration agents targeting DACA recipients. At least 18 DACA recipients are detained, according to a Home is Here tracker.

So far, Home is Here has pinpointed DACA recipients detained in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Virginia.

The immigrant advocates were joined at a press conference by congressional Democrats and family members of DACA recipients currently detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The lawmakers included Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Alex Padilla of Carlifornia and Reps. Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Delia Ramirez of Illinois.

“The Trump administration is killing DACA piece by piece,” Garcia said.

DACA tied up in court

The Trump administration tried to end DACA during President Donald Trump’s first term, but the Supreme Court blocked the effort. Republican-led states have challenged the legality of DACA and its fate is tied up in an appeals court.

There are roughly 550,000 DACA recipients, a program created under the Obama administration for undocumented children brought into the country without legal authorization by their parents.

DACA allows that group to be shielded from deportation and obtain work authorizations and driver’s licenses. DACA recipients have to reapply every two years for a renewal fee of $520 and pass a background check.

Ramirez said the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportation campaign is indiscriminately targeting immigrants and has instilled fear in Latino communities.

“The whole (Trump) administration are waging a campaign of terror against our neighbors, against our own families, against our loved ones as they advance their fascist agenda and they try to cast immigrants as a public enemy,” said Ramirez, who is married to a DACA recipient and is the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants.

The Democrats said they would continue to speak out against the detention of DACA recipients and provide assistance in litigation for families. A handful of Democrats have sued ICE over blocked access to detention facilities to conduct oversight.

An arrest, and detainment

The wife of a DACA recipient in ICE detention, Alejandra, who spoke at the press conference, said that she saw through a home security camera her husband, Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira, being arrested by masked men in the driveway of their Texas home.

Alejandra said their children were in the car and they could be heard screaming on the video. Her husband remains in detainment. The ACLU of New Mexico said in a statement he is 28 years old and the father of four U.S. citizen children.

“No family should ever have to endure that kind of terror,” she said. “For more than a decade, Paulo has been able to renew his status without issues. He has always followed the rules, done everything this country asked of him, and yet, under this administration, it feels like none of that matters anymore.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-09/dreamers-1024x683-1-1.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=eSTRkXqC,N,,2025-09-18 15:58:05.742923

In court documents made public Wednesday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Khalil should be deported for failing to disclose information on his green card application.

The decision marked a setback for Khalil, a lawful U.S. resident and recent Columbia University graduate student who became the first person targeted by President Donald Trump’s aggressive crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists. But while the ruling puts him one step closer to a final order of removal, it is far from the last word in the case.

For now, Khalil remains protected from detention and deportation under a separate judicial order. His legal team has said they intend to appeal the immigration judge’s ruling, which Khalil has characterized as “further evidence of retaliation” from a “kangaroo court.”

WATCH: Mahmoud Khalil speaks at Newark airport after release from immigration detention

Here’s a look at where things stand in the ongoing legal battle:

What did the immigration judge in Louisiana decide?

The Sept. 12 ruling by the immigration judge, Jamee Comans, builds on her previous order issued in April, which found Khalil could be forced out of the country as a national security risk.

Khalil’s attorneys had challenged that decision, citing his lack of criminal history and close ties to the United States. His wife is a U.S. citizen, as is his 5-month-old son, who was born while Khalil was in federal custody.

Khalil was a prominent figure in protests at Columbia University against the war in Gaza, which spread to campuses nationwide. He was arrested inside his campus apartment building this past March and accused by the Trump administration of supporting “pro-Hamas” activity, referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Khalil has repeatedly denied the charge and the federal government has not provided evidence for it.

Khalil has argued he is being targeted for exercising his free speech, pointing to a memo by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that justified his arrest on the grounds that his pro-Palestinian beliefs could undermine U.S. foreign policy interests.

In her latest decision, Comans said she lacked the authority “to question foreign policy determinations” and that Khalil’s “limited family ties” to the country did not amount to a compelling reason to waive her prior ruling.

Comans then sided with the government on a separate claim, finding that Khalil had “willfully misrepresented” facts about his background on his green card application, including his role in a United Nations agency that provides services to Palestinian refugees.

Khalil has maintained that any omissions on the application were unintentional.

What happens now?

Khalil’s attorneys said Wednesday that they intend to appeal the decision. But they also expressed concern about their odds of success in the reliably conservative federal appeals court with jurisdiction over the case.

If he were to lose his appeal, Khalil would be stripped of his permanent residency status, further restricting his ability to work and travel, according to his attorneys. But the government would still be prohibited from removing him under a June 11 order from a federal judge in New Jersey, Michael Farbiarz.

That order will remain in place while his civil rights case plays out in New Jersey. It may soon be “the only meaningful impediment” to Khalil’s deportation, according to a letter that his attorneys sent Wednesday to Farbiarz.

Oral arguments in that case could begin as soon as next month.

Where would he be deported?

Judge Comans has said Khalil would be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or “in the alternative” Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

Attorneys for Khalil have said the publicity surrounding his case would leave him in mortal danger if he were forced to return to either country.

Khalil, 30, fled Syria for Lebanon in 2013 after joining protests against then-President Bashar al-Assad. His family has roots in Tiberias but were displaced during the mass expulsion of Palestinians from what is now Israel, according to court documents.

Khalil has said he will continue advocating for Palestinians as his legal battle plays out. He is also currently suing the Trump administration for $20 million in damages, alleging that he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite.

Lauren Underwood, a Democrat, have said that they have been able to collect much information about “Operation Midway Blitz” from federal officials.","CHICAGO (NewsNation) — An ongoing large-scale federal immigration enforcement operation continues to focus on targeting what the Trump administration considers the “worst of the worst” in the greater Chicago area, despite ongoing opposition from elected officials.

NewsNation got an exclusive look at how Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actively working to take immigrants who entered the United States illegally and who have criminal convictions off the streets as part of “Operation Midway Blitz”.

On Tuesday, ICE arrested Arturas Pivoras, who first entered the United States in 2001. Pivoras appeared before an immigration judge who, in August, revoked Pivoras’ bond, ordered him back into custody and gave him 30 days to appeal. Officials said he never did.

Officials said that Pivoras, a 41-year-old Lithuanian national, was convicted of aggravated assault on a police officer, burglary, criminal trespass and drug possession. That made him a priority for ICE, officials told NewsNation during an exclusive ride-along this week. Pivoras was arrested without incident after his wife convinced him to surrender to federal officers.

“This is definitely a success,” Marcos Charles, the acting executive associate director of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations team, told NewsNation. “Any time we have a cooperative individual, we have to wait on them a little bit longer, but it’s cooperative. It’s safe for our officers, it’s safe for the individual, (and) that’s a win.”

In Pivoras’ case, the fact that he chose to surrender to ICE peacefully is considered a win for federal agencies.

Pivoras was wearing an ankle monitor, which alerted ICE to his location. But because he lived in a building with a doorman who did not permit ICE officers to enter the building, the process of taking Pivoras into custody was drawn out. But rather than having to force their way in, ICE officials spoke with Pivoras’ wife, who convinced her husband to give himself up.

ICE officials told NewsNation they plan to remain in Chicago indefinitely and “until the job is done.”

“They’re all characterized as bad guys,” Charles said of those the agency is targeting for arrest. “If there’s somebody we can grab right away, that’s what we’re going to do. We’re after all of those people. It’s not like we’re targeting one group of bad guys. We’re targeting all bad guys.”

ICE isn’t alone in Operation Midway Blitz

Although ICE often draws much of the media attention in federal immigration enforcement operations, the Chicago operation is leaning into more of a whole-of-government approach.

Customs and Border Protection agents, along with the U.S. Border Patrol’s elite tactical unit, BORTAC, are all working together in a mission led by Border Patrol commander-at-large Gregory Bovino. On Tuesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was part of a BORTAC enforcement operation that targeted a home in suburban Elgin, where two undocumented immigrants with previous criminal convictions were taken into custody.

DHS officials announced that Christian Lopez-Cervantes, a Mexican national who had been charged with felony assault, domestic violence and felony illegal re-entry, was arrested on Tuesday.

DHS officials also announced the arrests of other criminal targets who had previously been charged with weapons offenses or had been convicted of murder. Others had either been arrested on allegations of domestic violence or criminally charged, the agency said.

Two other people, identified as Us.S residents, were detained by CBP during the Elgin operation. However, they were released after DHS officials said they were briefly held for their safety and that federal officers, the agency said.

DHS officials said that the two people were not arrested, which some local media outlets had reported had taken place. DHS officials said that holding people found at locations where enforcement operations take place is part of the agency’s protocol.

One of those released by CBP, Joe Botello, told the Chicago Tribune that masked and armed agents forcibly entered the home just before 6 a.m. He said officers were calling out the name of another person in Spanish and that officers destroyed a front door and a glass patio door in the process of entering the home.

“I’m just blessed that I’m still alive,” Botello told the newspaper. “I’ve been hearing it and seeing it through social media. But it never crossed my mind that it was going to happen here at the house … where I live.”

Botello said that he was handcuffed and led out of his home before he was released after showing officers his identification as an American citizen.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has criticized the ongoing federal operation, saying that ICE and other agencies have not been transparent about their activity. That includes the fatal shooting of an ICE target last week in suburban Franklin Park.

Pritzker has called for more answers after ICE officials said the suspect attempted to hit officers with his car during a traffic stop and dragged an ICE officer. An FBI spokesperson would not confirm or deny to NewsNation whether they are leading an investigation into the incident.

Other officials, including U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, a Democrat, have said that they have been able to collect much information about “Operation Midway Blitz” from federal officials.

Underwood’s office announced Monday that the lawmaker has been informed that 250 arrests have been made by federal officers since the Chicago-based operation began last week. Underwood said that those being arrested have been transferred to detention centers in Indiana and Wisconsin, but that family members are experiencing difficulty reaching those being detained.

But she fears that incidents like those that have been taking place in both Chicago and the surrounding suburbs will continue to stoke fear.

“Everyone deserves to feel safe in their community. Like all Illinoisans, I’ve been concerned and alarmed by reporting about ICE’s conduct and operations in our state under Donald Trump,” Underwood, the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations, said in a statement released by her office.

An Underwood spokesperson told NewsNation on Wednesday that the lawmaker had not received information on the Elgin arrests. A Pritzker spokesperson accused Noem on social media of “coming to Chicago “for a few hours to capture content (and) fled before taking questions from the press or public.”

Still, federal officials said they will not be deterred by the opposition they are facing from Pritzker and other Democrats.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/09/ICE-vehicles.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-18 16:57:09.867418

The decision by U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly comes after the Republican administration's Labor Day weekend attempt to remove Guatemalan migrant children who were living in government shelters and foster care.

Government officials with the Department of Homeland Security nor the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes custody of the children, offered no immediate response to the judge's order.

Trump administration officials said they were seeking to reunify children with parents who wanted them returned home. ""But that explanation crumbled like a house of cards about a week later,"" Kelly wrote. ""There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.""

Advocates for the children also submitted a whistleblower account to the court that suggests many of the children who were found eligible for deportation had likely been victims of child abuse, like death threats, gang violence, and human trafficking, Kelly noted in his order.

""The court saw through the government's repeated misrepresentations of critical facts to try to justify the indefensible targeting of vulnerable children who would have faced danger if forcibly sent to other countries,"" Efrén C. Olivares, vice president of litigation & legal strategy at the National Immigration Law Center, said in a statement.

There was already a temporary order in place preventing the removal of Guatemalan children. But that was set to expire Tuesday. Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, granted a preliminary injunction extends that temporary protection indefinitely, although the government can appeal.

Kelly did rebuff advocates' push to block the removal of children from additional countries, though he said any attempt to remove those children in a similar way would likely be unlawful. Legal advocates working with Kids in Need of Defense visited Honduras last week and found government officials and nongovernmental organizations working ""furiously"" to receive as many as 400 children back from the United States.

There are also temporary restraining orders in separate cases in Arizona and Illinois, but those cases are much more narrow in the scope of children they cover, underlining the importance of the Washington case.

In a late-night operation Aug. 30, the administration notified shelters where migrant children traveling alone initially live after they cross the U.S.-Mexico border that they would be returning the children to Guatemala and that they needed to have the kids ready to leave in a matter of hours.

""Our clients were terrified-many had tear-soaked faces and some were visibly shaking with fear,"" Mishan Wroe, directing attorney at the National Center for Youth Law, one of the plaintiff attorneys, said in a statement.

Contractors for Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up the Guatemalan children from shelters and foster care and transported them to the airport. The government has said in court filings that it identified 457 children for possible removal to Guatemala although that list was eventually whittled down to 327. In the end, 76 got as far as boarding planes in El Paso and Harlingen, Texas, on Aug. 31 and were set to depart to Guatemala in what the government described as a first phase.

Bertilda López's 17-year-old son was among those slated to be sent to Guatemala. Over Labor Day weekend, he called his family late at night to tell them he was being sent home and she drove through the night to get to the capital.

She expressed mixed feelings about the judge's decision Thursday.

""As a mother I want him to be well, whether that's sending him (home) or him being locked up there,"" López said. ""Maybe it's better that they send him back because he's really sad. The way things are there (in the U.S.), it bothers me that my son is locked up.""

Elisabeth Toca, who is sponsoring the boy and hopeful he will be allowed to stay, said she's still hoping she will be able to get him out of U.S. custody and ""give him a better life.""

Guatemala's government declined to comment, saying only that it was an internal U.S. justice process.

Immigration and children's advocates, who had been alerted of possible efforts to remove Guatemalan minors, immediately sued the Trump administration to prevent the children's removal. The advocates argued that many of these children were fleeing abuse or violence in their home countries and that the government was bypassing longstanding legal procedures meant to protect young migrants from being returned to potentially abusive or violent places.

""This was a tragedy in the making that was barely averted thanks to the tireless efforts of advocates across the country who saw that children were being endangered and raised the alarm,"" Shaina Aber, executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, said in a statement.

Another federal judge in Washington granted advocates a temporary restraining order largely preventing the Trump administration from removing Guatemalan migrant children in its care except in limited circumstances where an immigration judge had already ordered their removal after reviewing their cases. That initial 14-day order was set to expire on Sunday, and then Kelly extended it through Tuesday to give him extra time to examine the case.

The government has argued that it has the right to return children in its care and it was acting at the behest of the Guatemalan government. But the government walked back an initial claim alleging the parents requested their children be sent back.

The Guatemalan government has said that it was concerned over minors in U.S. custody who were going to turn 18 and would then be at risk of being turned over to adult detention facilities.

Children who cross the southern border alone are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services. The children usually live in a network of shelters across the country that are overseen by the resettlement office until they are eventually released to a sponsor, usually a relative.

After advocates got the temporary restraining order approved for Guatemalan children, they also asked the court to extend protections from deportation to children of other nationalities after hearing reports that the government was intending to remove Honduran children as well.

The unanimous three-judge panel on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to lift a lower order blocking the restructuring as Democratic-led states press ahead with their lawsuit.

The 19 states, joined by the District of Columbia, sued as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s leadership moved to terminate 10,000 employees and dismantle several of its subagencies.

U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose, an appointee of former President Biden, blocked the restructuring in July by finding it was likely unlawful.

It halts mass layoffs at four offices under HHS: the Center for Tobacco Products, the Office of Head Start, components of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.

In its appeal, the administration contended the states have no legal right to sue, federal law requires their claims to go before an agency that guards the federal employee merit system rather than a court, and the restructuring is lawful anyway.

The argument heavily relies on a July ruling from the Supreme Court enabling the Education Department to lay off roughly half its employees. It became the latest battle over how to interpret the high court’s recent emergency orders siding with the administration, which have often come with no or little explanation.

“The Supreme Court has clearly determined that agencies should be able to proceed with their restructuring efforts while litigation proceeds, even in the face of all the legal and equitable arguments that plaintiffs advance here,” the Justice Department wrote in court filings.

The states pushed back, arguing the justices’ ruling “says nothing about the district court’s conclusions regarding the distinct factual record and narrow preliminary relief here.”

The 1st Circuit panel comprised U.S. Circuit Judges Lara Montecalvo, Julie Rikelman and Seth Aframe, all nominated to the bench by Biden.

NEWPORT – Immigration enforcement agents took a man into custody outside a Newport motel Wednesday morning in a highly public arrest that sent fear through many workers who staff local lodging and restaurant jobs.

It is unclear how many arrests by U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement officers have made in Lincoln County since the Trump Administration’s enforcement crackdown. But Wednesday’s detention was certainly the most public, as several unmarked ICE vehicles and masked agents took a man from his vehicle about 8 a.m. in front of the Allred Hotel on Elizabeth Street.

Since Trump took office immigration arrests in Oregon have tripled, according to data collected by Berkley Law’s Deportation Data Project. However, the number of arrests is relatively low when compared to other states – partly because of Oregon’s status as a sanctuary state. Under Oregon law, local law enforcement agencies are prohibited from using public resources to support or assist federal immigration enforcement.

Oregon does not have its own overnight detention center and to hold someone they have to be taken to a detention center in Tacoma, Wash., creating a hurdle for immigration arrests in the state. A rapid response network has also been established to help detainees and their families, including a hotline run by Portland Immigration Rights Coalition that helps verify ICE sightings and get people connected with lawyers.

Still, Oregon residents are getting detained, including a father outside his child’s school in Beaverton, Woodburn farmworkers headed to blueberry fields and an asylum seeker from Newport who won his court battle for unlawful detention.

In Newport Wednesday morning, several agents in unmarked immigration enforcement vehicles took a man from his car and told a woman accompanying him she had a week to leave the country, witnesses told the Lincoln Chronicle.

Four vehicles surrounded the car and six agents – four who wore masks covering their faces — were in the street across by the Allred Hotel.

A Nye Beach business owner was on her way to work when she stopped to take videos of the encounter. While she was filming, she shouted to the woman, reminding her of her rights. The business owner later spoke to the woman and learned ICE agents told her she had a week to leave the country and that the woman had obtained a lawyer.

“I lived here my whole life and never saw anything like it,” the business owner told the Chronicle. “I wished more people stopped and got out of their car when they saw it happening.”

Two guests of the Allred Hotel saw agents detain the man from their third story room and watched the scene unfold from the balcony in their bathrobes. They counted the number of unmarked vehicles and agents they saw in the street below and relayed it to a member of Oregon’s rapid response network who came to collect details later that morning.

The Elizabeth Hotel managers declined to comment. Employees at the Allred Hotel said they didn’t witness the incident firsthand but had heard about the immigration enforcement vehicles that morning and had seen videos posted on community Facebook groups.

Word quickly spread through the community, and workers were fearful of being profiled, a Newport Bayfront employee told the Chronicle. Some restaurant managers shared resources so that employees were aware of their rights and had access to the immigration response hotline.

Several employees of Bayfront restaurants said they were understaffed Wednesday because employees were afraid to come to work and some businesses closed due to the lack of staff.

“My co-workers are in danger and scared,” a Bayfront restaurant employee told the Chronicle.

Later Wednesday afternoon, a man along U.S. Highway 101 held a painted surfboard in protest with the words “ICE is here attacking our community.”

There have been other detentions in Newport before Wednesday, but the rapid response hotline did not have specific data to share, a hotline worker told the Chronicle. The rapid response network could only confirm one detention Wednesday in Newport.

The Newport Police Department issued a short press release Wednesday afternoon saying it had no prior knowledge of the ICE operation and did not assist in any way.

ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://lincolnchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/548596362_10238541722630314_300349476850331774_n.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 18:57:08.525152

October 2025 Visa Bulletin Update: Big Advancement

FY 2025 EB-5 Unreserved Category Reaches Annual Cap

USCIS Reintroduces Revised Naturalization Civics Test

Supreme Court Allows Immigration Detentions in Los Angeles to Continue

October 2025 Visa Bulletin Update – Advancement! Get Ready to File AOS Cases

Although several FY2025 Immigrant Visa limits were reached in September, the Department of State’s October 2025 Visa Bulletin marks several developments for employment-based immigration categories.

Final Action Date Chart: EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 categories show modest advancement, with some countries, including China and India, seeing progress of up to 3.5 months.

Dates for Filing Chart: EB-1 through EB-3, with certain categories advancing over a year.

Impact: Employers should review the updated Final Action and Filing Charts to identify employees who may now be eligible for adjustment of status. It’s essential to prepare related I-485 applications, I-140 petitions, and other documentation promptly to avoid delays and risk of missing the filing window. Clear communication with affected employees will ensure they understand next steps and expectations.

FY 2025 EB-5 Unreserved Category Reaches Annual Cap

The Department of State has confirmed that the EB-5 Unreserved immigrant visa category has reached its annual limit for FY 2025 and will remain unavailable until October 1, 2025, when the new fiscal year begins. Until then, U.S. embassies and consulates will not issue EB-5 Unreserved visas, and USCIS cannot approve adjustment of status (AOS) applications in this category.

Applicants may still submit AOS filings, but adjudication and final approval will be paused until new visa numbers are released in October. Interviews may proceed, though final decisions will not be issued until the category reopens.

Impact: Employers should anticipate short-term delays for employees or candidates in the EB-5 Unreserved category and communicate this clearly to manage expectations. Planning for October filings and monitoring the Visa Bulletin will be essential to minimize disruption to onboarding and workforce mobility plans.

USCIS Reintroduces Revised Naturalization Civics Test

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced it will implement the 2025 Naturalization Civics Test, effective for applications filed on or after October 18, 2025. The new test draws heavily from the 2020 version, with about 75% of questions carried over from the 2008 test and 25% updated or newly created. Applicants will be asked up to 20 questions from a 128-question bank and must answer 12 correctly to pass, with officers now stopping once an applicant either passes or fails to reduce unnecessary questioning.

Applications filed before October 18, 2025, will continue to use the 2008 civics test. Applicants age 65+ with 20+ years of permanent residence remain eligible for a simplified 10-question version, based on their filing date. Updated study materials for both versions will be published by USCIS to ensure applicants can prepare appropriately.

Impact: While this change primarily affects employees pursuing U.S. citizenship, HR and mobility teams should expect questions from staff on timing, eligibility, and preparation. Employers can support employees by helping them understand which test applies based on filing date and directing them to updated USCIS study resources.

Supreme Court Allows Immigration Detentions in Los Angeles to Continu

On September 8, 2025, the Supreme Court granted a stay in Noem v. Perdomo, allowing immigration officers to continue detaining individuals in the Los Angeles area based on factors such as language, race/ethnicity, or type of employment while litigation proceeds. This means workplace-adjacent stops at car washes, construction sites, farms, and day-labor gathering areas may continue, raising visibility of enforcement in the community.

Justice Kavanaugh concurred, citing extraordinary levels of illegal immigration, while Justice Sotomayor dissented, warning the practice risks sweeping in U.S. citizens and lawful residents and raises constitutional concerns.",https://wolfsdorf.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/News-Digest-Header-1.png,N,,2025-09-18 13:58:32.012986

“Following an investigation, the City of Portland will send a land use violation notice this Friday for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in [South] Portland,” said city spokesman Cody Bowman, “launching a process to determine whether the site’s detention practices comply with the conditions of the site’s land use approval.”

The city said in its statement that, based on federal government records, it identified “more than two dozen detention policy violations of the facility’s land use conditions of approval with the city, which does not allow detainees to be kept overnight or held for more than 12 hours.”

The ICE facility on South Macadam Avenue has been the site of frequent clashes this spring and summer between protesters and federal officers, some resulting in arrests.

This spring, the Portland City Council debated whether to revoke ICE’s permit to operate its South Portland facility, but ultimately did not, saying the city’s hands were tied so long as ICE had broken no rules it had agreed to.

“In response to formal complaints, the city’s permitting bureau launched an investigation in late July,” the city noted in its statement. “Records indicate that detainees were held beyond the facility’s 12-hour limit or kept overnight 25 times between October 1, 2024, and July 27, 2025.”

After the city files the violation, the respondent has 30 days to right the issue.

Khalil’s attorneys laid out the latest in a New Jersey federal court filing Wednesday to U.S. District Judge Michael E. Farbiarz, a Biden appointee who has overseen some of Khalil’s litigation, which has been playing out in different courts following his March arrest. The lawful permanent U.S. resident argues that the administration has been retaliating against him for speaking out for Palestinians. (He was born in Syria and is a citizen of Algeria.)

Farbiarz ordered his release in June, finding Khalil wasn’t a flight risk or danger to the community, and the litigation has continued as the administration keeps pressing for his deportation.

The DOJ immigration judge, Jamee Comans, ruled Sept. 12 that Khalil isn’t entitled to a waiver of his removal. While noting factors in his favor like having family ties via his U.S. citizen wife and infant son, the immigration judge wrote that she “lacks authority to question foreign policy determinations” by the administration, which has claimed Khalil’s presence “has potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

Comans said that deference alone precludes a waiver. Noting that Farbiarz previously precluded removal on that ground, she gave additional reasons as well, citing what she called Khalil’s “fraud” during the immigration application process when he “failed to disclose his involvement” in pro-Palestinian groups.

Khalil and his lawyers have rejected the fraud claim as a post-hoc justification to retaliate against him after Farbiarz ruled that he couldn’t be deported on the foreign policy ground. One of Khalil’s lawyers, Ramzi Kassem, said that when “the immigration prosecutor, judge, and jailor all answer to Donald Trump, and that one man is eager to weaponize the system in a desperate bid to silence Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. permanent resident whose only supposed sin is that he stands against an ongoing genocide in Palestine, this is the result.” Kassem said the “plain-as-day First Amendment violation that also puts on sharp display the rapidly free-falling credibility of the entire U.S. immigration system.”

In their Wednesday filing to Farbiarz, Khalil’s lawyers said the government’s continued pursuit of his removal based on what they called the “Post-Hoc Charge,” as well as what they called the “highly unusual developments” in his immigration proceedings, “is part and parcel” of the government’s retaliation “for his constitutionally protected expression in support of Palestinian rights.” They said it’s a “substantial threat” to his “liberty, family integrity and if ultimately removed, his physical safety.”

As for what’s next in the litigation, they noted that they have 30 days from Sept. 12 to appeal Comans’ order to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which, like DOJ immigration judges, is housed within the executive branch, not the judicial branch, like Farbiarz.

His lawyers told Farbiarz that, given the administration’s targeting of Khalil, they expect the appellate board to swiftly approve Comans’ order, which, they wrote, would mean Khalil “will lose his lawful permanent resident status, including his right to reside and work in the United States, and have a final order of removal against him.”

That’s not the end of the case, because Khalil can appeal the removal order in federal court. But, as they explained to Farbiarz, the circuit in which that appeal would proceed — the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit — “almost never grants stays of removal to noncitizens pursuing petitions for review of BIA decisions.”

That led them to tell Farbiarz that “the only meaningful impediment” to Khalil’s removal would be a prior order from him to block removal while federal habeas corpus proceedings are pending. They concluded by telling the New Jersey judge that they will be pressing their litigation in his court regarding Khalil’s claim that the administration’s action against him is “pretextual First Amendment retaliation.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250918-mahmoud-khalil-mn-0830-6fc377.jpg",N,,2025-09-18 13:58:36.135666

There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy.
The Constitution establishes a clear civil-military divide because the founders understood that when the military becomes a tool of domestic control, constitutional democracy dies.
Today, the danger is not from foreign invasion or civil war, but instead the methodical dismantling of constitutional governance by a president sworn to uphold it.","In 1952, seven years after the end of the Second World War, Congress established Constitution Day to celebrate our country’s sacred foundational document. In the more than 70 years since, most Americans have taken for granted the fundamental freedoms this day honors. There are no parades, no barbecues, and no mattress sales for Constitution Day. In many ways, this low profile is a sign of strength.

But this year, that complacency feels perilous. Fundamental pillars of our democracy are under assault, and the situation is more dire than many realize. That’s why we can no longer assume the Constitution will simply survive through benign neglect.We must fight to protect and strengthen it.

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought.

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought. As our country has evolved and expanded rights and advanced democratic reforms, this framework – through its many iterations and amendments – has remained true to its core throughout. Through civil war and depression, world wars and social upheavals, through the peaceful transfer of power across generations and parties, Americans have been able to count on the Constitution being there.

Today we are facing a new type of threat. There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy. This assault should alarm anyone who values constitutional governance and the personal freedoms we so often take for granted.

Alarmingly, we’re witnessing the intrusion of military force into civilian life. Earlier this summer the president deployed Marines and National Guard units to crack down on protests in Los Angeles and has thousands of Guard members patrolling the streets of Washington D.C. The administration has signaled that this is just the start, with plans to deploy more troops onto American streets in Chicago and possibly elsewhere.

There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy.

This violates a founding principle of American governance, enshrined in the Posse Comitatus Act, that military forces should not police civilians. The Constitution establishes a clear civil-military divide because the founders understood that when the military becomes a tool of domestic control, constitutional democracy dies. Immigration detention centers under construction on military bases echo some of the darkest chapters in our history and represent a dangerous conflation of military and civilian authority.

As we saw in Los Angeles, the deployment of troops is a fear tactic meant to silence opposition and criminalize dissent. But the attacks on the First Amendment are not isolated to targeting peaceful protest. The Trump administration has ushered in a new McCarthy era, sending a clear message that if someone disagrees with our government, they will be punished.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened.

Just look at this administration’s actions. Federal agents have repeatedly detained or arrested public officials conducting legitimate oversight, including Newark, New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka,Congresswoman LaMonica McIver, andSenator Alex Padilla, who was tackled and detained for asking Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions. Students, including green card holders, have been detained and threatened with deportation for writing op-eds or expressing views that deviate from what the administration deems acceptable.

The administration is not content with silencing critics — it rejects the very concept of legitimate political opposition. Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller recently declared ""The Democrat party is not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization."" Coming from an administration that’s literally prosecuting a democratic congresswoman on invented felony charges stemming from her oversight of an ICE facility, this explicit rejection of political pluralism is chilling.

Perhaps most dangerously, the Trump administration is ignoring the rule of law and corrupting justice itself. The president has targeted law firms whose attorneys investigated him, stripping their security clearances, barring attorneys from federal buildings, and terminating government contracts unless firms agree to coercive demands for ""pro bono"" services. He excoriates judges who issue unfavorable rulings, calling them ""radical left lunatics"" and ""deranged,"" while encouraging calls for impeachment or worse. Ominously, the Justice Department is now seeking financial sanctions against immigration attorney Joshua Schroeder for filing emergency motions to halt his client's deportation — the first case under a new Trump directive to personally target lawyers who challenge administration policies.

Military forces now police civilians. Members of Congress are arrested for doing their jobs. The president's top adviser declares the opposition party illegitimate. Judges and lawyers face threats for upholding the law. This is the systematic dismantling of constitutional governance.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened. Today, the danger is not from foreign invasion or civil war, but instead the methodical dismantling of constitutional governance by a president sworn to uphold it. At a moment when we are seeing political violence escalating — claiming lives and threatening the very free discourse our Constitution protects — we must choose peaceful democratic engagement over dehumanization and violence. The power ultimately lies with the people, and as a country we must decide whether we will defend our Constitution or let it fall.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/09/defend-the-constitution-s.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 13:57:47.025473

Mr. Khalil, who was a Columbia University graduate student when he was abruptly arrested by the Trump administration this year, is not in imminent danger of deportation.

A standing order from the federal judge, Michael E. Farbiarz, prohibits Mr. Khalil’s removal from the country. He has until October to appeal the immigration judge’s decision and further appeals could forestall his deportation.

But several months after he was released from detention in Louisiana, his legal plight is growing more dire.

Mr. Khalil’s case is progressing in two separate courts: A federal court in New Jersey, where Judge Farbiarz is scrutinizing constitutional issues, and an immigration court in Louisiana.

Immigration judges are part of the executive branch, not the judicial, and Judge Jamee E. Comans, who works for the Justice Department, appears eager to speed the matter along.

The tension between the judges has intensified, and the request by Mr. Khalil’s lawyers that Judge Farbiarz intervene, made in a court filing on Wednesday, could escalate the battle between the executive branch and the judiciary.

Mr. Khalil’s lawyers asked Judge Farbiarz for permission to refile their initial complaint with arguments that would encompass Judge Comans’s latest action, which they characterized as part of a pattern of retaliation by the Trump administration.

Mr. Khalil was a prominent presence at pro-Palestinian protests on the Columbia campus. When he returned to the White House, Mr. Trump was quick to crack down on those demonstrations and the schools that hosted them.

Since Mr. Khalil’s March arrest, the Trump administration has sought to deport him, although he is a legal permanent resident whose wife and infant son are American citizens.

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, cited a rarely used statute as the legal rationale for Mr. Khalil’s deportation, saying that his mere presence in the United States spread antisemitism.

More than a week later, after Mr. Khalil’s lawyers had begun to fight for his freedom, the administration added a separate rationale for deportation, saying that Mr. Khalil had failed to disclose membership in several organizations when he applied for legal residency in March 2024. A lawyer for Mr. Khalil has called those allegations “bogus.”

Mr. Khalil was detained in Louisiana for more than three months. He was behind bars in April when his wife gave birth to their son.

In May, Judge Farbiarz ruled that the law cited by Mr. Rubio was likely unconstitutional. The following month, the judge said that Mr. Khalil could no longer be held on that basis. After the government argued that it was instead holding Mr. Khalil based on the allegations related to his residency application, Judge Farbiarz ordered his release.

But the immigration court process continued.

On June 20 — the day of Mr. Khalil’s release — Judge Comans put in a written order her earlier statement that Mr. Khalil could be deported on the basis of the statute Mr. Rubio cited.

In July, Judge Farbiarz ordered that decision nullified.

Judge Comans heeded his order, but responded furiously in footnotes, accusing Judge Farbiarz of “interfering with the legal process and the authority of the immigration court.”

Last week, she said that Mr. Khalil could be deported in light of the allegations about his residency application.

According to Mr. Khalil’s lawyers, she continued to grant weight to Mr. Rubio’s determination.

She also said that because Judge Farbiarz had refused to allow her to rely on that determination, she was “compelled to make alternative findings.” Therefore, she indicated, she was using the allegations about Mr. Khalil’s residency application as a basis for deportation.

The Trump administration has accused Mr. Khalil of neglecting to disclose that he had worked with a United Nations agency that assists Palestinian refugees, as well as membership in Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a coalition of student groups involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

Mr. Khalil’s lawyers have said that Mr. Khalil participated in an internship at the U.N. agency through Columbia and considered it coursework rather than employment. They say Mr. Khalil was not a member of the coalition but a mediator, and that he took on that role after he applied for permanent residency.

In a statement Wednesday, Mr. Khalil said the administration had “resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide.”

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, saying that the Executive Office for Immigration Review does not comment on cases before the agency.

Mr. Khalil has 30 days to appeal Judge Comans’s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which may then consider his case at length. Mr. Khalil’s lawyers are concerned that the process might be swift — the board is also part of the Justice Department.

He could then appeal to a federal appeals court in Louisiana, though, as his lawyers noted, that appeals court often refuses to allow immigrants to stay in the country as they are appealing.

Last week, the New Mexico Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a report entitled “Civil Rights in Immigrant Detention Centers in New Mexico,” which stated that in July the committee’s nine members voted 7-2 to recommend closing the three immigrant detention centers following an inquiry initiated in October. Those facilities are the Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral and the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia.

The report details five major areas that it says guided the committee’s decisions: limited access to legal representation and rights education, shortcomings in credible fear interviews for asylum seekers, concerns about physical conditions and safety at the facilities, a contracting structure that the report describes as undermining oversight, and insufficient oversight and transparency.

According to the report, Christopher Saucedo, the advisory committee’s chair, and Douglas Turner, the committee’s vice chair, voted against the recommendations.

Representatives for CoreCivic, a Tennessee-based company that provides detention management services and operates the facilities located in Cibola and Torrance counties, and Management & Training Corporation, which is based in Utah and manages the Otero County Processing Center, defended the records of their respective companies.

Emily Lawhead, communications director for Management & Training Corporation, said her company refutes the allegations made in the report.

“The report mischaracterizes the Otero County Processing Center (OCPC) and conflates allegations across multiple New Mexico facilities,” Lawhead said in an email to New Mexico Political Report.

She added that the Otero County Processing Center operates under the daily oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and is routinely inspected and audited using ICE’s Performance-based National Detention Standards. Lawhead said that the Management & Training Corporation “consistently meet and exceed required benchmarks.”

“The people in our care have on-site medical and mental-health services, confidential access to legal counsel, private spaces for credible-fear interviews with certified language interpretation, and multiple documented grievance avenues,” she said.

Lawhead added that the staff is provided robust training as part of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, has zero-tolerance policies and shares performance data with government partners.

“Safety, dignity and process guide our work every day, and we welcome transparent oversight and visits to our facility to see our operations firsthand,” Lawhead stated in the email.

Brian Todd, public affairs manager for CoreCivic, defended the company’s record. He cited CoreCivic’s 40 years of providing services to the federal government under presidential administrations of both parties, and the company’s human rights policy that outlines its commitment to detainee rights, including policies related to legal rights, access to medical care, and security.

“Our responsibility is to care for each person respectfully and humanely while they receive the legal due process they are entitled to,” he said. Detainees, Todd said, are provided with a high standard of care, including 24/7 medical care and three meals a day.

Todd also countered claims of a lack of transparency. He stated that CoreCivics’s facilities are routinely subjected to independent audits without prior notice. He added that facilities are frequently visited by immigration attorneys, community volunteers, elected officials and friends and families of detainees.

The recommendations in the report also called for an end to county-level pass-through contracts for immigrant detention, which have been used to set up the three immigrant detention centers in New Mexico. According to the report, under such agreements, a county acts as a pass-through entity to provide ICE detention capacity using private contractors.

Opponents of the agreements say they allow contractors an avenue to bypass competitive bidding and federal procurement rules.

“By circumventing the ordinary federal procurement process, there might be a decline in transparency and competition that could improve the conditions of the facilities,” the report stated.

For years, immigrant rights activists and some lawmakers have lobbied for passage of legislation that would prohibit local bodies — such as counties— from entering into such agreements and requiring the termination of any existing ones. Such legislation passed the New Mexico House earlier this year but did not make it to the Senate floor.

A spokesperson for Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham hinted earlier this year that the governor was considering a ban on federal detention centers in an agenda for the upcoming special legislative session scheduled in October. New Mexico Political Report has since reported that the governor’s office has opted to push the issue off until the regular January session.",https://nmpoliticalreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2020/07/22-dju_20190606_Estancia_Loving_200-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 12:58:15.540392

The decision, issued Sept. 12, denied Khalil a waiver of removability, which could lead to a final order of removal, his legal team said.

According to the judge, Khalil omitted information about his involvement with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees and Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a student group, on his application for permanent residency.

Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, has been a prominent advocate for Palestinian human rights and has not been accused of any criminal activity. His legal team said he is challenging the decision.

“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” Khalil said in a statement.

“When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide,” he added. “Such fascist tactics will never deter me from continuing to advocate for my people’s liberation.”

Khalil’s lawyers argue the judge’s decision was based on “baseless, pretextual ‘misrepresentation’ charges the government added after his detention.” They said the immigration judge “rushed to a decision without providing a hearing on the evidence,” violating due process.

Federal court orders blocking Khalil’s detention or deportation remain in effect as his civil rights case proceeds in New Jersey.

In June, a federal judge in New Jersey blocked Khalil’s detention and deportation after finding the government’s original justification — based on an assertion from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Khalil’s activism could harm U.S. foreign policy interest — was likely unconstitutional.

Following that ruling, the government shifted its basis for removal to allegations of misrepresentations on his green card application, Khalil’s lawyers said.

“We have witnessed a constant lack of humanity and allegiance to the law throughout proceedings in this farcical Louisiana immigration court, and the immigration judge’s September 12 decision is just the most recent example of what occurs when the system requires an arbiter that is anything but neutral to do the administration’s bidding,” Johnny Sinodis, a lawyer representing Khalil, said in a statement. “As with other illegal efforts by the government, this too will be challenged and overcome.”

The Legal Debate Over IEEPA and Tariffs There are two issues at play in the ongoing legal debate over the Trump administration’s use of IEEPA.
Transparency, accountability, and judicial oversight: Importantly, the revised IEEPA should impose transparency, accountability, and judicial oversight requirements on the process.
And, importantly, the national emergency finding and measures imposed would have to be reviewed and updated every 2 years, subject to the same transparency, accountability, and oversight requirements.
The changes would be highly unlikely to undermine sanctions important to U.S. national security, such as the Iran or Russian sanctions programs.","U.S. President Donald Trump has asserted that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) gives him the authority to take unprecedented economic measures, including imposing tariffs, to address purported international emergencies. Courts are now hearing legal challenges to some of these measures while commentators struggle to make sense of their implications. The Trump administration’s uses of these national emergency powers have underscored the longstanding need for IEEPA reform. While litigation in the courts unfolds, Congress can take steps to revise IEEPA and strengthen transparency, accountability and oversight when the executive branch leverages U.S. economic powers in pursuit of national security and foreign policy goals.

Background on IEEPA

At issue are a wide array of sanctions programs that are a critical component of the U.S. national security and foreign policy toolkit. When resort to military force is not warranted, economic sanctions can exert U.S. economic power to address behavior contrary to U.S. national interests by foreign states or non-state actors as well as to demonstrate American resolve to confront international crises. IEEPA has been used to impose sanctions on Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Venezuela, Myanmar, and other countries, as well as on foreign terrorists and transnational criminal organizations. Depending on their scope, IEEPA sanctions can prohibit or restrict U.S. trade or transactions with sanctioned countries or entities, limiting their access to the U.S. banking system (and thus the global financial system) and to U.S. goods, services, and funds, ideally to alter or deter their behavior.

Trump has now used IEEPA authority to impose for the first time large tariffs across the global economy for widely disparate reasons, including to address large and persistent trade deficits globally; to sanction Brazil’s efforts to prosecute its former president and to respond to the country’s purported human rights violations; and most recently, to push India to stop buying Russian oil. No president has used IEEPA throughout its 50-year history to impose tariffs or steer trade relations, in large part because the U.S. Constitution expressly provides Congress with the power to “lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.” As a result, tariff rate-setting has traditionally been reserved to trade negotiations that require congressional approval.

The Legal Debate Over IEEPA and Tariffs

There are two issues at play in the ongoing legal debate over the Trump administration’s use of IEEPA. First, there is a narrow interpretive question: whether the president can impose tariffs under IEEPA’s broad grant of authority to “regulate … importation,” notwithstanding the statute’s absence of an express reference to tariffs or duties. Second, there is a more existential question of whether there are legal boundaries that courts can supervise regarding the president’s ability to declare a national emergency under IEEPA.

Can the President Impose Tariffs Under IEEPA?

The first question will have one of two fundamental outcomes. One view is that IEEPA does not include tariff imposition among its list of eight enumerated powers given to the president once a national emergency is declared—and that Congress would not have omitted the word “tariff” if it had intended to include that authority among IEEPA’s enumerated powers. The second view is that the power to “regulate … [the] importation …of” goods, which is a phrase contained in IEEPA, encompasses the power to impose tariffs.

To adopt the second interpretation, a court would need to engage in some interpretive gymnastics. It would first need to go beyond the plain language of the statute and read the power to tax into the power to regulate, against a backdrop in which Congress itself has consistently legislated tariffs for generations. In doing so, the court would also need to overcome the “major questions doctrine,” which limits the executive branch’s ability to interpret a statute broadly to regulate matters of “major economic and political significance” — which likely includes the unprecedented tariffs imposed by the president on almost all U.S. trading partners in response to longstanding trade conditions.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit articulates a narrow third way between these two outcomes: that the specific “trafficking” tariffs imposed on China for its failure to stop “chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other [transnational criminal organizations], criminals at large, and drugs” and the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed on a swath of countries to address large and persistent trade deficits are not authorized by IEEPA, without foreclosing the use of IEEPA to impose tariffs “at all.”

Can Courts Limit the President’s Ability to Declare National Emergencies Under IEEPA?

The second question is more challenging to assess. Conventional wisdom for government national security lawyers—myself included—is that the president’s ability to declare a national emergency is (more or less) unbounded, given the president’s preeminent authority in the arena of national security and foreign affairs and the lack of a meaningful, justiciable standard for courts to apply. Federal courts will understandably be unlikely to take on this issue out of due regard for the separation of powers, particularly where, as Justice Robert Jackson stated in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, the President acts “pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress.”

As the ongoing IEEPA litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has highlighted, courts face challenges in developing judicially manageable standards to constrain presidential decision-making, particularly in the context of an international emergency. The president leads a co-equal branch of government and one with greater power and expertise in foreign affairs, so courts have good reason to tread lightly.

There are various principles that a court could potentially invoke to test whether a president’s decision to declare and carry out a national emergency makes sense. For example, was the action made in “good faith”? Was there a “rational relationship” between the national emergency and the measures imposed? Did Congress expressly authorize the action, or did the president act in a “zone of twilight”? Or, as the dissent in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in VOS Selections recently stated, was there “an action as crossing the statutory boundary, after scrupulous and humble recognition of all the predictive, evaluative, and other judgment-call-based elements that, though people may passionately hold contrary views, are not subject to objective proof of error.” Faced with these difficult judgments, courts have declined to review the national emergency altogether, finding it to be a political question.

The deference historically afforded by courts in this area has perhaps encouraged or tacitly endorsed the longstanding practice by presidents across the 50 years since IEEPA’s enactment to declare national emergencies with only cursory public explanations for their actions. Presidents regularly declare national emergencies with a summary paragraph or two explaining the factual basis for the emergency in the chapeau of an executive order. The reasoning is often conclusory, and there is little fact-finding or analysis: Iran sponsors terrorism and is developing nuclear weapons; the import of conflict diamonds fuels armed conflict and human rights violations in Africa; Zimbabwe’s political leadership undermines its democratic processes, contributing to the breakdown of the rule of law; Russia’s invasion of Ukraine undermines peace and stability. The reasoning and factual basis given for a particular national emergency has generally been fairly scant.

Let’s consider an admittedly absurd example to illustrate the problem: Under current law, it would not be straightforward for the courts to decide whether a national emergency is appropriate to impose tariffs on imports of, for example, white tennis shoes. The president could declare that such shoe imports constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, or the economy. They could state that tariffs are needed to ensure a sufficient supply for national security purposes, or that white tennis shoe imports exacerbate trade deficits. Even more absurdly, the president could maintain that the increased albedo resulting from too many white tennis shoe imports could blind the U.S. military’s pilots. Just maybe?

In each of these absurd cases, it is not obvious whether the courts would review the national emergency declaration at all, what standards they would apply, how courts would come out on any such review, or how they would go about rejecting the president’s findings. Administrations have historically exercised IEEPA’s significant powers where there is some consensus on the need for action and the authorities used, and litigants have infrequently challenged the president’s declaration of a national emergency. Courts have to date mostly punted on this decision-making, noting a considered preference to stay out of national security and foreign policy judgments. Even with a need or opportunity to delve into the facts underlying a national emergency, courts may be reluctant to ask the Executive branch to develop a factual record for a host of reasons, including questions about the applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act, the absence of express authority to do so under IEEPA, and the broader context with respect to the political questions doctrine.

If absurd cases like the white tennis shoe example might vex jurists to an extent, courts will almost certainly balk at assessing whether large and persistent trade deficits can constitute a national emergency—even after many years of economic diplomacy. Likewise, courts may be disinclined to second-guess whether the Brazilian prosecutor’s decision to prosecute former President Jair Bolsonaro, along with other actions by the Brazilian government purportedly to restrict free speech, undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy. Some commentary has deemed these national emergencies to be outrageous, but will courts be able to draw effective lines to discipline abuse of the IEEPA authorities?

Checks introduced by Congress in legislative reforms in 1976 to the president’s ability to impose and continue a national emergency have proven illusory. The National Emergencies Act requires termination of a national emergency after one year unless the president transmits a notice to Congress continuing the national emergency. The form and content of the continuation notice are not prescribed in the legislation, and the reports, transmitted largely by the Department of the Treasury on an annual basis, are often devoid of salient information on the need to continue the emergency. Congress ostensibly plays a role by having statutory authority to terminate a national emergency through a joint resolution of Congress. This congressional check, however, is limited given that only a joint resolution enacted as law can terminate a national emergency—in practice, a two-thirds majority of both the House and the Senate that can survive a presidential veto.

Going Forward: Congressional Reform of IEEPA

Congress can make sensible changes to IEEPA to provide greater transparency, accountability, and meaningful judicial oversight while preserving presidential discretion to use IEEPA as it has been used successfully in the past: to leverage U.S. economic tools in support of foreign policy and national security goals in circumstances that are truly unusual and extraordinary.

Wide discretion, but with meaningful limits: First, the president should continue to have broad authority to declare national emergencies to respond to unusual and extraordinary threats to U.S. national security or foreign policy—but that authority should be limited in time. The president should be limited to 180 days during which they can impose emergency economic measures. After 180 days, the national emergency terminates, subject to the qualifications described below.

The 180-day period provides enough time for the ordinary legislative and policy-making process to take hold. Congress could pass a law to take appropriate action in response to the underlying threat. If there is a congressional stalemate, the revised IEEPA could provide an alternative mechanism as a safeguard—but not just a routine extension. Under a statutorily-prescribed process, the Secretary of State, as the lead of a committee composed of the Secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, and other relevant departments, could be required to publish a finding within 45 days of the national emergency declaration supported by an administrative record that provides the factual basis for the measures imposed.

This is not novel; existing committees such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and agencies such as Commerce, in the context of determinations under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act to restrict imports of goods that present a national security threat, can take economic measures to respond to national security challenges based on careful analysis, due process, or published findings, supported by administrative records.

Transparency, accountability, and judicial oversight: Importantly, the revised IEEPA should impose transparency, accountability, and judicial oversight requirements on the process. In addition to the requirement for a fact-based administrative record, consideration could be given to an expedited notice and comment process—to permit stakeholders to provide input on unintended consequences—and an analysis of the economic and political impacts.

The administrative record should be reviewable by the federal courts under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), potentially under a clearly erroneous standard for findings of fact, and an arbitrary and capricious standard for any legal determinations or measures. APA provisions that provide exemptions from its procedures where foreign affairs matters are involved should not apply to this process. Courts should be able to apply special procedures to handle and review any classified information in the administrative record.

And, importantly, the national emergency finding and measures imposed would have to be reviewed and updated every 2 years, subject to the same transparency, accountability, and oversight requirements.

Achieving Flexibility, Transparency, and Oversight is Possible

These suggested changes to IEEPA would preserve presidential flexibility to respond to sudden changes in the national security and foreign policy arena while enhancing transparency and independent oversight for responses that evolve from crises to long-term international challenges. The changes would be highly unlikely to undermine sanctions important to U.S. national security, such as the Iran or Russian sanctions programs. There would be greater administrative burdens on the government, although there should be ample material to make this burden manageable, even with short timeframes, and there will be increased potential for litigation than is likely now.

Overall, the reforms would drive more purposeful policy making by requiring the executive branch to take a hard look at its sanctions programs and justify its decisions to the public to the maximum extent practicable. Lastly, it would give judges a framework in a national security and foreign policy context for doing what they do best—assessing facts and making decisions based on clearly articulated standards.

And what impact would these changes have on a national emergency declared to impose tariffs on white tennis shoe imports? While it would not guarantee that such orders would be invalidated, it would force the executive branch to justify such actions with a fact-based explanation for why extraordinary measures are needed and give the courts the power to review those decisions. That would be an improvement over the status quo, in which it is often taken for granted that IEEPA provides a blank check to the president.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-22167800081.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 13:58:46.351737

Washington, D.C. — UnidosUS, joined by 43 leading civil rights and advocacy organizations, today released a letter calling on Congressional leaders to take immediate action to stop the unlawful deployment of military forces in U.S. cities and protect the civil rights of all Americans.

The letter is addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as they work to avert a government shutdown. It warns that recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions and executive branch actions — including those enabling racial profiling and using military resources for immigration enforcement and routine law enforcement — “perpetuate executive branch overreach, undermine constitutional safeguards and civil rights and set a dangerous precedent for all American communities.” The groups note that these actions will weaken legal protections and exacerbate civil rights abuses against all U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.

Congress has both the authority and the responsibility to ensure that taxpayer money is not used to support these unlawful deployments,” said Janet Murguía, president and CEO of UnidosUS.

The letter cites deployments of the National Guard and other military resources in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles as violations of the Posse Comitatus Act. It warns that these practices “weaken trust in government and destabilize families and neighborhoods” at a time when fear and division are already at dangerous levels.

UnidosUS and civil rights allies and advocacy partners urge Congress to use its constitutional authority to:

Prevent the misuse of military resources for immigration enforcement or routine law enforcement in U.S. cities, including National Guard troops in Title 10 or Title 32 status.

Hold federal officials accountable for violating the civil rights of citizens and law-abiding immigrants.

Ensure that funds and taxpayer dollars are not used to support unlawful military deployments, including activities prohibited under 18 U.S.C. § 1385 (Posse Comitatus Act), such as crowd control, search and seizure, checkpoints, arrests or interrogations.

UnidosUS and the organizations joining the letter have requested a written response from Congressional leaders by Friday, September 26, outlining the steps Congress will take to meet these demands. The groups emphasize their readiness to work with Congress to safeguard democratic principles and ensure that the rights of all Americans are protected.

“Make no mistake: this isn’t just about Washington, D.C. or Los Angeles. President Trump is attempting to write himself a blank check to deploy federal agents and military troops against the very people they are supposed to protect. Congress must hold the Trump administration accountable for using federal forces to suppress dissent and target our immigrant neighbors and unhoused people,” said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer at the American Civil Liberties Union.

“This misuse of the military is not only impacting our immigrant community but also citizens. As someone who works in higher ed, I had to cancel a trip to DC to a Smithsonian after multiple (citizen) students expressed their discomfort at the idea of being present in DC. This is impacting education, civil rights and so much more,” said Ana Lopez Martinez of Casa de la Cultura.

“In Eagle Pass, multiple military deployments have led to repeated rights abuses, including racial profiling, asylum pushbacks, family separation, physical violence and death, as well as community trauma, destruction of public property and pollution. The military has no place in public safety and community health. On the contrary, they put our lives at risk,” said Ari Sawyer, co-director at Frontera Federation.

“Deploying the National Guard into our communities only serves to stifle local economies, instill fear, break trust and divert vital federal funding from lifesaving programs. The National Guard should not be used as a political ploy to intimidate, nor is it to be used as a tool for civilian law enforcement. The manner by which the Trump administration is using the National Guard is a threat to our democracy. Hispanic Federation calls on Congress to take action and pass meaningful legislation to prevent the misuse of military enforcement on our communities,” said Frankie Miranda, president and CEO of Hispanic Federation.

“The militarization of our cities is a direct assault on the civil rights of working families — especially immigrants, Latinos and communities of color. For decades, these communities have carried the weight of discriminatory policing and surveillance, now intensified by executive overreach and unconstitutional enforcement. When neighborhoods are treated like battlefields and families like expendable pawns, our democracy suffers. Congress must act decisively to end these abuses, safeguard due process and ensure that working people are protected. True security will never come from armed patrols in our streets, but from justice, solidarity and the power of people standing together,” said Evelyn DeJesus, national president at Labor Council for Latin American Advancement.

“Deploying the military into our neighborhoods is unlawful, dangerous and a direct assault on civil rights and democratic freedoms. Latinos, along with other minority communities, know too well the pain, fear and harm caused by racial profiling, over-policing and surveillance. Normalizing the use of troops against our own people is not public safety — it’s abuse of power. We call on Congress to act now to end these practices and defend every family’s right to live in dignity and safety,” said Katharine Pichardo, president and CEO of Latino Victory.

“As a Marine veteran and LULAC President, I cannot stay silent while the freedoms I wore the uniform to defend are trampled here at home. For 96 years, LULAC has fought to protect Latino families and all Americans from discrimination. The Supreme Court’s green light for racial profiling, paired with unlawful military deployments in our neighborhoods, undermines the Constitution and dishonors the values our service members risk their lives for. The military’s duty is to defend our nation—not police our communities. LULAC stands with our allies to say clearly: no community is expendable, and we will not allow civil rights to be sacrificed under the guise of enforcement,” said Roman Palomares, national president and board chairman of LULAC.

“Our families deserve safety, dignity and full protection, not unlawful use of military deployment in our neighborhoods. Misusing the military to engage in racial profiling is abuse of power and a dangerous violation of human and civil rights. This is not who we are as a democracy. Congress must act now to uphold civil rights, due process and constitutional protections for every family in this nation,” said Hector Sanchez Barba, president and CEO of Mi Familia Vota.

“We need Congress to step up and protect the people who voted for them. Across the country, this president is abusing military and federal police powers to sow chaos and fear throughout Black and brown communities while trampling on our civil rights. American citizens, lawful immigrants and innocent youths have been swept up in needless and cruel arrests, upending their lives. This must end. If Congress fails to act, then the American people will send a clear message to lawmakers that civil rights are non-negotiable,” said Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP.

“Deployment of the military against civilians not only violates deeply held constitutional principles, but also poses a grave threat to civil rights by evading democratic oversight and enabling the use of force without public accountability. It’s an erosion of constitutional safeguards and an infringement on the freedoms guaranteed to every American citizen,” said Marc H. Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League.

“This is not a drill. Federal immigration and law enforcement agents’ unhinged overreach is wholly at odds with America’s foundational and historical values. Our federal bureaucracy should not order militarized and forceful government actions against people in our communities and neighborhoods. As things stand, all of our civil, constitutional and democratic rights hang in the balance. We must act now, or we risk losing everything generations of Americans have fought to protect for nearly 250 years,” said Drew P. Schaffer, director of the William E.

Introduction

H-2B is one of many U.S. temporary work visa programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 created some of the existing temporary work visas, including the H-2 visas for foreign nationals “coming temporarily to the United States to perform other temporary services or labor, if unemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country.” In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) split the H-2 visa into two separate visas: the H-2A for temporary workers employed in agricultural occupations and H-2B for temporary workers in occupations outside of agriculture. More specifically, the purpose of the H-2B program is for circumstances when nonagricultural employers cannot find sufficient U.S. workers in seasonal or temporary jobs and can prove to the U.S. Department of Labor that their need for an H-2B worker is legitimate. In practice, the most common H-2B occupations are in landscaping, construction, forestry, seafood and meat processing, traveling carnivals, restaurants, and hospitality. Legislation enacted subsequently to IRCA, the Immigration Act of 1990, established an annual numerical limit of H-2B visas that could be issued, of 66,000 visas, to take effect in fiscal year (FY) 1992. This annual numerical limit of 66,000 visas is often referred to as the H-2B annual “cap.”

As presently constructed, the H-2B visa program is deeply flawed. Like other temporary work visa programs, it is rife with abuse and in desperate need of reform. It fails to ensure that migrant workers are paid fairly and treated with dignity, and it fails to prevent harm to workers who already reside in the United States. It is of great concern that the current structure does not prevent employers with track records of labor, and wage and hour violations from hiring through the H-2B program. Current rules also make it easy for employers to game the system to bypass available U.S. workers who may be seeking seasonal jobs, and to then underpay migrant workers recruited through the H-2B program. Employers control the immigration status of their H-2B employees, leaving workers with little bargaining power or even the ability to leave a lawbreaking employer without losing their ability to earn back the significant investments migrant workers make to participate in the H-2B program. In addition, the families of H-2B workers, in practice, are not able to join workers in the United States, and H-2B workers have no path to permanent residence and U.S. citizenship, which prevents them from fully participating and integrating into American society, and reduces their potential contributions to the U.S. economy. Together, these flaws call into question the credibility of the program.

This is relevant today because employer demand for more H-2B visas continues to escalate, and successive presidential administrations have repeatedly used authority ceded by Congress to increase the size of the H-2B program since FY 2016. In light of the second Trump administration’s policies and actions to carry out “mass deportations,” employers are lobbying furiously for more H-2B visas to fill jobs left vacant by workers who have been deported or have left voluntarily, or who lost their work authorization as a result of the Trump administration’s canceling of temporary immigration protections like parole and Temporary Protected Status. The recent funding allocated for immigration enforcement via H.R.1 (the Republican-led budget bill that was passed by Republican lawmakers and signed into law by President Trump in July 2025 ) will turbocharge both deportations and employer pressure for more workers employed with temporary visas like H-2B. Meanwhile, neither the Biden administration nor the first or second Trump administrations has taken any actions to implement much-needed reforms that would protect migrant workers and U.S. workers as the H-2B program expands.

This report also assesses one industry, meatpacking, as a case study of an industry in which employers are currently not heavy users of the H-2B program but have been lobbying furiously to do so and may find a sympathetic Congress and administration, given Republican control of all three branches of government. Meat and poultry processing jobs are not all temporary jobs; in fact, most are year-round, permanent jobs, and current law requires that H-2B jobs be temporary, meaning 9 months or less (with some exceptions). This report considers the impact of expanding the H-2B program to year-round jobs in the meatpacking industry compared with providing green cards to currently unauthorized workers and hiring new permanent immigrant workers with green cards, who would have a path to a citizenship.

Arguably the United States needs pathways that allow more migrants to come to the United States—especially given demographic realities and the fact that nearly all prime-age workforce growth in the past 30 years has come from immigration. But the H-2B program is not a model for a fair and safe pathway because of flaws that leave workers vulnerable to wage theft, forced labor, and other forms of employer and labor recruiter lawbreaking, including human trafficking. In addition, as this report discusses, the available data on labor standards enforcement show that many employers have engaged in mass lawbreaking by stealing billions in wages from workers in major H-2B industries over the past 25 years.

In light of the abuses taking place in those industries, Congress and the executive branch expanding a flawed work visa program that channels vulnerable workers into those same problematic industries—rather than using the legal authority they have to improve the program so that both migrant and U.S. workers are adequately protected—is misguided. Rather than expand H-2B, the Trump administration should work with Congress to implement reforms that would protect all workers in H-2B industries and provide green cards for workers instead of temporary visas.

Background on the H-2B visa program size and appropriations riders

A previous report published in 2022 provides a fuller explanation of the background of the size of the H-2B program and a history of the legislative riders in appropriations bills that have been used to expand the size of the H-2B program. Nevertheless, a brief recap here is warranted. First, in fiscal year 2016, Congress authorized a “returning worker” exemption, through appropriations legislation to fund the operation of the U.S. government. The legislation included language (known as a “rider”) exempting H-2B workers from the cap in fiscal year 2016 if they were previously in H-2B status in any of the preceding three fiscal years. There was no cap on the number of returning H-2B workers under the exemption.

In each year since FY 2017, Congress has, through appropriations riders, given the executive branch the discretionary legal authority to roughly double the number of H-2B visas available. The Democrats and Republicans in the congressional appropriations committees who included and supported the language to expand H-2B failed to specify the level of increase they wanted for the H-2B program—passing the buck instead to the executive branch by directing DHS, in consultation with DOL, to determine how many additional H-2B visas are appropriate, if any. DHS has interpreted the statute as allowing them to issue up to 64,716 supplemental visas in the corresponding fiscal year. In total, it has been 10 years (FY 2016–2025) since Congress first permitted increases to the size of the H-2B program through an appropriations rider, and appropriations legislators have proposed rider language that would allow for additional visas beyond 64,716 for fiscal year 2026.

These additional visas above the cap set by Congress are generally referred to as “supplemental” visas. The Biden administration added 55,000 supplemental visas in 2022, setting the total H-2B cap for that year at 121,000. In the following three fiscal years (2023, 2024, and 2025), DHS under the Biden administration used the full authority granted to it in the legislative riders allowing the agency to issue 64,716 supplemental visas, raising the total H-2B annual limit to 130,716. While the first Trump administration used the authority granted to it by Congress to increase the size of the H-2B program with supplemental visas, representatives from the second administration have yet to state publicly any opinions on the size of the program and whether they would take action to expand it if granted the authority by Congress.

The true size of the H-2B program has reached 170,000

In 2021, USCIS began providing data, through the H-2B Employer Data Hub, on individual H-2B petitions that USCIS has adjudicated. H-2B petitions data are categorized under either new or continuing employment, including how many petitions for H-2B workers were approved or denied, and whether each approval was counted under the original annual cap of 66,000 or the supplemental cap for the corresponding fiscal year, or whether the H-2B job was exempt from the caps. In 2024, USCIS updated these data to provide additional clarity on the types of petitions filed on H-2B within those categories. The data now specify which petitions were for continuation of an H-2B petition with the same employer (in other words, H-2B workers who had their visas extended), how many petitions were for H-2B workers who changed employers, and how many were for H-2B workers who amended their conditions of employment. (H-2B visas that are approved for extensions, changing employers, and amending conditions of employment are not counted against the annual cap.) The newly released data date back to fiscal year 2015 and allow us to have a more complete picture of the true size of the H-2B program, even compared with the estimates published in 2022.

Figure A shows that in 2015, while the statutory cap of 66,000 was still in place, the total number of H-2B workers was higher at 75,122, of which 69,684 were H-2B workers with newly issued visas from the State Department, and 1,572 were H-2B workers who had their employment extended with the same employer. An additional 3,866 were H-2B workers who changed employers.

By 2024, when 64,716 supplemental H-2B visas were added to the statutory cap of 66,000, for a total cap of 130,716, there were a total of 169,177 H-2B workers, a total that is more than 2.5 times the size of the original H-2B annual cap. Of those nearly 170,000 H-2B workers, 139,541 were H-2B workers with newly issued visas from the State Department, and 4,580 were H-2B workers who had their employment extended with the same employer. An additional 25,056 were H-2B workers who changed employers.

H-2B workers are in a small number of industries and occupations for an average of 7.6 months

As discussed above, the data clearly show that the H-2B program is growing to unprecedented levels. However, H-2B workers are not spread across a wide range of industries and occupations but are highly concentrated in just a few.

Table 1 lists the top H-2B occupations by number of approvals in the USCIS H-2B Employer Data Hub, including approvals for initial employment (representing new H-2B jobs), continuing employment with the same employer (workers who have their H-2B job and status extended), and H-2B workers with approved petitions for changing employers. The data provided by USCIS for H-2B occupations are for broad occupational categories, which are reflected in Table 1. (Data on certified H-2B positions that are provided by DOL, on the other hand, categorize H-2B occupations under narrower titles distinguished by specific Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes, which fall under the broad categories provided by USCIS. DOL occupational data are discussed and analyzed later in this report.)

By far the top broad occupational category according to USCIS petition data is building and grounds cleaning and maintenance operations, accounting for 45.9% of all H-2B petitions counted, which corresponds to landscaping, maids and housekeepers, and janitors. The second largest occupation is food preparation and serving-related occupations, accounting for 14.1%, which correspond to jobs like restaurant cooks, food servers, and persons employed in fast food restaurants. The third largest is construction and extraction occupations, accounting for 7.7%, which correspond to construction laborers and other construction jobs like cement masons and concrete finishers.

As Table 1 shows, the top-10 occupations by number of approvals in the USCIS H-2B Employer Data Hub accounted for 98.8% of all H-2B approvals in 2024. If we exclude occupation number 7, “N/A”—which represents data observations in which the occupation field was missing—the remaining nine occupations still account for 94.5% of all H-2B approvals in 2024.

The average duration of H-2B jobs can be found by analyzing data from DOL’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification. The 243,798 certified jobs in fiscal year 2024 were approved for jobs with a duration of 232 days, or 7.6 months, with 86% of the jobs having been certified for 6 months or more, 75% certified for 7 months or more, 53% certified for 8 months or more, and 28% certified for 9 months or more.

A high-road employment strategy prioritizing green cards: Meatpacking as a case study

Despite the rapid increase in the size of the H-2B program, H-2B workers are concentrated in a small number of industries and occupations. By law, an employer’s need for an H-2B worker must be temporary or seasonal, but employers have been lobbying to expand H-2B into year-round, permanent jobs. Especially given the Trump administration’s determination to undertake a campaign of mass deportation and the massive influx of funding it has received through the Republican-led budget bill that was signed into law in July 2025, employers in many low-wage industries are looking for alternative employment strategies. One notable industry in which this push from employers for year-round H-2B workers is occurring is meatpacking—which we define as meat and poultry processing.

In this section, we consider some of the impacts on the industry, workers, and local economies if meatpacking employers were able to significantly increase their hiring of H-2B workers compared with a scenario in which workers have a permanent immigration status instead. In other words, if current unauthorized immigrant workers were provided with a path to a green card and citizenship, and/or if newly recruited immigrant workers were hired with a green card in hand.

Meatpacking is an industry with a clear history of employers weaponizing immigration trends and policies to hamstring the power of workers to demand higher job quality. In the early 20th century, meatpacking was arduous and unsafe work done overwhelmingly by foreign-born workers for extremely low pay. However, from the 1940s until the early 1980s, unionization rates in the sector were higher than in the manufacturing average, and this labor market power showed up as wages in the meatpacking sector actually exceeding the average of even the rest of the relatively high-wage manufacturing sector.

In the 1980s, however, unionization rates in the “animal slaughtering and processing” sector declined sharply, falling from 37.4% in 1983 to 20.5% in 1989. (This sector includes both meatpacking and poultry processing.) Historical research indicates that unionization trends (both the post-World War II increase and the subsequent fall) in this sector were largely driven by meatpacking. Unionization rates in this larger sector stayed roughly steady through the 1990s and 2000s, standing at 21.7% in 2007, right before the Great Recession. Since 2007 there has been a shallow (if uneven) decline, with unionization rates averaging under 19% since 2007. The year 2024 saw a very sharp one-year drop in the rate to 13.5%; it is unclear if this is a statistical blip or instead represents sustained downward pressure on unionization rates. Unionization rates in the animal processing sector remain about twice as high as the private-sector average (13.5% versus 6.7%) but far below rates prevailing in the early 1980s.

This decline in unionization rates corresponds with a rise in the share of the workforce that is foreign-born (shown in Figure B). This swapping out of unionized workers for many nonunionized immigrant workers was an intentional strategy of meatpacking employers who undertook aggressive recruitment campaigns in immigrant communities to find nonunion labor, including from beyond the borders of the United States. (Nevertheless, unions can and do unionize some foreign-born workers, despite the added difficulties caused by their immigration status, which makes them more vulnerable to exploitation and retaliation. However, data on their immigration statuses are not readily available (i.e., whether they are naturalized citizens, green card holders, or lack status)).

The precarity of much of the immigrant workforce in the meatpacking sector keeps wages suppressed—and not just for the foreign-born. In light of newly aggressive immigration enforcement, meatpacking employers may well be thinking about alternative ways to keep their workforce disempowered, especially if the option of large-scale employment of unauthorized workers becomes less viable. An obvious alternative model of immigration-based labor precarity would be to increase hiring through the H-2B visa program, since the program fails to fully protect the rights of migrant workers. At present, relatively few meatpacking employers hire through H-2B because the law only permits temporary jobs to be filled by H-2B workers, whereas meatpacking work is not temporary or seasonal. Expanded hiring of H-2B workers in meatpacking would require a statutory change, and reports from industry publications suggest that employers are, in fact, lobbying for that, as well as a change to allow hiring through the H-2A visa program, an uncapped visa program that is currently only permitted for seasonal farm jobs.

Why a precarious workforce for meatpacking is bad for local economies

A replacement of the existing precarious immigrant workforce with another precarious and temporary migrant workforce would do nothing to spur needed job-quality improvements in meatpacking. If the widespread adoption of H-2B visas went beyond this and began displacing unionized positions, already insufficient job quality would degrade significantly.

The possibility of visa-enabled suppression of workers’ wages and bargaining power would obviously be bad for meatpacking workers themselves, but this would also be bad for the local economies that meatpacking plants often anchor. The meatpacking industry in recent decades has seen pronounced concentration, with more and more meatpacking done by a smaller number of very large firms, but also done in more geographically concentrated plants, usually located far from metropolitan centers. The concentration of meatpacking in less urban parts of the United States means that meatpacking workers’ leverage is weaker due to a lack of easily obtainable alternative job options, should they lose their meatpacking jobs.

This geographic concentration also means that the local meatpacking plant is often a key engine of local economies. Anything that degrades workers’ wages at these plants translates directly into less money flowing into the local economies. The corresponding increase in profits and business income that accompanies successful wage suppression efforts is far less likely to redound to the benefit of these local economies. The owners of today’s meatpacking plants tend to be large corporate conglomerates that distribute profits to the shareholders and managers who overwhelmingly live outside the counties and towns that plants are located in.

Going forward, the choice facing the meatpacking industry seems to be a high-road or low-road workforce strategy, both of which will require changes to current U.S. law. The high-road strategy—converting today’s precarious immigrant pool into a unionized workforce (composed of both foreign-born workers with a permanent immigration status and U.S.-born workers)—will raise wages for meatpacking workers and raise spending and demand for labor in the local economies anchored by these plants. The low-road strategy—converting today’s precarious immigrant labor pool into tomorrow’s precarious temporary migrant labor pool—will do the opposite. Namely, the low-road strategy entails replacing current unauthorized immigrant workers and workers with time-limited protections like Temporary Protected Status and parole, with H-2B workers on temporary visas that fail to provide fundamental labor and workplace protections. That scenario will keep meatpacking wages extremely low and sap demand in local economies.

Wage gains from providing workers with a permanent immigration status would raise demand for goods and services in local economies

The potential stakes in this decision are not trivial. According to the Current Employment Statistics (CES) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the animal slaughtering and processing industry (including poultry processing) employs roughly 560,000 people in the United States. According to data from the Census of Manufacturing, these workers earn a combined payroll of nearly $30 billion. There were animal processing facilities in 37 states in 2022, and in 23 of them, its value of shipments (revenue) exceeded 1% of total gross state product (GSP). In recent decades, a growing share of meatpacking plants has been concentrating in rural and nonmetropolitan areas, making this one of the few key hubs of economic activity that is growing, rather than shrinking, in these regions.

In Table 2, we show the 23 states in which revenues of meatpacking constitute an economically significant part of the state’s overall activity—a threshold we define as 1% of GSP. Table 2 shows the total GSP in the 23 states, and then the value of shipments (revenue), payroll, value-added, and value of shipments as a percentage of GSP for animal slaughtering and processing, including poultry processing.

Table 3 shows total employment in animal processing (which includes both meat and poultry processing), and the shares of workers who are U.S.-born and foreign-born, and the subsets of the foreign-born who are naturalized citizens and noncitizens. Currently, foreign-born workers in the sector constitute over 40% of the workforce, and roughly three-fourths of these workers are not U.S. citizens. Noncitizen workers are likely a mix of unauthorized immigrant workers, green card holders including refugees and asylees, migrant workers with temporary visas, asylum seekers, and workers with temporary immigration protections like parole and Temporary Protected Status that provide legal work authorization.

Table 3 also shows that the implied labor market precarity of this workforce appears in average wages: Wages for U.S.-born workers are more than 25% higher than for foreign-born workers. Further, wages for both U.S.-born workers and foreign-born workers in the sector are significantly higher than wages reported for the 311 total jobs certified by the U.S. Department of Labor for new H-2B workers in the “butchers and meat cutters” and “slaughterers and meat packers” occupations in 2024.

The last two columns in the bottom half of the table show how wages in the meatpacking sector stack up against wages in the overall economy. The second column shows the ratio of average wages in the meatpacking sector to median wages in the overall economy for each group. The last column shows average wages per group in the overall economy, showing that average wages for all workers are significantly higher than for both U.S.-born and foreign-born meatpacking workers. One takeaway from this table is that for U.S.-born workers, the meatpacking sector is notably low wage, with average hourly wages constituting just 83.2% of typical (median) wages for U.S.-born workers across the overall economy. However, for foreign-born workers, average hourly wages in meatpacking exceed the median for foreign-born workers across the wider economy.

This wage advantage we see here for U.S.-born workers is right in line with many research-based estimates of the wage premium for having a permanent immigration status (a green card or citizenship) relative to either temporary work visas or the lack of an immigration status and work authorization. For example, Gass Kandilov found a 24.7% increase in wages for migrant workers on temporary visas, following the receipt of a green card, while Mukhopadhyay and Oxborrow also found a 25.4% increase in wages from transitioning from a temporary visa to a green card.

Similarly, Edwards and Ortega find that legalization erases 20% of the gap in observed productivity of unauthorized and U.S.-born workers, indicating that legal status alone would raise wages by (at least) 20% for workers receiving permanent status.

Given these estimates, we can provide a very rough calculation about how much wages would rise if the current foreign-born workforce in meat and poultry processing received a change in immigration status that granted them the same labor market rights and power as U.S.-born workers. These wage gains would translate essentially dollar-for-dollar into increased demand for goods and services in the local economies in which they work.

A 20% wage gain due to being granted permanent status (the midpoint of these estimates) would raise the overall payroll in meat and poultry processing—and hence, the demand flowing through the local economies surrounding meatpacking plants—by roughly 3.75%. In dollar terms, this would generate $1.1 billion additional dollars for the local economies surrounding meatpacking plants.

Importantly, Apgar finds that unauthorized workers and those in temporary work visa programs face essentially identical wage penalties relative to immigrants with long-term permanent status. She finds raw wage penalties of roughly 25% and regression-based wage penalties of 10–15%, and no significant difference in these between visa holders and unauthorized workers. This means that an employer strategy that instead sought to replace today’s unauthorized foreign-born workers in meatpacking with workers on temporary visas would not generate these wage gains and, hence, would fail to provide any boost to the local economies where these workers live.

Permanent immigrants will invest more in local economies because they send fewer remittances abroad than temporary migrants do

Besides the additional boost to local economies stemming from higher wages induced by granting permanent status to currently precarious workers, there are other potential benefits that would accrue from a program of granting permanent status and full workplace rights to today’s foreign-born meatpacking workforce. For one, evidence indicates that permanent immigrants spend more of their income in their country of residence than do temporary migrants. Temporary migrants tend to direct more consumption spending in their country of origin (often by taking more frequent trips there), and they also tend to remit a higher share of their income than permanent immigrants do.

The magnitude of these effects could be considerable. William Olney, for example, found that immigrants residing in Germany remitted 11% of their income abroad. This looks in line with what data from the United States would suggest: In 2024 remittances from the United States were roughly $230 billion based on the aggregate labor income of foreign-born workers of roughly $2.1 trillion in 2023.

Findings from two studies (one by Dustmann and Mestres and another by Pinger ) indicate that remittance rates among “temporary” migrants are 30% higher than rates for “permanent” immigrants. While it seems clear that workers on temporary visas in the United States are “temporary” and workers with permanent lawful status are “permanent,” it is not entirely clear how unauthorized immigrants currently living in the United States fit into these categories. However, if the Trump administration’s sharp increase in deportations and cancellations of status protections like TPS and parole continue, and it results in a large chunk of the current meatpacking workforce being replaced, the choice facing the meatpacking industry in terms of whether to take the low- or the high-road in constructing this future workforce maps near perfectly onto this “temporary” versus “permanent” distinction. Either the industry pushes for a system that allows employers to hire temporary workers on visas or a system in which long-term immigrants who are permanent residents can be recruited and will work in unionized jobs. The difference between the low- and high-road will have nontrivial effects on remittances—and by extension, the amount of income that meatpacking workers will spend in local economies.

If we take the foreign-born noncitizen share of the meatpacking workforce shown in Table 3 (29.9%) and assume that 5% of those workers have a permanent status via green cards, that means roughly 25% of workers in meatpacking are foreign-born and lack permanent status. Assume this workforce is converted to one with temporary work visas. In this case, those workers would likely remit 13.5% of their earnings (the average for foreign-born workers without permanent status). Conversely, a permanent regularization of status that saw their wages rise by 20% would also see their remittance rate drop to 10.5%. This, in turn, implies that remittances would drop by $220 million, and this money would flow to local economies.

While this likely overstates the number of “temporary” immigrants (because some share of the unauthorized population has resided in the United States for many years), it does give a sense of how important the temporary versus permanent distinction is for remittance behavior and how big an economic effect would be triggered by changes in the temporary or permanent classification. The obvious implication is that any move in either meatpacking or the wider economy to increase the share of the overall workforce on temporary work visas will see a rise in remittances that will come at the expense of demand for goods and services in local economies.

Family unity through green cards brings additional economic benefits

The remittances flow to the places where workers’ families live, which highlights another potential benefit from granting permanent status: Temporary migrants are far less likely to bring their families to the United States, including their spouses. This is especially true for workers on H-2A and H-2B visas. While H-2B workers are legally allowed to apply to have their spouses accompany them through H-4 visas, those spouses are not allowed to obtain work permits. Given that H-2A and H-2B workers earn very low wages, it does not make economic sense for them to apply for H-4 spousal visas, since the couple would have to survive in the United States—a higher-wage country than the countries of origin of most H-2A and H-2B workers—on just one low-wage salary. Also, as others have observed, there are additional reasons that contribute to very few spouses of H-2A and H-2B workers obtaining H-4 visas. If workers in the United States doing low-wage work on temporary work visas have spouses who remained in their country of origin, it seems obvious that workers on temporary work visas will remit a higher share of their income to support their families. If spouses are allowed to accompany workers to the United States, the remittances that previously went to spousal support abroad will instead spur demand for local economic output.

Additionally, spouses of working immigrants are themselves potential workers. If workers who would be employed in the United States on temporary work visas were instead granted permanent status—and hence, were able to bring working spouses to the United States—it would increase the labor supply and the rate of new business formation in local communities.

Consider two scenarios. In the first, the 25% of workers in the meatpacking industry who are foreign-born but not naturalized U.S. citizens or permanent residents, then become H-2B visa holders, and hence, are almost universally unable to have working spouses accompany them. In the second, these workers are instead granted permanent immigrant status via green cards. Assume that half of workers with permanent status bring working spouses to the United States and that two-thirds of the spouses work at a wage that is two-thirds as high as the spouses in meatpacking. This would generate an additional $1.3 billion in labor income for local economies surrounding meatpacking plants.

A high-road employment strategy for meatpacking with green cards would result in an additional $2.62 billion flowing to local economies surrounding meatpacking plants

In sum, the high-road employment scenario discussed here would lead to significant economic benefits for local economies surrounding meatpacking plants. First, there would be an additional $1.1 billion based on the likely wage gain due to workers having permanent status through green cards. There would be an additional $220 million resulting from the drop in remittances from workers having a green card compared with them being temporary workers. And an additional $1.3 billion in labor income would result from meatpacking workers with green cards who are able to keep their families together and have spouses who are permitted to work in the United States. Thus, the full economic impact of a high-road labor and immigration policy strategy for the meatpacking industry sums to about $2.62 billion in additional money flowing to local economies surrounding meatpacking plants. In the 23 states we identified previously that account for 80% of meatpacking activity, the average boost to state economies would be roughly $85 million per state.

Wages are still too low in H-2B occupations and undercut U.S. wage standards

Another important element of the H-2B program, and one that has been ripe for reform for many years, is the H-2B wage methodology, which sets out the minimum wages that employers must pay their H-2B workers. In most cases, since 2015, the DOL’s H-2B wage methodology has required that employers advertise most H-2B jobs to U.S. workers at the local average wage for the specific occupation and pay their H-2B employees that wage—according to data from the DOL’s Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey. While at first glance, this appears to be a reasonable wage rule, in practice, the available evidence makes clear that the H-2B wage rule is undercutting wage standards at the national level in H-2B occupations and is, therefore, not consistent with the law establishing the H-2B program.

To illustrate, see Table 4, which shows the top-15 H-2B occupations in fiscal year 2024 by Standard Occupational Classification code, according to the number of H-2B jobs certified by DOL. (These are narrower occupations that fall within the broader occupational codes used in Table 1 and by USCIS.) For context, as Table 4 shows, the top-15 H-2B occupations accounted for 82% of all certified H-2B jobs in 2024. The column to the right of the number of certified jobs is the nationwide average hourly wage for all certified H-2B workers in each of the occupations, according to our analysis of DOL disclosure data.

To the right of the H-2B average hourly wage column are the 2024 average hourly wage rates for all workers in the occupation nationwide, according to DOL’s OEWS survey, which is the same data set used to set H-2B wage rates, making it an apples-to-apples comparison. The final two columns show the difference between the average hourly certified wage for all H-2B workers nationwide in the occupation and the average hourly OEWS wage for all workers in the entire country—the dollar amount and in percentage terms. In other words, these numbers reveal the amounts by which certified H-2B wages are undercutting national-level wage standards in H-2B occupations. Table 4 clearly shows that the H-2B program is allowing employers to legally undercut U.S. wage standards, which harms all workers, regardless of whether they are U.S.-born citizens or foreign-born.

While, as noted above, H-2B wages are set at the local level according to each job, we must instead look at the impact of the H-2B program on the average wages of H-2B occupations at the national level because the H-2B statute sets a national standard for the protection of U.S. labor standards. The H-2B statute clearly states that H-2B workers can be hired only “if unemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country.” In order to determine whether there are “unemployed persons” in the United States capable of doing a job before an employer can hire an H-2B worker, employers should be required to offer at least the local, state, or national average wage for the occupation (whichever is highest), recruit U.S. workers nationwide, and offer to pay for housing and transportation for both U.S. and H-2B workers. But under the H-2B recruitment and wage regulations, that’s never been the case.

Table 4 shows that in all of the top-15 H-2B occupations in fiscal year 2024, the average hourly wage certified nationwide for H-2B workers was lower than the OEWS average hourly wage for all workers in the occupation. The biggest wage differential was found in the forest and conservation workers occupation: The national average hourly wage was $5.08 higher than the average wage certified for H-2B workers. The next biggest difference was for cement masons and concrete finishers, where the national average wage was $4.88 higher than the average wage certified for H-2B workers. If, for example, an employer hired an H-2B cement mason to work for 40 hours per week for the average duration of an H-2B job (approximately 33 weeks) at $4.88 per hour less than the national average wage—due to local wage variations, as the H-2B wage rule allows—the employer would save, and an H-2B worker would be underpaid by $6,442.

In the top occupations of landscaping and groundskeeping workers—which accounted for 37% of all H-2B certified jobs in 2024—the average H-2B wage was $2.11 lower per hour than the national average wage, almost 11% less. The construction laborers’ occupation, which is consistently one of the top H-2B occupations every year, had an average H-2B wage that was $3.79 less than the national average wage for the occupation, over 15% less. Employers in the seafood industry, who every year are some of the loudest voices calling for an increase in the H-2B cap, collectively paid their H-2B workers $4.13 less per hour than the national average wage in the meat, poultry, and fish cutters and trimmers occupation, over 22% less.

An easy way to fix this so that the H-2B wage rule no longer undercuts existing U.S. wage standards and so that it is consistent with the statute that establishes the program would be to require that employers pay at least the highest of the local, state, or national average wage for the occupation according to DOL’s OEWS data. DOL could even require a higher wage—for example, the 75th-percentile wage instead of the average—in order to incentivize additional recruitment of U.S. workers. DOL has the legal authority to make these changes via regulation—and given the popularity of the H-2B program among employers and employer pressure to increase the size of the program, the Trump administration should consider implementing such a rule in order to protect wage standards in H-2B occupations and ensure that migrant workers in H-2B are not exploited and underpaid relative to U.S. wage standards.

There’s an additional element of the current H-2B wage rule that allows employers to undercut wage standards in H-2B: employer-provided private wage surveys. Employers have the ability, under the current rules, to cherry-pick the data source they like in order to establish the legal minimum wage rates for their H-2B employees through non-governmental wage surveys that DOL approves. One can rightly assume that employers never go through the trouble of using one of these private wage surveys to increase the minimum wage they’ll pay their H-2B workers—they only use them to lower it. Seafood employers are fond of this loophole, and examples exist showing they are able to pay their workers much less than what the local and state average wage for the occupation would have required.

Wage theft is a massive problem in major H-2B industries: Employers have stolen over $2.2 billion from workers since 2000

As discussed in this report, H-2B workers are concentrated in a small number of industries and occupations. Data on labor standards enforcement paint a picture of rampant wage theft and lawbreaking by employers in those few industries that employ most H-2B workers, revealing that workers are being recruited into industries where they will be vulnerable. This is cause for concern, but especially so now given the rapid growth in the H-2B program and employer pressure to change the law to allow them to hire through H-2B for year-round jobs.

DOL’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) publishes and annually updates tables with summary data on the outcomes of WHD enforcement actions in what it calls “industries with high prevalence of H-2B workers.” The seven industries WHD lists in these data tables include landscaping services, janitorial services, hotels and motels, forestry, food services, construction, and amusement. Data on the top H-2B occupations (from the USCIS H-2B Employer Data Hub and DOL labor certifications cited in Tables 1 and 4) show that the vast majority of H-2B jobs that are certified by DOL and approved by USCIS are within these broad industries.

The published WHD enforcement data include tables for individual fiscal years in four different categories, for fiscal years 2014–2024. WHD previously published data going back to 2000, but they are no longer available online (but have been preserved by the author and used for this analysis). The first set of tables, “Compliance Action Summary,” includes data on violations of all wage and hour laws enforced by WHD in the listed industries. The second set of tables, “H-2B Violations Only,” summarizes employer violations of H-2B program laws and regulations. The third set, “FLSA Violations Only,” summarizes employer violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The final set, “All Other Violations,” summarizes violations of all laws that WHD enforces, except for violations of FLSA or H-2B laws and regulations.

It is important to note that the violations and back wages owed that are detailed in these tables from WHD do not represent enforcement actions that involve only H-2B workers; they represent violations and back wages owed to any worker in the seven selected H-2B industries. These may include U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (i.e., green card holders), H-2B workers, or workers of any other immigration status, including unauthorized immigrant workers.

Table 5 sums the total numbers of listed compliance actions and employees involved, along with the total amounts of back wages owed and civil money penalties (CMPs) across all 25 fiscal years, 2000–2024, adjusting WHD’s data on back wages owed and CMPs assessed to constant 2024 dollars. The average back wages owed per employee were calculated from WHD’s data and are also included.

Table 5 shows that across the 2000–2024 period, there were 247,180 compliance actions by WHD, and over 2 million workers were involved—i.e., were potential wage theft victims—in the cases that detected violations. Over 1.8 million of those workers were assessed by WHD to have actually been victims of wage theft—that is, their employers had failed to pay them the full wages to which they were entitled by law.

For those 1.8 million employees, WHD assessed a total of over $2.2 billion in back wages that were owed to them by their employers during the 25 fiscal years from 2000 through 2024. That’s an average of $89.5 million stolen per year from low-wage workers in the main industries that employ H-2B workers. Such a large dollar amount of stolen wages is particularly shocking when considering that most of the jobs in the seven major H-2B industries are associated with very low wages, as shown in Table 4.

It’s also important to remember that $2.2 billion represents only the extent of wage theft detected in the cases WHD investigated. There is no way to know the actual amounts of wages stolen in these industries. We do know that workers, especially low-wage workers—regardless of whether they are U.S.-born or foreign-born—often hesitate to report wage and hour and labor violations for fear of retaliation. We also know that WHD has limited investigative capacity, with annual funding that is flat and record-low numbers of WHD investigators on the job, with only 611 policing a labor market of 170 million workers as of May 2025. For these reasons, the actual extent of wage theft is likely higher—perhaps significantly higher—than $2.2 billion.

Table 5 also shows that on average, each worker who was assessed back wages was owed $1,228 by their employer. Back wages owed to workers were highest in construction with an average of $1,768 per worker. The second-highest amounts of back wages owed per worker were in landscaping—the industry that every year accounts for roughly 40% of all H-2B jobs—at $1,202 per worker.

In terms of civil money penalties, the total amount assessed during 2000–2024 was nearly $167.6 million. The largest share, $96.1 million (representing 57.3% of the total penalties), was assessed in food services. Construction accounted for 17.2% of the CMPs assessed at nearly $29 million.

The best solution: Major structural reforms to H-2B that provide a path to permanence for workers

As this report has shown, H-2B workers are underpaid and can only make temporary minor contributions to local economies under the status quo. Meanwhile, employer groups are lobbying furiously to expand the H-2B program by changing the law to allow employers to hire H-2B workers for year-round jobs—despite the rampant wage theft and employer lawbreaking occurring in major H-2B industries.

However, if members of Congress and the Trump administration believe in improving wages and working conditions for all workers, they should send a message to the business community that rather than expanding the deeply flawed H-2B program, a major reform is long overdue and needs to move forward. President Trump and congressional leaders should revamp the H-2B program by providing migrant workers with new protections, fairer wages, and a path to permanent resident status and citizenship. They should also implement reforms that would improve the integrity of the program, for example, by revamping the DOL system for recruitment to ensure that employers make adequate and genuine attempts to recruit and hire U.S. workers for open temporary and seasonal jobs. The administration and Congress should also prohibit lawbreaking employers from being allowed to recruit and hire through the H-2B program.

In general, legislation should be avoided that proposes to allow employers to hire more temporary H-2B workers or to hire through H-2B for permanent year-round jobs in industries like meatpacking. Instead, any proposed legislation should shift away from the use of temporary workers and create green cards—allowing migrant workers to stay in the United States permanently, increasing their economic contributions and participation in social and political life. That could contribute to stabilizing the workforce for employers and improving wages and working conditions for all workers, regardless of immigration status.

In terms of federal rulemaking, President Trump already has the legal authority to direct the leadership at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Labor to implement the many needed reforms through new or updated joint regulations and agency guidance. As of yet, there is no evidence showing that the Trump administration acknowledges the flaws in the H-2B program and that it will make an attempt through the regulatory process to protect U.S. workers employed in H-2B industries or migrant H-2B workers. If the Trump administration decides to propose regulations that would improve labor standards in H-2B industries, they should include, at a minimum:

the creation of a new registration system at DOL to screen and prohibit employers with a record of violating labor, wage and hour, civil rights, and anti-discrimination laws from hiring through the H-2B program

new regulations on wages and worker protections that require employers to pay the highest of the local, state, or national average wage for the specific job, and that end the use of employer-provided wage surveys to set H-2B wage rates

improvement of the January 2025 final rule that provides H-2B workers with limited portability to change jobs and employers, by increasing transparency for H-2B workers and making it easier for them to leave an abusive employment situation

These executive reforms would ensure that H-2B workers are paid fairly, would help prevent employers with records of violating labor and employment laws from hiring through the H-2B program, and would make it easier for workers to leave an abusive employment situation without losing the ability to earn money for the rest of their authorized employment period in the United States.

Together, congressional and executive reforms could transform a program that brings a temporary, exploitable, and underpaid workforce into one that brings permanent workers with full and equal rights to the United States. These workers would make long-term contributions and investments in local economies across the country, including in rural areas that desperately need them.

If an H-2B worker had an approved petition for a change of employer in the following fiscal year after having an approved petition for new employment, then they should be counted as an individual H-2B worker. However, it is possible that some H-2B workers may have an approved petition for new employment in the same fiscal year as an approved petition for changing employers, which would lead to those workers being counted twice in the data.

Approved H-2B petitions for an employment change with the same employer, new concurrent approvals, and amended approvals were excluded from the calculation and totaled 8,444.

The foreign-born share of the workforce in meatpacking is likely to be significantly higher, as Angela Stuesse and Nathan Dollar have argued, in part because of the inability of population surveys to adequately reflect what researchers have observed in ethnographic research.

To calculate this, we first need an estimate of the workforce that would see a clear wage gain from normalization of immigration status. 30% of the animal processing workforce is foreign-born and lacks citizenship. This number is likely higher in meatpacking than poultry processing, but for now we will use it to be conservative. If we assume (also likely conservatively, given qualitative research on this subject) that 5% of the noncitizen workforce in the sector has a green card, this leaves 25% of meatpacking workers who would see a 20% wage increase due to normalization of status. If we multiply the 25% of the workforce that this wage gain would apply to by the 20% increase and then by 75% (which is the share of industry-average wages they earn), this yields the 3.75% stated here.

This is calculated by multiplying 3.75% by the estimated 2024 payroll of $30 billion in the industry.

The overall remittance rate for the United States is roughly 11% ($230 billion in remittances on an immigrant wage bill of $2.1 trillion). Say that half of the foreign-born, noncitizen population of immigrants in the United States can be considered temporary and that this group makes 75% what foreign-born citizens make. This would imply that temporary immigrants account for 10% of the entire immigrant wage bill. Given this information and the fact that temporary immigrants’ remittance rates are 30% higher, we can calculate the remittance rate for permanent immigrants by dividing the overall remittance rate of 11% by the sum of 0.9 and (1.3*0.1), giving a permanent remittance rate of 10.7%. Multiplying by 1.3 gives a temporary remittance rate of 13.9%.

This calculation is based on the fact that the current payroll of meatpacking is $30 billion. Because foreign-born workers without permanent legal status constitute 25% of the workforce but make just 75% what other workers do, this implies their share of the overall wage bill is just under 19% (or $5.7 billion). If normalizing status reduces their remittance rate by 3.2% (the difference between the temporary remittance rate of 13.9% and the permanent remittance rate of 10.7% from the previous note), multiplying this by $5.7 billion and then by 1.2 to account for the wage boost from normalization implies $220 million in lower remittances and greater demand for local output.

See for example, David J. Bier, “The Facts About H-4 Visas for Spouses of H-1B Workers,” Cato At Liberty Blog (Cato Institute), June 16, 2020.

The assumptions on employment rates and wage rates of spouses are likely highly conservative. The employment rate of prime-age immigrants in the United States is closer to 80%, and even assuming all “spouses” of immigrants are female, the gender wage gap for low- to middle-wage workers is well under a third.

The amounts in the DOL data used to calculate these average wage rates are based on the lowest hourly wage that employers have been allowed to pay the workers who will fill the H-2B jobs that DOL has certified as demonstrating a legitimate need to hire an H-2B worker.

It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.
FALSE CLAIM: “During the first few weeks, some toilets and sinks didn’t work.” THE FACTS: Temporary maintenance issues were resolved immediately.
For many illegal aliens this is the best medical care they have received in their entire lives.
FALSE CLAIM: “One detainee had been given psychotropic medication but there was no record of that person ever consenting to it.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today set the record straight about the Washington Post’s false and misleading report on the Camp East Montana detention facility at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

“As our brave ICE law enforcement is facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults the Washington Post is choosing to smear them,"" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Here are the facts: any claim that there are “inhumane” conditions at ICE detention centers are categorically false. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members. It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by dieticians. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”

The following are FALSE claims made in the Washington Post’s article, as well as the facts:

FALSE CLAIM: “ICE’s inspectors found some people at Fort Bliss were being held without many basic human necessities.”

THE FACTS: Every detainee receives food, water, medical care, bedding and clean clothing. The Post twisted preliminary inspector notes into a smear campaign. The facility is climate-controlled and staffed to ensure safe and secure housing.

FALSE CLAIM: “During the first few weeks, some toilets and sinks didn’t work.”

THE FACTS: Temporary maintenance issues were resolved immediately. Detainees always had access to functioning lavatory and hygiene facilities.

FALSE CLAIM: “By September… only one of the four planned outdoor recreation areas had been completed… some detainees reported only getting three sessions in a two-week period.”

THE FACTS: Recreation is provided consistent with ICE standards.

FALSE CLAIM: “Due to concerns that detainees were not being given enough food, the facility decided to increase ‘overall meal calories by 30%,’… inspectors noted this plan had not been implemented.”

THE FACTS: The claim that ICE underfeeds detainees is false. They receive three meals a day. Certified dieticians evaluate meals and ensure they meet the appropriate standards.

FALSE CLAIM: “Inspectors also said contractors failed to follow mandatory procedures for medical care… charts never filled out… screenings never conducted.”

THE FACTS: Every detainee receives a medical intake screening and proper medical care. For many illegal aliens this is the best medical care they have received in their entire lives.

FALSE CLAIM: “One detainee had been given psychotropic medication but there was no record of that person ever consenting to it. Another had been placed on suicide watch but there was no record of anyone watching them.”

THE FACTS: ICE and its medical contractors follow federal medical guidelines. Oversight is constant, and serious cases are escalated immediately. This is fearmongering clickbait. All detainees have access to appropriate medical, dental, and mental health care, including emergency services. Health care staff have a valid professional licensure and/or certification for the jurisdiction in which they practice and will perform duties within the scope of their clinical license. Facility mental health providers, by virtue of their education, credentials, and experience, are permitted by law to evaluate and care for the mental health needs of patients in ICE custody. Medical treatment shall not be administered against the detainee’s will. If the detainee refuses to consent to treatment, medical staff will explain the medical risks to the detainee of declining treatment and make reasonable efforts to convince the detainee to voluntarily accept treatment in a language or manner that the detainee understands.

A detainee may be placed in administrative segregation when the detainee’s continued presence in the general population poses a threat to life, property, self, staff, or other detainees; for the secure and orderly operation of the facility; or for medical reasons. Staff shall observe and log observations on an irregular schedule; For cases that warrant increased observation, the staff shall observe detainees accordingly.

FALSE CLAIM: “When federal inspectors arrived in September… Camp East Montana had 286 security personnel for more than 1,200 detainees… only a portion of the 452 officers promised.”

THE FACTS: Staffing levels at new facilities scale with population. Camp East Montana’s ratio of officers to detainees fully meets safety requirements. The Post misled readers by comparing phased staffing numbers without sufficient background context.

FALSE CLAIM: “Armed guards stationed along the facility’s perimeter… instructions did not explain which situations would justify the use of lethal force.”

THE FACTS: ICE officers follow clear and strict rules on use of force consistent with federal law. The Post’s claim is irresponsible fear-baiting. The facility contract security staff is reviewing their Use of Force policy to align with ICE’s Use of Force policy.

FALSE CLAIM: “For the first three weeks of August… legal representatives and Rep. Veronica Escobar… were turned away.”

THE FACTS: Tours and legal visits are accommodated after construction is complete and security protocols are in place. This member showed up when they facility wasn’t even open yet. ICE did not “hide” conditions — safety dictated phased access. Congressmembers are aware of ICE’s 7-day visitation request requirement. There was absolutely no notice given to ICE despite policies that are in place in order to protect detainees and law enforcement.

FALSE CLAIM: “Inspectors later found that detainees were in the dark about their cases… they didn’t even know who their assigned deportation officer was.”

THE FACTS: Detainees are provided access to lawyers and have full due process—in fact the average illegal alien gets far more due process than most Americans.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly comes after the Republican administration’s Labor Day weekend attempt to remove Guatemalan migrant children who were living in government shelters and foster care.

Trump administration officials said they were seeking to reunify children with parents who wanted them returned home. “But that explanation crumbled like a house of cards about a week later,” Kelly wrote. “There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.”

There was already a temporary order in place preventing the removal of Guatemalan children. But that was set to expire Tuesday. Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, granted a preliminary injunction extends that temporary protection indefinitely, although the government can appeal.

Kelly did rebuff advocates’ push to block the removal of children from additional countries, though he said any attempt to remove those children in a similar way would likely be unlawful.

There are also temporary restraining orders in separate cases in Arizona and Illinois, but those cases are much more narrow in the scope of children they cover, underlining the importance of the Washington case.

In a late-night operation Aug. 30, the administration notified shelters where migrant children traveling alone initially live after they cross the U.S.-Mexico border that they would be returning the children to Guatemala and that they needed to have the kids ready to leave in a matter of hours.

Contractors for Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up the Guatemalan children from shelters and foster care and transported them to the airport. The government has said in court filings that it identified 457 children for possible removal to Guatemala although that list was eventually whittled down to 327. In the end, 76 got as far as boarding planes in El Paso and Harlingen, Texas, on Aug. 31 and were set to depart to Guatemala in what the government described as a first phase.

Immigration and children’s advocates, who had been alerted of possible efforts to remove Guatemalan minors, immediately sued the Trump administration to prevent the children’s removal. The advocates argued that many of these children were fleeing abuse or violence in their home countries and that the government was bypassing longstanding legal procedures meant to protect young migrants from being returned to potentially abusive or violent places.

Another federal judge in Washington granted advocates a temporary restraining order largely preventing the Trump administration from removing Guatemalan migrant children in its care except in limited circumstances where an immigration judge had already ordered their removal after reviewing their cases. That initial 14-day order was set to expire on Sunday, and then Kelly extended it through Tuesday to give him extra time to examine the case.

The government has argued that it has the right to return children in its care and it was acting at the behest of the Guatemalan government. But the government walked back an initial claim alleging the parents requested their children be sent back.

The Guatemalan government has said that it was concerned over minors in U.S. custody who were going to turn 18 and would then be at risk of being turned over to adult detention facilities.

Children who cross the southern border alone are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services. The children usually live in a network of shelters across the country that are overseen by the resettlement office until they are eventually released to a sponsor, usually a relative.

After advocates got the temporary restraining order approved for Guatemalan children, they also asked the court to extend protections from deportation to children of other nationalities after hearing reports that the government was intending to remove Honduran children as well.

She also wants the Federal Court to order the Immigration Department to reopen and consider her clients' applications.
The Canadian government opened the temporary visa program in January of 2024.
He said his sister and mother were later permitted to enter Canada through a separate visa program, and they have since applied for refugee status.
As of July 29, a total of 880 Palestinians have arrived in Canada through the visa program, which had a cap of 5,000, according to Canada's Immigration Department.","When immigration lawyer Hana Marku opened her email weeks ago to a photo of an emaciated infant in the Gaza Strip, she said she felt helpless.

The child is among about 50 Palestinians the Toronto-based lawyer is representing. She said each one was blocked without explanation from submitting applications under the temporary visa program the Canadian government created to help them flee the Israel-Hamas war.

""She's a baby girl who was born last year, and she was born into this war,"" Marku said. ""An infant whose bones I can count just by looking at a photo of her.""

Marku said her clients in the Gaza Strip are facing death every day. One narrowly escaped being killed as he was bringing home flour after a bomb fell nearby, she said. Some have witnessed loved ones crushed by falling rubble.

The situation has prompted her to request a ruling from Federal Court declaring the Immigration Department has unreasonably delayed the processing of her clients' applications, and that it acted unfairly by failing to explain the reason for the delays. She also wants the Federal Court to order the Immigration Department to reopen and consider her clients' applications.

The Canadian government opened the temporary visa program in January of 2024. As part of the process, family members based in Canada were asked to submit documents then wait for a reference code that would allow them to finalize their applications.

Program hit cap

Marku said that despite all her clients applying within a month of the program opening, none were given the chance to complete their applications, because their codes never arrived. The Immigration Department never communicated with her clients to say why they had not received codes or to explain the status of their applications either, she says.

Then this March, more than one year after the program opened, each of her clients received an email from the Canadian government stating that the program had reached its cap and had closed — and that none of them would be able to complete applications.

Marku says the government did not follow the procedures it set for the visa program.

""The instructions, which the applicants relied upon, said that as long as the web form submissions were complete they would either receive codes, or an explanation about why they are not eligible,"" she said.

The Canadian Press spoke with a family member of several of Marku's clients, and agreed not to name him because of his fears that revealing his identity would put his family at risk in the Gaza Strip.

He said he submitted applications for six family members on Jan. 9, 2024, but none got approved under the program.

""We followed the process,"" he said.

He said his sister and mother were later permitted to enter Canada through a separate visa program, and they have since applied for refugee status.

He said he had to take matters into his own hands to get them out of Gaza, since Canada couldn't evacuate them. In April 2024, he flew to Cairo, paying US$15,000 in cash to smugglers who managed to transport two sisters and his mother through the Rafah border into Egypt on April 28.

""They were lucky,"" he said.

One of his sisters remains in Cairo, he said, because she couldn't get approval to come to Canada.

Canadian government endorsed UN-backed finding

Marku submitted a letter to the Federal Court this August requesting an emergency hearing to resolve the issue.

""Under the Federal Court rules, there is no mechanism to seek an expedited decision at this stage. It just doesn't exist,"" she said, saying her request for an emergency hearing wasn't meant to serve as a legal argument, but rather as a humanitarian plea.

The court has acknowledged Marku's request, but she said it didn't indicate how it plans to move forward.

The Canadian government publicly endorsed a UN-backed finding in August that famine is occurring in the Gaza Strip.

In a letter obtained by The Canadian Press, lawyers for the Immigration Department wrote that while they recognize the situation in Gaza is difficult, the case is ultimately ""futile and moot.""

""The policy cap has already been reached,"" they wrote to the Federal Court. ""Receiving unique codes cannot assist them with their situations in Gaza.""

In a statement, the Immigration Department told The Canadian Press its policy only required it to process applications submitted before it had reached its cap. The department declined to comment on the litigation.

As of July 29, a total of 880 Palestinians have arrived in Canada through the visa program, which had a cap of 5,000, according to Canada's Immigration Department. Over 1,775 have also left Gaza and have been approved under the program, but have yet to arrive in the country.

Two weeks ago, U.S. immigration officials arrested almost 500 foreign nationals working at the construction site of a multibillion-dollar Georgia battery plant jointly owned by Korea’s LG and Hyundai. The raid, led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and supposedly the largest-ever at a single location, has set off a firestorm of commentary regarding the very public arrest, detention, and expulsion of the 300-plus South Korean citizens involved—and a furious debate over whether they were working illegally at the Georgia site (and thus worthy of arrest).

Now that the workers have returned home and the South Korean government has opened a human rights investigation into their treatment, it's increasingly clear that ICE messed up badly. The New York Times, for example, reports that the agency originally targeted only a few Hispanic workers and had no Korean translators on hand when the arrests were made. Even more suspiciously, ICE has refused to explain what immigration laws the Koreans actually broke, and their removal documents uncharacteristically lacked an express admission of wrongdoing. Other reports, meanwhile, note that U.S. immigration officers treated the Koreans terribly while in detention and wanted them all handcuffed upon departure—a second “perp walk” that was thankfully avoided. Several U.S. government officials have also apologized to the Korean government, including once in public. For an administration that prides itself on never backing down, this is about as clear an admission of fault as you’ll get.

Whether the Koreans were technically violating U.S. immigration law is less clear. The Times notes that most of them were here on B-1 or B-1/B-2 visas, which are issued for business trips of up to six months, or through the State Department’s visa waiver program (ESTA), which allows for 90-day business or tourism trips without a visa. Other outlets have added that similar arrangements are common for foreign companies setting up new and complex facilities here—including for other Korean investments in Georgia. The Times admits, however, that this approach falls into a legal gray area about the exact type of work that’s allowed while in-country, and that it’s often used because a more clear-cut H-1B visa for skilled immigrants is difficult to get, especially quickly. Reuters adds that some Korean workers had expressed concerns about continuing to use “questionable” B-1 visas during an era of heightened U.S. enforcement.

Getting answers to these questions is all well and good, but there are also several important policy issues that the LG/Hyundai raid addresses—and none of them are good for the United States.

U.S. Immigration Law Remains a Mess

First, the incident is a clear example of the United States’ insanely bureaucratic and wildly irrational immigration laws—and how their needless complexity effectively creates an open license for government abuse. As noted above, several informed observers speculate that it may have been more appropriate for these workers to use an H-1B visa to avoid limits on the type of work they perform or the duration of their stay. But, the Times notes, a low and arbitrary cap on H-1Bs (only 85,000 total are issued each year) make them “expensive to apply for and in high demand,” and a lottery system for allocating these visas makes quickly obtaining one extremely uncertain. H-1B visas also have their own rules, another immigration expert tells me, that might exclude some of the Korean workers at issue. He speculates that the H-2B visa might be better for those folks, but—to the surprise of no one—it has its own onerous rules and arbitrary cap.

South Korea also lacks the kind of streamlined visa category that several other U.S. free trade agreement partners have (so those nations’ citizens can, quite logically, support the increased trade and investment the agreements generate). Combined, these legal hurdles have pushed Korean companies and their lawyers to look for quicker “workarounds” to bring in support staff for new U.S. investments—workarounds that wouldn’t be necessary if our immigration laws made any sense.

But they don’t, so many Korean firms (and other foreign investors) have turned to the B-1 visa and ESTA waiver to bring in temporary, specialized workers because those approvals are faster and easier to obtain than an H-1B. Yet they too come with headaches. As the Economic Innovation Group’s Sam Peak detailed last week, for example, the B-1 visa “prohibits most work activity,” including rote construction work, but contains exceptions for certain specialists and types of work (e.g., equipment installation). He speculates that these B-1 rules—and similar ones for the ESTA waivers the Koreans also used—allowed the workers at issue to legally enter the U.S. and work at the LG/Hyundai site. In practice, however, strict compliance with the visa’s restrictions would be messy:

[E]mployers would need to differentiate between manual labor that any tradesman can do versus highly specialized work that only the foreign worker can do. This distinction can get unreasonably blurry and burdensome very quickly. Somebody who is tasked with bolting foreign equipment to the floor might need specialized knowledge about that equipment. Having a domestic tradesman do this while following orders from a foreign specialist who is only fluent in Korean doesn't seem very efficient and could result in many mistakes.

Endless technicalities and legal gray areas also hand the government a ton of discretion regarding who gets arrested and who doesn’t—and provide a recipe for abuse. If a project and its foreign workers are favored by the government, scrutiny could be light. (Various news reports indicate, in fact, that this kind of leniency has been common for big, flashy foreign investments.) On the other hand, if government agents really want to arrest and publicly humiliate foreign workers on a project that doesn’t have Washington’s blessing, the system gives them plenty of nits to pick. Never mind, of course, that the system is so complicated and ambiguous that—as the LG/Hyundai raid and aftermath show—even U.S. agencies in the same administration can’t seem to agree on what the exact rules are.

A simplified immigration system with fewer categories, conditions (e.g., who can work where, at what wage, and for how long), and arbitrary limits would greatly reduce these problems—and it would have considerable economic benefits to boot.

Speaking of …

Industrial Policy, Again

Second, the incident is a classic case of how optimistic U.S. industrial policy plans can be thwarted by other government policies that increase costs, extend timelines, and otherwise discourage the very production and investment that the government says it wants. This conflict, as we’ve discussed, is one reason why bold predictions of industrial policy success often ring hollow: Subsidized projects that look good on paper run headfirst into other policies that impede, if not scuttle, the projects’ actual implementation. They’re also why industrial policy skeptics (like me) have long recommended policymakers fix well-known government impediments to domestic production (tax, trade, regulatory, immigration, etc.) before deciding that subsidies are needed to help “strategic” producers overcome supposed “market failures.” Refusal to follow this order of operation, we’ve warned, could be both costly (for taxpayers and the economy) and, ultimately, counterproductive.

In the current case, the policy conflict is clear: On the one hand, the LG/Hyundai facility has received billions of dollars in subsidies—$2.1 billion in state and local incentives, plus plenty more in federal Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. And it’s just the type of “strategic” foreign-invested factory that President Trump says his tariff and manufacturing policies are encouraging. (He even took credit for a separate Hyundai facility in Georgia that opened earlier this year—never mind the timing.) The U.S. government thus has a strong bipartisan interest that facilities like the LG/Hyundai battery plant get up and running as soon as possible, and it’s even established a new “investment accelerator” to speed the projects up.

On the other hand, the Trump-led government has also vowed to strictly enforce every letter of U.S. immigration law, even though it’s a well-known and longstanding brake on domestic investment and growth—especially for innovative industries like advanced manufacturing that depend on workers with big brains and specialized skills. (As we’ve discussed, for example, past U.S. reductions in skilled immigration have caused multinationals to move offshore so they can better access the talent they need; and the first Trump administration quietly accelerated visa approvals for semiconductor giant TSMC for this very reason.) Draconian enforcement efforts, which encourage (if not demand) very public shows of force and the achievement of arbitrary arrest/removal quotas, undoubtedly amplify immigration restrictions’ harms in this regard—something we also discussed when looking at past U.S. deportation campaigns.

This problem is now playing out in Georgia, bigly. The ICE raid immediately halted construction at the factory, and it won’t resume until the Korean companies find willing and capable replacements. That process will take months, because Korean workers aren’t excited to return (duh) and because there aren’t American replacements due to the specialized nature of the work at issue—such as installing Korean machinery. (It’s now being reported, in fact, that construction is paused until 2026.) According to Korean news reports, moreover, “at least 22 other factory sites involving Korean business groups, in autos, shipbuilding, steel and electrical equipment, have been nearly halted.” The raid and ICE’s subsequent abuse of the Korean workers have fueled a huge public backlash in Korea and, as several educated observers speculate, could discourage future Korean investment in the United States more broadly.

Exactly the opposite, in other words, of what an “investment accelerator” should do.

Indeed, the Trump administration itself seems to understand these risks and the damage the raid—and, by extension, restrictive and complicated U.S. immigration law—has already done. The detainees’ release, for example, was delayed because Trump offered to let the Koreans return to Georgia to keep construction moving—an offer all but one refused. (Just the kind of preferential treatment the law foments, by the way.) The State Department had its second-in-command publicly “express deep regret over the occurrence of this situation,” hope that the situation will be “a turning point to improve the system and strengthen Korea-U.S. relations,” and reiterate that the U.S. highly values Korean manufacturing investment. President Trump himself then took to Truth Social to explain why he wants and welcomes foreign companies “building extremely complex products, machines, and other ‘things’” bringing in their own specialists: because without such an arrangement, “all of that massive Investment will never come in the first place.” The Trump administration has even established a joint “visa working group” with South Korea, “with discussions said to include Seoul’s desire for a separate U.S. visa quota for its workers.”

Maybe—just maybe—the U.S. government should have considered this stuff before the subsidized investments and ICE raids got rolling.

The Perils of Zero-Sum Thinking

Finally, the entire episode is yet another warning against the type of zero-sum thinking that pervades our modern political discourse and, unfortunately, has been increasingly adopted by younger generations in the United States. As we’ve discussed, research overwhelmingly demonstrates that skilled immigrants are linked to increased wages and stable or expanding employment for native-born U.S. workers. In one very recent study, skilled immigrants were found to have raised the wages of less-educated native workers by around 2 to 3 percent from 2000 to 2019, while other studies have shown that reductions in skilled immigration did not boost native born employment (and in fact may have led to job losses). These gains are achieved via several channels—specialization, complementarity, entrepreneurship, innovation, agglomeration, tax revenues, etc.—but they all point to the same general conclusion: Skilled foreign workers usually support, rather than displace, their native-born American counterparts.

The LG/Hyundai plant shows this positive-sum outcome in practice: By the Koreans’ accounting, the detained workers were engaged in temporary, specialized work that complemented construction activities undertaken by (mostly) local workers. Even if the Korean workers actually were displacing American technicians, however, the same positive-sum conclusion would hold. That’s because the factory that those foreigners were building over the course of several months will eventually require the long-term employment of some 8,000 individuals, almost all of whom will be Americans. And the economic activity that the Korean-owned facility generates—activity, again, effectuated by those Korean technicians—will support lots of other local companies and jobs, too.

To ritualistically oppose the facility’s construction and praise the ICE raid because not everyone there was a native-born American, because some of them might be displacing Americans, or because the Koreans’ paperwork was (maybe) wrong denies this positive-sum reality—as well as the dynamic nature of the U.S. economy and the broader gains that immigration and trade often produce. It’s a reality that even our notoriously zero-sum President seems to get.

If only his most ardent supporters would get it too.

Let us know!

Immigrant rights advocates gathered across from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Wednesday evening, calling on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to end state collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and expand protections for immigrant residents.

“We want Governor Shapiro to use his executive power to stop state collaboration with ICE and to protect our constitutional rights, including the right to due process,” said Tammy Murphy, public policy and advocacy manager at Make the Road PA. “We feel that it’s a shame that the governor hasn’t spoken publicly about protecting immigrants and protecting our constitutional right to due process, and that puts all of us in danger.”

Advocates’ demands include ending ICE access to state databases; strengthening state troopers’ ICE policy; ending collaboration between the state Department of Corrections and ICE; prohibiting immigration enforcement arrests in state facilities; and never leasing a state facility to ICE.

Blanca Pacheco, co-director of New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia, an interfaith immigrant advocacy organization, said people can end up being deported if they are stopped for minor traffic infractions and don’t have a driver’s license.

She wants Shapiro to support the bill, and immigrant communities as a whole.

“Varios gobernadores al nivel del país, alcaldes al nivel del país, legisladores, han hablado fuertemente en apoyo a los inmigrantes, y acá no se ha dicho nada, y eso se sienten las comunidades”, dijo.

“Several governors throughout the country, mayors throughout the country, legislators, have spoken out strongly in support of immigrants, and here they haven’t said anything, and that’s felt by the communities,” she said.

Pacheco said the increase in ICE raids in the Greater Philadelphia region have taken a toll on immigrants as well as allies who have seen their parents, brothers and fellow church members detained, and have been left feeling “grief and pain all of the time.”

“El oír que … tanto el gobernador Shapiro como la alcalde de la ciudad u otros gobernantes no dicen absolutamente nada aun expande ese sentimiento de duelo y de abandono y de incertidumbre de qué es lo que va a pasar el dia de mañana”, dijo ella, “si las personas salen a trabajar y no regresan, si los niños son dejados en la escuela y regresan y no tienen padres”.

“To hear that … Governor Shapiro and the mayor of the city and other elected officials aren’t saying anything expands that feeling of grief and abandonment and uncertainty about what’s going to happen tomorrow,” she said, “if people leave for work and don’t come back, if children are dropped off at school and come home and don’t have parents.”

Murphy said organizers also want to see Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker speak out in support of immigrant communities amid ongoing ICE raids in the city.

“There is a void of leadership on immigration rights, and people are waiting to hear,” she said. “We have families that are afraid to go to work, afraid to send their kids to school, afraid to go to the grocery store, afraid to go see the doctor.”

Parker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Under the new test, applicants will have to get 12 out of 20 questions correct, instead of six of 10.
So, if an applicant answers the first 12 questions correctly, he or she will not need to continue answering all 20 questions.
“The test as it’s laid out right now, it’s not very difficult,” Mr. Edlow said in an interview with The New York Times.

The test is one of the final hurdles for the hundreds of thousands of people who become American citizens each year. The new test will be administered to those who file their applications on or after Oct. 20, according a notice from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Matthew Tragesser, a U.S.C.I.S. spokesman, said in a statement that the revised test would ensure that new citizens are “fully assimilated and will contribute to America’s greatness. These critical changes are the first of many,” he said.

Under the new test, applicants will have to get 12 out of 20 questions correct, instead of six of 10.

The bank of questions has been expanded to 128 questions, from 100, and also features fewer questions with simple, sometimes one-word answers.

Late in his first term, President Trump implemented a revised test, which was in place from Dec. 1, 2020, until April 30, 2021, when the Biden administration scrapped it.

One question on that test that had drawn scrutiny was: “Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War?” The correct answer was, “to stop the spread of Communism.” Another question on that test was, “Who does a U.S. Senator represent?” Previously, the answer had been “all people of the state”; on the test introduced in December 2020, it was “citizens” in the state.

The difference between that test and the one being introduced now is that officers will be required to ask questions until the applicant passes or fails. So, if an applicant answers the first 12 questions correctly, he or she will not need to continue answering all 20 questions.

Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in July that the test was too easy. “The test as it’s laid out right now, it’s not very difficult,” Mr. Edlow said in an interview with The New York Times. “It’s very easy to kind of memorize the answers,” he said. “I don’t think we’re really comporting with the spirit of the law.”

The U.S. government has administered citizenship tests in some form since the early 1900s. There was no standard test, however, so local judges and magistrates administered their own until the Internal Security Act of 1950 made knowledge of U.S. history and civics a prerequisite for naturalization. The current pass rate for the citizenship test, according to U.S.C.I.S., is 91 percent.

Doing so would almost certainly trigger a government shutdown, something Democrats avoided earlier this year but is increasingly looking inevitable this fall.

Democratic senators, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the looming shutdown has been the chief topic of discussion in recent caucus meetings.

They said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), who took enormous heat from his left flank after voting for a GOP funding bill earlier this year, has not laid out any plan B to avert a shutdown before the Sept. 30 deadline.

“Donald Trump gave us the middle finger. There is no alternative,” said one Democratic senator, who requested anonymity to discuss caucus strategy.

A second Democratic senator said a brief shutdown would give Democrats a “win,” even if it doesn’t result in any concrete policy concessions from Republicans. This Democrat said doing so would send a “message” to Trump that the White House can’t continue to steamroll Congress.

“Without some accommodation, some compromise, I think there probably will be a shutdown for a period of time,” the lawmaker said.

The second senator said they would not vote for the stopgap measure funding the government through Nov. 21, which House Republicans plan to pass later this week.

“I hate a shutdown anyway, we don’t have any choice. We can’t go along with what they’re doing,” the senator said. “We should use every lever we have, and this is one of the very few levers where we can actually push [Trump].”

“If Trump declares martial law, well, let him be transparent and show the world that’s what he thinks his ultimate goal is,” they added.

Congress has little time to avoid a shutdown. Lawmakers are expected to be out next week for Rosh Hashanah and would return to the Capitol on Sept. 29 on their current schedule.

Democratic senators familiar with the deliberations within their caucus right now count six Democratic votes — at most — for the seven-week continuing resolution that is expected to reach the Senate on Friday or Saturday.

The party likely would need at least eight votes to help Republicans reach the 60 votes necessary to move Senate legislation forward. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has said he will vote against the funding measure because it prolongs spending put in place by the Biden administration.

Senate Democratic leaders haven’t conducted a formal whip count yet, but lawmakers believe Sens. John Fetterman (Pa.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Jacky Rosen (Nev.) and Angus King (Maine), an independent who caucuses with Democrats, are likely or possible “yes” votes.

Fetterman has said repeatedly he will not vote to shut down the government.

He said a shutdown “is never a good idea,” even though he “fully supports” extending the enhanced health insurance premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which are due to expire at the end of the year.

Fetterman is worried his Democratic colleagues have staked out such a strong position ahead of the Sept. 30 funding deadline that a shutdown is inevitable.

“They are actively painting themselves into the corner. That’s why I’m deeply concerned there will be a shutdown,” he said. “I won’t be a part of it.”

Senate Democrats have crafted an alternative government funding measure that would extend the expiring health insurance subsidies, restore Medicaid funding cut by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and prevent the Trump administration from clawing back previously appropriated funding through “pocket rescissions.”

Republicans, however, say these demands are a nonstarter.

Senate Democrats say there’s been a dramatic shift in strategy since March, when Schumer and nine other members of the Senate Democratic caucus voted for a House-passed, Republican-drafted continuing resolution to avoid a shutdown.

Schumer’s vote sparked a furious backlash from the Democratic Party’s base and briefly raised questions about his future as Democratic leader.

Six months ago, Schumer didn’t take a hard line against the House-GOP drafted continuing resolution while it moved through the lower chamber, leaving it ambiguous whether Democrats would ultimately support it in the Senate.

Democratic senators say it was clear in March that Schumer wasn’t ready to force a shutdown to push back against Trump.

Sources familiar with conversations among Senate Democrats in March said they didn’t have a clear strategy over how to handle the continuing resolution if it passed the House and defaulted to just hoping Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) couldn’t muster enough votes to send it across the Capitol.

Now, Schumer is making it clear to Republicans that the House-crafted stopgap will fail in the Senate, even though he hasn’t laid out a plan B.

“When President Trump goes on Fox News and says to Republicans, ‘Don’t even bother dealing with [Democrats]’ … when he says out lout he doesn’t need or want our votes, that means Donald Trump wants a shutdown. Full stop,” Schumer said after meeting with Democratic colleagues Tuesday.

Schumer in a joint statement with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said the short-term funding proposal put together by House Republicans “fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis.”

Democrats say as much as they hate the idea of shutting down the government, they can’t swallow the House Republican funding bill after GOP leaders repeatedly ignored their requests to negotiate the measure.

“We have a lot of diverse views in the caucus, but we’re all professional politicians. And an iron law in politics is if you want a vote, you have to ask what it would take to get it, and they haven’t even asked,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), the Democratic chief deputy whip, referring to Republicans.

Schatz voted for the partisan GOP stopgap measure in March but warned he will vote “no” on the continuing resolution unveiled this week by House Republicans.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/AP25260540283590.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-18 13:57:55.776896

Discussion prompts:

i. Although the landscape regarding Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) has altered considerably since these articles were published, challenges with SIV processing have been consistent since the initiation of the program and are likely to persist under future administrations. What are the relative values and challenges to codifying executive decisions regarding SIVs via legislation, as Chris Purdy suggests Congress ought to have done in 2024?

Discussion prompts:

i. Do you agree that Congress should legislate an exception that permits the State Department to publicize individuals that have been subjected to a 3(C) visa denial? Can you think of any arguments as to why the State Department should not have the discretion to make such disclosures? What, if any, are the benefits to non-disclosure? Could there be any privacy interests at play, for instance?

Priya Morley, AI at the Border: Racialized Impacts and Implications (June 2024)

Discussion prompts:

i. What are the benefits and costs of utilizing AI (or other technology) in border enforcement activities? Recognizing that technological development and its proliferation throughout various government functions is highly likely to persist, are there ways to realize the benefits while minimizing the costs? What preconditions would be necessary for that to be true? Are there any technologies that should be outright banned from use in immigration enforcement?

III. Non-Citizens in the United States

Nancy Morawetz, The Immigration Registration Trap Goes Live (April 16, 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. How does the interim final rule (IFR) requiring non-citizens to register with the government potentially impact U.S. citizens, even though it appears facially to focus on non-citizens?

ii. Do you agree with the author that DHS’s argument that it is implementing the 1940 statutory provision regarding registration is weak, and that notice and comment rulemaking ought to be required? What are the benefits or potential drawbacks of ensuring a notice and comment period takes place?

Ahilan Arulanantham and Adam Cox, Explainer on First Amendment and Due Process Issues in Deportation of Pro-Palestinian Student Activist(s) (March 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. In the context of Nationality Act (INA) section 237(a)(4)(C), how should concepts like “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” and “compelling United States foreign policy interest” be understood? Should there be any limitations on how those concepts can be interpreted and applied? If so, how should those limitations be established, and by whom? The judiciary, via review of the “void for vagueness” problems raised by this section of the statute? Congress, via legislation to amend the INA? The executive itself, via internal statutory interpretation or policy guidance? What are the pros and cons to these various approaches?

Edgar Chen, With New “Alien Land Laws” Asian Immigrants Are Once Again Targeted by Real Estate Bans (May 2023)

Discussion prompts:

i. So-called “alien land laws” continue to raise thorny issues in the context of immigration. How would you balance the policy concerns referenced in the article, with the risk of constitutional violations and potential discriminatory enforcement? What other methods might be used to address these purported national security or other concerns? How does this article inform your thinking on the relationship between immigration and national security?

IV. Birthright Citizenship

Ilya Somin, Birthright Citizenship and Undocumented Immigrants (November 2024)

Discussion prompts:

i. What do you make of the various arguments for and against considering the children of undocumented immigrants as “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States? Are there any arguments for or against this that were not addressed in the article?

Edgar Chen and Chris M. Kwok, The Trump Administration’s 14th Amendment Retcon: ‘Wong Kim Ark’ Does Not Limit Birthright Citizenship (March 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. What strikes you as the strongest argument that United States v. Wong Kim Ark does not limit birthright citizenship in the manner claimed by the Trump administration? Are there any weaknesses to this argument? Are there any potential arguments in addition to those offered in the article?

ii. What do you make of the concept of “allegiance” in the context of U.S. citizenship? Setting aside which markers ought to demonstrate “sufficient” allegiance to the United States, is this an appropriate analytical lens for consideration of who ought to be eligible for citizenship at all, and if so, under what circumstances?

John Mikhail, Birthright Citizenship and DOJ’s Misuse of History in Its Appellate Briefs (April 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Utilizing the same historical sources cited in DOJ’s appellate brief, what are the core arguments in opposition to the Executive Order limiting birthright citizenship? Are there any arguments you can identify that the authors did not include in their article?

ii. Is it possible to square the concept of “primary allegiance” that DOJ references in its brief with the fact that the United States recognizes dual citizenship? If you were arguing on behalf of the government, how would you define what constitutes “primary” allegiance? Now, take the position of opposing counsel. What are the problems with, and consequences of, the arguments that you advanced on behalf of the government?

Why do you think that the statutory argument has received less attention?

Melissa Stewart, Trump v. CASA and the Risk of Statelessness (July 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. What processes could reasonably be put in place to protect individuals at risk of statelessness? Are there vulnerabilities in leaving any such protections to executive branch policy-making? Should there be legislation to provide some degree of protection, as suggested by the authors? What should such legislation strive to do? Are there any constraints on what can be solved via congressional action, in your view?

ii. What problems are raised by the lack of a clear definition of a “stateless person” in U.S. law?

V. Detention and Removal

ii. Does the Insurrection Act have a place in modern immigration enforcement? Should it be amended, and if so, how?

B. Use of Military in Border Enforcement

Mark Nevitt, The New “National Defense Area” at the Southern Border (April 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Is reforming the National Emergencies Act necessary and, if so, in what ways? For instance, should the ability of the executive branch to bypass congressional approval for certain actions during a national emergency be restricted in some way? Or should the circumstances in which the president declares a national emergency at all be circumscribed? Why might the drafters of the legislation have originally provided for exceptions to congressional approval upon the declaration of a national emergency?

ii. In what ways can we understand the (possibly purposeful) ambiguity of the military purpose doctrine regarding national security, and its concomitant effects on immigration? Should the military purpose doctrine be reimagined? How so?

William Banks, Expert Backgrounder: Federalizing the National Guard and Domestic Use of the Military (February 2024)

Discussion prompts:

i. Should Congress establish heightened limitations on presidential discretion in the Insurrection Act? What limitations would you propose, and how effective do you anticipate these limitations would be? What problems might remain, if any, and how might you address those?

Discussion prompts:

i. If you were to reapportion the budget for immigration-related activities, how would you apportion funds, and for what reasons? Which immigration efforts should receive the most funding, and why? Or, should immigration-related funding be reallocated to another executive branch initiative entirely? What would be the benefits and drawbacks of doing so?

Jonathan Hafetz and Rebecca Ingber, What Just Happened: At Guantanamo’s Migrant Operation Center (February 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Do individuals held at Guantanamo for immigration enforcement purposes have the same constitutional rights, such as due process, access to counsel, and habeas protections, as those held within continental United States? Should they? What implications does this have for other U.S. legal positions, such as in the DOD law of war detention context where the United States has taken the position that Guantanamo is not the United States and that U.S. law does not apply there?

Just Security, Series: Executive Order 9066 (February 2022)

Discussion prompts:

i. In reflecting on Executive Order 9066 and considering contemporary issues in immigration regulation and enforcement in the United States, what actions would you advocate should be taken now, and by whom, to incorporate the lessons from history into law, policy, and public discourse in a way that meaningfully mitigates the abuse of national security authorities? What lessons from Executive Order 9066 do you think are most at risk of repeating (or already are), and what implications does that have for the current legal infrastructure in which national security authorities are exercised?

D. Deportation

1. Non-Refoulement

Scott Roehm & Rebecca Ingber, In Congress, a Welcome, But Flawed, Step to Stop Trump’s Transfers to Torture (May 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Why is it important for Congress to be specific about the kind of information it seeks from the State Department regarding El Salvador’s human rights records, U.S. work to promote human rights in that country, and U.S. efforts to remedy rights violations associated with transfers? What would the categories of information detailed by the authors allow Congress to more effectively do?

ii. In addition to (or perhaps instead of) 502B resolutions, are there more systemic approaches to Congressional oversight over U.S. security assistance and the conditions in the countries which receive it that you might recommend? What would those be, and how would they be an improvement over the current 502B framework?

Rebecca Ingber and Scott Roehm, The Trump Administration’s Recent Removals to El Salvador Violate the Prohibition on Transfer to Torture (March 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Can you make an argument for why it is in the national security interests of the United States to adhere to the law regarding non-refoulement? What core U.S. objectives does compliance with this requirement potentially advance?

ii. Is a violation of non-refoulement ever justified? Why or why not, and under what circumstances?

Oona A. Hathaway, Mark Stevens, and Preston Lim, COVID-19 and International Law: Refugee Law – The Principle of Non-Refoulement (November 2020)

Discussion prompts:

i. Although the overt emergency raised by the COVID-19 has largely passed, questions regarding the limits that public crises can and should be able to place on international legal obligations remain highly relevant. How should governments balance the exigencies of extreme public health or other significant crises, on the one hand, and the requirements of international law that may be in tension with certain efforts to mitigate such a crisis, on the other hand? Should international law account for such circumstances in some way that it currently does not? What would be the risks of doing so?

2. Punishment and Constitutional Limits

Ahilan Arulanantham, Deportation to CECOT: The Constitutional Prohibition on Punishment Without Charge or Trial (April 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. What circumstances of incarceration would not constitute punishment, under current conceptions of the law? Are these circumstances appropriate, or would you argue for a differing approach? If so, why?

ii. Are there circumstances when incarceration without trial is justifiable, in the context of immigration enforcement? Why, or why not? Do the transfers to CECOT constitute such a circumstance?

Frank O. Bowman III, Immigration Is Not an “Invasion” under the Constitution (January 2024)

Discussion prompts:

i. What do you make of the constitutional, caselaw, and non-immigration arguments regarding the use of the word “invasion” in the context of immigration levels? Are there any additional arguments (or counterarguments) that might also be available, in addition to those raised in the article? Are there any limitations to the arguments you identified?

ii. What do you think the greatest risks of framing immigration as an “invasion” are, and why? Is there potential for any unintended consequences?

E. Special case study: Alien Enemies Act

Rebecca Ingber, Judicial Deference and Presidential Power Under the Alien Enemies Act (May 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Is a finding that the president’s factual determinations are not judicially reviewable supportable under the political question doctrine? Why or why not? What are the risks to this approach, and when (if ever) might there be justification for it?

ii. How has the March 2025 invocation of the AEA differed from prior invocations of the authority? What relevance do any of these differences have, if any, for our understanding of its March 2025 use?

Ryan Goodman, The Absence of “State Secrets” in US-El Salvador Agreement: On Removal and Imprisonment of Non-US Citizens (May 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. The DC Circuit states in the decision in Ellsberg v. Mitchell that “the privilege [of State secrets] may not be used to shield any material not strictly necessary to prevent injury to national security.” If U.S. officials had not shared so much information publicly about the United States-El Salvador arrangement (or the State secrets argument was otherwise stronger), would there be legitimacy to the national security argument in the case of transferring non-U.S. citizens to El Salvador? Why or why not?

Marty Lederman, Remarkable Things in the Government’s Alien Enemies Act Briefs to the Supreme Court (April 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Does the government’s position regarding habeas petitions in the context of removals made under an invocation of the Alien Enemies act violate the 5th Amendment’s Due Process Clause? How or how not? Are there specific aspects of the government’s arguments regarding habeas petitions that you find more or less problematic than others?

ii. Which of the author’s arguments do you find the most compelling, and why? Can you think of any counterarguments, and any responses to those counterarguments?

Katherine Yon Ebright, The Courts Can Stop Abuse of the Alien Enemies Act – the Political Question Doctrine is No Bar (March 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Should there be additional checks on the president’s ability to invoke the Alien Enemies Act? In light of the political question doctrine, is it more appropriate (or potentially more effective) for the judiciary or for Congress to serve as a check? Why, and in what ways might each institution best do so? What are the limitations of either institution’s ability to do so?",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Syllabus-Image.jpeg,N,,2025-09-18 09:56:40.408820

(AP) — Portland, Oregon, said Wednesday it will issue a land use violation notice to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, accusing the facility of detaining people beyond the limits of what its land use approval allows.

(AP) — Portland, Oregon, said Wednesday it will issue a land use violation notice to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, accusing the facility of detaining people beyond the limits of what its land use approval allows.

The building’s conditional land use approval, in place since 2011, does not allow people to be kept overnight or held for more than 12 hours. The city alleges that this provision was violated 25 times over the 10-month period from last October through most of this July.

“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement made clear detention limitation commitments to our community, and we believe they broke those policies more than two dozen times,” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a news release. “I am proud of our team for conducting a thorough, thoughtful investigation, and referring the matter to the next steps in the land use violation process.”

The city said it will issue the notice, which also references a second violation regarding boarded-up windows, on Thursday. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Recently, the building has been the site of nightly protests, which peaked in June, with smaller clashes also occurring since then. Immigration and legal advocates often gather there during the day to help those arriving at the building, while protesters, often dressed in black and wearing helmets or masks, show up at night.

While disruptive to nearby residents, the protests are a far cry from the racial justice protests that gripped the city in 2020. They nevertheless have drawn the attention of President Donald Trump, who recently said he was considering sending in federal troops, as he has also threatened to do to combat crime in other cities. He signed an order Monday to send the National Guard into Memphis, Tennessee, and deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C.

Most violent crime around the country has actually declined in recent years, including in Portland, where a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found that homicides from January through June decreased by 51% this year compared to the same period in 2024.

Under Portland’s sanctuary policy, city employees, including police officers, do not enforce federal immigration law. Oregon also has a sanctuary law that prohibits state and local law enforcement from participating in immigration enforcement without a warrant.

Portland said its permitting bureau launched an investigation into the ICE building in late July in response to formal complaints. It reviewed data released by ICE to the nonprofit Deportation Data Project under public records requests, which indicated that the most recent of the 25 detention violations between Oct. 1, 2024, and July 27, 2025 occurred on May 20, the city said.

Landowners have 30 days after receiving a notice of violation to correct the issue. A fine can be issued if there is “substantial evidence of violation,” the city said.

However, it is unclear how many people have been deported from the site or transferred to other immigration detention centers.
Other lawyers say they must schedule an appointment three days in advance to meet with their clients in person at Alligator Alcatraz.
Alligator Alcatraz was built in just over a week on a former airstrip in the Everglades, the vast wetlands west of Miami.
The state established another immigration detention center north of the peninsula, in a former men’s prison, which it named Deportation Depot.","Hundreds of people detained at the Alligator Alcatraz immigration processing center west of Miami, Florida, appear to have vanished. They have disappeared from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) online database, and their lawyers and families have been unable to locate them, according to immigrant advocacy groups.

“When searching for people detained there, the ICE locator now says, ‘Call the Florida Department of Corrections for details,’” says Luis Sorto of Sanctuary of the South, a network that offers legal services and participated in a lawsuit against the government over restrictions on access to lawyers for detainees at the infamous immigration jail.

All of the plaintiffs who were being held at the center were transferred to another location after a new lawsuit was filed in August challenging Florida’s authority to detain people there, Sorto added. That lawsuit also noted that the detainees did not appear in ICE’s tracking system.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which filed the lawsuit, described Alligator Alcatraz as a “black hole,” noting that some people were “missing,” effectively “off the radar” of the immigration system, and “their lawyers and families often don’t know where they are or how to contact them.”

Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, told EL PAÍS that ICE’s “persistent refusal” to promptly update detainee locations “is a significant obstacle to effective attorney-client communication, undermines due process, and is yet another hallmark of the detention system’s cruelty.”

A Miami Herald report indicates that about 800 detainees no longer appeared in ICE’s online database as of late August, and another 450 did not have a location, but rather the message: “Call ICE for details.”

A judge ruled in August that the state must dismantle the camp following a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and a local Native American tribe, but an appeals court halted the ruling and allowed the center to continue operating while the litigation continues.

Following the ruling, however, a state official said that the facility would be empty within a few days, and authorities indicated they were transferring detainees to other facilities, including some in Florida flagged by human rights organizations for poor conditions, and others outside the state. Reports indicate that the number of people detained there has decreased significantly.

However, it is unclear how many people have been deported from the site or transferred to other immigration detention centers. Some detainees told the Miami Herald that authorities are pressuring them to voluntarily agree to deportation, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said in late July that about 100 had been deported from the site.

Alex Solomiany, a Miami immigration attorney, told the Miami Herald that he went to see one of his clients in immigration court at the Krome detention center southwest of Miami, where he learned he had been accidentally deported to Guatemala. Solomiany told EL PAÍS on Wednesday that his client remains in Guatemala and is “working with ICE” to obtain parole that would allow him to return to the United States.

Other lawyers say they must schedule an appointment three days in advance to meet with their clients in person at Alligator Alcatraz.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in an email that “the number of detainees at Alligator Alcatraz fluctuates constantly as they are deported and transferred to ICE detention centers for further removal proceedings,” and that “all detainees have opportunities to communicate with attorneys and family members.” “ICE’s goal is to remove illegals from the country as quickly as possible,” DHS said. ICE did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Alligator Alcatraz was built in just over a week on a former airstrip in the Everglades, the vast wetlands west of Miami. President Donald Trump endorsed it with a visit for its inauguration in early July, and it began receiving detainees almost immediately. Allegations of poor hygiene, food, and mistreatment soon arose. The Florida Department of Emergency Management operates the facility.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

In a social media post, President Trump yesterday said that he is designating Antifa as a “major terrorist organization.” It is unclear what mechanism Trump hopes to use to implement, as “antifa” is an umbrella description for far-left-leaning movements, and there would be no statutory authority to designate domestic terrorist groups like there is for foreign terrorist organizations. Aaron Pellish reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration yesterday announced the launch of a new civics education coalition. The coalition unites the Education Department and more than 40 groups aligned with Trump’s Make America Great Again movement, including the Heritage Foundation, Turning Point USA, and the America First Policy Institute. The Education Department said the initiative is dedicated to “renewing patriotism, strengthening civic knowledge, and advancing a shared understanding of America’s founding principles in schools.” Michael C. Bender reports for the New York Times; Sequoia Carrillo reports for NPR.

The White House is drawing up an executive order on political violence and hate speech, a Trump administration official indicated yesterday. According to the official, the plan could be unveiled later this week, and its specifics are still being hammered out by Trump’s top advisers, including White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. James Oliphant and Jeff Mason report for Reuters.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders are cracking down on Pentagon staffers’ alleged mocking of Charlie Kirk’s death. According to a congressional aide and a source close to the Pentagon, several troops have been fired or punished for social media posts that do not necessarily attack Kirk. A Defense Department official indicated that a suspension process has also been started in response to far-right influencers flagging service members they believe are making negative comments about Kirk. Paul McLeary and Jack Detsch report for POLITICO.

U.S. POLITICAL VIOLENCE

Disney-owned ABC yesterday announced it would “indefinitely” suspend comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show. On Monday, Kimmel criticized “the MAGA gang” as “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” with his remarks drawing sharp reactions from conservatives. In a podcast episode released yesterday, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr implied that the FCC could suspend ABC’s broadcast licenses if it does not “take action on Kimmel.” John Koblin, Michael M. Grynbaum, and Brooks Barnes report for the New York Times; Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chair Rep. James Comer (R-KY) yesterday asked the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit to testify about the “radicalization of online forum users” at an October 8 hearing following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. David Shepardson reports for Reuters.

House members will be allowed $10,000 per month to cover personal security costs in the wake of Kirk’s assassination, twice the funding currently available under a pilot program created this summer to boost member security, House leaders announced yesterday. Katherine Tully-McManus and Jennifer Scholtes report for POLITICO.

A GOP resolution to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) over comments and a social media repost she made on Charlie Kirk’s death failed yesterday. Republican Reps. Cory Mills (FL), Jeff Hurd (CO), Tom McClintock (CA), and Mike Flood (NE) joined Democrats to defeat the measure in a 214-213 vote. Katy Stech Ferek and Jasmine Li report for the Wall Street Journal.

Russian, Iranian, and Chinese state media have mentioned “Charlie Kirk” over 6,200 times between Sep. 10 and Sep. 17, according to a social media analytics tool used by NewsGuard, a company that tracks disinformation online. All three countries framed the killing as a Western conspiracy and spread false narratives about Kirk’s death, although the details of their claims differed. Steven Lee Myers reports for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer today and announce the unveiling of a £150 billion ($205 billion) package of U.S. investment in the United Kingdom. Starmer is also expected to discuss foreign affairs with Trump, hoping to persuade him to take stronger action against Russia and Israel. U.S. companies that are expected to invest in the United Kingdom under the deal include Blackstone, Palantir, and Boeing. Steve Holland, Elizabeth Piper, and Andrew Macaskill report for Reuters; Shawn McCreesh reports for the New York Times; Charlotte Edwards and Michael Race report for BBC News.

The International Monetary Fund is likely to tap Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s Chief of Staff, Dan Katz, as the IMF’s second-in-command, sources say. Katz’s nomination could be announced as soon as tomorrow, the sources add. Victoria Guida and Megan Messerly report for POLITICO.

Some military lawyers and Defense Department officials are raising concerns about the legality of Trump’s campaign of military strikes on vessels allegedly affiliated with Latin America-based drug cartels, sources say. According to the sources, the concerns relate both to the legal justification for the strikes themselves as well as legal implications of the campaign for U.S. military personnel. At least some defense officials and career military lawyers who provided their opinions on the matter to Pentagon decision-makers believe they are being ignored or deliberately sidelined, one of the sources added. Lara Seligman reports for the Wall Street Journal.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as “the most corrupt federal agency in the world” and said CDC staffers are “horrible people” who were “bought by the pharmaceutical industry” and “were killing children and they don’t care,” former CDC Director Susan Monarez testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee yesterday. Monarez also said that Kennedy said that he had spoken to the White House about replacing her if she did not commit “to blanket approval to each of the recommendations” made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Robert King reports for POLITICO.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, one of the United States’ most respected scientific bodies, yesterday issued a review of climate science concluding that the evidence of climate change was “beyond scientific dispute.” According to the chair of the committee that authored the report, Shirley Tilghman, the “study was undertaken with the ultimate aim of informing the EPA … as it considers the status of the endangerment finding.” Alex Guillén reports for POLITICO.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Nvidia has agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel, announcing today that the two companies will “multiple generations of custom data center and PC products.” Nvidia’s investment will give it a 4% stake in Intel, making it one of the chipmaker’s largest shareholders, and follows the U.S government’s purchase of a 10% stake in Intel a few weeks ago. Ian King reports for Bloomberg; Reuters reports.

Microsoft, Google and Nvidia have announced more than $40 billion in investments for AI in the United Kingdom during Trump’s state visit this week. Several U.S. tech leaders are participating in Trump’s visit, including Open AI’s Sam Altman and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella. A U.S. tech industry representative told Politico that with these plans for investment in Britain, “we would like to see [is] a trade barrier being lowered in the digital service tax.” Tim Bradshaw, David Sheppard, Stephen Morris and Michael Action report for the Financial Times; Adam Satariano reports for the New York Times; Tom Bristow and Aaron Mak report for Politico.

China’s State Administration for Market Regulation is dropping its antitrust probe into Google, two sources told the Financial Times. The sources say this is a tactical decision to focus on Nvidia as a point of leverage in U.S.-China trade talks while sending a positive sign to Washington by dropping its investigation into Google. According to a source, “China is trying to narrow its retaliatory targets to make them more potent.” Stephen Morris reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Dozens of Israeli tanks yesterday entered Sheikh Radwan, a major residential district of Gaza City, according to local residents and eyewitnesses. The district is considered one of the city’s most densely populated areas. Israeli strikes have also cut off phone and internet services in the city, making it harder for Palestinians to call for help, the Palestinian Telecommunications Regulatory Authority said. The Israeli military said that it is looking into the incident and does not deliberately target public communication networks. Rushdi Abualouf reports for BBC News; Julia Frankel and Samy Magdy report for AP News.

No food aid has entered northern Gaza since Friday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said yesterday, saying that Israel’s military had closed an important border crossing, Zikim, on that date. According to the office, aid groups have “grave concerns over fuel and food stock depletion” due to the closure. Separately, the Israeli military agency that manages aid to Gaza, COGAT, said that 230 aid trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday, including through the Zikim crossing. COGAT declined to explain the discrepancy between its account and the U.N. report. Cassandra Vinograd, Rawan Sheikh Ahmad, Gabby Sobelman, and Liam Stack report for the New York Times.

The destruction in Gaza could be turned into a “real estate bonanza” under a plan that is currently on Trump’s table, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said yesterday. Smotrich also said that he has “started negotiations with the Americans” because Israel “paid a lot of money for this war, so we need to divide how we make a percentage on the land marketing later in Gaza.” Babak Dehghanpisheh and Omer Bekin report for NBC News.

The Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has now surpassed 65,000, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. Julia Frankel and Samy Magdy report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

The United Kingdom will this weekend formally recognise Palestine as a state ahead of the U.N. General Assembly next week, the Times reports, adding that U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is delaying an announcement on the issue until after Trump’s visit concludes his state visit to Britain. Steven Swinford reports.

SYRIA — U.S. RESPONSE

Syria’s interim Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani is expected to visit Washington, D.C., today for talks on permanently lifting the remaining U.S. sanctions against Syria, lawmakers and U.S. officials say. Shaibani is expected to meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio tomorrow, according to Axios. Barak Ravid reports.

Some top-ranking U.S. diplomats working on Syria have been abruptly let go from their posts in recent days, several sources say. The diplomats who were let go reported to the U.S. special envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack. One of the sources said that the departures would not affect U.S. policy in Syria, while a Western diplomat suggested that the move was in part driven by a “divergence” in views between the staffers and Barack on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Jonathan Spicer, Suleiman Al-Khalidi, and Humeyra Pamuk report for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Fifteen people have been charged with terrorism offences in Lithuania for the detonations of explosives carried in packages by DHL and DPD from Vilnius to Germany, Poland and the UK in July last year, Lithuanian prosecutors announced in a statement yesterday. The prosecutors said that the incidents were coordinated by individuals with links to Russian military intelligence services. George Wright reports for BBC News; Andrius Sytas reports for Reuters.

Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz arrived in Ukraine today for talks on developing Poland’s drone capabilities, following the Russian incursion last week. “We will be signing an agreement concerning cooperation between the ministries, but also acquiring capabilities when it comes to operating drones”, Kosiniak-Kamysz said. AP News reports.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced yesterday that Denmark will acquire long-range precision weapons in response to Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. Frederiksen called it “a paradigm shift in Danish defense policy” and said “there is no doubt that Russia will be a threat to Denmark and Europe for many years.” Maya Tekeli and Jeffrey Gettleman report for the New York Times.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Saudi Arabia and Pakistan signed a mutual defense pact yesterday, strengthening their existing security partnership. “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means,” a senior Saudi official told Reuters when asked whether Pakistan would provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella. Maha El Dahan and Saeed Shah report.

Thai security forces clashed yesterday with Cambodian protestors in a disputed border area, with 28 people injured and no deaths reported according to Cambodian official statements. A Thai army spokesperson said that the Thai authorities considered the incident to be a provocation and an intentional violation of the ceasefire agreed in July. The Cambodian government issued a statement that Thai security forces “used tear gas against Cambodian civilians in an attempt to surround land that Cambodians have long lived on.” Sopheng Cheang and Grant Peck report for AP News.

Yulia Navalnaya alleged yesterday that lab tests of biological samples taken from her husband, Alexei Navalny, prove that he was poisoned. She did not provide evidence of the test but urged the laboratories, in two unspecified countries, who conducted the tests, to publish them. Matthew Luxmoore reports for the Wall Street Journal.

The Taliban administration yesterday announced the imposition of an internet ban intended to “prevent immoral activities” across large parts of northern Afghanistan. The ban is the first such ban since the Taliban took over in August 2021. Mohammad Yunus Yawar reports for Reuters.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Trump administration cannot, for now, proceed with its planned overhaul of the Health and Human Services Department, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday. The court upheld a lower court’s injunction prohibiting mass firings at the agency for the duration of litigation contesting the move and rejected the Trump administration’s claim that states who sued could not show they would be irreparably harmed by the injunction being lifted. Nate Raymond and Daniel Wiessner report for Reuters.

A federal judge yesterday temporarily prohibited the Trump administration from holding immigrants for prolonged periods of time in unsafe and unsanitary conditions at a Manhattan detention center. In his order, the judge said that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the conditions in the holding cells violated the First and Fifth Amendments. Luis Ferré-Sadurní reports for the New York Times; Beth Wang reports for Bloomberg Law.

An immigration judge ordered Mahmoud Khalil’s deportation to Algeria or Syria last Friday. The judge denied Khalil’s motion for a waiver preventing his deportation because of misrepresentations made in his application to register permanent residence. In a statement, Khalil remarked that the Trump administration’s “latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again.” Chloe Atkins and Marlene Lenthang report for NBC News.

Camara also ordered a “mortar crew” under his command to attack central Monrovia, striking the U.S. Embassy compound, resulting in the death of a U.S. embassy employee – a Liberian guard – and other civilians.

HSI Philadelphia investigated the case, with valuable assistance from the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office and the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service at the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia.","Laye Sekou Camara, 47, has been sentenced to 57 months in prison after pleading guilty to four counts of visa fraud.

“The defendant, who was a member of a Liberian rebel group, engaged in the extrajudicial killing of civilians and ordered a mortar attack which struck the U.S. Embassy compound in Monrovia, Liberia, before traveling to the United States and making false statements to obtain lawful permanent residence,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Human rights violators are not welcome in the United States, and the Criminal Division is committed to holding accountable those who attempt to conceal their crimes and live freely without consequence in the United States.”

“The defendant was a notorious LURD commander, brutal even by the standards of the Second Liberian Civil War, and he lied about his past to build a new life in the United States,” said U.S. Attorney David Metcalf for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. “Today’s sentence holds him responsible for his immigration fraud and officially ends his efforts to avoid accountability for his horrific crimes.”

According to court records, in 2010, Camara, also known as “general K-1” and “general Dragon Master,” entered the United States pursuant to an immigrant visa and later obtained Lawful Permanent Resident status and a green card by falsely stating on immigration forms that he had never participated in extrajudicial killings or other acts of violence; had never been involved with a paramilitary unit, rebel group, or guerilla group; and had never engaged in the recruitment or use of child soldiers.

At a preliminary sentencing hearing held on Jan. 23, nine Liberian witnesses described how Camara used his position of power in the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) rebel group to terrorize civilians, committing extrajudicial killings and other atrocities. One farmer in Lofa County, Liberia, described how “K-1 and his boys surrounded the town, . . . [and] . . . [t]hose who refused to be arrested, those who resisted, they were killed.” Another witness recounted how Camara used a handgun to kill at close range a pregnant woman and her 13-year-old son after the woman objected to LURD’s recruitment of her son. Other witnesses described how LURD rebels – and Camara specifically – fired on and killed civilians who were trying to obtain food. Camara also ordered a “mortar crew” under his command to attack central Monrovia, striking the U.S. Embassy compound, resulting in the death of a U.S. embassy employee – a Liberian guard – and other civilians. Other witnesses testified about Camara’s tactics to humiliate and terrorize civilians, including through mutilation of his victims. In one instance, a witness described how Camara tied a man’s hands behind his back and “cut off his right ear,” when the man continued to resist.

HSI Philadelphia investigated the case, with valuable assistance from the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office and the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service at the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia. The Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center (HRVWCC) supported the case. Established in 2009 and led by HSI, the HRVWCC uses a whole of government approach to further efforts to identify, locate, and prosecute human rights abusers in the United States, including those who are known or suspected to have participated in persecution, war crimes, genocide, torture, extrajudicial killings, female genital mutilation, and the use or recruitment of child soldiers.

Temporary DHS Commissioner Shireen Gandhi told the committee that she's only able to confirm that Grumdahl's appointment ended Tuesday.
""I want to remind everybody that DHS is taking a zero tolerance approach to fraud,"" Gandhi said in her testimony.
Members of the committee had expected Grumdahl to attend the hearing so he could answer questions on reported fraud.
The DFL lawmaker, who works as a prosecutor outside of the Legislature, said: ""Since the start of the 2025 session, the House Fraud Committee has done next to nothing to prevent fraud.","The state's Housing Stabilization Services (HSS) program was under the microscope Wednesday as a Minnesota House committee investigates fraud within the Department of Human Services (DHS).

Ahead of Wednesday's hearing, members of the House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Policy Committee learned that DHS Assistant Commissioner Eric Grumdahl, who oversaw HSS, had left his post, but they weren't given a clear answer about his departure.

Temporary DHS Commissioner Shireen Gandhi told the committee that she's only able to confirm that Grumdahl's appointment ended Tuesday. The Minnesota Data Practices Act prevents employers from sharing reasons behind an employee's separation, a department spokesperson said when asked by Bring Me The News for more details.

""I want to remind everybody that DHS is taking a zero tolerance approach to fraud,"" Gandhi said in her testimony.

Last month, the department moved to terminate HSS, a Medicaid-funded program that helps secure housing for Minnesotans with disabilities, mental illnesses, and substance abuse disorders, amid a federal investigation into fraud among providers.

DHS plans to redesign and relaunch the program with help from the Legislature, community partners, providers and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

James Clark, the department’s inspector general since March, said during the hearing that DHS has become ""more aggressive"" in combating fraud and has proactively suspended payments to providers suspected of fraud since May.

A probe had been launched after payments rose from $2.5 million in 2020 – the year Minnesota became the first state to offer Medicaid funding for housing stabilization – to more than $100 million in 2024.

Walz announces new fraud crackdown

Also ahead of Wednesday's hearing, Gov. Tim Walz issued an anti-fraud executive order ""directing state agencies to intensify efforts to prevent, detect, and combat fraud across Minnesota government programs.""

He said in an announcement that the state has ""no tolerance for fraud,"" and anyone who commits fraud in Minnesota ""will be prosecuted and held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""

The executive order includes the creation of the Statewide Inspector General Coordinating Council, led by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, in an effort to ""unify agency inspectors general, enhance data sharing, (and) coordinate investigations.""

“Abuse of taxpayer dollars takes resources away from the people who need them most,"" Walz said in a statement. ""While we will continue to urge the legislature to take further action, this executive order gives our agencies additional tools to safeguard taxpayer dollars.”

But committee chair Rep. Kristin Robbins (R-Maple Grove) said an independent inspector general's office, outside of agency control, is needed ""to provide meaningful oversight, restore public trust, and strengthen program integrity.""

Robbins had earlier issued a statement calling Grumdahl's apparent termination ""yet another example of DHS and the Walz Administration dodging accountability for their failures.""

Members of the committee had expected Grumdahl to attend the hearing so he could answer questions on reported fraud.

""While I’m glad to see they are finally starting to hold individuals running these programs accountable for fraud, doing it the day before the public hearing just shows how DHS tries to hide what is going on from legislators and the public,"" Robbins said.

The Republican candidate for governor, who will face Walz as he seeks reelection, pledged to fight fraud when she announced her campaign in August.

During the hearing, Robbins was accused by a DFL legislator of a potential conflict of interest, as she is the chair of a committee investigating fraud, while simultaneously running for governor on an anti-fraud message. She rejected the concern, however, saying she doesn't see a conflict.

Rep. Dave Pinto (D-St. Paul) issued a statement after the hearing accusing Robbins of using the committee as ""an exercise in campaign politics"" to leverage her gubernatorial bid.

The DFL lawmaker, who works as a prosecutor outside of the Legislature, said: ""Since the start of the 2025 session, the House Fraud Committee has done next to nothing to prevent fraud. It has received not one bill and has acted on not one policy. This spring, as the Legislature passed a two-year budget, including funding and policy changes for the programs discussed at today’s hearing, the committee played little if any role. Instead, the committee has served almost entirely as a setting for questioning and criticism of the executive branch – again, without any tie to policy change.

“Up until Rep. Robbins’ announcement, the committee was merely a waste of time.""",https://bringmethenews.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNjI3MTI1NzI5NzMyMDgw/dsc_8595.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 14:58:22.110643

While the Trump administration pushed to terminate the deportation protections for Venezuelans and other nationalities, federal courts have repeatedly upheld the Biden administration’s decisions to maintain the status.

On Sept. 5, federal Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco ruled that it was unlawful for the Trump administration and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to eliminate TPS from over half-a-million Venezuelans, effectively reinstating their deportation protections and extending TPS through October 2026.

“The Secretary’s actions in revoking TPS were not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which they were taken but also violated the law,” the judge wrote.

This ruling underscores the ongoing legal uncertainties facing hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries living in the U.S. and highlighting the critical importance of re-registration, legal challenges and vigilant advocacy as their status remains under threat.

Here are the answers to some of the key questions about the status and what recent legal developments mean.

How does Venezuela’s Temporary Protected Status work?

Temporary Protected Status provides deportation protections and work permits to over half-a-million Venezuelans. The federal protections are granted to nationals from countries in turmoil who are living in the United States and cannot go back to their home countries because of war, natural disasters or other devastating circumstances.

There are two TPS designations for Venezuela. The Biden administration granted the first one in 2021, and it protects about 252,000 people. The second one was granted in 2023, and it protects about 350,000 people. The Biden administration granted the protections citing a severe humanitarian emergency, a collapse of basic services, political turbulence and economic problems.

Why did the Trump administration decide to end TPS for Venezuela?

Venezuela was the first country to have its TPS designation terminated under the current administration. The Department of Homeland Security said the designation went against American national interests despite what conditions in the country were. But it also said that certain conditions, like healthcare, public safety and the economy had improved enough for a safe return.

That’s despite Trump’s State Department warning Americans and green-card holders to not travel to Venezuela. The department issued a “Do not travel” advisory, raising alarm about the risk of “wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, and arbitrary enforcement of local laws,” as well as poor health infrastructure, civil unrest, and crime.”

In 2021, just one day before leaving office, the Trump administration issued a Memorandum of Deferred Enforced Departure for certain Venezuelans, directing that their removal be deferred for 18 months. The memo cited the “autocratic government of Nicolás Maduro,” stating that it had “consistently violated the sovereign freedoms possessed by the Venezuelan people.” The move acknowledged the severe conditions in Venezuela, despite broader attempts by the second Trump administration to limit humanitarian protections like TPS.

In August, the Trump administration designated the “Cartel of the Suns”—which U.S. prosecutors allege is led by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and other high-ranking members of his regime—as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” entity.

This designation raises the possibility that the cartel, and potentially Venezuelan government-linked actors, could become direct targets of U.S. military action if the administration chooses to escalate further. In September, several U.S. amphibious warships and destroyers were reportedly deployed near Venezuelan waters as part of an intensified crackdown on transnational drug cartels.

The move marked a sharp escalation in the political confrontation between Washington and Caracas. The developments underscore the growing instability and danger in Venezuela, further highlighting how unsafe it would be for Venezuelans living in the U.S. to return if their deportation protections under TPS were revoked.

What’s happened so far in the litigation about Venezuela’s TPS?

After Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced it would end a Biden-era TPS extension for Venezuelans protected under the 2023 designation in February, the National TPS Alliance and seven Venezuelans with TPS sued the Trump administration.

On March 31, Judge Chen issued a preliminary order blocking the Trump administration’s attempt to revoke deportation protections for about 252,000 Venezuelans, just days before their TPS was set to expire on April 7. Chen ruled that Venezuelan nationals with TPS could suffer “irreparable injury” without a stay preventing their deportations.

In April, a federal appeals court upheld Chen’s stay, rejecting the government’s request to lift the protection. However, on May 19, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing the termination of TPS to proceed while the legal case continues to be litigated.

The high court’s decision did not address the underlying merits of the lawsuit, which contests the Department of Homeland Security’s revocation policy. But it did give the Trump administration the green light to end the program while litigation was pending and left nearly all TPS holders under the 2023 designation without their protections. Only about 5,000 kept their status after another Chen ruling later/

Last month, the appeals court upheld Chen’s March ruling . On Sept. 5, days before the 2021 designation was set to expire, Chen ordered the Trump administration to keep TPS for all Venezuelans through October 2026.

The Trump administration asked Chen to overturn the order, but Chen denied the request.

Why is there litigation if TPS is meant to be temporary?

TPS is designed to provide temporary relief to nationals of countries experiencing unsafe conditions for return, lasting only until those conditions improve. However, in many cases, including Venezuela, the unsafe conditions persist for years. The federal government reviews country conditions every 6, 12, or 18 months and can decide whether to renew the protections depending on what’s happening in a certain country.

The ongoing Venezuelan humanitarian crisis continues. Last year’s presidential election, which let to Nicolás Maduro remaining in power, was widely criticized in the Western Hemisphere for lacking credibility and legitimacy.

Other countries also have years-long designations under TPS.

Honduras and Nicaragua have maintained TPS status for over 25 years due to prolonged crises like climate disasters. These long-standing TPS designations have also been the subject of litigation under the Trump administration, which sought to terminate or restrict the protections.

How many Venezuelans with TPS are protected under Chen’s most recent ruling?

About 605,000 Venezuelan beneficiaries currently hold TPS, regardless of when they initially received their protection, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Venezuelans represent the largest group of TPS holders in the United States, with the majority residing in Florida and Texas. It is important to note that not all TPS recipients have applied for or received work permits under this status, and the exact number with work authorization remains unclear.

How many Venezuelans have work authorization under TPS?

There is currently no official breakdown of how many Venezuelan TPS holders have received work authorization specifically through TPS. This is partly because individuals can have multiple immigration processes pending simultaneously—such as asylum claims, adjustment of status, or other forms of relief—which may also grant them work eligibility.

However, according to the Department of Homeland Security, Venezuelans who have been granted work authorization under TPS are authorized to work in the United States through April 2, 2026. Do Venezuelans have automatic TPS extension?

No. Venezuelan TPS holders were required to re-register between Jan. 17 — when the Biden administration extended TPS — and Sept. 10, despite ongoing litigation. Those who failed to re-register during this period lost their deportation protection.

Complicating matters further, on the final day of re-registration, Venezuela was no longer listed as a designated TPS country in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website, causing confusion and preventing some eligible individuals from completing the process.

In response, the National TPS Alliance filed a legal challenge, and Judge Chen ordered the government to provide additional time for Venezuelans to re-register for TPS, ensuring that those affected by the online omission would not lose their protection.

What documents prove a Venezuelan under TPS can legally work and remain in the U.S.?

Several official documents establish that Venezuelans under TPS can legally remain in the United States:

Notice of re-registration from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, confirming continued TPS eligibility.

Homeland Security’s Designation of Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela, including the recent federal ruling on Sept. 5 by Judge Chen.

A Federal Register notice on Jan. 17, 2025, detailing the extension of Venezuela’s TPS designation under the Biden administration, which explains the legal basis for the status and its continuation.

The decision by Judge Chen upholding the extension of TPS protections for Venezuelans granted under the Biden administration.

Together, the documents provide the legal foundation for Venezuelans to work and to remain in the U.S. under TPS protections amid ongoing legal challenges.

Is the Trump administration expected to appeal the most recent ruling?

While no appeal has been filed yet, Venezuelan advocates and attorneys anticipate the case could eventually reach the Supreme Court, potentially setting a precedent not only for Venezuelans under TPS but also for other nations receiving similar protections.

Lawyers in South Florida have warned that if the case reaches the Supreme Court again and the nation’s highest court side with the Trump administration, Venezuelans who have only TPS protections and no other immigration processes ongoing could find themselves undocumented and having accrued unlawful time in the United States — leaving them vulnerable to being banned for years from entering the country and making them ineligible for certain visas.

Do Venezuelans living in the U.S. hold another immigration status in addition to TPS?

There are no official statistics breaking down how many Venezuelans with TPS also hold another immigration status. However, between fiscal years 2021 and 2023, at least 331,000 Venezuelans applied for asylum, according to data from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. About one-third of the applications were filed during deportation proceedings, indicating that many Venezuelans in the U.S. are pursuing multiple forms of legal protection simultaneously.

How many Venezuelans live in the U.S.?

According to the U.S. Census data, about 900,000 Venezuelans live in the United States, though some estimates put the number closer to 1.3 million. Around 602,000 Venezuelans had been approved for TPS, according to the Congressional Research Service. Venezuelans now make up the largest TPS holder group in the country, representing more than half of the total TPS population, which exceeds 1 million.

What is the economic impact of Venezuelan TPS holders in the U.S.?

As the largest TPS migrant group in the country, Venezuelans contribute significantly to the U.S. economy. According to the immigration reform nonprofit FWD.us, Venezuelan TPS holders generate an estimated $11.5 billion annually in economic activity.

Now to the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement and the case of a U.S. citizen who was caught in the middle.

Andrea Velez says she was wrongfully arrested this past summer in downtown Los Angeles, swept up in an immigration raid on her way to work. Velez says she froze, was knocked to the ground by an ICE officer, and despite declaring her citizenship was detained and led to a car. Fearing she was being kidnapped, she ran toward nearby LAPD officers, when ICE agents caught her and carried her back.

She spent two nights in jail before facing a felony charge for obstructing an officer, a charge the Justice Department dropped two weeks later.

I spoke earlier with Andrea Velez and her attorney, Luis Carrillo.

Thank you both for being with us.

Andrea, we will start with you.

Take us back to that morning. Your mother and sister had just dropped you off for work. What happened next?

Andrea Velez, Formerly Detained U.S. Citizen:

Suddenly, I saw these cars swarming in, and I just remembered that they got out their cars that abruptly, and then they just looked like they were just ready to attack and chase.

They never identified themselves as ICE agents. They just started chasing people. And I remember watching just people running. And one of them I think was a street vendor. And that's when I noticed one coming towards my direction. And I used my bag as a form of protection to shield myself.

Then I remember that he just got — and pushed me and slammed me to the floor, to the ground. He started proceeding to say that I was interfering and that he was going to arrest me. I asked him for his badge number and his identification and also if he had a warrant. And he said that I didn't need to know any of that because all I had to look was at his vest.

They were all wearing civilian clothing, sneakers and gaiter masks. And when he was trying to arrest me, I noticed that there was people filming. And I started saying my name. ""I'm a U.S. citizen."" And I started saying my mom's name and her number, because I wasn't sure if she was going to know where I was at.

I just remember thinking like, she's probably going to wait for me to come home and I'm never going to come home. So that's why I started saying my name.

And then, when he decided to take me inside the car, he took my belongings. The ICE agent took my belongings. They left me in the car by myself. And I remember there was belongings, a backpack, and I remember there was a phone. I remember there was — it just looked like a regular car.

And then, when they left me alone, I noticed a helicopter swerving in, and I started hearing the LAPD coming. And somehow I managed to open the door. The door unlocked by itself. And that's when I started running to LAPD, thinking that they could help me. And I knew that they were there, that they were going to protect me, because they have uniforms on.

And one of them said, it's OK. And he just told me to put my hands behind my back and to face — like, face the front. Out of nowhere, I noticed that one of the ICE agents was coming. And he said: ""She's mine.""

And then they let them take me. And that's when I felt like — I felt like — like there's nothing I can do. I wasn't resisting or anything. And the ICE agent decided to make a show out of the whole thing. And he picked me up from my body and then he just decided to put me down. And then they took me into the car again.

Geoff Bennett:

He said, ""She's mine,"" physically picked you up off the ground and took you back to the car?

Andrea Velez:

Yes. Yes, correct.

Geoff Bennett:

When you told that ICE agent that you were a U.S. citizen, what was the response?

Andrea Velez:

It didn't seem like they cared. I even, at one point in the car, I — they were talking about how many bodies they got that day. They then — the driver, he proceeded to say that I was an alleged U.S. citizen. So he didn't ever bother checking my identification, not until we were already inside there, inside the place, yes.

Geoff Bennett:

Mr. Carrillo, what is the status of Andrea's case today?

Luis Carrillo, Attorney for Andrea Velez: They dismissed the criminal charges against her in the federal courts. We have filed a claim, which is the precursor to a lawsuit against the federal government, because they had no basis to arrest her at all.

And so what we have seen — we represent nine U.S. citizens who were manhandled, beaten, thrown to the ground. And the ICE agents or Border Patrol agents never acknowledged their pleas when they were saying, I'm a U.S. citizen, I'm a U.S. citizen.

Geoff Bennett:

What does justice look like for Ms. Velez and the other people you represent?

Luis Carrillo:

Justice looks, for us, we're making a monetary claim. But the ideal is that they stop ICE and Border Patrol, they stop doing this damage to our people.

But they're rounding up everybody that has a brown skin in California. And it's happening in other places. We want that to stop.

Geoff Bennett:

Ms. Velez, how long were you held and what were the conditions like in the detention center?

Andrea Velez:

I was there on Tuesday evening towards Thursday morning. I remember there wasn't a bed for me. The ladies that were in there were nice enough to grab me a bed. They told me that if I wanted to drink water, I had to grab a cup, but the cup, I had to pay for.

And because I didn't have money on my commissary account, I couldn't get water. One of the nice people there let me borrow their cup for just to drink. And then, later that day, this lady, she was getting out that day and she was nice enough to give me her cup and her fork, her spork, so I could eat that day.

So they had given rice and chicken in the, like, dinner, so I was able to eat a little bit of that.

Geoff Bennett:

You have been working remotely because you're afraid to go downtown; is that right? What has this experience been like for you? How has it changed you?

Andrea Velez:

It's been challenging, just because you're not safe outside. And now that the — that they are still rounding up people, it's every day. It's a fear, like where are they going to be at? Like, you don't know what's going to happen, yes.

Geoff Bennett:

Andrea Velez, Luis Carrillo, we thank you both for your time.

Andrea Velez:

Thank you.

Luis Carrillo:

For the most part, the Court has done its job of protecting Convention rights well.
But the main obstacle to removing migrants is not international human rights law.","The European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights are under attack again.

In May, nine European Union states including Poland, Italy and Denmark, suggested that the human rights court was constraining their ability to act for public safety, particularly over immigration, and had strayed beyond its original mandate.

The UK government has since joined the chorus, with the then-Lord Chancellor saying in June that the way courts interpret the convention is “out of step with common sense,” against a domestic backdrop of calls for the UK to leave it altogether. Even the Council of Europe’s Secretary General said the convention needed to “adapt” (though confusingly, he also said it did not need reform).

To understand why the Court and Convention are so important, it’s worth recalling their origins ad understanding the potential consequences of these attacks.

With the horrors of the Second World War fresh in their memory, European leaders, including Winston Churchill, created the European Convention on Human Rights to help guard against future human rights violations. To uphold its promise, they also founded a regional court to step in when national courts were unable or unwilling to protect people’s rights. (Despite sharing part of their name, they have no connection to the European Union).

For the most part, the Court has done its job of protecting Convention rights well. Many of the human rights protections we enjoy in Europe today arise from the work of the Court – including ending corporal punishment against children in schools, protecting press freedom, and protecting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.

The Court will only take a case if a person has already sought and been unable to find justice in national courts. It rejects most applications that are brought to it. And historically its judges have deferred significantly to governments on questions of how rights should be interpreted in national law and policy.

So why is it that the Court faces such opprobrium from democratic governments?

The first answer is obvious – the Court holds governments to account for their actions, including with fines and orders to address violations. And governments don’t like having their power constrained, whether by courts, the media or otherwise.

Beyond that there are two main criticisms: First, that the Court’s judges interpret the Convention to “find” rights that were never intended by its framers 70 some years ago. Second, that the Court’s interpretation of the right to family life has led to deportations being blocked in immigration cases.

The criticism about judges “finding” rights is misplaced. The Court does apply the Convention as a living instrument to factual situations that were not envisioned when the treaty was drafted. In doing so it applies the rights in the treaty rather than creating new ones. And its actions ensure that the convention continues to protect the rights of people as the framers intended.

On immigration, it is true that national courts apply the convention in ways that sometimes frustrate government efforts to deport foreign nationals. In some cases, those decisions draw on European Court rulings. But the main obstacle to removing migrants is not international human rights law. A key issue is that the states from which the migrants originate frequently decline to accept or cooperate with their return, frustrating deportation efforts. As governments in Europe blame human rights for tying their hands on migration, so the media has followed, stirring negative public sentiments.

While the right to family life is sometimes cited by domestic courts as a reason why foreign nationals convicted of crimes cannot be deported, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the basis of those decisions. It is the impact on the rights of other family members (for example, children) who are lawful residents and often citizens rather than the person facing deportation that are often crucial to the decision. Their rights are often forgotten in the political debate around the issue.

While the European Court undoubtedly constrains state action at times, that is what it was designed to do: to protect people from overreach by the state, and ultimately to serve as a bulwark against tyranny and war. It protects 700 million people across the Council of Europe region.

While the Court is not without problems – a long backlog of cases means decisions can take years – genuine reform efforts have helped streamline its decision making. The main obstacle to its effective functioning remains the reluctance of some governments to fully implement its rulings and tackle the persistent abuses that lead to them.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media/images/photographs/2011_France_ECHR.jpg?itok=K9xfTSx-,N,,2025-09-18 05:56:26.808485

Cruz is an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by the New York City Police Department for murder, attempted murder, assault, vehicular manslaughter and several other felony crimes after he mowed down a 16-year-old, her mother, and her stepfather with his vehicle after the teenager refused his drunken, lewd advances on Sept. 13. The collision killed the young girl and injured her mother.

“Another young family is dealing with an unimaginable and all-too-preventable tragedy due to soft-on-crime sanctuary policies and prior open-border policies that let criminal aliens pour into our country with impunity,” said acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons. “The days of criminal aliens being given carte blanche to harm innocent people are over. These violent offenders will face the full force of the law and then be expeditiously removed from the U.S.”

Cruz illegally entered the U.S. near Nogales, Arizona, Nov. 10, 2004. On April 20, 2005, an immigration judge denied his applications for asylum and withholding of removal, granting him voluntary departure until June 20, 2005, with an alternate order of removal. On May 20, 2005, Cruz filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals, but it dismissed his appeal, vacated his voluntary departure, and remanded his case back to immigration court, where a judge ordered him removed from the U.S.

At some point thereafter, Cruz illegally reentered the U.S. ICE officers encountered him on April 29, 2013, after his arrest on Long Island for DUI. ICE officers took custody of him the same day pursuant to an immigration detainer and reinstatement of his deportation order. He was released from ICE detention on July 1, 2013, for enrollment into the Alternatives to Detention Program. Cruz subsequently absconded and all attempts to locate him were unsuccessful.

Cruz racked up additional arrests for possession of a forged instrument (October 2024); disorderly conduct: creating hazardous or physically offensive conditions; attempted driving while; and attempted operation of a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .08% or more (January 2025).

Flurries of executive orders have become part of a strategy to circumvent accountability for unconstitutional measures taken against a so-called “immigration crisis.”

Despite research showing that “crime rates, offending rates and incarceration rates tend to be lower amongst foreign-born individuals,” endless promises to solve the immigration-as-crisis narrative permeated politics in 2024. Whether it was in hopes of winning the White House or a seat in the Senate, this desperate framing prevailed. Concessions to sensationalist right-wing talking points blaming immigrants for crime and unraveling social cohesion eventually set the stage for this hostile shift in our nation’s immigration policy.

The immigration crisis narrative has served its purpose in manufacturing consent for the administration to subject anyone deemed a target, regardless of their legal status, to unimaginable violence and cruelty. Meanwhile, media coverage of escalating immigration law enforcement reifies this narrative, holding a magnifying glass to the chaotic executive onslaught attempting to bring Trump’s mass deportation fantasy into reality.

Back in the Oval Office, Trump finds himself under virtually zero oversight as he guts public institutions to bankroll his agenda. Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are seeing an influx of government spending like never before. Civilians emboldened by anti-immigrant rhetoric are among those benefitting from that investment, taking jobs enforcing these policies as unaccountable, unidentifiable footsoldiers.

This approach to handling immigration—relying on a barrage of dubious legal arguments that paralyze courts—is trickling its way into Wisconsin. Several counties are partnering with ICE for 287(g) and State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) agreements. These policies provide law enforcement agencies with financial incentives for incorporating Trumpian violations of constitutional protections into their activities. Tone Madison reported on the Dane County Sheriff’s Office’s (DCSO) participation in SCAAP in 2023. Two years later, DSCO announced its withdrawal from the program.

“Both programs are these ICE programs that incentivize the detention of people who are here— not just people with an unauthorized immigration status, but now it’s just anybody who they deem might be a criminal,” says political scientist and UW–Madison professor Armando Ibarra. (Full disclosure: Ibarra is my Latino History and Politics professor.)

Individuals trying to navigate the broken immigration system are being detained in courts, and the people in positions to stop it are being silenced. All the while, the threat of federal intervention still looms—because, for this administration, mere complacency doesn’t get the job done quite as fast as total subjugation.

Federal crackdowns are portrayed as a harsh but necessary response to the “invasion” narrative, which opens the door for the executive power to justify revoking constitutional rights and freedoms in the process. This illustration—the menacing authoritarian ripping down the foundations of justice and whipping everything into shape—hinges on the hope that we fall for that fantasy. If we start to believe that our rights are as good as gone anyway, why bother putting up a struggle?

But faltering in the face of authoritarian pressure is not an option. Wisconsin-based organizations—some operating right here in Madison—are showing how this is the case.

This month, the League of Women Voters of Dane County brought together community voices to share information about immigration issues and measures that people are taking in response to renewed fears. Dane County residents heard from Ibarra, Voces de la Frontera (VDLF) executive director Christine Neumann-Ortiz, and Community Immigration Law Center (CILC) legal director and attorney Aissa Olivarez. The panelists discussed immigration statistics in Dane County, the possibility of federal intervention, and the necessity of community awareness and involvement.

“We need policies that build communities that are safe, collectively prosperous, and protect our rights at a time when the campaign of terror against immigrants is being waged as a tool to attack the judiciary, silence dissent, and violate human rights and due process,” Neumann-Ortiz says, during her panel.

Several organizations have been answering calls to action—stepping in to provide vital resources for the people being targeted by the federal overhaul in immigration policies. VDLF organizes a rapid response network and an emergency hotline for those at risk of being detained. The CILC administers pro bono legal services for individuals in need and hosts a legal clinic that provides counseling directly to individuals and families from all over the state.

“People in immigration court, who are at risk of deportation, have the right to an attorney, but not the right to a government-funded attorney, like we do in criminal proceedings. So we sort of created this public defender-type opportunity for immigrants at risk of deportation through our programming,” says Olivarez.

CILC partners with law students volunteering for the UW–Madison Immigrant Justice Center to connect people at the Dodge County Detention Facility, the only one in Wisconsin, which has now reached capacity. Individuals are now being sent out, often without notice, to facilities across the country, where their cases risk falling between the cracks of the system.

“I think what we’re seeing—along with an uptick in enforcement, detention, and deportation—is sort of this tactic of moving people quickly so that they don’t have access to the information that they would normally have in these facilities,” Olivarez says.

CILC’s operations, like many of the organizations providing these resources, largely rely on individual donations and volunteers. Olivarez describes their mission: “We’re a grassroots small organization, and we’re working to be able to invest to continue to grow. And part of that means, you know, us personally going and speaking at places and doing outreach about this work and educating the community about what universal [legal] representation is, right?”

Open Doors for Refugees (ODFR) emerged in 2016, built from the collective efforts of people attending an event meant to raise awareness for the Syrian refugee crisis.

“After one of the events somebody just said, ‘If you’re interested in doing something about all this, stay after,’ and a lot of people stayed after, and that just kind of started the conversation,” says Jason Mack, executive director of ODFR. Since then, the organization has developed a range of services for refugees settling in Madison, made possible through its partnerships with neighboring organizations. This includes assisting Jewish Social Services (JSS) with refugee resettlement by collecting furniture donations, providing volunteer transportation services, and procuring warm clothes for recent arrivals bracing for their first winter in Wisconsin.

Rather than breaking families apart and pushing people out, these services function to welcome people into the Madison community. “Now, with the Trump administration taking over, they have basically shut down all refugee resettlement,” says Mack. In response, ODFR has pivoted its services toward a broader portion of the community with language tutoring and an upcoming workforce development project for immigrants and refugees.

These are just a few of the many options organized by the Madison community as an organic response to uncertainty and hostility at the federal level. Spaces providing reliable information and resources, like the events that brought together ODFR, create a forum for uniting organizations with aligned goals. This ultimately casts a wider, stronger network that can focus on connecting those in need to resources.

“You have the service organizations that work alongside the city, the state that provide services of connecting people to more socially integrate into the greater community. Then you have the advocacy organizations, or the social movement organizations, that are building collective power from the bottom up and see that as mutual defense needed in this current context,” adds Ibarra.

The energy to show up and do something is there, and it takes sustained collective effort in order to prevent it from fizzling away. The Madison community’s capacity to preemptively act in response to crisis—that of federal violence enacted on our neighbors—shines when the community steps up and develops its own measures to support the most vulnerable. In times of uncertainty, we need a movement that doesn’t wait for a crisis to reach our streets, but instead takes on the job of bridging the deep gaps in our immigration system.

“This is a time for everybody to say, ‘I do have power. I do have things I can do. I can show up. I can volunteer. I can give. I can protest. I can write my legislator.’ You know, like, if we just all just fade under this kind of onslaught, then we let go of the power that we absolutely do have,” says Mack.",https://d3hccd6dowbbba.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/16211534/ImmiHeader.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 02:56:44.736948

Khalil, a former Columbia graduate student who helped organize campus protests, was arrested at his Manhattan residence and put into deportation proceedings.
Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” Khalil said.

Days later, the judge ordered Khalil’s release after determining that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community.","An immigration judge in Louisiana has ordered pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., deported to Syria or Algeria for failing to disclose certain information on his green card application, according to documents filed in federal court Wednesday by his lawyers.

Khalil’s lawyers suggested in a filing that they intend to appeal the deportation order, but expressed concern that the appeal process will likely be swift and unfavorable.

The order from the immigration judge, Jamee Comans, came despite a separate order in Khalil’s federal case in New Jersey blocking his deportation while that court considers Khalil’s legal argument that his detention and deportation are unlawful retaliation for his Palestinian advocacy.

Khalil’s March 8 arrest and subsequent detention in Louisiana was part of the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on foreign-born pro-Palestinian academics who were studying or working in the U.S. legally. Khalil, a former Columbia graduate student who helped organize campus protests, was arrested at his Manhattan residence and put into deportation proceedings. He has not been charged with a crime.

In a letter to the New Jersey federal judge, Michael Farbiarz, Khalil’s lawyers said they have 30 days from Sept. 12, the date of the immigration judge’s ruling, to appeal her decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals. The lawyers said they expect that process to be “swift” and that an appeal of the BIA decision, which would go to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, is unlikely to be successful, since, they wrote, the appeals court “almost never” grants stays of removal to noncitizens.

“As a result,” they wrote, “the only meaningful impediment to Petitioner’s physical removal from the United States would be this Court’s important order prohibiting removal during the pendency of his federal habeas case.” And, they wrote, “nothing would preserve his lawful permanent resident status.”

In a statement, Khalil, a Palestinian originally from Syria, accused the Trump administration of using “fascist tactics.”

“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” Khalil said.

For more than three months earlier this year, Khalil was held in detention in Louisiana after the Trump administration arrested him, invoking a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to deport any noncitizen — even a legal resident — if the secretary of State determines that the person’s continued presence harms U.S. foreign policy interests.

In June, Farbiarz, a Biden appointee, blocked the Trump administration from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds. Days later, the judge ordered Khalil’s release after determining that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community.

That allowed him to return to New York, where he was reunited with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and his newborn son, who was born during his detention.

The Trump administration, however, has continued to seek Khalil’s deportation via another rationale it tacked on after his arrest in Manhattan: that when he applied for a green card, he failed to disclose all his past employment and membership in certain organizations.

Federal government records from a 10-month period show more than two dozen detention policy violations of the facility’s land use conditions of approval with the city, which does not allow detainees to be kept overnight or held for more than 12 hours. The notice also references a second violation related to boarded windows, which is not associated with the land use approval.

A conditional land use approval has been in place since 2011, shortly after the building owner for 4310 S. Macadam Ave. secured a long-term lease with the General Services Administration for two agencies associated with ICE. The site includes a processing center where federal officers detain and interview people to determine their legal status as U.S. residents.

Like ICE sites in many U.S. cities, Portland’s South Waterfront facility has attracted attention since the current presidential administration ramped up immigration enforcement.

In response to formal complaints, the city’s permitting bureau launched an investigation in late July. The City reviewed data released to the Deportation Data Project, a nonprofit that leveraged the Freedom of Information Act to request information about all ICE processing centers.

Records indicate that detainees were held beyond the facility’s 12-hour limit or kept overnight 25 times between October 1, 2024 and July 27, 2025. The most recent violation during that period took place on May 20.

“U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement made clear detention limitation commitments to our community, and we believe they broke those policies more than two dozen times,” said Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, who oversees the City’s administration. “I am proud of our team for conducting a thorough, thoughtful investigation, and referring the matter to the next steps in the land use violation process.”

Under land use permitting rules, a landowner or operator has 30 days after receiving a notice of violation to correct the issue. If there is substantial evidence of violation, a fine can be issued. Portland Permitting & Development can also initiate a “reconsideration” of a land use approval by scheduling a hearing at least 60 days after the notice. Once the hearings officer makes a decision, it can be appealed to the Portland City Council by any interested party.

While the matter progresses, ICE can continue to operate under its existing land use approval.

In recent years, the United States and Brazil have experienced comparable challenges to their democratic systems and the rule of law. Elected leaders in both nations, upon losing their reelection, challenged the electoral outcomes without substantiating evidence. They refused to accept the election results, inciting violence that, in the United States, culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and, two years later, in the invasion of Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court, and Presidential Palace on January 8, 2023.

On September 11, 2025, Brazil undertook a significant democratic stride as its judiciary held former President Jair Bolsonaro and other high-ranking officials accountable for their roles in various actions that laid the groundwork for the January 8 attempted coup d’état and assault on the rule of law. These actions are the result of months of extensive investigations; a similar effort had taken place regarding the assault on the U.S. Capitol before the re-election of President Trump in January 2025.

Despite the trial adhering to due process and serving as a robust institutional response to the assault on democratic norms and the rule of law in Brazil, since the beginning of Trump’s second term in office in January 2025, his administration has undertaken several troubling actions to infringe upon the independence of the Brazilian judiciary and its economy. This included the controversial imposition of Magnitsky Act sanctions on a member of the Supreme Federal Court and other associates, as well as their family members, and the implementation of unwarranted trade tariffs largely for political reasons. As with the Trump administration’s measures that threaten academic freedom, civil rights, and democratic norms in the United States, the administration’s actions towards Brazil are also alarming and represent an incorrect use of trade and U.S. sanctions policy to advance political interests.

The undersigned U.S. civil society organizations, dedicated to the promotion and defense of fundamental rights and freedoms in the U.S and internationally, express profound concern over the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine Brazilian democracy. Brazil’s judiciary has faced this situation by ensuring that those responsible face appropriate legal consequences.

Similar to other countries in Latin America, Brazil suffered a brutal dictatorship from 1964 to 1985 that resulted in the denial of civil liberties and human rights violations. Once the country returned to civilian rule, it developed strong democratic institutions with key checks and balances. This week’s ruling by the Brazilian judiciary should be welcomed as an indicator of the strength of the country’s democracy, not misconstrued as undermining it. We call on the Trump administration to refrain from any future attempts to interfere with judicial proceedings and decisions in Brazil and to respect free and fair elections in 2026.

Larson (CT-01) and Attorney General William Tong responded to the Trump Department of Homeland Security’s statement(link is external) targeting Rep. Larson and immigrant advocates for speaking out against ICE’s abusive tactics – including recent raids in Newington and Southington, Connecticut. Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to defending constitutional rights and holding the Trump Administration accountable for its attacks on free speech and civil liberties.

“Trump’s masked ICE agents took workers from Newington and Southington without notifying local officials – even tearing two mothers from their children,” said Larson. “Now, he is attacking me for defending them. This comes from a president who freed violent insurrectionists that assaulted and killed police, while he weaponizes the government against immigrant families and his political enemies. Decades fighting this type of authoritarianism taught me this: when government terrorizes communities, representatives can stand up or stand aside. I stand up. Always have. Always will.”

“This report is reckless, and this kind of irresponsible tagging of political enemies needs to stop before someone else is shot. We have to do better. But if I know one thing about John Larson, he will not be silenced. He’s going to keep speaking up—loudly—to call out wrongs when they occur, to defend our rights and our democracy, and to protect Connecticut families. And he’s going to do that with his voice and his votes, and it is incumbent upon all of us to see and know the difference between forceful and necessary democratic protest and bloodshed,” said Tong.

Following an ICE raid in Newington, Rep. Larson called on Congress to pass the No Secret Police Act(link is external), to require ICE agents to identify themselves and bar them from wearing masks, and the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act(link is external), to prevent ICE raids at schools, hospitals, courthouses, and places of worship. He also joined a group of his Democratic colleagues to launch a probe(link is external) into ICE detention of service members, veterans, and military families.

After the Supreme Court cleared the way last week for federal immigration authorities to make indiscriminate stops based on ethnicity, language, and other factors, Larson and a group of his colleagues introduced the Home Together Act to block the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development from sharing records with ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies, including home addresses and ethnicities.",http://larson.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/larson.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/DSC_0309.JPG,N,,2025-09-17 19:57:12.678347

The tap water is cloudy, smells strange and upsets stomachs, the families told their attorneys.","McALLEN, Texas (AP) — New revelations about conditions at a Texas detention facility for immigrant families have stoked ongoing concerns from attorneys representing children.

The details are part of a lawsuit where the government is attempting to end protections for children. Declarations from families held at the facility in Dilley, Texas, which was reopened in March, described persistently cloudy water, delayed medical attention and long periods of time children are being detained.

Allegations of children fighting adults for clean water, distraught children and a protracted medical response first surfaced during the summer while the federal government asked a federal judge to end a policy protecting immigrant children.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles, who presides over the case, heard arguments from the government, which wants to end the Flores Settlement agreement. The policy limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires safe and sanitary conditions.

After Gee told the government last month to provide detention times, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that the number of children in custody over 72 hours decreased from an average of six days to five days in June and July, respectively. The “vast majority” spent less than 72 hours in CBP custody, the report stated.

Attorneys representing the children reviewed the report and said some children are still being held for several weeks or months and often without justification.

About 65 families spoke to attorneys since Dilley opened.

“A huge percentage of families at Dilley are being apprehended from across the country as they dutifully appear for their immigration court hearings and ICE check-ins,” Leecia Welch, the deputy legal director at Children’s Rights who spoke with families, told The Associated Press in a statement.

The tap water is cloudy, smells strange and upsets stomachs, the families told their attorneys. The hand soap the facility provides for showers has been causing rashes, the families said. Children also struggle eating the food, like the snacks of graham crackers, apples, juice and milk.

Detainees are allowed to buy staples like bottled water for $1.21 from the commissary.

""I have never heard until now of children having to buy water,” said Welch, who has been visiting children in custody of CBP and the Office of Refugee Resettlement for eight years.

Families face costs as high as $5.73 for deodorant, $1.44 for soap, and $2.39 for toothpaste, Welch said in court documents. A single dose of Tylenol costs $1.30, she said.

A child with a stomachache waited six hours for a nurse and wasn't taken to a hospital with appendicitis until he vomited, court documents said. Another child fell on his arm and it wasn't until two hours later that the staff drove him to a hospital for an X-ray.

Parents said there are no organized activities for the children and only an hour of instruction from workbooks.

A woman's son told her that he ""doesn’t believe in God anymore because he prays to him but we still haven’t been able to get out of here,” according to her declaration, provided by Welch.

Some families are being released only to be detained again, Welch said. One family released after about 60 days in federal detention was asked to check in with ICE only to be detained at their appointment.

But the Supreme Court did not feel the need to explain itself.

The federal district court found that ICE was stopping people without reasonable suspicion, with race being a primary factor in its actions.
The day after the Supreme Court’s ruling, I began the class by discussing the case.","The Supreme Court’s recent ruling upholding raids by ICE agents in Los Angeles and other cities, targeting people based on their skin color and accents, is inconsistent with fundamental constitutional principles. It legitimizes race-based policing and understandably will cause enormous fear in cities throughout the nation.

A federal district court in Los Angeles had found that ICE agents were stopping individuals without reasonable suspicion that they were unlawfully in the United States. The district court identified a number of instances of people, citizens and non-citizens, who were stopped based on their apparent ethnicity, the language they spoke, and where they worked.

The federal district court required that ICE agents comply with the Fourth Amendment and only stop individuals where there is reasonable suspicion that they are in the United States unlawfully. The court said that ICE agents could not rely on four factors in stopping an individual: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; presence at a particular location (e.g., bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, etc.); or the type of work one does.

The United States government appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In a lengthy opinion, the appellate court upheld the district court’s order.

But the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, reversed and allowed ICE to resume its racial profiling, while the matter continues to be litigated in the lower courts.

A ruling without explanation

There is much that is deeply disturbing about the Supreme Court’s action. To begin with, the Court wrote no opinion, not a word of explanation. The lower courts wrote long, persuasive opinions in a very short period of time. But the Supreme Court did not feel the need to explain itself. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was in the majority, wrote an opinion just for himself, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the three dissenters.

Judicial opinions are important in providing explanations to the parties to the litigation and to the public. They provide guidance to lower courts and to the government officials who must implement the decisions. “Because I said so” is never persuasive and especially not when coming from the Supreme Court.

The Court’s ruling is at odds with the Constitution. The Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion before anyone -- citizen or non-citizen, documented or undocumented -- is stopped by law enforcement officers. The Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection prevents people from being stopped based on their race.

No one disputes that this is the law. The federal district court found that ICE was stopping people without reasonable suspicion, with race being a primary factor in its actions. This should be sufficient to justify the district court’s order that ICE must comply with the Constitution.

Kavanaugh misapplies the Fourth Amendment

Justice Kavanaugh, in his opinion, says that because there are a large number of undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles, that justifies stopping individuals based on their apparent ethnicity, the language they speak, and where they work. But the core of the Fourth Amendment is that no one can be stopped by the police without individualized suspicion that he or she has committed a crime.

Justice Kavanaugh says that the “interests of individuals who are illegally in the country in avoiding being stopped by law enforcement for questioning is ultimately an interest in evading the law.” This profoundly misunderstands the Fourth Amendment: it protects the right of every person – citizen or non-citizen – to be free from being stopped by the police unless there is individualized reasonable suspicion.

It is sadly ironic that the conservative justices who have insisted that the Constitution requires that the government be color-blind ignored that here and allowed overtly race-based policing. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in a powerful dissent: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish and appears to work in a low wage job.”

I am teaching Criminal Procedure this semester. The day after the Supreme Court’s ruling, I began the class by discussing the case. A woman in the class spoke up and said, “My father is Latino. He is a citizen. He speaks English with a heavy accent. He is retired and likes to work around the home. He often goes to stores like Home Depot. I am petrified every day that he will be apprehended by ICE.” She then burst into tears.

And those who look and sound like him every reason to worry. It should not be that way under our Constitution.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/11m41z/picture311110405/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/COVER.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 00:56:39.249097

Greenberg Traurig explained the far-reaching nature of this change in a June GT Alert.

Gov. Pritzker signed the bill into law on August 15. A circuit court recently dismissed one challenge to the law brought by various Illinois lawmakers.

Illinois Lawmakers Sued to Declare Senate Bill 328 Null and Void

On June 17, just over two weeks after Senate Bill 328 passed, a group of 47 Illinois lawmakers filed a lawsuit in Sangamon County against Representative Emanuel “Chris” Welch, the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, and Senator Don Harmon, President of the Illinois Senate. The plaintiffs claimed that the process of passing the Senate Bill—which Speaker Welch and President Harmon certified as complying with all procedural rules—violated the “Three Readings Rule” in the Illinois Constitution. Under this Rule, a bill must “be read by title on three different days in each house” of the General Assembly before passage. Ill. Const. Art. IV, § 8(d). According to court filings, the plaintiffs sought an injunction and a declaration that Senate Bill 328 is null and void because it failed to comply with the Three Readings Rule.

The plaintiffs alleged that, hours before Senate Bill 328’s passage, it purported to amend portions of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure concerning e-filing and pleadings. At the “eleventh hour” of the legislative session, however, the plaintiffs claimed that a floor amendment “completely replaced” the existing language with the toxic-tort jurisdiction law that ultimately passed. The plaintiffs asserted that this essentially new bill was not read three times and therefore violated the Three Readings Rule.

Speaker Welch and President Harmon claimed that the title of Senate Bill 328 was read three times before passage. The 47 lawmakers replied that the title (“An Act Concerning Civil Law”) was too vague to apprise lawmakers of the bill’s contents and that the bill was titled before the toxic-tort amendments.

The Circuit Court Dismissed the Lawsuit and Rejected the Lawmakers’ Constitutional Challenges

Speaker Welch and President Harmon moved to dismiss the lawsuit. Among other arguments, they contended that pursuant to the “enrolled-bill doctrine,” the court should not reach the issue of whether Senate Bill 328 complied with the Three Readings Rule. Under the enrolled-bill doctrine, “once the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate certify that the procedural requirements for passing a bill have been met, a bill is conclusively presumed to have met all procedural requirements for passage.” Accuracy Firearms, LLC v. Pritzker, 2023 IL App (5th) 230035, ¶ 36. Illinois courts “will not invalidate legislation on the basis of the three-readings requirement if the legislation has been certified.” Id. Separately, Speaker Welch and President Harmon also argued that because the lawmakers are not foreign corporations potentially subject to Senate Bill 328’s new jurisdictional requirements, they lacked standing to challenge its passage.

The lawmakers countered that though Senate Bill 328 was certified, the enrolled-bill doctrine “renders the Three Readings Rule utterly meaningless” because lawmakers may falsely certify that the bill complied, precluding judicial review. The plaintiffs sought a change in the law, stating that the “era of abuse of the Three Readings Rule and the Court’s blind adherence to the Enrolled Bill Doctrine must come to an end, and it should end with the invalidation of SB 328.” They also asserted they had standing to bring this lawsuit because each of them, “by virtue of being members of the General Assembly, have been directly affected by the [allegedly unconstitutional] procedure by which SB 328 was passed.”

On August 21, the circuit court granted the motion to dismiss, agreeing both that the enrolled-bill doctrine barred the challenge and that the plaintiffs lacked standing. It explained that while the Illinois Supreme Court noted in 1992 that “ignoring the three-readings requirement has become a procedural regularity,” Geja’s Café v. Metro. Pier & Exposition Auth., 153 Ill. 2d 239, 260 (1992), the Illinois Supreme Court has since “addressed three readings challenges on several occasions and has, without exception, followed the enrolled bill rule.” Noting that the parties agreed that Speaker Welch and President Harmon certified Senate Bill 328 as complying with all procedural requirements, and concluding itself bound by Supreme Court precedent, the circuit court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice.

The circuit court then went further, separately holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge Senate Bill 328. According to the court, Senate Bill 328 affects only “foreign corporations that will have to consent to the general jurisdiction of the Illinois Courts.” Thus, it continued, because the plaintiff lawmakers are not foreign corporations, they will never be subject to or injured by the law. Accordingly, the circuit court found that no actual controversy existed and that the plaintiffs had an insufficient interest in the lawsuit, as required to have standing to bring a declaratory-judgment action. In short, the circuit court dismissed the lawsuit on this separate ground because “Senate Bill 328 can never affect [the] plaintiffs.”

In March, Padilla blasted the Trump Administration’s stop work order to organizations that provide legal services for unaccompanied children and demanded they protect Congressionally mandated legal representation for these children in the immigration system.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, criticized Senate Republicans’ hypocrisy in convening a hearing focused on the Biden Administration’s management of unaccompanied children as multiple recent reports emerge about the current Administration’s cruel mistreatment of unaccompanied children, ongoing family separations, and disregard for child safety and the rule of law. During his opening statement at the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing, Padilla called on his Republican colleagues to join him in pushing for oversight and accountability over this Administration’s flagrant violations of unaccompanied migrant children’s rights.

Padilla slammed the Trump Administration for attempting to unlawfully deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children in the middle of night over Labor Day weekend despite their ongoing immigration proceedings and fear of returning to Guatemala. Despite the Trump Administration’s claims to the contrary, a whistleblower disclosure yesterday alleged that at least 30 unaccompanied Guatemalan children the Administration attempted to deport without due process were flagged in the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s (ORR) database as having indicators of trafficking or child abuse if they were to be removed to Guatemala. Ahead of the Subcommittee hearing, Padilla and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) requested an oversight hearing on ORR’s mass child deportation efforts and apparent lies under oath.

He also highlighted reporting from the Washington Post uncovering that the Trump Administration’s mass deportation agenda has reignited forced family separations, including a recent incident in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ripped a 35-year-old Honduran mother from her twin 14-year-old daughters despite her maintaining a work permit, a pathway to a visa, and a pending asylum claim.

Key quotes from Senator Padilla’s opening remarks are below:

“Too often, their stories of unaccompanied children go unheard until a horrific story about their mistreatment shocks the conscience of our country. And it’s not just a matter of past tense. It is not just a matter of what happened during the Biden Administration or in prior years. One of these stories broke out just a few weeks ago.”

“On Sunday, August 31st — at about 1 or 2 in the morning — 76 children in Texas shelters were jolted awake. In the middle of the night, with no warning, they were instructed to pack their bags, and immigration officials led them to an airport to be deported. Without a hearing, without due process, and without proper vetting to see if they would be safe back in Guatemala, these kids, as you can imagine, were terrified.”

“Now it’s on us to do the right thing and bring ORR officials before this committee to demand the truth. Now, Mr. Chairman, we are the committee of jurisdiction with an obligation to conduct oversight over ORR. So I don’t just ask you, I urge you: let’s work together to schedule an oversight hearing with ORR to get to the truth.”

“Every single one of us here has a responsibility to stand up for the children in our immigration system, whether it’s because of trafficking, physical or sexual abuse, child labor, or violations of their due process. And this is a responsibility that I don’t take lightly, none of us should take lightly.”

“The reality is, the Trump Administration officials should be the ones in the seats in front of us to field our questions and to answer our questions about their, in many ways, cruel and unlawful policies, especially after this whistleblower disclosure.”

“If we truly want to improve our immigration system and protect unaccompanied children, we’d be exercising our oversight authority to ask about the real harm currently happening to children because of the indiscriminate mass deportation policies that this Administration is carrying out. There has to be real oversight of this Administration and their dangerous treatment of minors.”

“So don’t lecture me about kids, and then at the same time grab defenseless children in the middle of the night to haul them off to a country when we know they will be in danger. Don’t lecture me about kids, but then refuse to call out this Administration when they deprive them of representation. And don’t lecture me about kids and then refuse to speak out when we hear parents are being forced to decide whether to be deported with their children or let them be sent to ORR shelters, as we learned just this morning.”

“Not a single child benefits from political theater. So today, it’s my hope that this hearing doesn’t devolve into just a competition of who can praise Trump the most or who can bash Biden the best. Because regardless of which party is in the White House, or which party is in the majority in Congress, keeping children safe should be a bipartisan concern.”

“Everybody in this hearing room and everybody watching at home: Democrats demanded accountability from the Biden Administration on what happened to children under their watch. And I invite our Republican colleagues to join us in demanding the same accountability from the Trump Administration about what’s happening to children under theirs.”

Video of Senator Padilla’s opening statement is available here and be downloaded here.

On Monday, Padilla, Durbin, and Representatives Jamie Raskin (D-Md.-08) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.-07) demanded answers from senior Administration officials on this cruel effort, including information on their compliance with due process and confidentiality obligations under asylum law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, and other statutory protections afforded to unaccompanied children by law.

Earlier this year, Senator Padilla led seven Senators in sounding the alarm on troubling reports that ORR unlawfully granted expanded access to sensitive data on unaccompanied children and their sponsors to ICE. The Senators raised serious concerns that ICE could misuse this confidential information to enact mass deportations and detain immigrant families and demanded DHS Secretary Noem and HHS Secretary Kennedy immediately cease this misguided practice. In March, Padilla blasted the Trump Administration’s stop work order to organizations that provide legal services for unaccompanied children and demanded they protect Congressionally mandated legal representation for these children in the immigration system.

Under the Biden Administration, Padilla co-chaired a hearing in which he condemned the labor exploitation of migrant children in the United States and called on the federal government to enforce the law and hold employers accountable for unlawfully exploiting migrant children.

After this ruling, the government shifted its justification for Mr. Khalil’s detention to false, retaliatory charges about purported misrepresentations on his green card application.","NEWARK, N.J. – Following the Trump administration’s latest effort to weaponize the immigration system to silence Mahmoud Khalil for his advocacy in support of Palestinian human rights, Mr. Khalil’s legal team today submitted a letter to the federal court in New Jersey overseeing his civil rights case. The letter to Judge Michael Farbiarz explains that Mr. Khalil will challenge a Sept. 12 decision made by the immigration judge in Louisiana that denied Mr. Khalil a waiver of removability, bringing him one step closer to a final order of removal, because of baseless, pretextual “misrepresentation” charges the government added after his detention.

As the letter notes, the immigration judge rushed to a decision without providing a hearing on the evidence as due process requires, engaging in multiple procedural irregularities, and choosing to believe the false charges made after the fact by the government. The letter also states how rare it is for an immigration judge to deny a waiver against a lawful permanent resident with a U.S. spouse and child, and no criminal record.

The federal district court’s separate orders, prohibiting the government from deporting or detaining Mr. Khalil as his federal court case proceeds, remain in effect. The letter to federal court explains that the immigration judge’s decision is further evidence of retaliation and that Mr. Khalil will be pressing ahead in federal court to prove these charges are pretextual and unlawful.

“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” said Mahmoud Khalil. “When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide. Such fascist tactics will never deter me from continuing to advocate for my people’s liberation.”

In June, the federal court ruled that the government’s original justification for Mr. Khalil’s detention based only on Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s say-so was likely unconstitutional and blocked his detention and deportation on that basis. After this ruling, the government shifted its justification for Mr. Khalil’s detention to false, retaliatory charges about purported misrepresentations on his green card application. As Mr. Khalil’s legal team thoroughly outlined in court filings, these after-the-fact charges are meritless and retaliatory.

“The Trump administration will stop at nothing to try to silence Mr. Khalil, including by denying him, his family, and his supporters the right to testify in immigration court, in complete contravention of the U.S. Constitution,” said Johnny Sinodis, partner at Van Der Hout LLP. “We have witnessed a constant lack of humanity and allegiance to the law throughout proceedings in this farcical Louisiana immigration court, and the immigration judge’s September 12 decision is just the most recent example of what occurs when the system requires an arbiter that is anything but neutral to do the administration’s bidding. As with other illegal efforts by the government, this too will be challenged and overcome.”

“When the immigration prosecutor, judge, and jailor all answer to Donald Trump, and that one man is eager to weaponize the system in a desperate bid to silence Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. permanent resident whose only supposed sin is that he stands against an ongoing genocide in Palestine, this is the result,” said Ramzi Kassem, co-director of CLEAR. “A plain-as-day First Amendment violation that also puts on sharp display the rapidly freefalling credibility of the entire U.S. immigration system.”

Mr. Khalil is represented by Dratel & Lewis, the Center for Constitutional Rights, CLEAR, Van Der Hout LLP, Washington Square Legal Services, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the ACLU of New Jersey, and the ACLU of Louisiana.

Marchers held photos of Silverio Villegas-Gonzáles — the 38-year-old man fatally shot by an immigration agent in nearby Franklin Park Friday — during an afternoon procession through Melrose Park Tuesday.

“[ICE] assassinated a hard-working man, a father that only wanted to drop off his kids, go to work and then come back … but he never came back home,” said Nancy Salgado, director of organizing for the Melrose Park-based immigrant rights nonprofit PASO West Suburban Action Project. “Today, we stand in solidarity with his family.”

Organizers of Tuesday’s march, attended by about 50 people and originally designed to protest the growing presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the Chicago area, dedicated the event to Villegas-Gonzáles’ family upon learning of Friday’s shooting Salgado said. The event unfolded as elected officials such as Gov. JB Pritzker continue to call for an investigation into the shooting and for ICE to provide more information about what led to the fatal shots being fired.

State Rep. Norma Hernandez, D-Melrose Park, who also attended the march, confirmed that Villegas-Gonzáles was the father of two young sons, a 7-year-old and a 3-year-old.

Villegas-Gonzáles was his family’s sole provider and worked long hours as a cook, she said. The Friday morning shooting in a suburb just south of O’Hare Airport occurred soon after Villegas-Gonzáles dropped his children off at school, Hernandez said.

Franklin Park School District 84 Superintendent David Katzin confirmed Villegas-Gonzáles’ 7-year-old son attended nearby Passow Elementary School.

A GoFundMe has been set up to raise money for Villegas-Gonzáles’ family, and more than $45,000 had been raised as of early Tuesday evening.

“Silverio passed away after ICE agents shot him fatally, leaving behind not only loving family and friends, but also a legacy of warmth, resilience and deep compassion. He was someone who always extended a helping hand, shared his smile freely, and showed up for those he loved — no matter the circumstances,” wrote Lily Rivera, the fundraising campaign’s organizer.

The Elgin-based group Vecinos Unidos is also holding a community drive this weekend to collect food and toiletry donations for Villegas-Gonzáles’ family. Learn more about the donation drive here.

A memorial featuring photos, cards, candles and flowers now marks the Franklin Park intersection where Villegas-Gonzáles was killed.

The Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago confirmed that Villegas-González was a Mexican national. Reyna Torres Mendivil, the consul general of Mexico in Chicago, told the Sun Times that Villegas-González’s family has requested that his remains be sent back to Mexico.

ICE Has Released ‘Very Little’ Information On What Happened

According to a statement released by ICE, agents stopped Villegas-González in Franklin Park Friday while he was driving and he “refused to follow law enforcement commands” before driving his car at officers.

ICE wrote that one officer was hit and dragged and “fearing for his own life, the officer fired his weapon.”

Surveillance video from a nearby business, according to CBS2, shows two officers stop and approach a Subaru driven by Villegas-González. One officer walks to the passenger side and the other to the driver’s side. The officer on the passenger side appears to try to open the door before Villegas-González starts backing up and drives away. The officer at the driver’s side window — whom ICE said was dragged — cannot be seen in the footage as Villegas-González drives away. Two gunshots can be heard in footage from another business. Footage of the officer being dragged and later shooting Villegas-González has not been produced. ICE agents involved in the fatal shooting were not wearing body cameras during the incident, the Sun-Times reported Tuesday.

Hernandez said that as soon as she heard about the shooting on Friday, she reached out to local rapid response networks to try to gather more information.

“We had people on the ground going to businesses to try and get footage because we know that we cannot trust the federal government,” she said.

Pritzker said his office asked ICE for all the information around Villegas-González’ shooting but said the agency has “given very little” detail, according to the Sun Times

“This is the most unusual situation I’ve seen in my entire lifetime, where we have no transparency and the federal government is not policing itself. Even the offices of inspector generals are being dismantled under this administration. So we may never really know what the truth is,” the governor said.

The Franklin Park Police Department referred all questions about the shooting to the FBI. In a statement, the FBI confirmed the agency responded to the shooting and assisted law enforcement on-scene. The FBI would not confirm whether the agency was investigating the incident further. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions.

“The Department of Justice’s media policy prohibits the FBI from confirming or denying investigations, but as a general matter, we examine the facts with consideration of federal criminal statutes. We then proceed as appropriate, whether by investigating or referring the matter to the relevant partners,” an FBI spokesperson wrote.

ICE has increased its presence in the Chicago area in recent days, announcing Operation Midway Blitz last week. On Tuesday, Customs and Border Protection officials — a sister agency — traveled to Chicago for a separate campaign dubbed Operating At Large.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to CBS2. Noem posted a video on X of immigration arrests that appeared to show an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid Tuesday in Elgin, CBS reported.

Claudia Galvàn, who is originally from Mexico but has been living in Melrose Park for more than 30 years, said she usually celebrates Mexican Independence Day but “can’t this year because of all the things happening.”

She and her son joined the march as they were headed to the store Tuesday. She said hearing about Villegas-González’ death last week was particularly unsettling because she often goes to Franklin Park.

“It’s scary,” she said. “It could happen to anyone.”

Grace Clear, 75, traveled from Elmhurst to join the march. She’s part of a group of residents called Progressives for Change that has been protesting President Donald Trump’s administration by rallying outside the Elmhurst City Hall every Saturday since February.

“It’s just so senseless,” Clear said of Villegas-González’ death. “ICE feels they have the right to murder someone over a traffic stop.”

Salgado said PASO, the Melrose Park immigrants’ rights group, will be organizing more marches in the coming weeks, including one in Franklin Park. March updates will be posted on Facebook.

Tuesday’s march was about showing power and unity in the face of intimidation, Hernandez said.

“This is our way to fight back, to be joyful, to celebrate our culture and to highlight the wrongful death of Silverio,” she said. “Because we can’t let this one go, we have to make sure this doesn’t happen again, that there isn’t another murder by this agency.”

Hernandez said she will be meeting with Villegas-González’ family later this week to offer support and discuss next steps, including potential legal action.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5117-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 16:57:37.013640

The Trump administration has faced some legal roadblocks in its funding freeze attempts.","WASHINGTON — Labor unions, faculty and students in the University of California education system sued President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday over the freezing of federal funds and other actions that they say aim to stifle academic freedom.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, seeks to forbid the government from using financial threats against the system that it said were harmful and unlawful. It also aims to restore funding already suspended.

“(The administration) has attempted to implement a playbook to threaten colleges and universities,” the coalition that filed the lawsuit said. It added that those threats were based on disdain for the institutions’ curriculum, expressive activity on campuses, and initiatives for diversity, equity and inclusion.

The University of California system and the White House had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.

The government has launched probes into universities’ handling of alleged antisemitism during student protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza, and has frozen funds over that and other issues, including climate initiatives and DEI programs.

Civil rights advocates say the Trump administration is attempting to make universities more aligned with his political agenda, while critics also see such attempts as threatening free speech and academic freedom.

University of California Operates One of the Largest Higher-Education Systems

The University of California operates one of the largest higher-education systems in the country, with 10 main campuses and nearly 300,000 students, as well as 265,000 faculty and staff.

The Trump administration had proposed to settle its probe into the University of California, Los Angeles – part of the university system – through a $1 billion payment from the institution. Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom called that an extortion attempt.

UCLA said in August the government froze $584 million in funding before a judge ordered the Trump administration to restore some of that money. The University of California, Berkeley, another campus in the system, said on Friday it provided information on 160 faculty members and students to the government as part of an investigation.

University of California President James Milliken said on Monday the institution was facing one of the gravest threats in its history due to the federal government’s actions, noting that it receives more than $17 billion each year in federal support.

The Trump administration has faced some legal roadblocks in its funding freeze attempts. A federal judge ruled earlier this month that it had unlawfully terminated more than $2 billion in grants for Harvard University.

The government alleges universities allowed antisemitism during campus protests. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, have said the government is wrongly equating their criticism of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories with antisemitism, and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism.

Human rights advocates have noted a rise in antisemitism, anti-Arab bias and Islamophobia due to conflict in the Middle East, although the Trump administration has not announced probes into Islamophobia.

The administration has settled its investigations with Columbia and Brown universities.

This assault should alarm anyone who values constitutional governance and the personal freedoms we so often take for granted.
There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy.
The Constitution establishes a clear civil-military divide because the founders understood that when the military becomes a tool of domestic control, constitutional democracy dies.
Today, the danger is not from foreign invasion or civil war, but instead the methodical dismantling of constitutional governance by a president sworn to uphold it.","In 1952, seven years after the end of the Second World War, Congress established Constitution Day to celebrate our country’s sacred foundational document. In the more than 70 years since, most Americans have taken for granted the fundamental freedoms this day honors. There are no parades, no barbecues, and no mattress sales for Constitution Day. In many ways, this low profile is a sign of strength.

But this year, that complacency feels perilous. Fundamental pillars of our democracy are under assault, and the situation is more dire than many realize. That’s why we can no longer assume the Constitution will simply survive through benign neglect.We must fight to protect and strengthen it.

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought.

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought. As our country has evolved and expanded rights and advanced democratic reforms, this framework – through its many iterations and amendments – has remained true to its core throughout. Through civil war and depression, world wars and social upheavals, through the peaceful transfer of power across generations and parties, Americans have been able to count on the Constitution being there.

Today we are facing a new type of threat. There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy. This assault should alarm anyone who values constitutional governance and the personal freedoms we so often take for granted.

Alarmingly, we’re witnessing the intrusion of military force into civilian life. Earlier this summer the president deployed Marines and National Guard units to crack down on protests in Los Angeles and has thousands of Guard members patrolling the streets of Washington D.C. The administration has signaled that this is just the start, with plans to deploy more troops onto American streets in Chicago and possibly elsewhere.

There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy.

This violates a founding principle of American governance, enshrined in the Posse Comitatus Act, that military forces should not police civilians. The Constitution establishes a clear civil-military divide because the founders understood that when the military becomes a tool of domestic control, constitutional democracy dies. Immigration detention centers under construction on military bases echo some of the darkest chapters in our history and represent a dangerous conflation of military and civilian authority.

As we saw in Los Angeles, the deployment of troops is a fear tactic meant to silence opposition and criminalize dissent. But the attacks on the First Amendment are not isolated to targeting peaceful protest. The Trump administration has ushered in a new McCarthy era, sending a clear message that if someone disagrees with our government, they will be punished.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened.

Just look at this administration’s actions. Federal agents have repeatedly detained or arrested public officials conducting legitimate oversight, including Newark, New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka,Congresswoman LaMonica McIver, andSenator Alex Padilla, who was tackled and detained for asking Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions. Students, including green card holders, have been detained and threatened with deportation for writing op-eds or expressing views that deviate from what the administration deems acceptable.

The administration is not content with silencing critics — it rejects the very concept of legitimate political opposition. Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller recently declared ""The Democrat party is not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization."" Coming from an administration that’s literally prosecuting a democratic congresswoman on invented felony charges stemming from her oversight of an ICE facility, this explicit rejection of political pluralism is chilling.

Perhaps most dangerously, the Trump administration is ignoring the rule of law and corrupting justice itself. The president has targeted law firms whose attorneys investigated him, stripping their security clearances, barring attorneys from federal buildings, and terminating government contracts unless firms agree to coercive demands for ""pro bono"" services. He excoriates judges who issue unfavorable rulings, calling them ""radical left lunatics"" and ""deranged,"" while encouraging calls for impeachment or worse. Ominously, the Justice Department is now seeking financial sanctions against immigration attorney Joshua Schroeder for filing emergency motions to halt his client's deportation — the first case under a new Trump directive to personally target lawyers who challenge administration policies.

Military forces now police civilians. Members of Congress are arrested for doing their jobs. The president's top adviser declares the opposition party illegitimate. Judges and lawyers face threats for upholding the law. This is the systematic dismantling of constitutional governance.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened. Today, the danger is not from foreign invasion or civil war, but instead the methodical dismantling of constitutional governance by a president sworn to uphold it. At a moment when we are seeing political violence escalating — claiming lives and threatening the very free discourse our Constitution protects — we must choose peaceful democratic engagement over dehumanization and violence. The power ultimately lies with the people, and as a country we must decide whether we will defend our Constitution or let it fall.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/09/defend-the-constitution-s.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 16:57:34.213067

The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is, like many ICE facilities, run by an outside contractor — the GEO Group, a multinational private prison corporation and ICE’s largest detention contractor.
“I filed complaints and grievances.","Current and former detainees at the South Louisiana ICE Detention Center in Basile, Louisiana have filed multiple complaints through immigration rights groups on Monday (Sept. 15) against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging repeated sexual harassment, sexual abuse, physical abuse, coerced labor and neglect of urgent medical and mental health care at the facility.

Three organizations, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the ACLU of Louisiana and the National Immigration Project filed the complaints on behalf of four people — two who have been deported and two individuals who remain in custody at the facility, but who are in imminent risk of deportation, according to Sarah Decker, a staff attorney with RFK Human Rights. One of the deported individuals has since reentered the country and is now in criminal custody, Decker said.

The complaints allege that a former assistant warden, Manuel Reyes, at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center repeatedly sexually abused, threatened and punished one of the complainants, who is referred to as “Jane Doe” by her attorneys. The complaints further allege that Reyes ran an off-the-books late-night work scheme that coerced transgender detainees into physically and psychologically painful labor. Reyes could not be reached for comment.

“What’s particularly jarring about these cases is that these clients screamed for help,” said Decker, who filed the complaints with DHS and ICE. “They filed grievances. They filed [Prison Rape Elimination Act] complaints. They called the [Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General] hotline. They spoke to ICE officers face-to-face and told them what was happening. So this was an open secret in the facility, and ICE definitely knew about this.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs filed claims of personal injury against DHS and ICE, seeking financial compensation, on behalf of their clients. Separately they filed a civil rights complaint with offices at DHS. The Southeast Dignity Not Detention Coalition joined the other legal groups in filing the civil complaint.

Decker said that while Reyes is central to the complaints, she believes the problems at detention facilities like the one in Basile go much deeper.

“There’s much more going on than even we as advocates who represent people know about. There’s a deep underbelly of abuse that we haven’t fully uncovered yet,” she said.

The GEO Group has repeatedly faced allegations of negligence and abuse at the immigration facilities it oversees. The company did not respond to requests for comment on the newest complaints.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, responded on behalf of DHS and ICE, calling the accusations false, characterizing them as a “hoax.” McLaughlin said the assistant warden did not perpetrate or enable sexual harassment or assault and that no one was forced into coerced labor or physically abused.

“The media is clearly desperate for these allegations of inhumane conditions at this facility to be true,” McLaughlin wrote. “All of these allegations are investigated by (the) ICE Office of Professional Responsibility, and none were found to be true.”

Decker disagreed with McLaughlin’s categorization of the incidents in the complaints.

“The documentation that we’ve done for years at these facilities and the stories of these clients prove otherwise, and it’s not surprising that DHS is once again failing to take accountability for the mistreatment and abuse of those entrusted to their care,” she said.

McLaughlin also said that ICE detainees receive proper meals and medical treatment.

“This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she said.

Decker pointed to the results of a 2024 ACLU study, in which medical experts reviewed records for 52 of 53 reported deaths in ICE custody from 2017 to 2021. They found that of those 52 people, roughly 95% were “preventable or possibly preventable,” had appropriate medical care been provided.

“The assertion that people in ICE custody are receiving high quality medical care is simply false,” Decker said. “What we’ve found is the exact opposite, that the medical care at these facilities is so poor and so abusive that people are dying in government custody and are suffering from life threatening and potentially permanent medical consequences as a result of this mistreatment.”

The woman identified as Jane Doe is from the Dominican Republic and lived in Maryland for 10 years, according to the complaint. She landed in the Basile ICE center by way of the women’s Federal Correctional Institution in Aliceville, Alabama, according to her lawyer.

The woman’s complaint says that she suffers from epilepsy, and it alleges that she was first sexually harassed and then finally repeatedly sexually abused at the detention center. It also states that she was denied medical attention and put in solitary confinement and threatened. Decker said those threats are central to why the woman identified as Jane Doe wants to remain anonymous. As her abuse in the facility continued, Doe’s physical health deteriorated, the complaint states.

“I begged the U.S. government to help me,” the woman identified as Jane Doe said in a press statement. “I filed complaints and grievances. I told ICE officers and medical staff. But they did nothing. I want people to know what happened to me and what continues to happen to people detained in these facilities.”

Three transgender detainees were also subject to physical and psychological abuse, according to their individual complaints.

One complainant, Mexican national Monica Renteria-Gonzalez, who was still in ICE custody as of this week, is a transgender man. The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is used primarily to hold women, but ICE assigns people to detention centers based upon their sex assigned at birth instead of their gender identity. Renteria-Gonzalez has been detained since roughly May 2023 at the facility, according to his complaint. Renteria-Gonzalez began working during the late-night hours alongside other transgender people for as little as $1 per day, the complaint states.

Renteria-Gonzalez’ complaint details difficult manual labor, allegedly without protective equipment, resulting in physical injury.

“Our rights are being violated everyday. This is a privately run facility that profits from our suffering. They are using us to make a profit but denying us medical care, food, even the most basic things like proper clothes and mattresses,” Renteria-Gonzalez said in a press release.

Two other transgender people detained at the facility — Mario Luisa Garcia-Valenzuela, a transgender man who is still in custody, and Kenia Campos-Flores, a nonbinary/transgender person who is no longer at the facility — had similar allegations in their complaints.

The complaints also allege that solitary confinement was used against the detainees as a means of punishment for complaints they issued about the behavior of the people running the facility.

The civil rights complaint filed with DHS is calling for the release of the detainees mentioned in the complaint, a full investigation of the allegations and financial penalties for GEO Group, should wrongdoing and mismanagement be found, as well as the termination of the contract with GEO to run the facility.

“These facilities are incapable of housing people humanely, and there’s no solution outside of shutting down these facilities and ending the use of immigration detention,” Decker said.

Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Monica Renteria-Gonzalez’ name. That’s been corrected.

As families hole up in homes — afraid to leave and risk detainment — advocates are reporting an increased presence of unmarked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles sitting in parking lots and other public areas throughout immigrant communities, where agents appeared to target work vans. One man captured a video of three landscapers who were working on the Saugus Town Hall property being arrested after agents smashed their truck window.

Just north of Boston, the city of Everett canceled its annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival after its mayor said it wouldn't be right to ""hold a celebration at a time when community members may not feel safe attending.”

The actions have been praised by public officials like New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who signed legislation this year banning sanctuary city policies in her state, vowing not to let New Hampshire “go the way of Massachusetts."" ICE this summer began utilizing a New Hampshire airport about an hour from Boston to transport New England detainees.

However, others argue that ICE's presence in Massachusetts is doing more harm than good.

“This is really increasing the fear in communities, which is already incredibly high,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.

Cities like Boston and Chicago — where Mayor Brandon Johnson has also condemned the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown, calling it an example of “tyranny” — have become targets for enforcement in recent days. Trump also threatened to potentially deploy the National Guard to Chicago, though he had wavered on a military deployment last week.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Sept. 4 filed a lawsuit against Mayor Michelle Wu, the city of Boston and its police department over its sanctuary city policies, claiming they’re interfering with immigration enforcement. In response, Wu accused Trump of “attacking cities to hide his administration’s failures.”

Now, ICE has launched an operation it called “Patriot 2.0"" on the heels of a May crackdown where nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in Massachusetts. Its latest operation came days before a preliminary mayoral election, where incumbent Wu won easily. The mayor has become a frequent target over her defense of the city and its so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Boston surge would focus on “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” living in Massachusetts.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but protect them at the peril of law-abiding American citizens,"" she said in a press release early last week, which detailed the arrest of seven individuals by ICE, including a 38-year-old man from Guatemala who had previously been arrested on assault-related charges.

The agency did not respond to requests from The Associated Press about the number of immigrants detained since “Patriot 2.0” began.

ICE has contracts to detain people at multiple correctional facilities across New England, including county jails as well as the federal prison in Berlin, New Hampshire, and a publicly-owned, privately operated prison in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

Volunteers monitoring flights carrying detainees from New Hampshire’s Portsmouth International Airport at Pease have documented the transfer of more than 300 individuals since early August, with at least five flights per week transferring people from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts. All of the detainees have been in shackles, said David Holt, who has been organizing regular protests at Pease.

Protesters gathered at venues like the ICE office in Burlington, where three participants were arrested on trespassing charges.

Luce, the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, staffed its hotline with interpreters who speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin, and Haitian Creole to collect information about ICE sightings. The organization put out a call for volunteers who speak languages like Cape Verdean Kriolu, Nepali and Vietnamese to help manage the influx.

Kevin Lam, co-executive director with the Asian American Resource Workshop, a community group that works on immigration and other issues, said they have seen a “spike” in ICE activity, including five Vietnamese residents from a Boston neighborhood who were detained last week.

He and other advocates said many immigrants have expressed fear about everyday tasks like picking up their kids at school and riding on public transportation. However, he said many are still attending work, with some willing to risk being detained because they are the primary breadwinners for their families.

""Many of them are like, ‘Yeah, it is a risk every day when I step out, but I need to work to be able to provide for my family,’” he said.

Republican Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Leah Foley said she is “100% supportive” of ICE's latest operation in the state and that her office will not hesitate to prosecute immigrants without legal status who commit crimes. Noncriminals have also been swept up in raids that ICE calls “collateral arrests.”

""We stand ready to charge individuals who violate all federal laws, including those who enter our country without authorization after being deported and those who assault federal law enforcement officers or impede or interfere with federal officers doing their jobs,"" she said in a statement to the AP.

Advocates like Lam pushed back on claims that ICE agents are only targeting criminals, saying that with fewer protections for asylum-seekers and others who are here legally, the strategy seems to be going well beyond “bad immigrants” with records.

Alexandra Peredo Carroll, director of legal Education and advocacy at the Boston-based Mabel Center for Immigrant Justice, said the Trump administration is ""trying to fit folks into this narrative of being illegal or having broken the law, when in fact, many of these are individuals who are actually going through the legal process.”

“I think you’re going to see more and more how families are going to be torn apart, how individuals with no criminal history, with pending forms of relief, pending applications are just going to be rounded up,” she said.

“There has been a difficult relationship” between the Petro and Trump administrations, she explained.
“But they have a president now who in addition to being erratic has not been a very good partner when it comes to taking on drug cartels.” ____","BOGOTA, Colombia -- BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombian president Gustavo Petro on Tuesday lashed out at the U.S. government after it added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in three decades.

In a message on his X account, the leftist leader accused the United States of seeking to “participate” in Colombian politics and looking for a “puppet president” as the country prepares for presidential elections next year.

“The Colombian people will reply if they want a puppet president…or a free and sovereign nation” Petro wrote, adding in another message that he would not let his nation “kneel” to U.S. interests and allow peasants who grow coca to get “beaten up.”

On Monday, the Trump administration designated Colombia as a country that is failing to meet its international commitments to fight drug trafficking and blamed the Colombian government for a lack of progress in the fight against the cocaine trade.

The designation, known as decertification, is a stunning rebuke for a traditional U.S. ally. It comes amid a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and Colombia’s first leftist president.

Even as the U.S determined that Colombia has failed to comply with international anti-narcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts.

On Tuesday, the charge d’affaires at the U.S. embassy in Bogota, John McNamara, said that consular services, humanitarian projects and defense cooperation would not be affected by Colombia’s decertification.

“We are going to do everything we can to fight with the Colombian people against the global threat” of drugs, McNamara told Colombian radio station Blu.

Colombia’s decertification comes as cocaine production skyrockets in the South American country.

The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests as well as criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.

The Colombian president has also said that whisky kills more people than cocaine, and claimed that the reason wealthy countries like the United States want to crack down on cocaine is because its produced in Latin America.

Sandra Borda, an international relations professor at Bogota's Los Andes University said that Colombia's decertification is unlikely to affect efforts to take on drug traffickers in Colombia, because military cooperation is expected to continue.

However she expects tensions between the governments of the U.S. and Colombia to increase, as Petro uses Colombia's decertification to tap into anti-American sentiment and rally his supporters ahead of next year's elections.

“There has been a difficult relationship” between the Petro and Trump administrations, she explained. “You have statements and declarations that are not friendly and I think what you are going to see is an escalation of that.”

In the Presidential Determination submitted to Congress on Monday, the Trump administration mostly blamed Petro for the rise of cocaine production in Colombia, describing his efforts to negotiate peace deals with ""narco terrorist groups” as a failure.

The report said that Colombia’s security institutions and municipal authorities have shown “skill and courage” in confronting drug traffickers, but said that “the failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also commented on Colombia's decertification on Tuesday.

""Colombia has been a great partner historically,"" Rubio told reporters. “But they have a president now who in addition to being erratic has not been a very good partner when it comes to taking on drug cartels.”

SOUTH KOREA WANTS CHANGES TO US VISA SYSTEM South Korea is pressing Washington to ease visa rules after the immigration raid.","The South Korean government has launched an investigation into potential human-rights violations after more than 300 of its citizens were detained in a US immigration raid earlier this month at a Hyundai Motor construction site in Georgia.

The raid took place at an electric-vehicle battery plant under construction near Savannah, Georgia. The facility is a joint project between Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution, both major South Korean firms.

A spokesperson for South Korea’s presidential office said that Seoul has conveyed its ""strong regret"" to Washington, stressing that the rights and interests of South Koreans must not be infringed during the US immigration raid.

The raid, carried out on September 4 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has provoked outrage in South Korea. Officials in Seoul say they received no prior notice of the operation, despite South Korea’s commitments to the US in trade and investment. The country has pledged close to half a trillion dollars in US energy purchases and manufacturing investments, particularly in the electric-vehicle sector.

REPORTS OF MISTREATMENT

The repatriation of 316 South Koreans on Friday heightened the controversy. A number of them claimed to have been mistreated while in the US custody. During the raid, detainees claimed they were shackled, made to sleep on mouldy beds, kept in temporary detention cells with as many as 70 people, and refused access to interpreters.

According to South Korean media, workers alleged that they had not been informed of his Miranda rights. These testimonies have sparked anger that US authorities mishandled the raid and violated basic legal protections.

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry and Justice Ministry, working with employers of the former detainees, are now investigating whether human-rights violations occurred in the detention centre and whether South Koreans were unfairly targeted because of their jobs at the site.

""If the probe confirms that violations occurred, the government will submit a formal complaint to the United States,"" a South Korean official said as per the Wall Street Journal. The official added that the enquiry is expected to conclude within weeks.

US OFFICIALS RESPOND

During a visit to Seoul on Sunday, Christopher Landau, the US Deputy Secretary of State, expressed regret over the detention of South Korean nationals.

According to a local poll, nearly 60 percent of South Koreans believe the raid was excessive and voiced disappointment with Washington’s handling of the incident.

ICE confirmed that around 475 workers were detained in what has become the largest single-site immigration raid ever carried out in the US. According to the search warrant, the operation initially targeted four Hispanic workers suspected of entering the country illegally or violating visa terms.

SOUTH KOREA WANTS CHANGES TO US VISA SYSTEM

South Korea is pressing Washington to ease visa rules after the immigration raid. Businesses say restrictive US visas make it difficult to send skilled staff, forcing some workers to operate in legal grey areas.

Foreign Minister’s talks in Washington this week included plans for a joint working group to explore a new visa category for Korean nationals.

Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hoon-sik said the raid had harmed ""innocent people of Korea,”"" stressing that Seoul expects fair treatment. ""The standard changes every time, and there constantly has to be deal-making,"" he told reporters.

The dispute comes as both countries negotiate a trade pact tied to a $350 billion investment fund for US strategic industries.

The details are part of a lawsuit where the government is attempting to end protections for children. Declarations from families held at the facility in Dilley, Texas, which was reopened in March, described persistently cloudy water, delayed medical attention and long periods of time children are being detained.

Allegations of children fighting adults for clean water, distraught children and a protracted medical response first surfaced during the summer while the federal government asked a federal judge to end a policy protecting immigrant children.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles, who presides over the case, heard arguments from the government, which wants to end the Flores Settlement agreement. The policy limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires safe and sanitary conditions.

After Gee told the government last month to provide detention times, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that the number of children in custody over 72 hours decreased from an average of six days to five days in June and July, respectively. The “vast majority” spent less than 72 hours in CBP custody, the report stated.

Attorneys representing the children reviewed the report and said some children are still being held for several weeks or months and often without justification.

About 65 families spoke to attorneys since Dilley opened.

U.S. & World

“A huge percentage of families at Dilley are being apprehended from across the country as they dutifully appear for their immigration court hearings and ICE check-ins,” Leecia Welch, the deputy legal director at Children’s Rights who spoke with families, told The Associated Press in a statement.

The tap water is cloudy, smells strange and upsets stomachs, the families told their attorneys. The hand soap the facility provides for showers has been causing rashes, the families said. Children also struggle eating the food, like the snacks of graham crackers, apples, juice and milk.

Detainees are allowed to buy staples like bottled water for $1.21 from the commissary.

""I have never heard until now of children having to buy water,” said Welch, who has been visiting children in custody of CBP and the Office of Refugee Resettlement for eight years.

Families face costs as high as $5.73 for deodorant, $1.44 for soap, and $2.39 for toothpaste, Welch said in court documents. A single dose of Tylenol costs $1.30, she said.

A child with a stomachache waited six hours for a nurse and wasn't taken to a hospital with appendicitis until he vomited, court documents said. Another child fell on his arm and it wasn't until two hours later that the staff drove him to a hospital for an X-ray.

Parents said there are no organized activities for the children and only an hour of instruction from workbooks.

A woman's son told her that he ""doesn’t believe in God anymore because he prays to him but we still haven’t been able to get out of here,” according to her declaration, provided by Welch.

Some families are being released only to be detained again, Welch said.

Chellie Pingree is seeking answers after a parent was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school last week.
“It is difficult to imagine any circumstance that could justify staging enforcement activity when children are arriving to learn,” Pingree wrote to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons Tuesday.
“The proximity of the enforcement activity to the school raises serious questions about its justification, its impact on the school community, and whether appropriate oversight and approvals were secured,” wrote Pingree, whose district includes Portland.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper Friday that he is being held at Cumberland County Jail.
“ICE had to make this arrest at large in the community because Portland authorities do not cooperate with ICE,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.","U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is seeking answers after a parent was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school last week.

“It is difficult to imagine any circumstance that could justify staging enforcement activity when children are arriving to learn,” Pingree wrote to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons Tuesday. “Beyond the harm it causes the community at-large, these actions have caused irreparable damage to the family, who is already dealing with difficult circumstances.”

According to a letter sent to parents from Portland Superintendent Ryan Scallon, on the morning of Sept. 11, unidentified agents in unmarked vehicles wearing vests marked “police” detained a parent on a Gerald E. Talbot Community School access road after dropping off their child.

“The proximity of the enforcement activity to the school raises serious questions about its justification, its impact on the school community, and whether appropriate oversight and approvals were secured,” wrote Pingree, whose district includes Portland.

She went on to cite research that found such actions trigger “measurable harm: lower attendance, diminished academic performance, increased anxiety and depression, and lasting trauma for students and families – including those not directly targeted,” adding that district officials have already reported a drop in attendance since the incident.

Pingree also raised concerns about the fact that the arresting officers were unidentifiable and said the action caused confusion among local law enforcement who were not informed of the activity.

According to the district, an administrator “approached the officers to inquire about their presence” and the officers “did not state what agency they represented.” The district later confirmed with the Portland Police Department that they were not local officers. The police department also assured the district “that if they learn of any proposed enforcement action planned at a school, they will work to ensure that it does not occur there,” Scallon wrote.

Portland police later told the Portland Press Herald that the parent, a Honduran immigrant, had earlier been arrested by local officers on an accusation of a Class D domestic violence assault and was released on bail one day before he was detained by ICE outside the school. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper Friday that he is being held at Cumberland County Jail.

“ICE had to make this arrest at large in the community because Portland authorities do not cooperate with ICE,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.

She also asked for “a written explanation of any review or retraining that occurs from this incident; a description of the guidance used to determine whether enforcement activity at schools is absolutely necessary; and a list of protocols adapted to minimize harm done to the community while practicing said enforcement activity.”

I was 16 when Governor Jan Brewer signed Senate Bill 1070 in 2010. I remember the fear in our communities. I remember the silence in neighborhoods, the way people stopped gathering at the park, the way families disappeared overnight. I remember the protests, the heartbreak, and the resilience. Arizona became a national symbol of racial profiling and anti-immigrant policy.

Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration (Published 2010)

Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill aimed at identifying, prosecuting and deporting illegal immigrants.

www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html

Now, 15 years later, the Supreme Court has reopened that wound.

Last week, the Court lifted restrictions on federal immigration agents, allowing them to resume “roving patrols” — sweeping operations that permit stops based on appearance, language, or location. The ruling, which temporarily overturns a lower court’s decision, echoes the darkest chapters of Arizona’s immigration history. It’s déjà vu for those of us who lived through SB 1070.

Supreme Court said ICE can stop you based on race, accent, job and location. What we know.

A group of Latino California residents and related organizations sued the government, saying they were being subject to illegal stops.

The decision permits agents to detain individuals outside places like Home Depot, car washes, and bus stops — simply for speaking Spanish or appearing to seek day labor. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her powerful dissent, warned that this ruling “poses a threat not just to undocumented foreigners but to Americans of Hispanic descent.” She’s right. That threat is not theoretical. It’s personal. It’s the fear of being stopped while buying groceries. It’s the anxiety of walking your child to school. It’s the trauma of being treated like a suspect in your own home.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has rightly stated that the 9th Circuit’s ruling, which blocked these tactics, remains binding in our state. But legal nuance doesn’t always translate to lived experience. When federal agents are empowered to act on stereotypes, immigrants and people of color suffer — regardless of citizenship status. We’ve lived it.

SB 1070 left scars on everyone. It led to widespread fear, family separations, and a chilling effect on civic participation. It took years of organizing, litigation, and advocacy to push back against these efforts. And now, we must do it again.

This ruling is a test — not just of our legal system, but also of our moral compass. Will Arizona repeat its mistakes, or will we lead with compassion and courage?

If this ruling unsettles you, don’t stay silent. Call your representatives. Demand that Arizona uphold protections against racial profiling. Support local immigrant rights organizations. Show up at city council meetings. Share your story. Speak out when you see injustice.

Arizona is more than its past. We are a place of resilience, of diversity, of people who refuse to be silenced. We know this story too well. And this time, we won’t just fight back. We’ll lead forward.

Migrants soon began complaining about being held in the cells for days, and even up to three weeks.
Judge Kaplan’s order on Aug. 12 directed ICE to hold fewer people in the cells, allow migrants to call their lawyers, and provide medical and hygienic care.","A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Wednesday to continue improving conditions for migrants being held in a Manhattan federal building, writing that he was intervening to protect detainees from potentially “unconstitutional and inhumane treatment.”

The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, had already ordered the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency on Aug. 12 to improve conditions at the building, 26 Federal Plaza, where migrants were being held in squalid and cramped conditions, according to a lawsuit filed by a migrant detained there.

On Wednesday, Judge Kaplan issued a longer-lasting order known as a preliminary injunction, requiring ICE to continue addressing the poor conditions, such as overcrowding and a lack of basic hygiene. While the injunction is not the final decision in the case, the judge said that the evidence was strong enough to merit a temporary order while the lawsuit moves toward a conclusion.

In his 84-page decision, Judge Kaplan provisionally certified the lawsuit, originally filed on Aug. 8 by a Peruvian immigrant, as a class action, expanding its scope to include any ICE detainee held at 26 Federal Plaza for 12 hours or longer.

He also said that the plaintiffs were “very likely to succeed on the merits of the claims” that the conditions in the holding cells violated the First and Fifth Amendments.

“We aspire to treat all Americans — and those among us — with humanity,” he wrote. “We are legally and morally bound to adhere to the Constitution and laws of the United States with respect to everyone within our borders.”

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency has previously cast the allegations in the lawsuit as false.

The 10th-floor holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza have emerged as a defining flashpoint of President Trump’s immigration crackdown in New York City. The cells, typically meant to hold a small number of people for just a few hours, became crowded this year as ICE accelerated arrests at nearby immigration courts, detaining dozens of people a day.

Migrants soon began complaining about being held in the cells for days, and even up to three weeks. They said they were forced to sleep on the floor or sitting upright, and were deprived of showers, sufficient medical care and legal representation. Video recorded by a migrant who sneaked a cellphone into the cells in July prompted Democratic lawmakers to escalate their demands to inspect the facilities, only to be denied access by ICE.

Judge Kaplan’s order on Aug. 12 directed ICE to hold fewer people in the cells, allow migrants to call their lawyers, and provide medical and hygienic care.

The agency has argued that the cells are used only for short-term confinement and that most detainees are transferred to other detention facilities within 72 hours, offering some data to that effect in legal filings.

But Judge Kaplan wrote on Wednesday that the arguments and statistics the agency had provided were “unpersuasive” and that they “obscure more than they illuminate.”

The judge concluded that the improvements made by ICE had resulted from his previous order in August, and that there were no assurances that those improvements would continue without the preliminary injunction he issued on Wednesday.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/22/multimedia/22met-migrant-video-bztg/22met-migrant-video-bztg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 13:57:18.927135

In the wake of media coverage of conditions at the field office, the Burlington Select Board and Building Department sought entry to the building.
""It got to the point where sometimes you couldn't even sit down.” Pineda spent two days at the Burlington field office, uncomfortable and hungry.","Hundreds of people detained at ICE's New England Regional Headquarters in Burlington were held there for multiple days over the spring and summer, despite the agency's admission that the facility is not designed to house detainees for extended periods.

Between Jan. 20, when President Trump returned to office, and the end of July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement booked in more than 2,700 people, according to a WBUR analysis of information from the Deportation Data Project.

Of those, nearly half, or 1,338 people, were transferred out of Burlington within 12 hours. Another 353 were moved within a day. But 1,005 were held for multiple days, and in several cases, for more than a week.

Through July, at least 176 people were held in the Burlington field office for three days or more. In one case, a Brazilian man was held for 20 days.

These long stays appear to exceed even ICE's new detainment standards. According to a July 24 letter from ICE to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the agency issued a temporary waiver in June so that ""aliens may be housed in a holding facility for up to, but not exceeding, 72 hours, absent exceptional circumstances.""

ICE did not respond to WBUR's questions about the longer Burlington detentions.

In a statement, Warren said, ""ICE’s responses are insufficient and don’t match the reality on the ground.""

""The reports coming out of ICE field offices continue to be deeply concerning,"" she said.

The ICE letter said the agency inspects conditions at its holding room facilities ""through a formal self-inspection program, and that it's committed to ""safe, secure, and humane environments"" for those in its custody.

But people detained in Burlington have told a very different story, from a Milford High School volleyball player held for six days in a crowd of men to women held for days without sanitary products.

""Immigrants are imprisoned here in overcrowded cells,"" said Rev. Andrew Harris, a minister at the nearby Burlington United Church of Christ, during a recent protest outside the ICE facility. Harris, who helps organize a weekly demonstration there, pointed to the squat, two-story building, recounting what former detainees have said publicly about the conditions inside.

""There are no beds, so people sleep on concrete floors,"" Harris told a crowd of about 500 people. ""There are no clocks, no showers, no soap, no medicine,"" he said; people held there also have complained about sharing a toilet with large numbers of people and no privacy.

ICE has refuted some of these claims and said detainees are given ""ample food, regular access to phones, showers and legal representation as well as medical care when needed.”

The field office is a 42,000-square-foot building in a busy office park near the Burlington Mall. The facility is primarily an administrative site, where people go for routine check-ins with immigration officials. It also serves as a regional intake center, where ICE takes people after arresting them.

Most people are transferred quickly to detention centers like the Plymouth County jail or facilities out of state. But as ICE launched ""Operation Patriot"" in the spring, a highly publicized increase in immigration enforcement and patrols in Massachusetts, hundreds of arrestees got stuck waiting in Burlington.

The number of people held at the Burlington office fluctuates day to day, but during the weeks around the May surge, agents booked about 40-50 people per day. In one day, they brought 101 people in; on another, 107.

And now with the launch of ""Patriot 2.0"" — a new immigration enforcement operation in Massachusetts — many more people are likely to spend time inside Burlington in the coming weeks.

""This latest enforcement 'surge' will inevitably cause overcrowding, denial of due process, and any number of other violations of the legal and human rights of detainees,"" said Matt Cameron, a Boston immigration attorney.

Very few outsiders have been allowed into the ICE field office in recent months, but in early June, U.S. Reps. Seth Moulton and Jake Auchincloss got a rare look inside.

""This is supposed to be a processing facility where people stay for six to 12 hours,"" Moulton told reporters at the time. ""It's obviously completely inappropriate — I would say, inhumane — for long-term detention.""

The two congressmen had gone to the facility to meet Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, the 18-year-old volleyball player from Milford who had just been released after six days in detention. Da Silva had not been the intended target of immigration agents; they’d been looking for his father. But they picked him up anyway, in what immigration enforcement officials refer to as a ""collateral"" arrest.

ICE had claimed Marcelo was ""an exceptional case,"" Auchincloss said, and that most people were booked in and out of the field office in a matter of hours.

Until now, that's been difficult to verify. Neither reporters nor members of the public have been permitted inside, and immigration lawyers haven't been allowed into the secure holding area in the back of the building. The agency also has denied Burlington town officials access to inspect the building.

In the wake of media coverage of conditions at the field office, the Burlington Select Board and Building Department sought entry to the building. When ICE refused, the town petitioned the decision in district court. But that request also was recently denied, leaving the town with no option to appeal, according to Select Board Chairman Mike Espejo.

""I’ve probably put more time and thought into this issue than any other during my seven years in town government,"" Espejo wrote on Facebook last week. ""This is all about ensuring that all of our buildings in town are used in the manner in which they are designed and permitted and ensuring that anyone that enters the Town of Burlington is treated ethically and fairly.""

An ICE spokesperson told WBUR in an email, ""We never intend for anyone’s stay at Burlington to be an extended one."" There are occasions when it happens, the statement continued, and ""these instances are a rarity.""

Yet that's not what the data shows.

While ICE wrote in its letter to Warren that a March 31 ""self-inspection"" found no detainees in custody at that time had been held for more than 12 hours, the Deportation Data Project reveals that at least 50 people were held for longer than that in the preceding ten days.

Most of the extended stays in Burlington coincided with the May arrest surge, but at least 38 more occurred in June and July, according to the data analyzed by WBUR.

The data also shows that while ICE has said it's pursuing the ""worst of the worst"" in its immigration arrests, about half of those detained in Burlington had no criminal history, just civil immigration violations. According to the data, 508 people booked into Burlington had some criminal conviction; another 937 had pending charges.

""ICE facilities like Burlington’s are being forced into roles they were never meant to play, because of the Trump Administration’s chaotic and inhumane decisions,"" Moulton said in an email after WBUR shared the results of the new data analysis.

""If the data being reported is accurate, it is unacceptable that people are being held there for days — or even weeks — without adequate medical care, access to showers, or beds,"" he said, noting that the latest ICE surge in the station “will only make these problems worse.""

The dataset includes a hold that lasted 34 days, and another that lasted 55 days. ICE did not respond to questions about whether these extreme outliers are accurate or the result of a data entry error.

José Pineda, an East Boston resident, was stopped by five ICE agents on May 27 while driving to work. Pineda was born in El Salvador but has temporary protected status, which gives him the right to live and work in the U.S. He's lived in the country for 30 years and has a 12-year-old daughter who was born here.

Pineda said he gave the agents his driver's license and explained his legal status, but they arrested him anyway.

""They said, 'Those who aren't born here don't have rights,' "" he recounted in Spanish.

Pineda was brought to Burlington, where he said he was placed in a crowded room with 40 to 50 other men.

""After a couple of hours, they moved me to another room that was a bit emptier,"" he said. But soon, many more men arrived. ""It got to the point where sometimes you couldn't even sit down.”

Pineda spent two days at the Burlington field office, uncomfortable and hungry. He slept on a concrete floor with only a mylar blanket, and was fed ""a sour and inedible pudding"" on the first day and a ""cup of oats and a small burrito"" on the second, according to a complaint his lawyers filed with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE.

Pineda said he'd never been detained or spent time in jail before. Other men held there at the time told him a jail cell was ""more comfortable than these little rooms packed with people.""

After two days, Pineda was released. He said he's still having nightmares about the experience, but his detainment has taken an especially hard toll on his daughter, Michelle Valentina Pineda, according to the complaint.

""I don't want any more separations of families,"" Michelle said at a community listening event hosted by Rep. Ayanna Pressley earlier this summer. ""Family belongs together and I don't want any kid to know what I've been through and what happened to me.""

Mirian Albert, a senior attorney with Lawyers for Civil Rights and one of Pineda's lawyers, said ICE's new surge is hitting immigrant communities like New Bedford and Chelsea hard.

""Families and communities are living in fear again,"" she said. ""Many of them are paralyzed in many of their daily activities.""

And as happened during the spring surge, she expects Burlington will soon be crowded with people stuck there for days at a time.

While neither immigration enforcement operation in Illinois is relying on National Guard troops, President Trump on Tuesday renewed his threat to send troops to Chicago to fight crime.","The Trump administration has launched a second immigration enforcement operation in the Chicago area, with a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection sweep that began on Tuesday.

The dual operations are similar, but each with their own mission and their own personnel, neither of which includes local police agencies or federal troops.

Both efforts involve federal agents arresting criminal and non-criminal immigrants in deportation sweeps.

The immigration sweeps are both statewide efforts, not merely focused on Chicago and the suburbs.

The first, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement initiative dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" began earlier this month.

The new initiative, dubbed ""Operation At Large"" was announced Tuesday on social media by Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who led controversial immigration enforcement raids in southern California this summer.

U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-IL) – whose 14th Congressional District includes several western and southwestern suburbs, including Aurora, Joliet, Naperville, and DeKalb – was briefed about ""Operation Midway Blitz"" on Monday by ICE leaders who shared precisely who they are looking for.

""Anyone who has been arrested and booked, charged, or convicted, and then released by local law enforcement and is not a lawfully present U.S. person is eligible for their enforcement operation,"" she said. ""So far they have told me that 250 people have been arrested.""

Anyone found in the U.S. illegally – even non-criminals – can be taken in.

Newly deputized agents on loan from other federal agencies are being used for Midway Blitz.

""Officials from the Department of Justice; to include U.S. Marshals, DEA agents – Drug Enforcement Agency agents – and ATF,"" Underwood said.

Midway Blitz will not include raids of Home Depots and car washes. When will it end?

""They would not give me a termination date, and said that the director of ICE would be notified by the Trump administration,"" Underwood said.

The second immigration sweep, ""Operation At Large,"" started on Tuesday, according to CBS News sources, and is being led by Bovino, who headed the border patrol's effort to target immigration in Los Angeles this summer.

The new operation differs from Midway Blitz in that it will look more like the LA effort, with more indiscriminate raids, sources said. Bovino's team has a history of targeting Home Depots and car washes.

Notably, neither effort is using the National Guard, as they have not been mobilized in Illinois.

Nonetheless, it leaves Underwood's constituents unsettled.

""They're scared that this is going to come to their block, their cul-de-sac, then a knock on their door,"" Underwood said.

Underwood says those being arrested are being taken to Wisconsin and Indiana for holding as their cases get sorted out.

ICE officials insisted to Underwood that they don't pursue people – meaning, if the target does not make themselves immediately available to detainment, ICE won't engage in a high-speed chase.

She said that flies in the face of what's actually happened on the ground, pointing to the fatal shooting in Franklin Park last week, when an ICE agent shot a man during an arrest, after he allegedly drove at agents, and dragged one of them with his car.

While neither immigration enforcement operation in Illinois is relying on National Guard troops, President Trump on Tuesday renewed his threat to send troops to Chicago to fight crime.

""If they lose less than six or seven people a week with murder, they're doing a great job in their opinion. Chicago is a death trap, and I'm going to make it just like I did with D.C., just like I'll do with Memphis,"" he said.

Gov. Pritzker responded to the president on Tuesday morning, saying, ""you can't take anything that he says seriously,"" noting Mr. Trump has repeatedly reversed course on possible plans to deploy the National Guard in Chicago.

NEW YORK – A U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction today that would improve conditions for people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at 26 Federal Plaza. Notably, the order grants class certification and prohibits ICE from detaining people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person. The order also requires ICE to improve access to hygiene, provide sleeping mats and access to adequate soap and other hygiene products, and ensure people detained can make free, unmonitored, and confidential calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained.

In August, the court granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from holding people in abusive conditions at 26 Federal Plaza after the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union, Make the Road New York, and Wang Hecker LLP filed a class action lawsuit.

The temporary holding facility has come under fire in recent months, after ICE held more than 100 people, sometimes for weeks, in inhumane and unsanitary conditions without beds, showers, or adequate medical support. The government also banned in-person legal visitation, any confidential phone or video communication, and confidential exchange of written documents, in violation of people’s First and Fifth Amendment rights.

Quotes from co-counsel are as follows:

“Today’s ruling is an important win for immigrants’ rights and affirms what we’ve known all along: ICE’s conduct at 26 Federal Plaza is inhumane, illegal and a direct violation of the Constitution,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel with the ACLU’s National Prison Project. “No person should be denied medical care, access to a lawyer, or basic dignity when they are held in government custody – and we’ll continue to fight to hold ICE accountable.”

“The cruel policy of subjecting individuals to degrading treatment and inhumane conditions is deeply disturbing. And now, the court has made it abundantly clear that it is also illegal,” said Harold Solis, Co-Legal Director of Make the Road New York. “As always, we’ll remain vigilant to ensure the government complies with today’s decision.”

“Today’s order rightly affirms that ICE cannot hold people in the dehumanizing, abusive conditions at 26 Federal Plaza,” said Bobby Hodgson, Assistant Legal Director at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “We’ll continue to fight to hold the Trump administration accountable and end ICE’s unconstitutional detention practices at 26 Federal Plaza for good.”

“The Court today sent a clear and much-needed message: ICE cannot flagrantly disregard the constitutional rights and basic human needs of the immigrants it detains at 26 Federal Plaza,” said Heather Gregorio of Wang Hecker LLP. “This order is an important step in the ongoing fight to hold the government accountable.”

County supervisors voted Tuesday to approve a motion, introduced by Supervisor Hilda Solis, to beef up oversight of data gathered by law enforcement devices known as automated license plate readers.

It’s already illegal in California for local law enforcement agencies to share information gleaned from license plate readers with federal agencies such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement without a warrant.

But after a summer of ramped-up deportations, the county supervisors decided to impose more transparency on who’s requesting license plate data from the Sheriff’s Department — and when the agency provides it.

The change will create a clear policy that the data cannot be “disclosed, transferred, or otherwise made available” to immigration officials except when “expressly required” by law or if they have a warrant.

“In a place like Los Angeles County, where residents depend on cars for nearly every aspect of daily life, people must feel safe traveling from place to place without fear that their movements are being tracked, stored, and shared in ways that violate their privacy,” the motion states.

Supervisor Kathryn Barger cast the sole no vote. Helen Chavez, a spokesperson for Barger, said the supervisor voted against the motion because it calls for the county to support a bill that would limit the amount of time law enforcement can keep most license plate data to 60 days. Law enforcement has opposed that bill, she said.

Across the country, law enforcement agencies use cameras to collect data on millions of vehicles, poring over the records for clues to help find stolen vehicles, crime suspects or missing persons.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement it has roughly 366 fixed licensed plate readers from Motorola Vigilant and 476 from Flock Safety in contract cities and unincorporated areas. An additional 89 mobile systems from Motorola are mounted on vehicles that patrol these areas.

The department said its policy already prohibits it from sharing data from plate readers, known as ALPR, with any entity that “does not have a lawful purpose for receiving it.”

“LASD shares ALPR data with other law enforcement agencies only under an executed inter-agency agreement, which requires all parties to collect, access, use, and disclose the data in compliance with applicable law,” the statement read. “LASD has no current agreements for ALPR data sharing with any federal agency.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that the agency has multiple resources at its “fingertips to ensure federal law is enforced in Los Angeles, and throughout the entire country.”

“These sanctuary politicians’ efforts to stop the Sheriff’s Department from cooperating with ICE are reckless and will not deter ICE from enforcing the law,” McLaughlin said.

Southern California law enforcement departments — including LAPD and authorities in San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties — have been accused of routinely flouting state law by sharing license plate data with federal agents. A recent report from CalMatters cited records obtained by the anti-surveillance group Oakland Privacy that showed more than 100 instances in a single month when local police queried databases for federal agencies.

“When you collect this data, it’s really hard to control,” said Catherine Crump, director of UC Berkeley’s Technology & Public Policy Clinic. “It’s no different from once you share your data with Meta or Google, they’re going to repackage your data and sell it to advertisers and you don’t have any idea which of the advertising companies have your data.”

Even with the board cracking down on data sharing, advocates say it’s nearly impossible to ensure federal agents are barred from license plate data in L.A. County.

Dave Maass, the director of investigations for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said private companies that operate in California still collect and sell data that ICE can use.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection also has its own license plate readers around Southern California, he said.

Maass said even if a county bars its local sheriff’s department from sharing data with ICE, it’s difficult to guarantee the rule is followed by the rank-and-file. Immigration officers could informally pass on a plate number to a deputy with access to the system.

“Maybe they run the plate,” Maass says. “Unless there’s some public records release from the Los Angeles side of things, we just really don’t know who accessed the system.”

Under the motion passed Tuesday, the sheriff department would need to regularly report what agencies asked for license plate data to two county watchdogs groups — the Office of Inspector General and the Civilian Oversight Commission.

“Having somebody who is somewhat independent and whose role is more aggressively overseeing reviewing these searches is actually quite a big deal,” Maass said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9800f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3800x1995+0+269/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fzbk%2Fdamlat_images%2FLA%2FLA_PHOTO_SELECTS%2F2014_05%2F1862760_FI_0506_lawenforce_RL_003.JPG,N,,2025-09-17 13:56:58.965916

Firouzeh Firouzabadi was able to hug her son, Reza Zavvar, in their driveway on Saturday, just feet from where he was arrested by federal agents while walking his dog this summer.

“It’s amazing,” Zavvar said. “I’m glad it’s over.”

He also had an emotional reunion with his beloved dog, Duke.

Days after his happy homecoming, the 52-year-old recounted the morning of June 28.

“When I saw the first ICE agent exit his car and walk towards me with his hand on his weapon and asking if my dog is friendly, I said ‘Yes he is friendly,’"" he said. ""My heart kind of, like, sank — like, I can't believe this is happening.”

Zavvar sat down with News4 on Tuesday to reflect on the 77 days he spent in federal detention.

“Unnecessary, inhumane, corrupt,” he said.

Zavvar said he came to the U.S. from Iran legally as a student when he was 12 and eventually got his green card.

Years after a misdemeanor for marijuana possession in the late 1990s, he was stopped while reentering the country in 2004, which started the deportation process, according to his attorney.

His attorney said that case was resolved in 2007 when he was granted a ""withholding of removal order"" to Iran.

“Saying that you can stay here as long as you don’t get in trouble, that you stay clean and just stay here, work, pay taxes, and that’s what I was doing,” Zavvar said.

But nearly two decades later, ICE agents surrounded him in his quiet Gaithersburg neighborhood.

Zavvar said after he was picked up in June, he was first taken to a facility in Baltimore, where he spent five days in a holding cell. The cell had 30 to 40 people sleeping on a concrete floor, he said.

He was then transported to a detention center in Texas, according to online ICE detention records.

He said he was next sent to Ohio, back to Baltimore and eventually landed in Louisiana.

In July, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement, ""Zavvar had almost 20 years to self-deport and leave the U.S. The Trump administration will not ignore the rule of law […] criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.”

“I really didn't think that it would be to this extent and the types of people that they’re apprehending and the way that they’re going about doing it,” Zavvar said.

Loved ones said the government gave orders to deport him to Romania or Australia. However, with the help of family, friends and coworkers rallying around him and raising more than $50,000 for his legal fees, a judge ordered his release last week.

“I’m getting to that point that I’m believing right now because I can touch him, you know,” Zavvar's mother, said.

Now that he’s getting back to his routine, Zavaar said he isn't out of the woods. He's waiting for an immigration judge to be assigned to his case.

“We’re going to argue that the laws that were used to initially deport me based on my marijuana conviction in 1998, that those laws no longer exist, and to get my green card back and apply for citizenship, which I partly blame myself for that because I should have done that a little while ago,” he said.

And while he waits for his next day in court, his mother said this ordeal has taught her a valuable lesson:

(KOIN) – After Marion County filed a federal lawsuit seeking clarity on Oregon’s sanctuary state law, several Oregon counties are signing on to a letter in support of the litigation.

Marion County’s lawsuit was filed in August — seeking a federal court’s opinion on whether the county has the authority to turn over parole records of four alleged undocumented immigrants under Oregon’s sanctuary law.

Marion County’s lawsuit comes after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents served subpoenas to the county on August 1, requesting the records of four people on parole for crimes including multiple rape convictions, multiple sexual abuse convictions and convictions for kidnapping/robbery. According to court documents, a fifth subpoena was served for an individual whose identity was not clear at the time.

Federal authorities gave the county a deadline of August 18 to turn over the records, including information about the individuals’ criminal charges, home address, phone number, name of employer or school, driver’s license number and country of birth, court documents claim.

In the lawsuit — filed against Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons — the county argues that Oregon’s sanctuary law conflicts with state public records law and federal immigration law.

Now, a handful of Oregon counties are supporting the lawsuit, as reported by OPB.

In a draft letter to Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Marion County Board wrote, “Legal uncertainty harms everyone and benefits no one. It is currently unclear how Oregon’s Sanctuary Promise Act, Oregon’s Public Records Act, and federal laws interact and apply due to apparent conflicts, including in situations where a local government is served with an administrative subpoena.”

According to the draft, the counties that have signed the letter in support of the lawsuit include Baker, Clackamas, Columbia, Crook, Deschutes, Jefferson, Klamath, Linn, Malheur, Marion, Polk, Tillamook and Union counties.

The letter — which was shared with KOIN 6 News — goes on to say that the counties are encouraging the state to ask the federal court for a detailed opinion that will help local governments comply with local, state and federal laws.

A spokesperson for the Marion County Board told KOIN 6 that other Oregon counties are considering signing the letter and expect more signatures in the coming weeks.

In response to Oregon counties showing support for Marion County’s lawsuit, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said, “Oregon’s sanctuary law has already been upheld by the courts, including the Ninth Circuit, which made clear it does not conflict with federal law. My office has also been clear with Marion County and others, Oregon sanctuary law allows officials to produce information in response to a judicial warrant, but an administrative subpoena from ICE is not a judicial warrant.”

Rayfield continued, “For immigrant communities, these legal battles can create fear and confusion. My office will vigorously defend Oregon’s sanctuary law, so families feel safe reporting crimes, sending their kids to school, and living their lives without fear of being targeted unfairly.”

Spokespeople for Gov. Kotek and U.S. Attorney General Bondi declined to comment on the pending litigation.

Oregon counties are not the only group showing support for Marion County’s lawsuit.

In late August, 34 out of 36 Oregon sheriffs came out in support of the lawsuit — also seeking clarity on ICE enforcement.

The two sheriffs who did not join that letter were Washington County Sheriff Caprice Massey and Multnomah County Sheriff Nicole Morrisey O’Donnell.

In a statement shared with KOIN 6, Sheriff Massey explained her reason for not signing the letter in support of Marion County’s lawsuit.

“The Washington County Sheriff’s Office appreciates Marion County and OSSA’s efforts to seek

clarification and guidance from federal courts regarding any conflicts between federal

immigration and Oregon sanctuary laws. Of note, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office has

not recently received administrative subpoenas like those described in the Marion County

lawsuit. Those subpoenas were directed to individuals on parole or probation. In Washington

County, the Department of Community Corrections is a separate county department and not

under the Sheriff’s authority,” Washington County Sheriff Massey wrote.

Meanwhile, Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Deputy John Plock told KOIN 6, “Sheriff Morrisey O’Donnell supports efforts to seek legal clarity from the courts regarding the intersection of Oregon’s sanctuary laws and federal requests for information. However, she did not sign the OSSA letter because the administrative subpoenas at the center of the Declaratory Judgement Complaint filed by Marion County were not directed to the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office. Instead, they were sent to the Multnomah County Department of Community Justice (DCJ), which is a separate county department.”

Deputy Plock continued, “Out of respect for that separation and in recognition that DCJ—not the Sheriff’s Office—is the entity directly involved, Sheriff Morrisey O’Donnell chose not to speak or act on behalf of another department.”

Since 1987, Oregon has been a sanctuary state and was the first state in the nation to pass a statewide law stopping state and local police from aiding federal authorities with immigration enforcement.

Marion County’s lawsuit points to the Federal Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which gives federal immigration officers broad authority to enforce immigration laws, including the use of subpoenas to request records.

“Federal Immigration Law authorizes states and localities to cooperate with the federal government in the identifications, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States,” the lawsuit explains.

The complaint also points to conflicts with Oregon law, explaining that under state law, a public body cannot disclose certain information, such as an individual’s address, work or school schedules, or social media information for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement.",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/immigration_ice_12062025_AP25157540699407_04dfc5-e1755451111380.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-17 13:57:28.288268

Bucks County, Pa. — Community advocates rallied today outside the Bucks County courthouse preceding a preliminary injunction hearing challenging Sheriff Fred Harran's illegal decision to enter a 287(g) agreement with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The lawsuit, Make the Road Pennsylvania, et al. v. Harran, brought by the ACLU of Pennsylvania and the Community Justice Project, argues the sheriff acted unilaterally by entering the agreement without county approval, which is against the law.

Advocate leaders at the morning rally expressed their concerns:

""Every single person has a right to live safely, but 287(g) agreements like this one do the opposite. They spread fear, erode trust between communities and their government, and drive people into the shadows. So let’s talk about what this is really about: It’s about expanding the tentacles of Washington, D.C., into every corner of our country and our communities. It’s about giving some people free rein to target, profile, and arrest anyone they deem a threat. If today it’s immigrants, tomorrow it’s you,"" stated Diana Robinson, co-executive director of Make the Road Pennsylvania.

""The Welcome Project PA stands in solidarity with immigrant communities in Bucks County and beyond, affirming that our communities are safer and better when immigrant communities have access to safe due process and legal assistance,” said Josh Blakesley, executive director of The Welcome Project PA. “This program divides our communities and causes more fear and uncertainty. Residents of Bucks County do not want this, and neither do we!”

""The brunt of these 287(g) agreements is always felt by Black and brown communities, who become the targets of the unlawful racial profiling and harassment they manufacture. Families are in fear, worrying that their loved ones may not return home when they leave — no one should live like that. All Bucks County residents deserve to be treated with humanity and dignity. And, their taxpayer dollars should be spent on vital services, not tearing families apart in order to carry out the federal administration's destructive deportation plan against our immigrant neighbors,” said Danitra Sherman, deputy advocacy and policy director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania.

Although ICE’s budget has skyrocketed during Trump’s second term, the official confirmed body cameras haven’t been distributed to officials across the agency carrying out the president’s immigration enforcement agenda.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration discontinued its four-year body camera program.
Despite the lack of ICE body camera footage from the Franklin Park shooting, Houser said he believes there will still be a “robust” investigation into whether it was proper.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents weren’t wearing body cameras during the deadly shooting of a Mexican immigrant last week in the suburbs because a program requiring them was scrapped by the Trump administration.

In late 2021, ICE launched a $25 million body camera pilot program that was discontinued soon after President Donald Trump took office, Jason Houser, chief of staff for ICE from 2021 to 2023, said in an interview Tuesday.

“It would have put cameras on all 6,200 deportation officers,” Houser said. “So if they would have carried through with the timeline we had in place, they would all be wearing them.”

Two ICE agents weren’t wearing body-worn cameras when one of them fatally shot Silverio Villegas González in a traffic stop Friday in Franklin Park, according to a federal official who asked not to be identified.

Although ICE’s budget has skyrocketed during Trump’s second term, the official confirmed body cameras haven’t been distributed to officials across the agency carrying out the president’s immigration enforcement agenda.

Chicago cops and suburban officers have long been required to wear the devices. Earlier this year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration discontinued its four-year body camera program. The status of other federal agencies’ programs is unclear. A Trump executive order ended a mandate for federal agents to wear the devices.

Although ICE agents aren’t now required to wear body cameras, Houser pointed out they’ve been used in isolated situations this year, including a protest at an ICE facility in May in New Jersey where Newark’s mayor was arrested and ICE body cam video was used in a trespassing case against him.

Despite the lack of ICE body camera footage from the Franklin Park shooting, Houser said he believes there will still be a “robust” investigation into whether it was proper.

Under ICE policies, agents are instructed not to shoot at cars unless they’re in fear for their lives and have taken the safety of bystanders and other officers into account.

“There’s discretion in those tactical moments,” Houser said.

Houser questioned why the officers were assigned to that particular mission in the first place.

“When you have an administration that’s seeking quotas and media hits,” he said, “that puts officers at risk.”

Houser also said the Trump administration’s surge of immigration agents in Democrat-run cities like Chicago is leaving cities where the agents came from understaffed and unable to keep up with their work there.

The FBI, DEA, ATF and IRS have more agents working on immigration enforcement than ICE — depleting their core missions of fighting other types of crime, Houser said.

“Standing on a street corner in Franklin Park, stopping every other car, the percentage of you’re going to find somebody that then leads to a removal is extremely low,” he said. “None of this has to do with going after that 2% of people that have taken advantage of the immigration system that are convicted criminals — rapists, murderers — or the 1.5 million that have final orders of removal.”

Houser said the U.S. immigration system has been broken for decades and both parties are to blame.

“We can also question what went on in the Biden administration, right?” Houser said, referring to policies that “created surges and incentivized recidivism at the border.”

“We need to wake up and understand that we need [immigration] pathways for our economy to grow and for our communities to grow, and that has always been foundational to the American experience,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security, which operates ICE, has said Villegas González, a Mexican national described as a devout family man, fled a traffic stop and dragged an ICE agent “a significant distance with his car.” The agent “sustained multiple injuries,” DHS said.

A witness, Sergio, has told the Sun-Times he witnessed part of the deadly encounter and didn’t see an ICE agent being dragged by Villegas González’s car, adding that videos posted online appear to disprove the official narrative.

“If things don’t stop, it’s only going to be a few more days before people start fighting back,” said Sergio, who said he legally immigrated from Mexico and only wanted to be identified by his first name.

On Monday, Gov. JB Pritzker said he was frustrated at what he believes is a lack of transparency about how Villegas González’s death is being investigated. And it’s still unclear who exactly is handling it.

In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tracy McLaughlin said, “All shootings are initially reviewed by the appropriate federal, state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency principally charged with first response to the incident. Following a review of the incident by the appropriate investigative agency, ICE will conduct an independent review of the critical incident.”

McLaughlin said assaults on ICE agents are up “1,000%.”

According to a 2021 ICE firearms and use-of-force handbook obtained by the Sun-Times, an ICE firearms committee reviews shootings to see if they complied with the agency’s guidelines, and if any policies need to be changed. If necessary, the committee can refer the case to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility for an additional review.

The bulletin noted: “ICE employees involved in a critical incident should anticipate an investigation by local authorities. They may be interviewed by local police or subpoenaed to a local grand jury or court proceeding.”

Dawn Catanzaro, a spokesperson for the village of Franklin Park, said, “the FBI Chicago field office is in charge of the investigation,” referring questions to that agency. An FBI spokesperson said the FBI responded to the shooting and assisted law enforcement on the scene, but wouldn’t comment on involvement in an ongoing investigation.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff85821/2147483647/strip/true/crop/969x553+15+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0d%2F5bcfcd5159b68d7e7030d036aac6%2Fpolicebodycamera-1.png,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:23.286867

Johnson said he taking proactive steps to protect the rights of people to publicly demonstrate in light of the recent ICE operations in and around Chicago.

The mayor kept his cool as he responded to reporter's questions on Tuesday. However, when he was asked about whether federal troops could help make Chicago's streets safer, it touched a nerve.

""The fact of the matter is, no one has asked me to send federal troops into this city to make it safe. It has never come up. It never came up during the campaign. It's never come up in the first two years,"" Johnson said.

The mayor's fiery comments comes as President Donald Trump once again flip flopped on sending the National Guard to Chicago.

""If they lose less than six or seven people a week with murder, they're doing a great job in their opinion,"" Trump said. ""Chicago is a death trap, and I'm going to make it just like I did with DC just like I'll do with Memphis.""

Mayor Johnson bristled at that plan, noting the city's reduction in violent crime this year.

""We're not going to allow the president United States of America, or any of his ilk, look at the work that we're doing across this country. And then now we're experiencing some level of reprieve, and now he wants to put his name on our paper. No, not going to tolerate it,"" Johnson said.

Johnson signed an executive order to reaffirm protections for people who want to demonstrate against any federal action in Chicago.

He cited a recent clash at the ICE processing facility in Broadview as an example of why the order was important.

""This President is so unhinged, we just don't know what his directives are going to be. The point is, is that there's something very fundamental about our country, and that's the ability to be able to peacefully assemble and petition its government,"" the mayor said.

Mayor Johnson also accused the president of being obsessed with militarizing cities, which he called a sickness, citing Dr. Martin Luther King.

He claimed there are no circumstances under which troops should be deployed to cities across America.

29 “Warren Questions ICE About Reports of Misuse of Solitary Confinement at Immigration Detention Facilities,” U.S.","Executive Summary

The Crisis

The United States maintains the world’s largest immigration detention system, detaining an average daily population of nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention.¹ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detains people in a network of facilities across the country where they often endure inhuman conditions, including solitary confinement.² Solitary confinement is the practice of isolating people in small cells without meaningful human contact for 22 hours or more per day.³

Over the past decade, the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention has risen at an alarming rate, with unprecedented numbers of immigrants held in isolation.⁴ Congress recently authorized a significant increase in funding to expand immigration detention, which will likely exacerbate this widespread, prolonged use of solitary confinement as detention capacity increases.⁵

The effects of prolonged solitary confinement can be lethal, as in the case of Charles Leo Daniel, who died after spending more than 13 years of his life in solitary confinement in various detention settings, including almost four years in solitary confinement in ICE detention.⁶ The adverse health effects of solitary confinement are well-established, extensively researched, and thoroughly documented across decades of literature,⁷ including post-traumatic stress disorder, self-harm, elevated suicide risks, lasting brain damage, and hallucinations.⁸ These effects often persist beyond the confinement period, resulting in enduring physical and psychological disabilities, especially among people with preexisting medical and mental health conditions.⁹ Vulnerable populations, including those with medical and mental health conditions, are often subjected to solitary confinement at high rates despite ICE’s own directives mandating its use as a last resort.¹⁰

Key Findings

This report, “Cruelty Campaign: Solitary Confinement in U.S. Immigration Detention,” authored by faculty and students from Harvard Law School’s Empirical Research Services and the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program (HIRCP), the Peeler Immigration Lab, and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), provides an updated analysis of solitary confinement in U.S. immigration detention with an additional regional focus on facilities in New England. It builds on the February 2024 report, “‘Endless Nightmare’: Torture and Inhuman Treatment in Solitary Confinement in U.S. Immigration Detention,” by the same authors.¹¹

Based on publicly available ICE data and records obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, “Cruelty Campaign” reveals alarming trends in the use of solitary confinement:

Over a span of just 14 months, from April 2024 to May 2025, more than 10,500 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigration detention centers across the United States.

In the first four months of the second Trump presidency, the monthly increase in the use of solitary confinement was twice the rate observed between 2018 and 2023, and more than six times higher than during the end of the previous administration.¹²

On average, during the first three months of 2025, solitary confinement placements involving people with vulnerabilities lasted more than twice as long as they did in the first fiscal quarter of 2022, when ICE began reporting statistics on the solitary confinement of vulnerable populations.¹³ This increase is evident in both the average consecutive days per placement (38 days in early 2025 compared to 14 days in late 2021) and the average cumulative days per person (44 days in early 2025 compared to 20 days in late 2021).¹⁴

Detailed analysis of facilities in New England shows that between 2018 and 2023, nearly three out of four solitary confinement placements lasted 15 days or longer, the threshold that UN human rights experts consider to be torture.¹⁵ On average, people spent about a month in solitary confinement, and some were isolated for more than a year.¹⁶

Where mental health status was reported, almost half of the solitary confinement placements in immigration detention in New England involved individuals with reported mental health conditions,¹⁷ contrary to ICE directives requiring its use only as a last resort for vulnerable populations.¹⁸

Notably, the average number of vulnerable individuals subjected to solitary confinement nationally increased by approximately 56 percent per quarter in fiscal year 2025 compared to 2022, with increasing numbers of individuals experiencing multiple placements.¹⁹

Individual case analysis in New England reveals systemic use of solitary confinement for arbitrary and retaliatory purposes, including punishing people for filing grievances; requesting basic needs like showers; sharing food; or reporting sexual assault, practices that violate international prohibitions on arbitrary detention independent of duration.²⁰

Data Shortcomings

This analysis is constrained by fundamental flaws in ICE’s data collection and reporting systems.²¹ Recent independent analysis has found significant mathematical discrepancies in ICE detention data, and unexplained facility count changes.²² These systematic reporting failures mean that the findings in this report, while based on the best available data, may still underestimate the true scope of solitary confinement abuses, adding another layer to the transparency and accountability failures that advocates have documented for over a decade.

Sounding the Alarm for Years

This report adds to over a decade of persistent advocacy and research by PHR,²³ the National Immigrant Justice Center,²⁴ Solitary Watch,²⁵ whistleblowers,²⁶ and others; investigations, inquiries, and reports by government oversight bodies,²⁷ independent journalists,²⁸ and members of Congress;²⁹ briefings to high-level government officials;³⁰ and multiple congressional hearings focused on solitary confinement.³¹ The 2024 findings presented in “‘Endless Nightmare’: Torture and Inhuman Treatment in Solitary Confinement in U.S. Immigration Detention” revived congressional inquiries, media investigations, and urgency about ICE’s use of solitary confinement.³²

Leaders at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE faced pressure to end solitary confinement altogether or, at the very least, make major changes to reduce its use, particularly among the most vulnerable people in ICE detention.³³ In December 2024, ICE introduced new reporting requirements,³⁴ representing a modest transparency improvement.

Trump Administration Escalation

Rather than implementing recommendations to protect vulnerable people and end solitary confinement, the Trump administration has doubled down on the use of detention. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed on July 4, 2025, more than quadruples ICE’s detention budget, which amounts to $45 billion through 2029.³⁵ This massive expansion of resources for a system already characterized by torturous conditions,³⁶ combined with little to no oversight, creates the conditions for catastrophic human rights violations on an unprecedented scale.

ICE’s continued lack of transparency hinders a comprehensive assessment of solitary confinement practices in immigration detention because granular data specific to each placement is not publicly reported.³⁷ While the new reporting requirements shed additional light on the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention, publicly released national data from April 2024 to May 2025 still omit key details, including circumstances and duration of each solitary placement.³⁸

Abuse in New England Facilities

Furthermore, the analysis of New England facilities demonstrates that county and state-run facilities are critical sites for intervention by state policymakers and advocates.³⁹

This regional focus exposes harmful practices and equips policymakers and advocates with actionable insights to dismantle systems of abuse.

Immediate Action Required

ICE’s use of detention has only increased under the current administration.⁴⁰ Given ICE’s planned continued expansion of detention and escalating use of solitary confinement, immediate action is required at all levels of government.

This report presents comprehensive recommendations across multiple levels of government to end solitary confinement in immigration detention. Given significant obstacles to federal reform, state and local action has become essential. The authors make the following recommendations:

State and local governments should renegotiate contracts with ICE to assert stronger control over detention standards and accountability measures.

Federal Government:

ICE must publicly commit to ending solitary confinement entirely through a binding directive that includes presumptive release for vulnerable populations.

The president should immediately halt immigration detention expansion at a minimum and eliminate solitary confinement in all immigration facilities.

Sign the UN Optional Protocol Against Torture to enable international oversight.

Congress must defend its constitutional oversight authority against ICE’s unprecedented obstruction by passing emergency legislation to restore unannounced inspection rights, strengthen civil rights oversight mechanisms, and ratify international monitoring protocols.

State and Local Government:

States should pass legislation eliminating or reducing solitary confinement in facilities within their borders.

States should increase procedural protections for those placed in isolation.

State Attorneys General should conduct regular unannounced inspections.

In the first legal challenge against the deal, in the High Court in London, his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed.

Science Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the ruling was ""an interim judgement on one individual"" which would not halt the deal.

""It will not stop this really important deal from going ahead, a deal that says if you come to this country illegally, you can and you will be deported,"" Kendall said.

She said ministers never claimed the deal would be ""a silver bullet to tackle all of the problems"" but insisted the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was determined to make sure it worked.

The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.

Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings.

But during the hearing, it emerged that while the home secretary's own officials had rejected his claim that he was a victim of slavery, they had also said in a letter today that he had a right to make further representations – and they would not expect him to do that from France.

Mr Justice Sheldon, who rejected the man's claim that he would be left homeless and destitute in France, said that he would nevertheless have to temporarily block the man's departure in light of that development.

""There is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner,"" he said.

""If there was a reasonable suspicion that he was trafficked - and that does not mean trafficked in or from France - that would amount to a statutory bar to removal for at least a short period of time.""

The judge said the man's lawyers must do all that is possible to make further representations within 14 days, so that his case can be finalised at a future hearing.

A spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC that the government expected the first returns to take place imminently and that the interim ruling would not prevent delivery of the wider policy.

But Danny Shaw, a former Home Office adviser, said the government appeared to have selected people for removal who had ""very recently arrived on small boats in the UK and because of that, there hasn't been a lot of time to investigate the background of those individuals"".

Shaw said that was what had happened in the case of the Eritrean man, in which the judge ruled he needed 14 days to investigate whether he had been trafficked.

Imogen Townley, a solicitor at Wilson LLP who has represented asylum seekers, said there seemed to be ""quite an arbitrary and chaotic approach to selecting people arriving on small boats"".

She said while she accepted legal claims holding up removals would be frustrating for the government, it was ""worth it to have due process and a fair system"".

""It's not realistic to think that individuals caught up in the scheme do not have individual circumstances [preventing their removal],"" Townley said.

She said she did not think the UK-France deal had been scuppered because there was not an ""overarching problem"" with the scheme's design.

Kemi Badenoch responded to news of the injunction with ""we told you so"".

Speaking to LBC, the Conservative leader called for ""some tough laws"" and said ""we are basically turning our country into a refuge for anyone who may have even the slightest bit of unhappiness in any other country"".

Reform leader Nigel Farage said that even if the policy worked, it would not lead to lower migration numbers as ""one in, one out, and with another one in, still means plus one for everyone that crosses the Channel"".

Papers logged at the High Court show that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left Ethiopia for Europe two years ago, arriving in Italy in April 2025.

A month later, he left for France where he was assisted by charities including the Red Cross, before his mother paid $1,400 (£1,024) to smugglers for his Channel crossing to the UK.

More than 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.

It is the earliest point in a calendar year this figure has been passed since data on crossings was first reported in 2018.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dd92/live/93f892f0-930b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:09.228393

CBS News Chicago reached out to Homeland Security officials about what happened in Des Plaines, but have yet to hear back.","Video captured the moment ICE agents tried to take a father and his two sons into custody—leaving one man in the hospital, even though he's not in the country illegally.

Family members said that the man was released from the hospital after he said he was tased in the face while being taken into federal custody.

The only problem—he was born in Chicago.

Although his father is undocumented, they all ended up in ICE custody.

Federal agents pulled out weapons around 9:30 Tuesday morning. They boxed in a landscaping truck just as a father and his two sons exited the 7-Eleven store at Ballard and Potter Roads in Des Plaines.

Edgar Ruiz said he came out first and jumped in the passenger seat. His brother, Adrian, was second—yet when his father, Rigoberto Ruiz, left the store, surveillance showed ICE agents moved in.

One agent was seen coming from the front of the truck and went to the passenger side, where Edgar sat.

The truck was shown reversing as more agents moved in. That's when Edgar could be seen running across the busy road—ICE agents followed.

The second brother, Adrian, ran down the block. Their father, who is undocumented and has lived in the United States for 30 years, did not run.

""In the past couple of weeks and months, we've seen the Latino community as a whole under attack, that means even if you're a U.S. citizen, you've got to carry your passport,"" said Berto Aguayo, policy co-chair of the Latino Leadership Council.

The two brothers are U.S. citizens.

Edgar said that when the agent originally came to the passenger door, he tried holding the door closed, preventing him from opening it. He said at that time he and his family had no idea who was at the vehicle, and everyone was scared.

When the agent tried opening the door, Edgar said he was tased in the face. That's when he told everyone in the truck to run for their lives. Despite being a U.S. citizen, he said they ran out of fear.

Those are the concerns the Latino Leadership Council is worried about as ""Operation Midway Blitz"" continues.

""The death xxx last week at the hands of ICE and the situation in Des Plaines, we must demand full accounts of what's happening in these incidents because they are too common and too frequent, and no one is above the law here in the U.S.,"" Aguayo said.

This is not about safety. This is an engineered crisis

Edgar said he was detained for about two hours in a facility in Lombard, Illinois. Once released, his family took him to get medical attention. The father remains in ICE custody.

Moreover, there’s a reason courtroom dramas continue to find their place on your favorite streaming service: Legal cases are rich with characters, narratives, and conflict.

Whether you win or lose in the near-term, couple your legal strategy with a communications strategy so that you make the “what’s at stake” and “who is impacted” of your work better known.","In the first year of the second Trump administration, more than 350 cases have been filed to date in response to its actions, a record for any president over such a short period of time. There’s no reason to expect this deluge to stop. But because it remains an open question how much the administration actually intends to comply with the many court orders issued in response to its actions, litigation can only be part of a larger strategy to respond to what the administration is doing.

Take, for example, a recent court order restricting immigration stops, stemming from a case filed jointly by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Public Counsel, which barred authorities from stopping or arresting people based solely on racial profile (and then from detaining them without legal representation or due process). Last Monday, the Supreme Court lifted the lower court’s restrictions. But while the administration was appealing the order, it had not ceased the immigration raids, as the court had ordered. A purely legal strategy, in such a situation, is clearly inadequate for the work we are doing.

Pressure must be applied outside the courtroom as well as inside it. And despite the administration’s apparent indifference to public opinion, public sentiment is not irrelevant in the broader political and legal ecosphere. Even in the president’s case, there is evidence that he cares what certain people think, as exemplified by the now infamous TACO trade on Wall Street, and a stated openness to finding ways to legally employ migrant farm workers, to list two examples.

Moving the needle on public opinion can ultimately build a base of support for cultural and policy change that can stand the test of time. For this reason, litigation in an information vacuum not only represents a missed opportunity for advocates, but seeing litigation as one part of a larger storytelling campaign can change hearts and minds for the long term, across social groups and identities.

A central challenge is that while many public interest cases have significant, direct impacts on millions of Americans, the legal process is designed to be inaccessible, using its own language, having its own processes and rules, and operating in very insular ways. Especially for those who believe in accessible and transparent justice, pairing litigation with communications is therefore not only the best way to address the problem of the moment, but an opportunity to engage, educate, and mobilize citizenry.

So much of the communication around major cases starts with the law and then goes to the facts, but it should be the other way around. After all, legal principles gain their meaning from what happens to real people, with whom the public can empathize. By translating what is happening in a case and why it matters, you create pathways for folks to engage, learn, and ideally mobilize in your or your issues’ favor.

Moreover, there’s a reason courtroom dramas continue to find their place on your favorite streaming service: Legal cases are rich with characters, narratives, and conflict. At its best, litigation communications is about augmenting often-arcane legal arguments with messaging centered on the shared values at play, the lives impacted, and the personal stakes for those who may otherwise feel distant from the case (or where the impacts may not be immediately clear).

Take, for example, the case of Daniel Ramirez Medina, a DACA recipient who was unlawfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) just weeks into President Trump’s first term, and represented by Public Counsel. ICE’s actions were based in falsely claiming Mr. Medina was a gang member, among other things, and held him without regard for his legal rights. As the first DACA recipient to be arrested and held, Mr. Medina’s case became the blueprint for how to respond to the Trump administration’s overreach, providing a playbook of sorts for lawyers and advocates alike. Along with countering the administration’s legal arguments, this included executing a relentless communications effort to counter the government’s aggressive portrayal of Mr. Medina as a criminal, by showing Daniel for who he was (and is): A longtime, law-abiding resident, a committed father and partner, and a hard-working individual who was no different from the more than 500,000 DACA recipients living lawfully across the country.

At Public Counsel, we framed Daniel’s story as a cautionary tale of the harm that broad, unchecked agency power can have on protected families and American citizens living in the United States. We shared that story across broadcast and local television, radio, print, and social media platforms, with members of Congress and other officials, and with the immigration advocacy community broadly. In 2018, a federal judge barred the government from revoking Medina’s DACA status, reinforcing the legitimacy of his legal right to remain. Public opinion also shifted as other components of the administration’s approach to immigration prompted public outcry, with more Americans in 2020 viewing immigration positively.

We are using a similar approach to counter the ongoing immigration raids now randomly sweeping up health and childcare workers, food service and construction teams, field hands and contributors to the American economy. Here we have focused on the connection between the folks being apprehended and the increased cost of goods and services, which are costs the American electorate shares a deep concern about. Moreover, as was true in the Medina case, there is a clear distinction to be drawn between hard working folks contributing positively to their community and the murderers, drug dealers, and rapists (real or imagined) the administration promised to focus on. The former enjoy broad public support, and connecting their fate to the administration’s disregard for any reasonable legal boundaries has fueled growing opposition to its hardline approach, with the potential power to influence future policy.

Why do so many organizations litigate but don’t communicate? With most resources being dedicated to the cost and time associated with a lawsuit, communicating about an active case can be tricky. And yet litigation under the cover of darkness and away from the public spotlight is only a half measure when fundamental rights are at stake. Even if a litigation-only approach may result in a legal victory, moving public opinion and the politics of the moment may be what is actually needed for the illegal activity to cease (or for a legal outcome to be durable).

This has been most evidently the case where it relates to marriage equality, where a broad and persistent communications campaign helped move public opinion. The campaign certainly benefited from the positive portrayal of same-sex couples on television, and Harvey Milk’s legacy in bringing the gay and lesbian community out of the shadows, but everything about the advocacy campaign was precise and intentional: We leveraged every filing and hearing to engage the media, every plaintiffs’ anniversary, birthday, or personal milestone to build community on social media, and every piece of testimony to build a narrative that showed how baseless the opposition to marriage equality really was. Between 2010 and 2015, public opinion on marriage equality shifted 25 percent, and even now, public support remains strong despite some pullback from Republican voters.

A strong litigation communications strategy also opens the door to a win-by-losing approach, something many organizations should consider or even plan for. Especially when courts are not reliable, a near-term legal defeat can still be offset by an evolution in public perception. This has certainly been true of recent environmental cases, where not all cases have been won but where 61 percent oppose the president’s actions on this issue. Between 2017 and 2020, a period of extreme environmental litigation, public sentiment around climate change shifted by 11 percent.

For foundations that litigate, or that might themselves be forced to litigate, the takeaway here is both-and: Fund the best legal teams to develop the best legal theories and pursue litigation where necessary. But don’t only do that part of the puzzle. Whether you win or lose in the near-term, couple your legal strategy with a communications strategy so that you make the “what’s at stake” and “who is impacted” of your work better known. Doing so builds a more durable base of support.

The judicial branch of government provides a unique and valuable platform to tell a critical and compelling story. But it is a platform you have to seize and take advantage of. The story won’t write itself.",https://ssir.org/images/blog/legal-advocacy-storytelling-737x737.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 09:56:23.966114

She currently works at the Latin American Youth Center, where she oversees compliance for programs that support homeless and unstably housed youth. This program facilitates access to education, employment, and housing services as part of a holistic approach to long-term stability and self-sufficiency.

The United States government continues to undermine migrants’ constitutional rights in the name of immigration enforcement. This disturbing truth has been brought to light after the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on March 15, 2025. Abrego Garcia is a Salvadorian man who had legal protection from deportation under U.S. immigration law. Under a legal system that claims due process for all, including non-citizens, Abrego Garcia was deported without a hearing, warning, or regard for court orders. While his story has gained headlines, sadly he represents countless immigrants who are routinely denied their right to due process via detainment or deportation. His case reveals a growing reliance on militarized policies that erode fundamental rights and endanger human dignity for noncitizens within the United States.

A Legal and Moral Failure

The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no person, citizen or non-citizen, can be deprived of life, liberty, or property without fair legal procedures (due process). Due to life-threatening gang violence in El Salvador, Abrego Garcia exercised this right in 2019 when he was granted legal protection against deportation. Despite this protection though, in March 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported Abrego Garcia disregarding federal court orders. In fact, a lawyer for the federal government admitted that Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador was a mistake, acknowledging that he had been wrongfully removed despite having legal protection. Only with Supreme Court intervention was Abrego Garcia safely returned to the United States.

With the U.S. federal government’s blatant disregard for legal safeguards in immigration enforcement, a clear corrosion of due process exists. Policies like ""Remain in Mexico"" and ""expedited removal"" have normalized immigration procedures that disregard basic due process protections by denying individuals the opportunity to be heard in court. While immigrants do not have a constitutional right to government-funded legal representation, they are permitted to bring legal counsel when hearings occur. However, in cases like Abrego Garcia’s, no hearing was granted at all, stripping him of even the chance to defend himself.

These practices undermine the basic right of due process by denying individuals the opportunity to present their asylum cases or challenge government mistakes. Even those with a court order barring removal, like Abrego Garcia, are regularly denied legal protections as immigration enforcement chooses efficiency over true justice. This is dangerous to all people in the United States, regardless of citizenship, because once one group of people’s rights are violated, everyone’s rights are at risk.

Militarizing the Border, Dismantling Rights

The degradation of immigrant rights is fundamentally tied to the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border. Over the last two decades, administrations on both sides of the aisle have transformed the Southern border into a pseudo-warzone with policies such as “prevention through deterrence”. As the Brennan Center notes, this militarization has become an “opaque and extralegal security apparatus” that avoids congressional oversight and threatens constitutional protections.

This strategy, intended to close off border entry, actually funnels migrants onto more dangerous routes, increasing their need for smugglers and risk of death. Migrants are simultaneously criminalized for using illicit channels while being denied access to legal ones. This manufactured danger not only justifies further enforcement spending but also shifts public perception by framing migration as a threat rather than a humanitarian issue rooted in global inequality and displacement.

Under pressure from the U.S. government, Mexico has also engaged in militarization by deploying their National Guard to the Southern border. The Oxford-published study The Militarization of Mexico’s Border and Its Impacts on Human Rights details how the “use of military tactics, strategy, technology, equipment and forces” to control migration undermines human rights protections and pushes migrants toward more dangerous, life-threatening paths.

Militarized Borders, Civilian Consequences

Border militarization has created a dangerous environment that blurs the lines between immigration enforcement and military policing. Under these policies, everyone, including U.S. citizens, is at risk of racial profiling, unwarranted stops, and unconstitutional surveillance. Particularly, Latinx residents near the border are disproportionately targeted, as the U.S. border enforcement turns its dehumanizing practices onto its own people.

These practices not only violate domestic law, but also disregard binding international agreements. The principle of non-refoulement under the 1951 Refugee Convention prohibits returning individuals to countries where they face serious harm. As such, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly condemned U.S. and Mexican border militarization as incompatible with basic human rights norms. In doing so, the U.S. and its partners have built a border regime that treats human rights as optional, a dangerous model with consequences that extend far beyond immigration policy.

A Path Forward through a Broken System

While Americans may wish to classify Abrego Garcia’s case as unique, doing so misses the deep systemic failures and institutional compromises of human rights happening within our borders. The U.S. government has incrementally legitimized a border regime which diminishes migration to criminality and prioritizes deterrence over justice. The Trump policies accelerated this trajectory, but the Biden administration has also not been able to fully reverse it. As the highest court in the country, the most recent decision by the Supreme Court affirming that deportations without hearings violate constitutional rights should be irrefutable. However, as the treatment of immigrants in the U.S. shows, having rights on paper means little without real enforcement and accountability.

Moving forward, migration policy must center human rights by upholding due process, expanding legal pathways, and decreasing harmful border militarization. This involves investing in immigration courts, ceasing expedited deportations, and ensuring that the principle of non-refoulement is not a mere formality but an effective legal protection. It also demands holding the highest-level officials responsible for unauthorized removals, regardless of whether there is Democratic or Republican leadership.

Conclusion

Legal protections do not stop at the border. In the United States, regardless of citizenship, people are entitled to dignity, justice, and protection of human rights. The unconstitutional deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a human rights failure. While due process is being reaffirmed by the courts, policymakers must confront the larger system that perpetuated this violation of basic human rights. Constitutional rights cannot coexist with militarized borders. So, to honor its legal and moral obligations, the United States will have to choose principle over fear by dismantling a border regime that treats human dignity as negotiable.",https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/meta_open_graph/public/2025-09/viber_image_2025-06-11_07-02-36-478.jpg?itok=ZrZq9yZl,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:13.990135

""On August 28, ICE arrested Nathaniel Rojas, a criminal alien from the Dominican Republic.","U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joined federal immigration agents during an early morning operation in Elgin, Illinois, on Tuesday that resulted in multiple people being led away in handcuffs, and two U.S. citizens being briefly detained.

A CBS report said that five people had been arrested during the raid, including two U.S. citizens, before being released after showing their official documentation. But when asked by Newsweek, DHS denied that two U.S. citizens were arrested and said they were held briefly and subsequently released.

""No U.S. citizen was arrested, they were briefly held for their and officers' safety while the operation in the house was under way. This is standard protocol,"" a DHS spokesperson told Newsweek.

DHS said that five people were arrested as part of the raid, all of whom were illegal immigrants.

The raid—which Noem posted footage of on X—was part of a broader Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enforcement effort called ""Operation Midway Blitz"" that targeted criminal noncitizens in the Chicago area, according to officials.

Why It Matters

Noem's presence on an early morning enforcement action underscores the heightened federal focus on immigration enforcement in the Chicago metropolitan area and the political salience of those operations. The homeland security secretary has become the face of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, making numerous public appearances and frequently attending ICE raids around the country.

The White House has floated a goal of 3,000 daily ICE arrests, raising concerns among advocates who say such quotas encourage indiscriminate enforcement practices and undermine due process protections.

What To Know

DHS said that five illegal immigrants were arrested in the Chicago area, including an individual convicted of a DUI with a child passenger, an individual convicted of violent assault, and an individual arrested for domestic violence, harassment, obstruction, and felony stalking.

""President Trump has been clear: if politicians will not put the safety of their citizens first, this administration will,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. ""Just this morning, DHS took violent offenders off the streets with arrests for assault, DUI, and felony stalking. Our work is only beginning.""

Video posted by Noem on X shows agents in tactical gear leading people away in handcuffs. It is unclear if those handcuffed included the two U.S. citizens.

DHS said the operation was part of a multi-week enforcement push targeting what the department described as ""criminal illegal aliens"" who have come to Illinois, particularly Chicago.

Local witnesses described helicopters, bright spotlights, tactical vehicles and what one neighbor called the ""drone of a helicopter"" overhead.

The Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history and has conducted numerous ICE raids since taking office in January.

ICE reported more than 66,000 arrests and 65,000 removals in the administration's first 100 days, with the daily detention population swelling to 55,000 people, well above pre-inauguration levels.

While officials have stressed that dangerous criminals are being targeted, federal data show that many detainees have no criminal record at all.

Last month, ICE agents detained the boyfriend of a New York City official though he had legal status.

""On August 28, ICE arrested Nathaniel Rojas, a criminal alien from the Dominican Republic. His criminal history includes convictions for felony grand larceny, felony aggravated DUI with a child passenger less than 16 years old, identify theft, and retail theft. This criminal alien is in ICE custody pending removal proceedings,"" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Newsweek.

What People Are Saying

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X alongside footage of the operation: ""This week, a brave ICE officer was dragged many yards by a car after a criminal illegal alien resisted arrest. His life was put at risk and he sustained serious injuries. President Trump has been clear: if politicians will not put the safety of their citizens first, this administration will. I was on the ground in Chicago today to make clear we are not backing down. Just this morning, DHS took violent offenders off the streets with arrests for assault, DUI, and felony stalking. Our work is only beginning.""

Joe Botello, a U.S. citizen from Texas detained in the raid, told the Chicago Sun-Times: ""I told them I was a U.S. citizen, that my ID was in my wallet.""

Illinois state Senator Cristina Castro, addressing Noem directly, told CBS Chicago: ""She can go to hell. Don't come into my community.""

What Happens Next

DHS has signaled that the operation will continue for several weeks across the Chicago area, with federal agencies participating in enforcement actions. CBS reported that the broader federal presence included ICE, U.S. Marshals, the FBI and Customs and Border Protection.

The lawsuit comes weeks after the Trump administration fined the University of California, Los Angeles $1.2 billion and froze research funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus and other civil rights violations. It was the first public university to be targeted with a widespread funding freeze. The administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges, including Harvard, Brown and Columbia.

According to the lawsuit, the Trump administration has made several demands in its proposed settlement offer to UCLA, including giving government access to faculty, student, and staff data, releasing admissions and hiring data, ending diversity scholarships, banning overnight demonstrations on university property and cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of the UC system's president.

Stett Holbrook, a spokesman for the University of California system, said that while the university is not involved in the lawsuit, it is part of numerous legal and advocacy efforts to restore and maintain funding.

“Federal cuts to research funding threaten lifesaving biomedical research, hamper U.S. economic competitiveness and jeopardize the health of Americans who depend on the University’s cutting-edge medical science and innovation,” he said in a statement.

The coalition that sued is led by the American Association of University Professors union, or AAUP, and represented by Democracy Forward, a legal group that has brought other lawsuits against the Trump administration over frozen federal funds.

“The blunt cudgel the Trump administration has repeatedly employed in this attack on the independence of institutions of higher education has been the abrupt, unilateral, and unlawful termination of federal research funding on which those institutions and the public interest rely,” the lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco said.

University of California President James Milliken said on Monday that the federal government has also launched investigations and other actions against all of the UC’s 10 campuses, but he offered no details in a statement.

“This represents one of the gravest threats to the University of California in our 157-year history,” he said, adding that the university system receives more than $17 billion each year in federal support, including nearly $10 billion in Medicare and Medicaid funding, and funding that goes toward research and student financial aid.

The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.

This summer, Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government’s allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restored more than $400 million in research grants.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/e2884df7-3c75-4f74-bf98-2bd8da799137/wirestory_a446496522cbaf0e33cc8eb8fd130a5d_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-17 09:56:27.086521
