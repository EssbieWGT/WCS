The shifting composition of the right’s coalitions around the Venezuela issue can be explained by a handful of factors.
But in the meantime, the political situation within MAGA bears a resemblance to the situation on the ground: fluid and uncertain.","On the other side of the issue, Trump’s saber-rattling is meeting resistance from the GOP’s “restrainers,” a group that includes both “America First” nationalists like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson as well as more conventional anti-interventionist libertarians like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Many members of the camp opposed Trump’s decision to bomb Iran in June on the grounds that it risks dragging the U.S. into another costly regime-change war in the Middle East, and they are raising similar concerns about toppling Maduro’s government in Venezuela.

Yet each coalition is subtly different than the ones that formed in other recent intra-right skirmishes over the Trump administration’s interventionist forays.

In this instance, long-time anti-interventionists like Carlson and Bannon are being joined by a handful of prominent conservatives who supported the U.S. bombing campaign against Iran. That cohort includes the divisive MAGA activist Laura Loomer, who clashed with Carlson earlier this year over his opposition to the Iran bombings but has now joined him in opposing military action in Venezuela. In a series of social media posts in recent weeks, Loomer has attacked fellow Republicans calling for the U.S. to intervene, arguing that ousting Maduro would saddle U.S. taxpayers with the cost of rebuilding the country while creating an opportunity for China to deepen its foothold in the region. (Loomer did not respond to requests for comment.)

Also apparently siding with anti-interventionists is Trump’s special envoy Richard Grenell, whom the administration tapped to spearhead diplomatic outreach to Caracas. Earlier this year, Grenell defended the U.S. bombing campaign in Iran, but he has emerged within the administration as a prominent proponent of a diplomatic resolution with Maduro’s government. In October, the administration paused Grenell’s outreach to Venezuela — a move that seemingly empowered more hawkish forces within the administration — but Grenell has continued to remain publicly committed to the potential for a peaceful resolution.

The anti-interventionist camp also has quietly won the backing of some right-leaning anti-immigration advocates, who fear that an escalation of the conflict could spur a hemispheric migration crisis that would undercut the administration’s efforts to cut down on immigration from South and Central America.

“Every foreign adventure that we’ve entered into has resulted in significant immigration,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for immigration restrictions. “That’s the way it always works, and it needs to be factored into any decision about intervening in foreign countries.”

Krikorian pointed out that the ratcheting up of tensions with Venezuela could also threaten other aspects of Trump’s immigration agenda, including efforts to deport Venezuelan immigrants back to their native country. On Tuesday, Maduro’s government announced that it would continue to accept twice-weekly deportation flights from the U.S. despite Trump’s recent decision to unilaterally declare a closure to Venezuela’s airspace, but Krikorian cautioned that the situation could get more difficult if the U.S. further escalates the conflict.

“Upping tensions with Venezuela makes it less likely we’re going to be able to get the Venezuelan illegal aliens that Biden let in out of the country,” he said.

The shifting composition of the right’s coalitions around the Venezuela issue can be explained by a handful of factors. For one, the issue mobilizes a small but influential group of conservative Hispanic voters for whom ousting Maduro remains a top-line issue — and who make up a critical part of Trump’s electoral coalition. At the same time, Venezuela — unlike Iran or Syria — sits in the U.S.’s backyard in the Western hemisphere, meaning that the knock-on effects of a protracted conflict could much more directly impact the U.S. Lastly, in contrast to the controversial strikes against Iran, the conflict with Venezuela doesn’t implicate U.S. support for Israel, an issue that continues to divide the GOP across traditional ideological lines.

The intra-right coalitions could shift further as the administration’s end game comes into clearer focus. In public, the administration has maintained that its pressure campaign is about combatting “narcoterrorism” and that it is not seeking to oust Maduro — even as it has continued to classify his government as “illegitimate,” ramped up U.S. military presence in the region and quietly discussed scenarios for a post-Maduro future.

All eight judges worked out of immigration court offices at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City, which is where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is headquartered in the city, the official told CBS News.

One of the judges who was fired was Amiena Khan, an assistant chief immigration judge at 26 Federal Plaza, the official said. Khan oversaw other immigration judges there.

According to the official, 98 judges have been fired nationally since January, including 12 assistant chief immigration judges. The official said that an almost equal number have taken early out options, retired or resigned since the start of the Trump administration.

A spokeswoman at the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Justice Department, which has control over immigration judges and courts, declined to comment Tuesday on personnel matters.

The New York Times first reported the firings on Monday.

There were about 700 immigration judges in the country to start the year, and we are now down below 600, the National Association of Immigration Judges official said. A tax bill passed in Congress and signed by President Trump in July called for 800 permanent immigration judges and judge teams to support them.

Since January, according to the official, the Justice Department has hired and placed 11 new permanent judges and 25 temporary judges with military backgrounds on six-month terms.

In an emailed statement, a Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News: ""After four years of the Biden Administration forcing Immigration Courts to implement a de facto amnesty for hundreds of thousands of aliens, this Department of Justice is restoring integrity to our immigration system and encourages talented legal professionals to join in our mission to protect national security and public safety.""

In July, three immigration judges spoke out about their firings by the Justice Department, telling CBS News the firings were ""arbitrary, unfair"" and ""an attack on the rule of law."" The Justice Department had no comment at the time on the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers union's allegations that several immigration judges had been fired without cause.

The immigration courts are struggling with a backlog of more than 3.4 million cases, and in September, a defense official confirmed to CBS News that the Pentagon is considering authorizing up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges.

The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court. Its new rule, published in the Federal Register in late August, states that the Justice Department ""no longer believes the restriction of [temporary immigration judges] to current Department employees with a threshold level of immigration law experience serves [the Executive Office for Immigration Review's] interests.""

Last month, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the Trump administration to release several hundred detainees on a $1,500 bond. While they waited for their immigration court dates, the former detainees would have been tracked with devices like ankle monitors or a smartphone app.

The judge ruled in response to immigration and civil rights lawyers’ allegations that Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly violated a 2022 federal consent decree restricting the use of warrantless arrests for undocumented immigrants.

But the Trump administration appealed, and on Tuesday argued to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals that the judge overstepped his authority by modifying the consent decree.

Criticism of ruling

At least one of the three judges on the panel — Trump appointee Thomas Kirsch II — seemed to agree. He criticized Cummings’ November order to release detainees along with his Oct. 7 order extending the consent decree until February. Cummings was appointed by President Joe Biden.

During nearly an hour of oral arguments, Kirsch said he was “surprised — I was shocked, actually” that Cummings’ October ruling “acts as if these are two private parties negotiating over the terms of a contract.”

U.S. Department of Justice lawyer Benjamin Hayes contended that by modifying the consent decree, Cummings was exercising power he didn’t have and forcing the administration to ignore federal law. National Immigrant Justice Center attorney Keren Zwick argued that Cummings was merely interpreting existing federal law and enforcing the consent decree in response to the Trump administration altering the playing field.

Zwick and her colleagues argue the new administration’s policy encouraging agents to carry blank warrant forms and fill them out at the scene of an arrest is a violation of the consent decree. Cummings in October agreed, writing the use of I-200 warrants was “explicitly designed” to get around the requirement that agents have probable cause to believe a person is in the country illegally and he or she is a flight risk before arresting an undocumented immigrant.

Zwick told Kirsch that Cummings was well within his rights to modify the consent decree because the use of I-200 warrants was “never contemplated” in the years she and her colleagues negotiated with DHS over the terms of the decree.

“So what?” Kirsch replied, saying that wasn’t enough for Cummings to modify or extend the decree.

Judge John Lee, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, took the opposite view on the I-200 forms.

“It seems to me odd that the government — whoever has the White House at the time — can just say, ‘Oh, well, I think this sheet of paper is good enough,’” Lee said.

Arrests exceed ‘worst of the worst’

Though the consent decree was scheduled to expire in May, plaintiffs’ attorneys had asked for an extension, which was supposed to have left it in place while the judge weighed the arguments. Cummings’ October ruling extended the decree through early February.

But since that ruling, “Operation Midway Blitz” reached a crescendo, resulting in the arrests of several thousand people. Cummings would go on to determine that not only did I-200 arrests violate the consent decree, but so did a new DHS policy on mandatory detention.

Before a Sept. 5 decision from the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals, the vast majority of undocumented immigrants who were arrested would be released on bond after an immigration judge determined a person didn’t have a disqualifying criminal record and was not a danger to the community or a flight risk.

But in the days before Operation Midway Blitz began last month, the Trump administration’s immigration appeals board reversed decades of precedent and ruled that detention would be mandatory for any undocumented immigrant who entered the U.S. without being “admitted” by an immigration officer.

Then on Sept. 8, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh issued a decision that allows immigration officers to take a person’s “apparent ethnicity” into account when determining reasonable suspicion to question someone’s immigration status. As a result of those factors, thousands more people were arrested in Midway Blitz than the “worst of the worst” promised by the Trump administration, including immigrants who’ve been in the U.S. for decades.

During a Nov. 13 hearing, Cummings said his staff had determined that the vast majority of approximately 100 undocumented immigrants who have active cases in Chicago federal court were arrested either at work or commuting to and from work, including 20 landscapers and nine people apprehended at Home Depot or Menards, “presumably either seeking work or picking up materials.”

Based on that pattern, the judge said it was “highly likely” that many arrestees should not be subject to mandatory detention and were “unlikely … part of the group of drug dealers, violent criminals and assorted ne’re-do-wells that fall into category that ICE calls worst of the worst.”

Cummings has repeatedly pointed out that more than 100 of his colleagues across the country have rejected DHS’ arguments on mandatory detention since the agency began testing the new legal theory in July. But the judge has also repeatedly said he doesn’t want anyone actually dangerous to be released from ICE custody. Per his orders, DHS had identified roughly 450 people who could potentially be released before the 7th Circuit halted Cummings’ order on Nov. 19.

Kirsch, though, said the lower court judge’s theory of his power over consent decrees could prove dangerous.

“What would stop the current administration from entering into a bunch of consent decrees to entrench their policy preferences on the next administration?” he asked.

Riot control weapons case dead

Meanwhile on Tuesday, protesters, clergy and media outlets who launched a high-profile lawsuit against DHS this fall over immigration agents’ use of riot control weapons said in a court filing they plan to drop their case.

Over nearly two months of litigation, attorneys for the plaintiffs corralled hundreds of videos and photos alleging agents’ inappropriate use of force against members of the public. They also forced the release of thousands of hours of body camera footage from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents participating in Operation Midway Blitz.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino into her courtroom and later called him a liar. The judge issued a temporary restraining order restricting weapons like tear gas, pepper balls, flashbang grenades and other use of force, and last month issued a more indefinite injunction.

But the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals last month stayed Ellis’ ruling, calling it “overbroad” and ruling that the judge’s injunction overstepped and “impermissibly” infringed on how the executive branch conducts law enforcement activity.

Moving to dismiss the lawsuit will prevent the 7th Circuit or U.S. Supreme Court from giving the Trump administration any permanent expanded powers against civilians. Despite the specter of losses on appeal, plaintiffs’ lawyers on Tuesday framed ending the case as a win.

Steve Art, an attorney with Loevy & Loevy, said in a statement that the lawsuit “exposed” the Trump administration’s “justifications for its conduct … as blatant lies.”

“The injunction broadly obstructs the enforcement of the nation’s laws, chills the exercise of executive power, and subverts the constitutional structure.” ____","In what appears to be a longer-term legal strategy, the plaintiffs in an injunction case limiting the use of force by immigration agents during Operation Midway Blitz on Tuesday abruptly moved to dismiss the underlying lawsuit in the midst of an appeal by the Trump administration.

In the request, lawyers representing a consortium of media outlets and other plaintiffs noted that the immigration enforcement surge “has ended” in Chicago — at least for now — and that “counsel has not received a single report of unconstitutional behavior that necessitated this case” since Nov. 8.

If the dismissal is granted, it could effectively end a case that came to symbolize the havoc Midway Blitz caused in Chicago and led to U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issuing a scathing ruling limiting the use of tear gas or other munitions against journalists and protesters, among other restrictions.

In a statement Tuesday, the board for the Chicago Headline Club, the lead plaintiff in the case, claimed victory, saying that Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and his team of agents left town soon after Ellis’ injunction was entered.

“To no one’s surprise, the federal government appealed, and the lower court’s preliminary injunction was stayed in the meantime,” the statement said. “Given that the Border Patrol and other federal agencies have reduced their presence for now, we don’t see a need to keep the court fight going. We’ll take the win.”

Lead plaintiffs’ attorney Steve Art said the litigation exposed the brutality behind the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and showed that its justifications for the use of force were “blatant lies.”

“Judge Ellis’s powerful opinion stands as the final word in this case, and as a defining document of our time,” Art said in a written statement.

Meanwhile, the Chicago Headline Club said that it was “fully prepared to go to court again if federal agents return in force or if any activities of federal agents escalate into violations of our constitutional rights.”

According to the motion to dismiss, the Department of Justice has agreed to drop its appeal as long as Ellis dismisses the lawsuit “with prejudice,” meaning it cannot be refiled.

A DOJ spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

The decision to drop the case came after ominous signs from a conservative three-judge panel with the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which issued an emergency stay of Ellis’ injunction last month. It’s not immediately clear if the appeals court would drop the matter entirely. The court had issued an expedited briefing schedule and set arguments for later this month.

In asking the 7th Circuit for a stay, lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice wrote earlier this month that the case was a “perfect example” of a growing trend in the nation’s courts to issue sweeping injunctions that violate the separation of powers and “superintend law-enforcement activities under threat of contempt.”

Days later, a conservative three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit granted the stay and set the case for expedited briefing, saying the government was likely to succeed on those arguments.

“The preliminary injunction entered by the district court is overbroad,” the order said. “In no uncertain terms, the district court’s order enjoins an expansive range of defendants, including the President of the United States, the entire Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and anyone acting in concert with them. … The practical effect is to enjoin all law enforcement officers within the Executive Branch.”

Ellis’ injunction also requires government officials to submit all future guidelines for use of force to the court for review, “a mandate impermissibly infringing on principles of separation of powers on this record,” the appeals court said.

The injunction was also too “prescriptive” in barring the “use of scores of riot control weapons and other devices in a way that resembles a federal regulation,” the appellate court order said.

All three judges on the panel hearing the appeal are Republican nominees. Judge Frank Easterbook was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, while Judge Michael Scudder and Judge Michael Brennan were each nominated by Trump in his first term.

While the judge’s warned not to read too much into its order for a stay, it was clear that the court was poised to severely limit — if not overturn — Ellis’ injunction, which could have greatly hampered any future efforts to rein in immigration enforcement practices should it pick up again in the spring.

In her injunction ruling, Ellis earlier this month revealed new information gleaned from body-worn cameras and other evidence showing how agents used tear gas and flash-bang grenades on fleeing protesters, shot a praying minister in the face with pepper balls and even used ChatGPT to help write a report.

The 233-page written ruling took readers methodically through many of the high-profile melees between immigration agents and protesters during the two-month operation, including incidents in Albany Park, Old Irving Park, Evanston and the East Side.

Ellis wrote in the opinion that, over and over, body-worn camera footage from the agents undermined what was eventually put in their use-of-force reports, rendering their statements unreliable.

The reports also misidentified “neighborhood moms and dads, Chicago Bears fans, people dressed in Halloween costumes, and the lawyer who lives on the block” as professional agitators, Ellis wrote, while the body cameras at times captured the agents’ apparent glee in deploying tear gas and other munitions on residential streets.

Ellis’ preliminary injunction prohibits immigration agents from deploying tear gas or other munitions before issuing two explicit warnings, requires agents in the field to have body cameras and wear clear identification on their uniforms and forbids law enforcement from targeting journalists or interrupting their news gathering in most circumstances.

Unlike a previously entered temporary restraining order, the preliminary injunction was to remain in effect until a final decision on the merits of the case is made, either at trial or through a settlement. Ellis had tentatively set a hearing on permanent injunction for March.

In its appeal brief filed last week, the Department of Justice argued Ellis’ injunction order was “untenably overbroad” and improperly empowers her to “micromanage how federal agents respond to disruptive and often violent protests throughout the Chicago area.”

“What began as a complaint by a handful of journalists and protesters alleging that federal officers targeted them with crowd-control devices at a few protests in September and early October has transformed into an instrument for judicial micromanagement of federal law-enforcement operations,” lawyers for the Department of Justice wrote in the brief. “The injunction broadly obstructs the enforcement of the nation’s laws, chills the exercise of executive power, and subverts the constitutional structure.”

Legal experts say a growing number of people are being detained when they come in for their appointments.

""A lot of people are afraid to go to interviews now. They don't want to go or... are making plans for if they get detained,"" said immigration attorney Habib Hasbani.

The couple says they used their savings to apply for the green card and are now struggling to pay attorneys as they work to get Hwang out on bond.

While plaintiffs characterized their move as a win, the case was headed toward a skeptical appeals court.

The court filing Tuesday noted that the federal officers led by senior U.S. Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino “are no longer operating in the Northern District of Illinois.” Bovino left the Chicago area last month for North Carolina, but sporadic immigration arrests have continued by other federal agents.

“We got the relief that we were looking for. They left,” said David Owens, an attorney representing the plaintiffs. “When the emergency goes away, things change.""

The attorneys also noted a blistering 223-page opinion by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis last month that outlined her findings in issuing a preliminary injunction restricting federal agents’ use of force.

The fate of the order was up in the air after an appeals court last month deemed it “overbroad” and “too prescriptive.” But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also cautioned against “overreading” its stay of Ellis' injunction and said a quick appeal process could lead to a “more tailored and appropriate” order. Arguments before the three-judge panel were set for later this month.

Owens declined to detail the plaintiffs’ legal reasoning in dropping the case, including if the appeals court’s intervention played a role.

The injunction was in response to a lawsuit filed by news outlets and protesters who claimed federal officers used excessive force during an immigration crackdown that has netted more than 3,000 arrests since September across the nation’s third-largest city and its many suburbs. Among other things, Ellis’ order restricted agents from using physical force and chemical agents such as tear gas and pepper balls, unless necessary or to prevent an “an immediate threat.” She said the current practices violated the constitutional rights of journalists and protesters.

“Because of the work of many Chicagoans, including the brave plaintiffs in this case, the brutality of Operation Midway Blitz was carefully documented for all to see, the constitutional rights of civilians across the region were vindicated, and the Trump administration’s justifications for its conduct were exposed as blatant lies,” said attorney Steve Art. “Judge Ellis’s powerful opinion stands as the final word in this case, and as a defining document of our time.”

A message left Tuesday for the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned. The department oversees both the U.S Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

DHS and Bovino have defended the operation in Chicago, saying agents were going after criminals and faced hostile crowds.

The case also precipitated a trove of new details about the immigration operation in the Chicago area, including through private interviews with Bovino, body camera footage and witness testimonies in court. Ellis cited each of these in her opinion, describing agents launching tear gas without warning, aiming rubber rounds at reporters, tackling protesters and laughing as blood oozed from a demonstrator’s ear — scenes that Ellis says were flatly at odds with the government’s own narratives.

Federal court weighs case over abrupt termination of Montana State University students' immigration status

The defense stated that the federal government ""ran into a buzzsaw"" of lawsuits after the March 2025 Student Criminal Alien Initiative (SCAI) began.

Through SCAI, federal agents searched the names of foreign students through the National Criminal Information Center's (NCIC) database, which tracks encounters with law enforcement.

Research returned thousands of hits, which prompted the termination of what's called SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor System Records).

Universities nationwide sent letters to foreign students warning of deportation.

Then, in April, the ACLU's lawsuit on behalf of the graduate students began. Later that month, the government reversed course and temporarily restored the SEVIS records.

Fast forward to Dec. 2, where the defense urged dismissal without prejudice since they say the government has no intent to engage in similar conduct.

The prosecution rebutted by stating, ""immigrants will continue to be in the crosshairs,"" and they say the government still can terminate records even if there is no plan to do so at the moment.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4e43966/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1182x621+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F17%2F9e%2Fa0bbaa6e455aaeaa2405d966aace%2Fscreenshot-2025-12-02-at-4-14-15-pm.png,N,,2025-12-02 19:56:45.708548

The day before the shooting was carried out, the Trump administration announced it would review all refugee admissions that were issued under the Biden administration, some 200,000 people over four years.
Lakanwal, who served in a CIA-backed counter-terrorism unit during the war, came to the U.S. under Biden but was approved for asylum under the Trump administration.
“This guy was vetted by both the Biden and Trump administrations, and that’s not the issue here, the vetting.
“We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country,” Trump said of Somalians.","President Trump’s threats to crack down on immigration are leaving migrants bracing as the administration said it will close the door on many legal pathways to the U.S. following a shooting that killed a National Guard member.

Since the Wednesday shooting killed 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, Trump and his Cabinet members have proposed a dizzying number of reforms as part of a Thanksgiving pledge to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”

The Trump administration has paused all pending asylum applications for those from across the globe seeking refuge in the U.S. And for those from the 19 countries already covered by the travel ban, Trump has said he would pause review of their immigration cases, threatening also to revoke their green cards. He also said the U.S. would not issue any visas to citizens of Afghanistan, the home country of shooter Rahmanullah Lakanwal.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested the policies could stretch even further, threatening action “on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches and entitlement junkies” in a remark that sparked concern the Trump administration could expand its existing travel ban.

To immigration advocates, the shooting has become cover to carry out drastic immigration moves that were likely already eyed by the administration.

“You have to take a broader view that this is a president that has a documented history of using tragedies, using external developments, using things like the pandemic as pretext to pursue specific ends when it comes to immigration,” said Jorge Loweree, managing director at the American Immigration Council.

“What happened is an absolute tragedy, and we need to do everything we can to prevent that sort of thing from happening. But there’s very clearly a much broader goal here, which is to severely reduce legal immigration to the U.S. by whatever means possible.”

Others lamented that the actions of one person have become the basis for a series of immigration actions that will have far-reaching consequences.

“They are going after not only all Afghans, but also it’s expanded to all people applying for asylum, all individuals who are from countries that are on the travel ban list, and they’re even looking toward expanding the travel ban as well,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, noting that the Trump administration initially considered 36 countries for the travel ban.

“They’re just going taking this one very tragic incident and expanding it … just using it as an excuse to do what they’ve always intended to do and go after individuals from, as the president said, Third World countries.”

Trump on Thanksgiving said the moves were needed to “allow the U.S. system to fully recover …and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.”

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL,” he wrote on Truth Social.

All the measures proposed by Trump would target legal immigrants to the United States.

The day before the shooting was carried out, the Trump administration announced it would review all refugee admissions that were issued under the Biden administration, some 200,000 people over four years.

The directive was seen by some as specifically targeting the roughly 80,000 Afghan citizens who fled the country amid the fallout from the U.S. withdrawal in 2021 and were evaluated by the Biden administration.

Lakanwal, who served in a CIA-backed counter-terrorism unit during the war, came to the U.S. under Biden but was approved for asylum under the Trump administration. He was vetted by counterterrorism authorities and had received what is known as chief-of-mission approval, verifying his work for U.S. forces as part of the process to gain a green card.

“This guy was vetted by both the Biden and Trump administrations, and that’s not the issue here, the vetting. Nothing failed with the vetting,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, who said the resulting immigration moves amount to collective punishment.

“[It’s a] colossal waste of resources. Refugees are already vetted to the fullest extent before they get here, and every person who’s a non-citizen or in a temporary status here is continually vetted when they’re here.”

Dalal-Dheini said the result of putting so many immigration applications on pause actually jeopardizes safety.

“They’re putting all these hundreds of thousands of people in limbo because of the action of one person, and that doesn’t do anything to improve our national security,” she said.

“If they just stop vetting these people to stop adjudicating their cases, people who are a national security threat may not be discovered. If they’re delaying these cases, if they’re spending all this time to re-examine individuals who have already been vetted — so refugees or green card holders — you’re now taking away resources for the adjudicators to be able to actually adjudicate new cases of people who have not been vetted before,” she said.

“This, in fact, is probably going to harm our national security more than improve it.”

Trump at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday forecast some future immigration moves, saying officials were preparing for a wave of new enforcement efforts, including one targeting Somali immigrants in Minneapolis.

“We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country,” Trump said of Somalians.

Somalia is already included on the existing travel ban list, as is Afghanistan, while Burundi, Chad, Cuba, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Myanmar, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela and Yemen fill out the rest of the list.

Trump’s comments about stopping migration from “all Third World countries” also raised questions about what countries might be included.

“There are a number of countries, some very, very large countries, who, depending on how you define a developing nation, or, as the president says, a Third World country, could be on that list, including, potentially, a country like India,” Loweree said.

But he sees a larger trend from Trump’s immigration moves, as further narrowing of immigration pathways to various countries inevitably stops people from coming to the U.S.

“The president’s intent on targeting a broad sort of swath of the world when it comes to the narrowing of our immigration system,” Loweree said.

“All of these different changes, some of them may be relatively small, but when you add them together, they create many different layers that prevent specific populations of people from being able to navigate the system, and therefore shut them out entirely,” he said.

“That is the goal, targeting specific people that the administration deems to be undesirable and cutting them out of the system.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/AP25336623814461-e1764696291426.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-02 19:56:32.282415

The government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Tuesday announced that the twice-weekly flights will go on following a request from the Trump administration. That reverses a Venezuelan government Saturday announcement indicating that U.S. immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended the flights.

An overflight and landing application submitted Monday by U.S.-based Eastern Airlines requests permission for an arrival Wednesday. The agreement authorizes flights on a Boeing 777-200 from Phoenix, Arizona, to land at Maiquetía International Airport, the Venezuelan government said. The application was made public Tuesday by Venezuela's foreign affairs minister.

Venezuelans have been steadily deported to their home country this year after Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. Maduro has since framed their return as a triumph, saying Venezuelans are being repatriated from harsh conditions in U.S. detention.

Immigrants arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants have returned so far this year on the chartered flights, the latest of which arrived Friday.

The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast.

Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.

The Trump administration has also claimed some of the drug cartels are controlled by Maduro. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would start doing strikes on land soon, though he didn't specify where and said attacks might occur in countries besides Venezuela, suggesting Colombia could see military strikes.

""You know, the land is much easier, much easier. And we know the routes they take,"" Mr. Trump said to reporters as he met with his Cabinet at the White House. ""We know everything about them We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon too.""

Later, when asked to elaborate, the president said he was speaking about countries that are manufacturing and selling fentanyl or cocaine. The president said he heard that Colombia is manufacturing cocaine and selling it to the U.S.

Colombia, indeed, is the world's top cocaine producer.

""Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,"" Mr. Trump said. He added a few moments later: ""Not just Venezuela.""

Tuesday's Cabinet meeting came amid calls for investigations and bipartisan concerns in Congress that a follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat may have constituted a war crime.

As tensions continue to escalate between the two countries, Pope Leo XVI on Tuesday called for the U.S. to pursue dialogue and even economic pressure on Venezuela to achieve its goals, rather than threats of military action.

Leo, history's first American pope, told reporters aboard the papal plane returning from Lebanon that the Venezuelan bishops conference and the Vatican Embassy in Caracas were trying to calm the situation and look out for the plight of ordinary Venezuelans.

""The voices coming from the United States change, with a certain frequency at times,"" he said. ""On the one hand, it seems there was telephone conversation between the two presidents, on the other, there's this danger, this possibility of an activity, an operation including invading the territory of Venezuela.""

He stressed that he didn't have further information. ""Again I believe it's better to look for ways of dialogue, perhaps pressure — including economic pressure — but looking for other ways to change, if that's what the United States wants to do.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/02/e9c4f6d2-4ad5-463c-91c1-ba738761d6aa/thumbnail/1200x630/cd79722477184b509a6d04983f14f2f8/gettyimages-2248653392.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 18:58:02.511153

Opponents of the effort argue the law prohibits partisan gerrymandering and that without new census data or a court order, Florida should not be drawing a new map.
“But if individual states want to prohibit partisan gerrymandering, they should do what Florida did and put it into their state constitution.","Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he and Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., would also be meeting with Bradley on Thursday.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized Bradley, commander of Special Operations Command, to order the strikes on Sept. 2 that have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

Lawmakers outside of committee leadership, like Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have expressed interest in hearing from Bradley.

“I’ve heard that there’s an effort to bring him here perhaps next week, but nothing definite as yet, and I would insist that the that the whole committee hear from him, not just some select group of senators,” Blumenthal said today.

""This is what you and the press don't understand,"" Hegseth continued. ""You sit in your air-conditioned offices up on Capitol Hill, and you nitpick and you plant fake stories in The Washington Post.""

The defense secretary added, ""Everybody phrases anonymous sources, not based in anything, not based in any truth at all. And then you want to throw out really irresponsible terms about American heroes, about the judgment that they made.""

Trump did not answer the question about the strikes directly, saying only that his administration's actions against alleged drug boats have saved lives.

""To me, it was an attack,"" Trump said. ""It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes. Somebody asked me a question about the second strike. I didn't know about the second strike.""

Yesterday, the White House confirmed the second strike on the boat in September. That follow-up strike killed survivors of the initial attack, and lawmakers opened inquiries into the situation.

Earlier in his remarks, Hegseth said that for the ""first couple of strikes — as you would, as any leader would want — you want to own that responsibility.""

""So I said, I'm going to be the one to make the call after getting all the information, and make sure it's the right strike,"" Hegseth said. ""That was Sept. 2.""

He added that while he watched the first strike live, he ""didn't stick around for the hour, two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs,"" noting that he moved to his next meeting.

“While that partisan redistricting battle is not illegal in other states, that is illegal in the state of Florida,” said Amy Keith, executive director of Common Cause Florida. “63% of Floridians voted to pass the Fair District Amendment, and that very clearly said Congressional districts in Florida cannot be drawn with the intent to favor a political party or an incumbent.”

Jessica Lowe-Minor, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, pointed to a 2019 Supreme Court ruling, Rucho v. Common Cause, which largely opened the door for states to conduct more aggressive partisan gerrymandering under federal law.

“The U.S. Supreme Court said, well, no, there really isn’t a federal prohibition on gerrymandering,” she said. “But if individual states want to prohibit partisan gerrymandering, they should do what Florida did and put it into their state constitution. So the U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged that Florida’s state constitution prevents partisan gerrymandering, so we expect that the legislature will respect that and the courts will respect that.”

Instead, District Court Judge A. Bruce Jones ordered outside attorneys representing Polis to provide a full response to the lawsuit by next week. He affirmed that a former state employee and a nonprofit law firm both had standing to sue the governor in a challenge of his May decision to turn over sensitive personal information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Scott Moss, who was then a state employee, had alleged that cooperating with ICE would violate state laws, including a new law that Polis signed at nearly the same time he decided to comply with the subpoena.

The judge’s ruling, issued last week on the day before Thanksgiving, is a blow to Polis’ attempt to both end the litigation and give ICE some records about the sponsors of undocumented and unaccompanied children. In June, a few weeks after the lawsuit was filed, Jones had blocked some state employees from complying with the subpoena.

Though he didn’t specifically block Polis from otherwise turning over the records, Jones indicated that doing so in any way would violate state laws that generally prohibit state and local employees from providing personal information to ICE.

After the June ruling, Polis’ attorneys moved to dismiss the case and said they now planned to turn over only some of the records to ICE. They argued that Moss, who left state employment during the summer, no longer had standing to sue and that Towards Justice, a nonprofit law firm that’s also part of the litigation, had no legal eligibility, either.

But Jones ruled otherwise last week and rejected Polis’ motion to dismiss. The governor’s response to the allegations in the suit are due by Dec. 10.

The state hired private attorneys to represent Polis at public expense after the Colorado Attorney General’s Office said it had a conflict because it had earlier provided legal advice to the governor in the matter.

“Governor Polis has spent well over $100,000 in taxpayer money trying to make this case go away so that he can continue collaborating with ICE behind closed doors,” Laura Wolf, the attorney representing Moss in the case, said in a statement Monday. “We are encouraged by the court’s ruling, and we will continue to fight for the rights of every person placed at risk by Governor Polis’s efforts to facilitate immigration enforcement in violation of Colorado law.”

Shelby Wieman, a spokeswoman for Polis, said in a statement that the governor is “committed to protecting Coloradans against human trafficking.”

“While he disagrees with the decision, he respects the opinion regarding standing and cannot comment further on pending litigation,” Wieman wrote Monday.

In its subpoena, ICE said it wanted information on the sponsors of unaccompanied children so it could check on them as part of an alleged criminal investigation. Neither the agency nor Polis’ office has provided any evidence that such an investigation exists, and Jones previously noted that the governor seemingly took no steps to confirm that ICE is legitimately investigating trafficking before he decided to cooperate with the agency. The subpoena references federal law related to immigration enforcement.

Wieman has previously not responded to questions about whether the state is using any of its own resources to check on the children.",https://www.greeleytribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TDP-L-snap102225-cha-408.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-12-02 17:59:10.719818

The report cites an anonymous Trump administration official and documents obtained by the Times.

The plan calls for the deployment of “strike teams” comprising ICE officers and other federal officials. The anonymous official told the Times that roughly 100 officers and agents from around the country have been brought into the operation.

Local elected officials tried to project resolve and support.

“I know many families are fearful tonight, but I want you to know that the city and I stand behind you,” said Minneapolis Council Member Jamal Osman, who represents the largest East African community in the city, during a press conference Tuesday.

The news comes after an increase in anti-Somali rhetoric among right-wing leaders, including President Donald Trump, following the publication of an article claiming — with little evidence — that Somali-American immigrants accused of defrauding Minnesota’s public programs are providing the money to the terrorist group al-Shaabab.

Federal officials have investigated fraud in Minnesota’s public programs for years, and of the dozens of people charged so far, the majority are Somali-American. Terrorism financing has not been among the fraud-related charges.

“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” Trump said during Tuesday’s cabinet meeting.

Data on the immigration statuses of the roughly 90,000 Somali-Americans in Minnesota is not readily available, but the vast majority of Somali people in Minnesota have legal status, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday. Roughly half of Somali-Americans in Minnesota were born in Somalia, according to 2024 Census data.

Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter stood together at Tuesday’s press conference, decrying the president’s comments.

“Mistakes will be made — and let’s be clear — it means that American citizens will be detained for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,” Frey said.

Protestors have squared off with federal officers — and sometimes local police — at raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul this year. Law enforcement officers have used crowd dispersal tactics like pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets and sound cannons.

Both Minneapolis and St. Paul are sanctuary cities, meaning their local police do not question residents’ immigration status or enforce immigration law, which is a federal responsibility. But both police departments have helped immigration authorities control the large crowds of protesters that have convened outside of raids.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Tuesday his officers will protect demonstrators’ First Amendment rights, and that the department is rewriting its immigration enforcement policy based on feedback from community organizations.

“I also ask that if demonstrations do happen around any type of immigration raid, that they remain nonviolent — so that we can keep everyone in our community safe, so that we minimize the risk of any tragedy happening, or the immigrant communities that are already suffering to suffer that much more,” O’Hara said.

On Nov. 21, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was “terminating” Temporary Protected Status for Somali people in Minnesota.

December 2, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the wake of last week’s tragic shooting in Washington, D.C., our hearts are with all those grieving this senseless act of violence, especially the families and loved ones of U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom who was killed and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe who remains in critical condition.

As communities across the country mourn this tragedy, the Arab American community also stands in solidarity with our Afghan, Somali, Sudanese, and other communities from the 19 nations now facing punitive immigration actions under the Trump Administration’s new rollback of immigration protections.

We know this fear too well. After 9/11, Arab, Muslim, African, and South Asian communities faced an initial wave of mass deportations and then were forced to endure NSEERS, a discriminatory registration and surveillance program that profiled entire nationalities for the actions of a few. We remember how quickly grief was weaponized into suspicion, how families were torn apart, and how trust in government was profoundly damaged.

Today, as new policies emerge in response to the D.C. shooting, including mass reviews of green cards, halted immigration processing, and sweeping security measures applied collectively by nationality, we must be clear: the actions of a single individual can never justify the targeting of entire communities. Collective punishment is not safety. It is injustice.

Just as we reject acts of violence, we reject the framing that equates entire nationalities or countries with “threat” and creates fear and suspicion among our neighbors. Security is not achieved with bigotry. What we urge instead is fairness, transparency, due process, and respect for the dignity of all immigrant communities.

As Arab Americans we know firsthand that when one community is targeted, no community is safe. Our fight for justice cannot be selective.

We call on elected leaders, civil society organizations, and all Americans of conscience to stand with our friends and neighbors from Sudan, Somalia, Afghanistan, and beyond. Protect their rights. Uphold their dignity. And let us reaffirm together that this country is strongest when its immigrant communities are valued — not feared.

""After consulting with interagency partners, Secretary (Kristi) Noem concluded that Haiti no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS.

""This decision was based on a review conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, input from relevant U.S. government agencies, and an analysis indicating that allowing Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is inconsistent with U.S. national interests,” said DHS officials.

FAMN officials slammed the decision.

“FANM denounces this [DHS] conclusion as factually indefensible and dangerously detached from the verified conditions on the ground,” said FAMN officials. “Returning people to Haiti under these conditions would place thousands of lives at immediate risk.”

“This is a cruel, unjust, and politically motivated decision,” said FANM Political Director Paul Christian Namphy.

FANM officials argue that TPS holders from Haiti and other countries contribute billions annually to the U.S. economy and pay $5.2 billion each year in federal, payroll, state, and local taxes.

WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 2, 2025 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12) joined Rep. Yvette Clarke (NY-11), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Rep. Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), along with a growing coalition of civil rights advocates, to reintroduce the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Civil Rights Act — comprehensive legislation to prevent companies from using biased and discriminatory AI-powered algorithms to help make critical decisions in Americans’ lives, ensure algorithms are tested before and after deployment, and increase transparency of complex algorithms used for critical decisions.

“I represent neighborhoods that know what it feels like to be overpoliced, underinvested, and overlooked. If artificial intelligence is shaping people’s lives, then we must mitigate the harm it causes. This legislation puts up the necessary guardrails in an age of disinformation and misinformation. I’m grateful to Representatives Yvette Clarke, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley for co-leading this effort and for Senator Ed Markey for his partnership on this bill. We can and should be innovative with our technology, but never at the cost of our civil rights,” said Rep. Lee.

“The AI Civil Rights Act represents a bold new front in our ongoing battle to protect the rights, dignity, and safety of every American. From developers to deployers, this legislation will place strict, strong, and unambiguous guardrails on the creation and use of artificial intelligence. I am deeply grateful to Senator Ed Markey for his steadfast leadership in introducing this critical bill. Together, we are making it very clear that innovation must never come at the expense of civil rights or justice,” said Rep. Clarke.

“As AI innovation grows, it is incumbent on us all to prioritize the safety, rights, and opportunity of all people—especially the Black, brown, and marginalized communities who disproportionately bear the burden of biased and discriminatory systems,” said Rep. Pressley. “We cannot allow AI to be the latest chapter in America’s history of exploiting marginalized people. That is why the AI Civil Rights Act is necessary—to invest in an approach rooted in equity that safeguards all of our civil rights and liberties.”

“This legislation comes at an inflection point for our country. Artificial intelligence has become a part of our everyday lives and grown into a projected $244 billion industry. A major risk of this new technology is the biases and discrimination that are built into algorithms – denying people housing or jobs based on race or gender. Our bill would place critical guardrails to ensure that the technologies of the future do not harden the injustices of the past,” said Rep. Jayapal.

“We must address AI-powered bias and discrimination in the AI age,” said Senator Markey. “Under the AI Civil Rights Act, America would show leadership in AI—not just technological leadership, but moral leadership. We cannot abandon our principles in reckless pursuit of technological superiority. Otherwise, we risk building a future where innovation races ahead, but justice falls behind. I am grateful for Congresswomen Clarke, Pressley, Jayapal, and Lee for their partnership on the AI Civil Rights Act. We will not allow for AI to stand for accelerating injustice.”

“The Lawyers’ Committee is proud to work in partnership with Senator Markey, Representatives Yvette Clarke, Summer Lee, Ayanna Pressley, and Pramila Jayapal as they introduce the AI Civil Rights Act to help ensure that AI systems are fair and equitable, as they become a large part of our daily lives. Most AI tools are built using data that reflects generations of racial discrimination, redlining, and segregation. Algorithms built on information about a troubled past can create new models that replicate these traumas as if they should be the norm for the future. So, increased transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of these technologies are critical steps for combating algorithmic bias. The Lawyers’ Committee has been on the front lines of this issue, litigating in the courts and leading policy debates focused on the impacts and opportunities of emerging technology for Black people and other communities of color. We all deserve technology that works for us, not against us. Adopting appropriate human-centered guardrails is both logical and a critical need. We know that with fierce defenders of civil rights and democracy in Congress like the sponsors and co-sponsors of the AI Civil Rights Act, we can make that ambition a reality,” said Damon Hewitt, President and Executive Director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

“Technologies, including AI systems, are only innovative if they help people. AI should be a tool that works for all of us, no matter where we come from, the color of our skin, our age, or how much money we have. But every day, qualified people are unjustly locked out of jobs, housing, education opportunities, and health care, or are wrongly jailed or imprisoned because of AI systems that discriminate. AI is powerful, so when it discriminates it can supercharge bias,” said Maya Wiley, President and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “The AI Civil Rights Act offers a way forward towards fairness and accountability by helping us see how AI is working, ensuring better accuracy, and holding companies that create and use AI accountable for protecting our rights. We are grateful for Senator Markey and Congresswoman Clarke’s commitment to creating a strong pro-civil rights federal standard that ensures we can all reap the benefits of the AI revolution.”

“With corporations increasingly using AI systems to hire, fire, surveil, and make disciplinary decisions, workers need common-sense civil rights protections. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Civil Rights Act introduced by Senator Markey and Congresswoman Clarke will do just that. It establishes critical guardrails to prevent AI discrimination, requires transparency from corporations around how they use AI, and holds corporations accountable when their AI systems perpetuate bias. This bill will be helpful in the labor movement’s ongoing fight to make sure that AI benefits workers instead of harming their jobs, rights, and freedoms,” said Jody Calemine, Director of Advocacy at the AFL-CIO.

“The AI Civil Rights Act is the bold, innovative policy we need today to ensure a just tomorrow for us all. The premise is simple: the AI tools and systems used at the most critical decision points in our lives – mediating our access to homes, employment, healthcare, and opportunities –should be demonstrated to be accessible and fair before being unleashed on the American public. With this technologically sophisticated bill, anchored in enduring American commitments to freedom, Senator Markey ushers in a new day for civil rights and digital equity,” said Alondra Nelson, Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress.

“AI is shaping access to opportunity across the country. ‘Black box’ systems make decisions about who gets a loan, receives a job offer, or is eligible for parole, often with little understanding of how those decisions are made. The AI Civil Rights Act makes sure that AI systems are transparent and give everyone a fair chance to compete,” said Cody Venzke, Senior Policy Counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.

“Artificial intelligence is fast becoming a part of everyday life, impacting all of our major decisions from housing and employment to education and healthcare. We thank Senators Markey and Booker, and Representative Clarke, for their proactive leadership in safeguarding our civil rights. The AI Civil Rights Act ensures that AI technologies do not reinforce existing inequalities, and instead contribute to a more just and equitable society,” said the National Urban League.

The legislation is co-led in the House by Representatives Summer Lee (PA-12), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Yvette Clarke (NY-11), and Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and led by Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) in the Senate.

The New York Times, which cited documents and an official who spoke anonymously, was first to report the operation in Minneapolis.

The latest federal immigration effort comes as President Donald Trump ended his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday by asserting he does not want Somali immigrants in the United States, referring to them as “garbage” who should “go back to where they came from.”

“I don’t want them in our country,” he said. “Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country.”

The president’s remarks represent an escalation of his attacks against Somalis, particularly in Minneapolis. He has repeatedly signaled out Somalis since last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, even though the alleged shooter is an Afghan who had nothing to do with Somalia.

Minneapolis officials held a news conference about the issue this afternoon.

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the agency does “not discuss future or potential operations.”

In response to the Times’ report, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, called the proposed operation a “PR stunt.”

estimated that removing noncitizens from the census count would shift 12 congressional seats to predominantly Republican states.
Republicans have introduced a handful of bills aimed at limiting the Census to just citizens.","Republicans on the House Oversight Committee advanced a blatantly unconstitutional bill Tuesday to exclude noncitizens from the decennial census counts.

The legislation, introduced by Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.), would require a citizenship question on the census starting in 2030, and then limit apportionment — the divvying of 435 congressional seats across the states and the corresponding allocation in the Electoral College — to just citizens.

If enacted, the proposal would contravene the U.S. Constitution, which calls for apportioning congressional seats according to a “counting the whole number of persons in each State.” That language clearly and deliberately uses “persons” instead of “citizens.”

“The bill attempts to exclude non citizens from being counted when drawing congressional districts, which clearly violates the 14th Amendment,” House Oversight ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said Tuesday. “This [citizenship] question will destroy the accuracy of the census and devastate numerous communities across the country. Non-citizens will avoid answering the census, leading to undercounts across the country.”

Republican backers argued that counting the roughly 21 million non-citizens undermines the voting power of citizens.

“Non-citizens are not evenly distributed among the states and some states end up with greater representation in Congress based on a higher concentration of non-citizens,” said House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) “This dilutes the ‘one-person, one-vote’ principle for citizens in states with fewer non-citizens.”

The committee voted 20-19 down party lines to advance the bill.

Tuesday’s legislation is just the latest in MAGA Republicans’ multipronged campaign to remove non-citizens from the census. In his first administration, President Donald Trump attempted to exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 Census. Opponents immediately sued and the case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which blocked the proposed change on procedural grounds while ducking the underlying question of its legality. The Supreme Court also blocked the Trump Administration’s separate attempt to add a question on citizenship status to the Census.

Trump’s unilateral attempts were ultimately doomed because the Constitution empowers Congress — not the president — with the “actual enumeration” of apportionment. But even if Congress enacted a law excluding non-citizens from the census, the Apportionment Clause of the Constitution would still present a considerable barrier.

On Tuesday, Democrats accused their Republican colleagues of trying to game the electoral system. “We’re here to fight for every single person who lives in our country, to make sure they have fair representation, and to make sure that we are funding our states adequately,” said Rep. Emily Randall (D-Wash.). “We are not here to try and rig elections so that more Republicans win.”

Setting aside the legal and constitutional issues, excluding unlawful immigrants from the Census count on apportionment would likely shift congressional seats to GOP-dominated states, although by how much isn’t clear. The Pew Research Center estimated in 2020 that doing so would have netted Alabama, Ohio, and Minnesota each an additional House seat while California, Texas, and Florida would have each lost one seat. At a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) estimated that removing noncitizens from the census count would shift 12 congressional seats to predominantly Republican states.

The GOP’s preoccupation with a citizens-only census comes amid Trump’s wider efforts to stem a crushing defeat in the 2026 midterms as his polling figures continue to plummet to record lows through every administrative ploy available, no matter how dubious. He’s repeatedly called for holding an additional, mid-decade census excluding non-citizens, even though federal law prohibits such a count from being used in apportionment. Over the summer, Trump launched a mid-decade redistricting war, saying Republicans were “entitled” to five extra seats in Texas, which has now spread across the nation.

Republicans have introduced a handful of bills aimed at limiting the Census to just citizens. The House passed a similar bill last year that then stalled in the Senate.

Shortly before Trump took office this year, a handful of Republican-led states sued the Commerce Department for including noncitizens in the Census. That case has been paused since the new administration began.

The longstanding suffrage slogan of “one person, one vote” was first articulated into constitutional law by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1963, which held that, along with the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection clause, the “conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing — one person, one vote.”",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3181-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-02 15:58:04.993743

The operation could begin in the coming days and is expected to zero in on people in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area who have final orders of deportation, the person said. Teams of immigration agents would spread across the Twin Cities in what the person described as a directed, high-priority sweep, though the plans remain fluid and subject to change.

The prospect of an immigration operation centered on Somali migrants is likely to deepen tensions in Minnesota as Trump has become increasingly focused on people of Somalian descent living in the U.S., saying recently that they “have caused a lot of trouble,” rhetoric that community leaders say has inflamed tensions and revived fears of profiling.

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

Hundreds of people are expected to be targeted in the operation, the person said. As with previous immigration operations, so-called incidental arrests are possible, meaning people who aren’t targeted but lack legal status could also be detained if encountered during the sweep, the person said.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations that have not been publicly disclosed. The operation was first reported by The New York Times.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency would not discuss “future or potential operations.”

“Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country. What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally,” McLaughlin said.

Trump and other officials in his administration have used increasingly harsh language in recent days against Somalis living in the U.S., after a conservative news outlet, City Journal, claimed that taxpayer dollars from defrauded government programs have flowed to the Somali group al-Shabab.

Last month, Trump said he was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Somali migrants living in Minnesota, a legal safeguard against deportation for immigrants from certain countries. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Responding to news reports about the potential enforcement activities, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in a post on X, “We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime. But pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.”

Trump has claimed immigrants from Somalia were “completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota” and has demeaned Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a social media post Monday that his agency was “investigating allegations that under the feckless mismanagement of the Biden Administration and Governor Tim Walz, hardworking Minnesotans’ tax dollars may have been diverted to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab.”

Jaylani Hussein, a Somali American who is executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group has heard of “less than a dozen” immigration arrests within the local Somali community in recent days.

But Hussein said around 95% of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, so the numbers of those at earlier stages of the immigration process are a “pretty small” proportion of the community. He said they estimate that 50% of the community was born in the U.S.

“We believe this is political rhetoric and an attack against our community,” Hussein said. “But additional ICE agents means additional pressure on the wider immigrant community,” he said, referring to Hispanics and other Africans.

Hussein said the reported crackdown plan is yet another example of the Trump administration “demonizing the Muslim community.” And he said it’s not new that when somebody in the community commits a crime, the entire community will get accused. He said that’s been true of other ethnic groups through American history.

The complaint, filed on Friday in the U.S. Court of International Trade, argues that Mr. Trump misused a 1977 law in his move to implement tariffs on products from more than 100 countries.

The lawsuit asserts that Congress, not the president, has the authority to set tariffs, and that Mr. Trump exceeded the authority granted to him by the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.

“The text of IEEPA does not use the word ‘tariff’ or any term of equivalent meaning,” Costco states in the lawsuit, which was reported earlier by NBC News. The act allows the president to regulate or prohibit foreign transactions during a national emergency, but does not authorize the imposition of tariffs, according to the lawsuit.

Kush Desai, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement that the “economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter.”

It has said in the past that its use of the IEEPA is lawful because the law gives the president the authority to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property to deal with emergencies.

The challenge by Costco, the largest warehouse club chain in the United States, echoes arguments that a number of small businesses have already made before the Supreme Court in lawsuits against Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

Costco argues that the Trump administration’s implementation of them has created chaos. The tariffs have been “threatened, modified, suspended, and reimposed, with the markets gyrating in response,” the lawsuit says. The lawsuit does not disclose how much Costco has paid in tariffs.

Importers like V.O.S. Selections, a wine and spirits company, and Learning Resources, Inc., an educational toymaker, have already secured major rulings against the administration in lower federal courts. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments last month and is expected to rule on the legality of the tariffs in the near future.

Mr. Trump argues that tariffs have helped bring the government “hundreds of billions of dollars,” and the administration has warned of a severe economic impact should businesses be allowed to seek refunds if the government loses the Supreme Court case.

If the administration loses the Supreme Court case, there are other ways to tax imports. Multiple trade authorities exist that would allow the president to impose tariffs that are not subject to the IEEPA, and some of those provisions are already in use.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/02/multimedia/02trump-news-costco-01-gfjt/02trump-news-costco-01-gfjt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:59:21.328838

,Litigation,2025-12-02 18:31:35+00:00,Los Angeles Times,These federal judges are building a legal wall against Trump's assault on transgender rights,"Michael Hiltzik, www.latimes.com, michael-hiltzik",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-02/federal-judges-bring-trumps-assault-on-transgender-rights-to-a-screeching-halt,"President Trump wasted no time before turning the right wing’s cherished assault on transgender rights into government policy.
These cases raise questions about the professionalism of Trump’s DOJ that have been raised by other federal courts on other topics.
As I’ve written, the Trumpian hand-wringing over the “mutilation” of children via gender-affirming therapy or surgery melds medical ignorance with fantasy.
“Congress never authorized a roving mandate to regulate and alter state-licensed medical care,” he wrote.
Whitehead concluded that the subpoena — compounded by Bondi’s news release — was aimed “not to investigate legal violations but to intimidate and coerce providers into abandoning lawful medical care.” (Emphasis his.)","President Trump wasted no time before turning the right wing’s cherished assault on transgender rights into government policy.

On the very day of his inauguration, he issued an executive order titled, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”

The order purported to “recognize two sexes, male and female,” as federal policy. “These sexes are not changeable,” it stated. It labeled “gender ideology” and “gender identity” as a “false claim.”

The order directed federal agencies to “remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.”

About a week later, Trump posted an order banning federal spending on gender-affirming therapies for children, which he defined as “mutilation” based on “junk science.”

Under Atty Gen. Pam Bondi, Trump’s Justice Department took action. On July 9, Bondi boasted of having sent “more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in performing transgender medical procedures on children.”

In her news release, Bondi said the subpoenas targeted “medical professionals and organizations that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology.”

That’s when Trump’s campaign ran into a judicial brick wall. In recent weeks at least three federal judges blocked some of these subpoenas as flagrantly illicit overreach.

At least two questioned the DOJ’s actions in these cases, with one warning that a federal official’s inaccurate declaration could be interpreted as perjury. Another implied that a DOJ filing in his courtroom might have reflected “deliberate misuse ... of court procedure.” (I am indebted to Chris Geidner of Lawdork.com for pulling these facts together.)

These cases raise questions about the professionalism of Trump’s DOJ that have been raised by other federal courts on other topics. Those include the invalidation of the appointments of three U.S. Attorneys put in place to pursue criminal charges against Trump’s political enemies, and the rejection by grand juries of indictments proposed by Trump-appointed prosecutors.

“The Department has defeated many of these lawsuits all the way up to the Supreme Court and will continue to defend the President’s agenda with the utmost professionalism,” a DOJ spokeswoman told me by email.

The transgender cases may have a more personal effect on millions of struggling youths and families. As I’ve written, the Trumpian hand-wringing over the “mutilation” of children via gender-affirming therapy or surgery melds medical ignorance with fantasy.

Therapies such as puberty blockers or hormone treatments typically are administered to minors only after painstaking medical consultations, and actual surgeries aren’t commonly performed on minors by reputable medical providers.

Trump made an assault on transgender treatments a plank in his campaign platform, spinning a weird claim that schools had been subjecting innocent children to secret operations. “The school decides what’s gonna happen with your child,” he said. “And you know, many of these childs [sic] 15 years later say, ‘What the hell happened? Who did this to me?’” None of that happens in the real world.

After the Supreme Court invalidated bans on same-sex marriage in 2015, Republican strategists found “the struggle over trans rights” to be “an especially potent wedge issue,” observes political scientist Paisley Currah, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Brooklyn College, in a new report in the New York Review of Books.

Their target, Currah writes, is “a very small proportion of the population (roughly 2.8 million people above the age of thirteen), not well understood by most Americans, living in ways that confounded common assumptions about sex.”

For the most part, this war has unfolded at the state level. North Carolina passed its notorious “bathroom bill,” requiring residents to use only the bathrooms designated for the sex on their birth certificates, in 2016. The measure drew widespread threats of boycotts by sports leagues and corporations, prompting its repeal the following year.

Legislators soon found an approach more tolerable for the public: banning transgender women from participating in women’s sports. In 2015 there were 21 antitrans bills introduced in state legislatures; in 2025 there were more than 1,000.

In June the Supreme Court’s six-member conservative majority appeared to bless this approach by turning away a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans puberty blockers and hormones for trans youth, even when parents and physicians prescribe them. With this ruling, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a ringing dissent, “the Court abandons transgender patients and their families to political whims.”

She might have added that Trump’s intimidation works. Medical providers coast-to-coast, including Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., and Kaiser Permanente, ended gender-affirming care for minors to avoid legal hassles; some institutions even ended such care for adults, although that care isn’t targeted by the government.

None of that means that there aren’t guardrails on the federal antitrans campaign, which brings us back to the judges placing a collar on the DOJ.

In the most recent ruling issued Nov. 21, federal Judge Mark Kearney of Philadelphia took aim at subpoenas Bondi served on Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Purporting to be investigating the mislabeling and misuse of puberty blockers and hormones, the DOJ demanded the hospital’s “billing and insurance records, communications with manufacturers and sales representatives, and the names and complete medical and psychological records of children receiving gender-affirming care,” Kearney wrote.

The hospital acceded to most of this request, but did not provide the identities of its child patients and their families and their confidential medical files.

Kearney quashed those subpoenas, ruling that the privacy rights of the children and their families “substantially outweighs” the DOJ’s “need to know the children’s names, addresses, and treatment.”

Kearney noted that federal law left questions about medical care entirely to the states; policy disagreements such as those pitting the DOJ against the hospital are not federal crimes. “Congress never authorized a roving mandate to regulate and alter state-licensed medical care,” he wrote.

He also focused on a declaration filed in court on Oct. 6 by DOJ official Lisa K. Hsiao, stating that “the government is aware of a lawsuit filed just this year” with “allegations of a minor being put on puberty blockers after his first visit and cross-sex hormones after his second with no meaningful assessment.”

As it happens, there is no such lawsuit. The day after Hsaio’s declaration was filed “under penalty of perjury,” Kearney observed, it was withdrawn and replaced with one that removed the reference to a lawsuit and substituted the claim that the government was aware only of “concerning allegations” about the treatment.

The hospital said in court that it hadn’t been served with any such lawsuit. Kearney questioned “the veracity of Director Hsiao’s sworn statements” and noted that DOJ lawyers agreed with him that “false statements may be subject to a perjury investigation.”

Kearney’s ruling followed one issued Sept. 9 by federal Judge Myong Joun of Boston. Joun quashed the entire subpoena issued to Boston Children’s Hospital seeking extensive information about its personnel and medical records of patients, including their Social Security numbers and home addresses.

“It is abundantly clear,” he wrote, that the administration’s “true purpose” is to interfere with the state’s right to authorize gender-affirming care, “to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.”

In the third case, federal Judge Jamal Whitehead of Seattle on Oct. 27 threw out a subpoena the government served on QueerDoc, a telehealth provider serving patients in the West. The subpoena demanded complete personnel files for all QueerDoc employees and all private information about patients for whom it prescribed puberty blockers or hormones.

Whitehead concluded that the subpoena — compounded by Bondi’s news release — was aimed “not to investigate legal violations but to intimidate and coerce providers into abandoning lawful medical care.” (Emphasis his.)

Whitehead also found that a legal filing in which the DOJ cited legal gounds for the subpoena “represents a fundamental misunderstanding — or deliberate misuse — of court procedure”: Filings of its kind generally were used to correct minor clerical errors in a previously filed document, he noted, not for making new legal arguments after the deadline. In this case the filing underscored that the government was targeting “the provision of gender-affirming care itself, not any legitimate federal violation.”

The government appealed the Joun and Whitehead rulings though not, as yet, Kearney’s action.

Vogel",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/02/us/trump-ukraine-putin-news,"When asked by a reporter on Thursday what Somalis had to do with the accused Afghan shooter in Washington, Mr. Trump said, “Ah, nothing.
But Somalis have caused a lot of trouble.” Since his first term, Mr. Trump has attacked Somalis in derogatory, xenophobic terms.
A White House official said Mr. Trump had not seen the letter before his announcement on Friday about the pardon.
The description was reminiscent of how Mr. Trump often refers to the four separate criminal cases against him.
Mr. Stone received a pardon from Mr. Trump in the final full day of the president’s first term.","The directive for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., came immediately after Mr. Trump’s remarks. The effort, which is beginning this week, focuses largely on Somalis with final deportation orders who are living in the Twin Cities, though the official said that others who are still seeking legal status could be swept up as well. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing operation.

The plan calls for the deployment of so-called strike teams, which are made up of ICE officers, agents and other federal officials. Roughly 100 officers and agents from around the country have been brought in for the operation, the official said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said in a statement that the agency does not discuss “future or potential operations.”

“What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally,” she added.

The targeting of Somali migrants is the latest piece of Mr. Trump’s intensifying immigration crackdown across the country, one that the administration is expanding to block legal pathways for many migrants in the wake of the National Guard shooting.

At the White House, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff, has ramped up pressure to increase arrests in recent months. The targeting of migrants in the Twin Cities comes after similar efforts in other metropolitan areas across the country.

In recent months, federal officials have launched immigration operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Charlotte, N.C., setting off protests about what critics say are overly aggressive tactics and mistreatment by agents. D.H.S. has said that operations identify immigrants who are in the country illegally and that the enforcement actions are necessary to follow through on Mr. Trump’s promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants.

The surge of federal agents to cities has also served another purpose: to scare migrants in the hopes that they will leave the country voluntarily.

While there have not yet been images of large-scale arrests in the Minneapolis area, immigration operations often vary in scale and residents in the city have been on edge amid Mr. Trump’s increasingly dark rhetoric.

In recent days, the president has moved to end temporary legal protections for Somalis. Many of them have had the protections for decades under a program for migrants from countries in crisis.

Minnesota is home to the largest diaspora of Somalis in the world, a community whose members began migrating to the state in large numbers as the East African nation descended into civil war in the mid-1990s. Immigrant activists and local officials say that the vast majority of Minnesotans with Somali roots are American citizens or legal permanent residents.

Nationally, about 73 percent of Somali immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens, according to the Census Bureau.

When asked by a reporter on Thursday what Somalis had to do with the accused Afghan shooter in Washington, Mr. Trump said, “Ah, nothing. But Somalis have caused a lot of trouble.”

Since his first term, Mr. Trump has attacked Somalis in derogatory, xenophobic terms.

In a social media post on Thursday night, Mr. Trump claimed that Somalis were “taking over” Minnesota and that Somali gangs were “roving the streets looking for ‘prey.’” He accused Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who came to the United States from Somalia as a refugee and became a citizen 25 years ago, as someone who “probably came into the U.S.A. illegally.” Mr. Trump said she was “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab.”

In a statement, Jacklyn Rogers, a spokeswoman for Ms. Omar, said, “The congresswoman thinks his obsession with her is unhealthy and hopes he gets help.”

The president also said that Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was “seriously retarded” for welcoming immigrants from Somalia.

In a response posted on social media, Mr. Walz said: “Donald Trump is focused on pitting people against each other. The center of his agenda is cruelty — not lowering prices or making life better for Americans.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Somalis in Minneapolis had ripped off American taxpayers, citing a New York Times report on an investigation into fraud that had taken place in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali diaspora. But just a small group of people were actually convicted of fraud. Somali Americans in the state say such broad accusations have unfairly pilloried an entire community.

Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the two largest cities in the state, have policies that bar local law enforcement officials and other municipal employees from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. But high-profile federal operations earlier this year have tested the limits of those policies.

In June, federal law enforcement agents, including immigration officials, carried out an operation in a commercial district close to downtown Minneapolis, which led to scuffles with dozens of protesters. The Minneapolis Police Department joined federal agents at the scene in an effort to de-escalate the situation, which angered some local officials and residents.

Federal officials later said the operation involved a narcotics investigation.

More recently, scores of protesters clashed with law enforcement officials during two immigration enforcement operations in Saint Paul. One, in mid-November, resulted in the arrest of 14 people at a paper distribution company.

Ernesto Londoño in St. Paul, Minn., contributed reporting.

Roger J. Stone Jr., Mr. Trump’s longtime on-and-off political adviser, said on his radio show that he had sent the letter, which was dated Oct. 28, to Mr. Trump hours before the president announced his plan to pardon Mr. Hernández. When asked whether he had been compensated for his role, Mr. Stone said he was not.

A White House official said Mr. Trump had not seen the letter before his announcement on Friday about the pardon. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying the administration by matter of routine did not discuss pardons on the record.

Mr. Trump discussed the planned pardon with reporters over the weekend in terms similar to those Mr. Hernández had used in his letter, saying that “the people of Honduras really thought he was set up, and it was a terrible thing.”

“He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country,” Mr. Trump said. “And they said it was a Biden administration setup. And I looked at the facts, and I agreed with them.”

Read Former Honduran President’s Letter to Trump

The New York Times has obtained the four-page letter that former President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras sent President Trump.

Read Document 4 pages

Mr. Hernández’s lawyer said on Tuesday that his client had been released from a federal prison in West Virginia. The White House confirmed the pardon had been issued.

The pardon had caused an uproar before it was carried out, given the serious narcotics crimes of which Mr. Hernández was convicted and Mr. Trump’s stated ambition of curbing the flow of drugs into the United States, and, in particular, his monthslong push against Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader.

The Trump administration has engaged in a highly controversial and potentially illegal practice of bombing boats in the waters around Venezuela that officials insist are piloted by drug traffickers bringing their wares into the United States. In fact, a separate social media post from the one that promised a pardon for Mr. Hernández argued, shortly before elections in Honduras, that the next president should not give Mr. Maduro greater regional control.

Mr. Hernández’s letter contained all the ingredients that, over time, foreign leaders, lobbyists and others who interact with Mr. Trump have found effective: flattery, a sense of shared persecution and an appeal to Mr. Trump’s perception of himself as the final arbiter of justice.

Addressing Mr. Trump as “your Excellency,” Mr. Hernández, who last year was sentenced to 45 years in prison for flooding the United States with cocaine, wrote, “I have found strength from you, Sir.”

“Your resilience to get back in that great office notwithstanding the persecution and prosecution you faced, all for what, because you wished to make your country Great Again,” Mr. Hernández wrote. “What you accomplished is unprecedented and truly historic.”

Mr. Hernández was convicted last year, but the investigation that led to his imprisonment began years earlier, before Mr. Trump was elected the first time. Investigators with the Drug Enforcement Administration and Manhattan federal prosecutors worked their way up a chain of cooperators involved in what they said — and multiple juries agreed — was a conspiracy to traffic enormous amounts of cocaine through Honduras and into the United States.

In his letter, though, Mr. Hernández characterized the case as a fly-by-night affair run by unscrupulous prosecutors in an office Mr. Trump has long resented — the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York — and directed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President Kamala Harris. The description was reminiscent of how Mr. Trump often refers to the four separate criminal cases against him.

“The politicization and selective application of justice in my case is undeniable,” Mr. Hernández wrote in his letter, adding, “I was prosecuted without solid evidence, based on the testimonies of violent traffickers and professional liars motivated by revenge and by get-out-of-jail deals.”

He also worked to remind Mr. Trump of their personal relationship, reminiscing about remarks Mr. Trump had made at the 2018 Israeli American Council National Summit, in which he had spoken about halting the flow of drug trafficking at the Southern border.

“We’re winning after years and years of losing,” Mr. Trump said then. “We’re stopping drugs at a level that has never happened.”

Mr. Hernández, reflecting on the remarks from prison, informed the president that “those words meant a great deal to me, my family and the Honduran people.”

The pardon of Mr. Hernández is a stark contrast to his administration’s treatment of his co-conspirator, who has been credited with helping to secure the former Honduran president’s conviction.

The co-conspirator, Amilcar Alexander Ardon Soriano, testified at Mr. Hernández’s trial that he had served as the mayor of the municipality of El Paraíso while running drugs, participated in torture and murdered two people, and that he was responsible for the deaths of more than 50 others.

Mr. Ardon said he had asked lawmakers whom he had bribed to vote for Mr. Hernández as the president of the Honduran Congress. In return, Mr. Ardon said, Mr. Hernández promised to protect him from prosecutors.

Mr. Ardon was sentenced in January to time served. But he was immediately taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. His lawyer, Jeffrey Cohn, petitioned ICE and the Justice Department to defer Mr. Ardon’s deportation, arguing that his life would be at risk if he were sent to Honduras.

“Typically, a cooperator like that will be protected from deportation because the threats of violence and reprisal against him for that kind of cooperation are self-evident,” Mr. Cohn said in an interview on Monday.

Mr. Ardon was deported in April. He was immediately taken into custody by the Honduran authorities, charged with crimes related to the accusations brought in the United States. He is in prison in Honduras awaiting trial.

“If I were Alex, and I were sitting in a Honduran jail, the last thing I would want to hear is Juan Orlando is coming home when I was the one who put him in jail for 45 years,” Mr. Cohn said.

Mr. Trump issued more than 200 pardons and commutations in his first term, most of them at the very end of his term. Mr. Biden far eclipsed that number, and Mr. Trump is on pace for a similar statistic. So far, he has issued more than 2,000 pardons and commutations, most of them to people arrested in connection with the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.

Mr. Stone received a pardon from Mr. Trump in the final full day of the president’s first term. Mr. Stone was among a small group of people who had been charged and convicted with crimes in connection to the special counsel’s investigation into possible ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Stone maintained his innocence, and Mr. Tump and his allies have viewed that investigation as illegitimate for nearly a decade.

The lawsuit asserts that Congress, not the president, has the authority to set tariffs, and that Mr. Trump exceeded the authority granted to him by the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.

“The text of IEEPA does not use the word ‘tariff’ or any term of equivalent meaning,” Costco states in the lawsuit, which was reported earlier by NBC News. The act allows the president to regulate or prohibit foreign transactions during a national emergency, but does not authorize the imposition of tariffs, according to the lawsuit.

Kush Desai, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement that the “economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter.”

It has said in the past that its use of the IEEPA is lawful because the law gives the president the authority to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property to deal with emergencies.

The challenge by Costco, the largest warehouse club chain in the United States, echoes arguments that a number of small businesses have already made before the Supreme Court in lawsuits against Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

Costco argues that the Trump administration’s implementation of them has created chaos. The tariffs have been “threatened, modified, suspended, and reimposed, with the markets gyrating in response,” the lawsuit says. The lawsuit does not disclose how much Costco has paid in tariffs.

Importers like V.O.S. Selections, a wine and spirits company, and Learning Resources, Inc., an educational toymaker, have already secured major rulings against the administration in lower federal courts. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments last month and is expected to rule on the legality of the tariffs in the near future.

Mr. Trump argues that tariffs have helped bring the government “hundreds of billions of dollars,” and the administration has warned of a severe economic impact should businesses be allowed to seek refunds if the government loses the Supreme Court case.

If the administration loses the Supreme Court case, there are other ways to tax imports. Multiple trade authorities exist that would allow the president to impose tariffs that are not subject to the IEEPA, and some of those provisions are already in use.

“Looks like Honduras is trying to change the results of their Presidential Election,” he wrote online on Monday night. “If they do, there will be hell to pay!”

His evidence? He said Honduran election officials had “abruptly stopped counting” at midnight the night before.

In reality, Honduras’s election agency had updated the results at about noon local time on Monday, roughly nine hours before Mr. Trump’s post. And the delay since then was expected.

That is because Honduras employs an electoral system that reports a first tranche of votes — transmitted from polling stations digitally — as preliminary results. Workers then verify all vote tallies by hand, and there is often a delay in between. It is difficult to send all tallies digitally because internet connections can be sparse and unstable in some parts of the country.

The preliminary results on Monday showed a virtual tie in the race. With 57 percent of ballots reported, two right-wing candidates, Nasry Asfura and Salvador Nasralla, each had 40 percent of the vote. Just 515 ballots separated them.

Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Asfura in the days ahead of the vote, warning Hondurans that the United States would “not be throwing good money after bad” at the country if his preferred candidate did not win. He called Mr. Nasralla a “borderline Communist.” And he also said he would pardon a former Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been convicted of helping smuggle cocaine into the United States.

Mr. Trump’s post on Monday was another extraordinary intervention in the Honduran election, as he stoked controversy, without evidence, just as election officials were calling on citizens to remain patient and peaceful.

Analysts and officials in Honduras and abroad had expressed concerns ahead of the vote that the election could be contested, because the candidates had repeatedly accused one another of plans to rig the results. Many of those accusations had targeted the left-wing governing party, whose candidate trailed by a wide margin in the preliminary results on Monday.

That fueled worries that Honduras could see a repeat of the unrest that followed the 2017 election, when a similar delay in the vote count sparked disputed results and destructive protests.

Yet on Monday, international election observers said that the election had few issues and that they would continue to monitor the count. Even with the razor-thin margin in the race, the nation was calm, and some businesses began to remove the plywood they had installed in windows in case of protests.

Ana Paola Hall, a top Honduran election official, said Monday afternoon that the National Electoral Council, or CNE, had finished reporting the digitally transmitted first tranche of votes from around the country.

She explained that officials were turning their attention to hand-counting remaining tallies, and then going back to verify all the results.

“In the face of this technical tie, we must remain calm, have patience, and wait for the CNE to finish counting,” Ms. Hall wrote online. She lauded the nation for its peaceful response.

On Monday night at a CNE office in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, election workers and military personnel unloaded sealed boxes from trucks as a man with a megaphone called out their respective numbers. The boxes were taped shut and labeled with the slogan “building democracy.”

A man who showed identification as an election official said that the vote count was on schedule and that workers had started counting the physical tallies at 10 p.m. local time, about an hour after Mr. Trump’s post.

“It is imperative that the Commission finish counting the Votes,” Mr. Trump said in his post. “Democracy must prevail!”

During the meeting on Tuesday at the Kremlin, Mr. Witkoff was expected to discuss with Mr. Putin a U.S.-backed peace proposal that was revised by American officials after recent negotiations with Ukrainian diplomats. The initial version of the U.S. plan that emerged last month was seen by Ukraine and its European allies as echoing the maximalist demands Russia has made since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Russian media showed footage of Mr. Putin beginning his meeting with Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner at a large white table in the Kremlin. Joining Mr. Putin were Yuri Ushakov, the top Kremlin foreign policy aide, and Kirill Dmitriev, Mr. Putin’s special envoy and head of the Russia Direct Investment Fund. They began by exchanging pleasantries, with Mr. Witkoff saying he had a beautiful walk around Moscow before the meeting.

Mr. Witkoff’s visit to Moscow, his sixth since January, is taking place two days after American and Ukrainian delegations met in Miami to continue negotiations over the potential peace plan. Both sides called those talks constructive but said more work was needed, without detailing the unresolved issues.

Ahead of the meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Putin said that Russia would continue to advance against Ukraine on the battlefield and portrayed the Kyiv leadership as weakened.

He said that Russian forces would expand strikes on Ukrainian ports and ships in response to attacks on Russia’s “shadow fleet” — the decrepit ships the country uses to transport oil and evade sanctions. Mr. Putin has also been casting Ukraine’s leadership as out of touch with the reality on the front.

“Ukraine’s leadership is currently preoccupied with other matters than the situation in the war zone. It’s as if they live on another planet,” Mr. Putin said on Tuesday, referring to a corruption scandal that has been roiling the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. “And then, constantly on the move begging for money, they have no time for current affairs, either in the economy or at the front.”

In a visit to the battlefield on Sunday and in remarks ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, Mr. Putin highlighted Russia’s claims to have captured Pokrovsk, a strategic city in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv has denied that Moscow has full control of the territory.

The battlefield map maintained by DeepState, a Ukrainian group with ties to the military, showed that the Russians have taken most of the center of Pokrovsk. But Ukrainian military units said in public posts on Tuesday that the fight was still ongoing.

Andriy Kovalenko, a senior Ukrainian government official focused on Russian disinformation operations, said on Monday in a post on Telegram that the Russian military was lying about fully capturing certain cities where fighting remained fierce in an attempt to shape the opinions of Western negotiators.

“The Russians will make many attempts to exert pressure on the front in the coming weeks and will accompany this with loud statements,” Mr. Kovalenko said. “All this is done exclusively for the Western audience and to raise the stakes in diplomacy.”

He added, “The fighting for Pokrovsk continues.”

Mr. Putin also condemned European countries that have balked at the Trump administration’s Russia-tilted peace plans as being “on the side of war.” Mr. Putin said that he was engaging with the U.S. envoys because Europe’s actions “are aimed at only one thing: to completely block this peace process.”

He threatened Ukraine’s European allies, which have been scrambling to shore up their defenses against the Russian threat.

“We are not planning to fight with Europe, but if Europe suddenly starts a war with us, we are ready right now,” he said. He suggested that Russia would be willing to use even greater violence in such a conflict than it has in Ukraine, a likely reference to Moscow’s nuclear arsenal, the largest in the world.

Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told journalists earlier on Tuesday that negotiations with Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner would go on “as long as necessary.” Mr. Kushner does not have a formal role in the Trump administration, but played a role in brokering the cease-fire in Gaza.

Mr. Zelensky, seeking support from European allies, met in Paris on Monday with President Emmanuel Macron of France. The Ukrainian leader then traveled to Ireland for meetings on Tuesday.

Mr. Zelensky said he would wait for an update from the American negotiators after the talks at the Kremlin and would possibly meet with them on Wednesday for an update.

The Ukrainian leader warned in a statement on X that any deal needed to ensure that Russia would not attack Ukraine again after its invasions in 2014 and 2022. Mr. Putin has demanded limits on Ukraine’s military, meaning that Russia would be free to build up its force after the signing of a peace deal, while Ukraine would face restrictions.

“We must end this war in a way that prevents Russia from coming back a year later with a third invasion,” Mr. Zelensky wrote. “They did not achieve their goal of occupying our country. But I am not sure their objectives have changed.” The Ukrainian leader has identified Western security guarantees as among the three biggest issues yet to be resolved in negotiations with the United States.

The White House has strongly pressured Ukraine to agree to a peace plan, with Mr. Trump initially giving Kyiv until Thanksgiving to make a decision. That deadline lapsed as negotiations continued, with Kyiv and its European allies trying to soften the U.S. plan.

Russia has set a series of conditions for halting the war. It has said, among other things, that Ukraine must cede its remaining territory in the Donbas region, drop its aspirations to join NATO and secure the status of the Russian language and the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. Ukraine has refused to accept Russia’s demands.

Ilya Grashchenkov, a political analyst in Moscow, said that expectations were low for a breakthrough from Mr. Witkoff’s visit, but that the meeting was still significant.

“The main expectations likely boil down to maintaining a high-level communication channel during this crisis period,” he said. “This in itself is considered important for avoiding dangerous escalation.”

Mr. Grashchenkov said that with Russian growth approaching zero and the budgetary deficit widening because of soaring military expenditures, economic strain might compel the Kremlin to agree to certain compromises in the future. But, so far, Russia’s government has managed to paper over the economic cracks, he said.

Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said in a post on Telegram, a messaging app, that Mr. Putin had “no doubt that as Ukraine loses more territory, the number of those in the West who call for a cessation of hostilities will grow.”

In November, Russian forces almost doubled the battlefield gains they made in September, according to DeepState, which uses geolocated combat footage and tips from Ukrainian Army sources to monitor battlefield developments. While still relatively small, the Russian advances highlighted the increasing strain on Ukraine’s military.

Mr. Trump, the oldest president ever sworn into his office, had M.R.I. scans in October as part of a semiannual physical exam. His annual physical was done in April.

On Sunday, during an appearance on “Meet the Press” on NBC News, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota called on the president to release the results after Mr. Trump had impugned Mr. Walz’s intelligence. Asked by a reporter on Sunday what part of his body was scanned, Mr. Trump said aboard Air Force One, “I have no idea — it was just an M.R.I.” He then said it was not a scan of his brain.

But Dr. Barbabella’s memo did not specify that Mr. Trump had a M.R.I. scan, which uses a magnetic field to produce images of soft tissues that do not show up on X-rays. Instead, the memo describes “advanced imaging” that it said was carried out “because men in his age group benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health.”

The imaging was part of Mr. Trump’s “comprehensive executive physical,” Dr. Barbabella explained, referring to a detailed medical exam often offered to executives. Such exams can include tests that are not normally done when people have no symptoms of disease.

The memo said Mr. Trump’s cardiovascular imaging is “perfectly normal” with no signs that his arteries are narrowed. His “cardiovascular system shows excellent health,” the statement said.

It added that, “his abdominal imaging is also perfectly normal,” and said, “this level of detailed assessment is standard for an executive physical at President Trump’s age and confirms that he remains in excellent overall health.”

Dr. Ron Blankstein, a preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said imaging could have been part of a routine checkup, though it is not recommended for people with no symptoms of heart disease.

In April, Dr. Barbabella said that Mr. Trump takes two medications to lower his cholesterol level.

Dr. Blankstein also highlighted the phrase “no evidence of arterial narrowing limiting blood flow.” It suggests, he said, that the president underwent a stress test, which could mean a doctor suspected or wanted to rule out heart disease. Most standard M.R.I. exams, he said, do not show the coronary arteries.

But there is a specialized M.R.I. scan, known as a cardiac stress exam, in which patients are given a medication that increases blood flow to the heart and then asked to lie in an M.R.I. machine for a scan. If the results are abnormal, that can indicate one or more coronary arteries is narrowed. But, Dr. Blankstein said, “a normal stress test, while reassuring that there is no critical flow limiting disease, does not rule out the possibility of coronary artery disease.”

“Stress tests are often not required in individuals who do not have symptoms” or cardiac disease, he added.

Dr. Jeffrey A. Linder, chief of general internal medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, said he found the White House statement confusing.

“There is nothing standard about an executive physical,” he said. No standards exist and what tests are included can vary widely.

And, he added, “there is no medical specialty that recommends that an otherwise asymptomatic individual get imaging.”

“There is a reason we don’t test everybody for everything all the time,” Dr. Linder said. The chance is much greater, he said, that the test would falsely point to an issue that would lead to rounds of extra testing to no avail. Instead of finding a problem, it could lead to useless treatments.

“There are real harms,” Dr. Linder said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/02/multimedia/02trump-news-promo-130pm-kmfz/02trump-news-promo-130pm-kmfz-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 13:57:19.784305

“This is retaliation in plain sight.

Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the two largest cities in the state, have policies that bar local law enforcement officials and other municipal employees from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.
More recently, scores of protesters clashed with law enforcement officials during two immigration enforcement operations in Saint Paul.","The Trump administration is launching an intensive immigration enforcement operation primarily targeting hundreds of undocumented Somali immigrants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region, according to an official with knowledge of the operation and documents obtained by The New York Times.

The move comes as President Trump has fixated on Somalis living in the United States, using increasingly inflammatory language to attack them. He stepped up his rhetoric in the wake of last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, even though the man suspected in the attack is an Afghan national.

The directive for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., came immediately after Mr. Trump’s remarks. The effort, which is beginning this week, focuses largely on Somalis with final deportation orders who are living in the Twin Cities, though the official said that others who are still seeking legal status could be swept up as well. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing operation.

The plan calls for the deployment of so-called strike teams, which are made up of ICE officers, agents and other federal officials. Roughly 100 officers and agents from around the country have been brought in for the operation, the official said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said in a statement that the agency does not discuss “future or potential operations.”

“What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally,” she added.

The targeting of Somali migrants is the latest piece of Mr. Trump’s intensifying immigration crackdown across the country, one that the administration is expanding to block legal pathways for many migrants in the wake of the National Guard shooting.

At the White House, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff, has ramped up pressure to increase arrests in recent months. The targeting of migrants in the Twin Cities comes after similar efforts in other metropolitan areas across the country.

In recent months, federal officials have launched immigration operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Charlotte, N.C., setting off protests about what critics say are overly aggressive tactics and mistreatment by agents. D.H.S. has said that operations identify immigrants who are in the country illegally and that the enforcement actions are necessary to follow through on Mr. Trump’s promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants.

The surge of federal agents to cities has also served another purpose: to scare migrants in the hopes that they will leave the country voluntarily.

While there have not yet been images of large-scale arrests in the Minneapolis area, immigration operations often vary in scale and residents in the city have been on edge amid Mr. Trump’s increasingly dark rhetoric.

In recent days, the president has moved to end temporary legal protections for Somalis. Many of them have had the protections for decades under a program for migrants from countries in crisis.

Minnesota is home to the largest diaspora of Somalis in the world, a community whose members began migrating to the state in large numbers as the East African nation descended into civil war in the mid-1990s. Immigrant activists and local officials say that the vast majority of Minnesotans with Somali roots are American citizens or legal permanent residents.

Nationally, about 73 percent of Somali immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens, according to the Census Bureau.

When asked by a reporter on Thursday what Somalis had to do with the accused Afghan shooter in Washington, Mr. Trump said, “Ah, nothing. But Somalis have caused a lot of trouble.”

Since his first term, Mr. Trump has attacked Somalis in derogatory, xenophobic terms.

In a social media post on Thursday night, Mr. Trump claimed that Somalis were “taking over” Minnesota and that Somali gangs were “roving the streets looking for ‘prey.’” He accused Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who came to the United States from Somalia as a refugee and became a citizen 25 years ago, as someone who “probably came into the U.S.A. illegally.” Mr. Trump said she was “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab.”

In a statement, Jacklyn Rogers, a spokeswoman for Ms. Omar, said, “The congresswoman thinks his obsession with her is unhealthy and hopes he gets help.”

The president also said that Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was “seriously retarded” for welcoming immigrants from Somalia.

In a response posted on social media, Mr. Walz said: “Donald Trump is focused on pitting people against each other. The center of his agenda is cruelty — not lowering prices or making life better for Americans.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Somalis in Minneapolis had ripped off American taxpayers, citing a New York Times report on an investigation into fraud that had taken place in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali diaspora. But just a small group of people were actually convicted of fraud. Somali Americans in the state say such broad accusations have unfairly pilloried an entire community.

Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the two largest cities in the state, have policies that bar local law enforcement officials and other municipal employees from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. But high-profile federal operations earlier this year have tested the limits of those policies.

In June, federal law enforcement agents, including immigration officials, carried out an operation in a commercial district close to downtown Minneapolis, which led to scuffles with dozens of protesters. The Minneapolis Police Department joined federal agents at the scene in an effort to de-escalate the situation, which angered some local officials and residents.

Federal officials later said the operation involved a narcotics investigation.

More recently, scores of protesters clashed with law enforcement officials during two immigration enforcement operations in Saint Paul. One, in mid-November, resulted in the arrest of 14 people at a paper distribution company.

Some earned settlement updates from the past week. First of all, the Home Secretary tweeted that the illegal entry penalty will not be applied to people who have been recognised as refugees. Thanks to Jon Featonby for spotting and flagging up that one. I personally feel this information would have been better off clearly stated in the consultation document. By Tuesday last week, five days after it opened, there had been 60,000 responses to the consultation (h/t CJ for that one). I wouldn’t be surprised if that had hit six figures by now.

Labour’s child poverty strategy is expected to be published shortly, however families that include migrants, including those with British or British born/raised children, will presumably be ignored as the earned settlement proposals will exacerbate and entrench poverty for those families. Reports have already started coming in about families choosing not to apply for or stopping claiming public funds that they are entitled to. The Guardian on the weekend told the story of this mother of a disabled child who cancelled her benefits because of fears it would lengthen the amount of time she has to wait before applying for settlement. One of the many problems here is that the proposal includes any past history of claiming benefits while in the route to settlement, so stopping now will not necessarily benefit people unless transitional provisions are put in place.

For those following the Mazur saga which has caused chaos throughout the legal sector, including in immigration, last week it was reported that CILEX has been granted permission to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal. Essential reading on what has been going on includes ILPA’s position statement on the implications for immigration practitioners, the Law Society’s Practice Note “Mazur and the conduct of litigation” as well as this piece in Legal Futures.

The Manston Inquiry emailed me last week to tell me that they have opened applications for those who want Inquiry Participant status. So now I’m telling you. More details and how to apply can be found on the website and the deadline is 8 December 2025.

On Free Movement, BID’s latest report looking at access to justice for people in immigration detention is out and things are looking more grim than ever. It was quarterly statistics day last Thursday. As ever, it is useful to consider what the Home Office is not telling us, and the data that is not published on family applications raises serious concerns about the extent to which the impact of the earned settlement proposals on families is known and has been taken into account.

There were also quite a few case write ups, including the Court of Appeal looking at article 8 claims in the context of adult siblings in a case turned high profile by both media and politicians earlier this year. There were two deportation decisions, one on the effect of withdrawal of a certification decision and a failed challenge to refusal to revoke a deportation order. Also, TOEIC cases continue to rumble through the system.

For everything else on Free Movement and elsewhere, read on.

Cheers, Sonia

The judges who worked out of 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan were terminated, according to an official in the National Association of Immigration Judges.

Earlier Monday, Tania Nemer sued the Justice Department on the grounds she was terminated from her post as an Ohio immigration judge because of her gender, a citizen of Lebanon and was a Democratic candidate for local office.

About 200 immigration judges have resigned or been let go as part of the Department of Government Efficiency’s effort to trim inefficiencies and spending by encouraging federal employees to leave their jobs. Roughly 100 of those were fired, the NAIJ official said.

The judges were terminated despite a backlog of 3.4 million immigration cases in the federal system, according to Syracuse University’s TRAC Reports.

The War Department said in September it planned to send 600 military lawyers to serve temporarily as immigration judges — but so far only 25 have gone through the required training and have begun hearing cases, the NAIJ official said.

Just 11 new permanent judges have been installed, despite Congress creating 800 federal immigration judiciary jobs as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Nemer’s suit, filed in Washington, DC, federal court, claims she was sacked on Feb. 5, in part, because she unsuccessfully ran for office earlier on in her career. She alleged this violated her Constitutional right to engage in political activity.

But the DOJ argued in her previous Equal Employment Opportunity complaint that the Trump administration has the right to fire employees and they let Nemer go as part of a “lawful exercise” of that authority.

Nemer began her judgeship in 2023 under former President Joe Biden’s administration. She is seeking to be reinstated.

Nothing more, nothing less,” said the EU executive spokesman responsible for trade, Olof Gill.
In essence, the European Commission will have the power, after informing the EU Council and the European Parliament, to terminate trade preferences with countries that fail to comply with their obligations to repatriate their nationals residing irregularly in the EU.","Brussels – Stop some trade preferences for developing countries that do not cooperate on migration and returns. This is the main novelty of the agreement reached late last night (1 December) between the EU institutions on the revision of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) regulation, the scheme through which 65 non-EU countries can gain privileged access to the European single market. The preferences,” reads an EU Council note, “may be withdrawn if a beneficiary country does not cooperate on the readmission of its own nationals.

Negotiations to revise the instrument, which began in 1971 and was last amended in 2014, have dragged on for almost four years. The rise of far-right parties across Europe and the assertion of an increasingly strict migration policy (with a renewed focus on returns) led to the inclusion, for the first time, of conditionality linking trade measures to the fight against irregular migration.

The European Commission “welcomed” the agreement between the co-legislators, noting that “the GSP in its current form already provides for certain conditions” for beneficiary countries. On respect for human rights and the environment, in particular. What changes now is that “certain provisions will encourage countries to strengthen cooperation on the readmission of their nationals. Nothing more, nothing less,” said the EU executive spokesman responsible for trade, Olof Gill.

In essence, the European Commission will have the power, after informing the EU Council and the European Parliament, to terminate trade preferences with countries that fail to comply with their obligations to repatriate their nationals residing irregularly in the EU. Obligations, in this sense, exist only for third countries that have concluded specific readmission agreements with Brussels, such as Ethiopia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Niger, Nigeria, Ghana, Mali, and Morocco. But also Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In all, there are more than 20.

The Group of Socialists and Democrats stated in a note that “thanks to the persistent efforts” of its negotiators, the final agreement “ensures that any consideration of readmission is strictly a measure of last resort, subject to clear safeguards and a rigorous procedure,” whereas the European Commission’s initial proposal “risked introducing cooperation on readmission of migrants as a criterion for the withdrawal of trade preferences.”

The other conditions: human rights, environment, and the rice clause

The new framework introduces other novelties. Beneficiary countries will be required to comply with more international conventions on human and labour rights, and Brussels will have an emergency procedure for the rapid withdrawal of preferences in the event of violations of the principles of these conventions, as well as in the event of serious and systematic violations of climate change and environmental protection conventions. The EU also provided for a gradual transition for countries that will cease to be considered LDCs in the next decade and will therefore no longer benefit from the GSP regime, and lowered the threshold of imports in a specific sector above which a country temporarily loses preferences from 57 per cent to 47 per cent.

To overcome resistance from Italy and Spain, an automatic specific safeguard mechanism for rice imports has also been introduced: in the event of a significant increase over the historical average of imports into the EU, these imports will be subject to World Trade Organisation MFN (Most Favoured Nation) duties for a specific period to avoid “severe disruption of the EU rice market.” The Renew Liberal Group assured in a note that “the mechanism will be used in a proportionate manner, with safeguards before any suspension, including extended evaluation procedures for least developed countries.”

The agreement will now have to be approved by the Council and Parliament before it is formally adopted. The legislation will then apply from 1 January 2027.",https://www.eunews.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/000_33KD8EM-1024x667.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:58:25.169756

The letter, which was sent Friday, November 21, 2025, to President Donald Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator Brandon Williams, denounces the administration’s plans and outlines clear actions to ensure Congressional oversight, including:

Unclassified bipartisan briefings.

Assessments of the projected health, environmental, and economic impacts.

A comprehensive cost estimate of an explosive nuclear test, and more.

Key excerpt:

Renewing explosive testing will resume a dark chapter in American history that still continues to leave deep human and environmental scars. Between 1951 and 1992, over 900 nuclear tests blanketed the American West with radioactive fallout, exposing millions of Americans to devastating health effects, especially “downwind” communities in Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. Decades of evidence from the Nevada National Security Site, the Marshall Islands, and other test regions document the lasting toll of contamination, illness, and environmental damage. Many of those harmed are still awaiting long-overdue compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). Resuming testing will only compound these injustices, expose new generations to radiation and environmental risk while many are already denied care for past exposure, and further erode public trust in the government’s commitment to protect its own citizens.

The lawmakers released the following statements:

“Nevadans know better than anyone how reckless the Trump administration’s reversal on three decades of nuclear non-proliferation is,” Rep. Horsford said. “Some in our state continue to wait for compensation they’re due from 41 years of nuclear tests poisoning our land, air, and water – we cannot allow history to repeat itself. Nevada’s Congressional Democrats are united in our opposition to renewed testing, and our demand for accountability. That means truly understanding the impacts on the environment, economy, and local population. It means being clear-eyed about the full cost of conducting a test. And it means ensuring all of this information is available for Congressional oversight and public scrutiny.”

“For decades too many Nevadans have suffered the consequences of explosive nuclear testing and toxic radiation exposure,” Rep. Lee said. “Experts, including those in the Trump administration, have consistently testified that explosive nuclear testing is unnecessary. Instead of nuclear saber-rattling, this moment demands transparency and accountability. Congress must have oversight over nuclear testing so we can continue to protect our people, environment, and economy.”

The lawmakers’ letter requests the Trump administration take six specific actions:

Reaffirm the U.S. moratorium on explosive nuclear weapons testing and immediately halt any preparatory or infrastructure activities that signal intent to resume such testing.

Provide a full, unclassified bipartisan briefing to Congress outlining any directives, funding allocations, or site activities associated with renewed test readiness, including at the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense.

Publish an interagency assessment detailing the projected health, environmental, and economic impacts of potential testing, including radiation exposure risks to downwind communities and service members.

Deliver to Congress a comprehensive cost estimate for conducting an explosive nuclear test—including equipment, personnel, time, and cleanup—along with an explanation of the strategic rationale.

Establish an updated presumption of exposure for military personnel, federal employees, and civilians who served or lived near historic or proposed test sites, ensuring expedited access to care and compensation under the RECA.

Recommit to the principles and verification mechanisms of the CTBT and reaffirm U.S. leadership in scientific stewardship, strategic stability, and responsible global engagement. We also urge the Administration to renew efforts for a Senate consideration and ratification of the CTBT.

All three of Nevada’s Congressional Democrats are signatories on a previous Congressional letter sent November 3, 2025, expressing outrage at the administration’s intent to test nuclear weapons. More information is available here.

Representatives Horsford and Lee also co-led legislation introduced on November 7, 2025, requiring Congressional Approval for Explosive Nuclear Tests. More information is available here.

The goal of these provisions was to make sure that the government would not force people with potentially valid asylum claims back to countries in which they faced persecution without first considering their claims.
In December 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in the District Court explaining why it should not dismiss the case.
For decades, the executive branch has consistently recognized that § 1182(f) does not allow the President to deny people the right to pursue a claim for asylum.
For this reason, no President has attempted to use that statute to prohibit access to the U.S. asylum process.","Under the Refugee Act of 1980, Congress required the executive branch to establish a process for any person physically present in the country or at a port of entry to seek asylum. It also prohibited government officials from sending noncitizens to places where their “life or freedom would be threatened.” In the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Congress once again addressed the nation’s asylum procedures by requiring the executive branch to exempt from expedited removal anyone who intended to seek asylum and expressed a credible fear of persecution. The goal of these provisions was to make sure that the government would not force people with potentially valid asylum claims back to countries in which they faced persecution without first considering their claims.

The Trump Administration nonetheless instituted an “Asylum Shutdown Policy” that turns away” people who are trying to present themselves at ports of entry to seek asylum, leaving them stranded in places in which they are subject to grave danger. A coalition of immigrants’ rights organizations brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, and the government moved to dismiss the case.

In December 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in the District Court explaining why it should not dismiss the case. Our brief argues that the Policy is unlawful for three reasons.

First, the provisions of law that the Trump Administration relies upon do not give the President the power to restrict the ability to apply for asylum. Most significantly, § 1182(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) provides that the President can “suspend the entry” of anyone whose entry “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” As the provision’s text and history make clear, it addresses the criteria for “admission” into the country. But admissibility is not—and has never been—a prerequisite to applying for asylum. Thus, the President’s § 1182(f) power gives him no discretion to prevent people from applying for asylum.

Second, President Trump’s policy upends Congress’s deliberate decisions about how the nation’s asylum system should operate. Congress passed laws to limit the executive’s control of asylum admissions and guarantee each asylum-seeker the opportunity to have the government consider their claim. It sought to replace an ad-hoc system driven by the executive branch’s discretion with a system in which every person’s application for asylum

is fairly considered. Over the decades, Congress has reiterated that all asylum-seekers are entitled to individualized assessment of their claims, regardless of the President’s power to suspend entry.

Finally, the Trump Administration’s arguments are at odds with historical practice. For decades, the executive branch has consistently recognized that § 1182(f) does not allow the President to deny people the right to pursue a claim for asylum. For this reason, no President has attempted to use that statute to prohibit access to the U.S. asylum process.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-12-02 11:00:00.353962

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries ""of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed.

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

Here's a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week:

All asylum decisions suspended

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they're granted asylum, they're allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Justice Department.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn't trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump's January order didn't affect those cases, Edlow's social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency's pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. USCIS said there are currently 1.4 million pending asylum cases at the agency. Just a few years ago, in 2022, it was 241,280, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. Separately there are about 2.4 million pending asylum applications in front of the Justice Department's immigration courts.

A focus on countries ‘of concern’

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others.

No visas for Afghans

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department’s announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

A review of refugees admitted under the Biden administration

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That's nearly 200,000 refugees.

Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.

Noem hints at updated travel ban

Late Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested in a post on X that more changes could be in the offing.

Noting that she had just met with Trump, Noem said she was recommending a “full travel ban” on countries she said were flooding the U.S. “with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Noem did not specifically name any countries and no timeline was given. The Department of Homeland Security said in an email Monday, “We will be announcing the list soon.”",https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/12/GettyImages-2249378423.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-02 17:58:36.978648

Organizations such as Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and Lutheran Services in Iowa have felt the brunt of a state scarce of affordable immigration legal services.","Iowa immigration lawyers and legal aid groups are overwhelmed by a surge in cases due to the Trump administration's immigration policies.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in Iowa have more than doubled from 298 in 2024 to 693 in the first seven months of this year.

There is a significant shortage of immigration attorneys in Iowa, especially in rural areas where many immigrants work and reside.

ELDORA — On a September afternoon, Tim Farmer climbed into his truck, plugged his laptop charger into a car USB port and logged onto a Zoom call with Escucha Mi Voz. For over an hour, while parked outside a diner, the Perry lawyer met three families and the Iowa City immigration rights group to offer free legal help and answer questions about their immigration statuses.

Like clockwork with each family, Farmer sat up, flashed a soft smile and reintroduced himself as new faces emerged onto the screen.

""Soy Tim Farmer. Soy abogado,"" he said, introducing himself as a lawyer to each of them in Spanish.

Farmer spent Tuesday, Sept. 16 on the road, driving an hour and a half from his office in Perry to Eldora to meet a client being held at the Hardin County Jail after federal immigration agents arrested him during a traffic stop. The lawyer answered calls from clients and their families, including the worried girlfriend of the man in Hardin County who asked about visiting hours and depositing money into her boyfriend's commissary account.

Long days have become normal for Farmer who, since January, has handled a surge of calls and requests for legal services because of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. In one of his first acts in office, President Donald Trump cancelled flights for refugees approved to come to the U.S. and ordered resettlement agencies to stop serving new arrivals, who would otherwise receive three months of help finding housing, employment and school for their children. He also declared a national emergency on the U.S.'s southern border and sought to end the humanitarian parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.

Farmer is among Iowa's immigration lawyers who say they are overwhelmed by the number of people who need access to legal services. Even before the Trump administration's moves, services were already strapped, particularly in rural areas. The need, they say, has only grown as the administration's frequent changes to immigration policies and push for expedited deportations creates new challenges for lawyers seeking to help clients remain in the country and with their families.

From Jan. 1 to July 28, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has made 693 arrests in Iowa, according to the Deportation Data Project. The project gathered and released data showing individual case information for ICE arrests and deportations. That Iowa arrest number is more than double the 298 ICE arrests in 2024 — and more than five times the 123 reported in 2023.

In those seven months, 511 people in Iowa were either deported, left voluntarily or removed because they reentered the U.S. before they were authorized to, according to the data. That number was 211 in 2024.

Many people, including those in Iowa, have cheered the increase in arrests and deportations. They believe the country's immigration system was broken long before the crackdown — and the president is finally fixing it with his aggressive moves.

Recent ads from the Department of Homeland Security tout reasons behind the administration's push for immigration enforcement.

""America is not a nation of immigrants,"" DHS Deputy Assistant Secretary Micah Bock said in a Nov. 16 video posted on social media. ""We are a nation of citizens, and it is because of those citizens that we are an exceptional nation. The first duty of our government is to defend people's well-being, way of life and safeguard our nation's heritage.""

But the approach has had consequences, both for Iowa lawyers and for the people they work to defend.

“I worked as an immigration attorney through the first Trump administration as well and I would say that this time things are much more aggressive,"" Farmer said.

""It's not letting up anytime soon,"" he added in a Nov. 7 interview.

According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, 211 immigration attorneys are members of the national organization's Iowa and Nebraska chapter. Of that number, about 74 are based in Iowa. While these figures are not an exact count of all Iowa attorneys practicing immigration law, they offer a glimpse of the resources available to immigrants seeking legal consultation or representation.

The list of immigration lawyers in Iowa is even smaller when taking into account specialties. Roughly one-third of American Immigration Lawyers Association Iowa lawyers handle removal proceedings, said Gunda Brost, the chapter's media liaison and an immigration attorney in northeast Iowa. More focus on business immigration and work with companies on employment visas or filings with agencies such as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or the National Visa Center.

""People who are caught up in Trump's enforcement — they are not even going to be able to find an employment immigration lawyer to take on their case,"" she said.

Those living in rural areas have fewer options, with most immigration lawyers located in larger cities such as Des Moines and Cedar Rapids.

""If you think about who the immigrants are, a lot of them are in meat packaging plants, construction ... where they are necessarily in rural areas,"" Brost said. ""In other words, it's difficult for them to access.""

Brost, whose firm is in Cedar Falls, serves clients from the area and Waterloo. The next closest immigration lawyer is in a 40-mile radius or at least an hour drive, she said.

Brost said some clients have turned to nonprofits for legal help but struggled to make appointments with staff because of the high demand or limited slots.

Access to legal representation is ""a life-changing protection,"" reported the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University data organization that tracks immigration detention. People who receive legal counsel are more likely to ""win relief from deportation,"" the group said.

Of the court cases decided nationwide from 2019 to 2024, 62% of immigrants without a lawyer were deported compared to 27% of those with one, the American Immigration Council found.

Cost and language are barriers for many, Brost said. It can be hard for clients to navigate the U.S. immigration and court system especially if their English is limited. That means access to bilingual or multilingual lawyers and quality interpreters are vital.

Of the top 10 languages spoken in immigration court, TRAC found noncitizens who speak Creole and had no legal representation were highly likely — 93% — to receive a removal order in fiscal year 2025. More than 80% of Spanish speakers also received removal orders — and over 85% were unrepresented in cases that ended in removal.

The case against one of Farmer's more high-profile clients, Pascual Pedro, a 20-year-old who was arrested and detained after a routine ICE check-in, underscores how quickly immigration lawyers must work. Pedro, a Guatemalan immigrant who lived in West Liberty with family and worked in construction, was deported to his home country a five days after his July 1 arrest.

Farmer said he didn't even have a chance to represent his client. An immigrant rights group hired Farmer July 3, but because of the July Fourth holiday, many offices were closed. The Monday after, as Farmer filed a stay of removal petition, he learned Pedro already was in Guatemala.

In 2018, Pedro, then 13 years old, fled to the U.S. from Guatemala with his father. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials issued them both an expedited removal but only Pedro's father was deported. Pedro was issued an order of supervision, which allowed him to temporarily live in the country with strict conditions while waiting final deportation orders.

""He's basically just been living in the U.S. for the past few years at their whim,"" Farmer previously said. ""They can decide to execute the order of removal at any time, and that's what they've done.""

Wave of policy changes bring new challenges for immigration attorneys, organizations

On the drive to Eldora, Farmer's electric truck became a makeshift mobile office. Tangled ties took over the glove compartment, his blazers in the trunk. Ceaseless phone calls have replaced a pastime — listening to audiobooks of classic literature.

""I get interrupted so much,"" said Farmer, who left a law firm in Perry after 10 years to start his own private practice in January.

He anticipated a heavier workload, but not like this.

Organizations such as Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and Lutheran Services in Iowa have felt the brunt of a state scarce of affordable immigration legal services. Limited funding to deliver those services often lead organizations to turn clients away and refer them to private attorneys such as Farmer, said Ann Naffier, co-legal director at Iowa MMJ, and Nicholas Wuertz, who oversees LSI's immigrant and refugee services.

""People keep asking me, 'oh, you must be really busy?' but the truth is I've always been really busy,"" Naffier said. ""We're just more stressed.

""Is there much more work to do? Yes. But we were already at capacity.""

Iowa MMJ recently expanded its legal clinics to combat the Trump administration's changes to programs, including those that revoked the temporary legal statuses of immigrants already living and working in the U.S. The organization, which provides free or low-cost legal services, began offering legal counsel clinics to help more of those individuals explore options, if any, to remain in the U.S.

Legal clinics are popular among Iowa MMJ clients, but space is limited. Some clinics with 10 appointment slots have seen 200 community members apply, said Elena Casillas-Hoffman, communications specialist.

In August, Iowa MMJ held an emergency clinic in Ottumwa for JBS meatpacking plant workers whose work visas had been revoked and who were at risk of deportation. Many of the 200 workers had temporary legal status through the CHNV parole program. That program ended in May and once protected immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela from deportation and gave them work visas. It hosted other clinics in Clarion and Storm Lake, where communities faced a similar issue and people whose legal statuses were ""ripped out from underneath them"" were laid off in droves, Casillas-Hoffman said.

Those kinds of policies are among the factors driving people to seek assistance from Iowa MMJ's legal team. Heightened fear and anxiety among immigrant and refugee communities are another.

Having a larger legal team also allowed the advocacy organization to see more people. Iowa MMJ has four attorneys — one of whom was added last year and focuses on detained community members — and six representatives accredited by the Department of Justice to provide immigration legal services. Two bilingual administrative assistants and two legal workers also joined the team this year.

Iowa MMJ is one of 10 organizations in the state — and one of three in Des Moines — recognized by the Department of Justice and has accredited representatives authorized to represent clients with immigration cases, including family petitions and work visa renewals.

Two LSI staff members are taking courses to become federally accredited representatives — a start to the nonprofit's longtime goal of having its own immigration legal services branch.

The changes to immigration policies under the Trump administration add fuel to that goal, Wuertz said.

Recent changes to SNAP benefits are affecting LSI refugee clients, who are no longer eligible for the federal program under HR 1, also known as Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act."" People granted asylum, survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking and other noncitizens also are unable to get assistance under the bill, which became law in July.

""With the passage of the bill, it restricts their access to programs until they gain lawful permanent residency or green cards,"" which they can apply for after a year, Wuertz said.

Refugees also can apply for citizenship after five years. Both those steps would require assistance of immigration legal services.

""It just increases the urgency for access to affordable immigration legal services so that refugees and other humanitarian immigrants can timely get their green card and once again be eligible for some of those safety next programs,"" Wuertz said.

'It's a blessing' if detained migrants get out of jail, lawyer says

At Hardin County Jail, Farmer walked past the secured doors and into small white room with a single chair and a glass window and waited for his client to enter.

A detail in the man's case speaks to a new trend Farmer has noticed: Traffic stops turning into immigration arrests are more common as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement. The man was stopped in Wright County for using his cell phone while driving, which consequently led to his arrest by federal immigration authorities.

""Sometimes, people get stopped just for having a headlight out or something like that and then the officer finds out they don't have a license,"" Farmer said. ""Sometimes, they'll even be arrested for driving without a license, which is not normally something that you would be arrested for.

""Some officers will arrest you for driving without a license if they find out the reason you don't have a license is because you're undocumented.""

And if you're an undocumented immigrant, you may not be eligible for bail.

An ICE policy change prevents judges from granting bond to most detained migrants, which Farmer and Des Moines immigration attorney Alexander Cárdenas Cruz said further limits their clients' legal options.

""If you get out of jail, it's a blessing honestly,"" said Cruz, who works at the downtown Des Moines law firm Mueller Schmidt Mulholland & Cooling.

Cruz said voluntary departure, an alternative to deportation, has become more appealing to his clients who have been released from ICE custody or are in detention.

""A lot of people are taking it,"" he said. ""They have been in jail for a couple of weeks, and they're just sick of being in jail — which I don't blame them — because they're not hard criminals.""

Hardin County Jail is one of six Iowa county jails contracted by the U.S. Marshals Service to hold federal inmates. Polk County Jail — the largest of the six that also includes Linn, Muscatine, Pottawattamie and Woodbury counties — has 170 to 200 beds reserved for federal inmates, said Lt. Mark Chance, spokesperson for the Polk County Sheriff's Office.

Sixty-four of those beds are for ICE.

To be granted voluntary departure, individuals must admit to being in the U.S. without immigration documents and withdraw submitted applications or petitions. Those who leave voluntarily could trigger a 10-year ban from reentering the U.S. and pay penalty fees up to about $10,000.

Like Farmer, Cruz said he continues to field more requests for legal services since Trump stepped into the Oval Office in January.

The work has been nonstop.

""We've been talking for 20 minutes, and I have five missed calls from people, either clients or (those) looking for representation,"" Cruz said during a Nov. 6 interview.

""Every time now that somebody on Instagram says that something's happening, I get a call,"" he said. News of ICE arrests across the country, including Iowa, frequent changes to immigration laws or new fees tacked on to immigration applications cause his phone to ring.

""If there’s a news article that comes out that says that somebody got deported at a court hearing, I get a call (from a client asking,) 'Am I going to get deported at my court hearing?'"" he said.

In October, calls poured in as people learned of a new policy that would require them to pay $100 each year their asylum applications are pending. A federal judge temporarily blocked that change that same month after the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project filed a lawsuit against USCIS over the fee.

The uncertainty is hard to face. So are the tears from Cruz's clients.

Families are scared to be separated — to lose loved ones with no possible return date in sight. Cruz said he has the tough job of telling people they may not win their cases.

With clients facing deportations, he speaks with families about their next steps, which could entail plans on what they could do to legally return to the U.S.

""I’ve always, at least, made sure to really enjoy the wins,"" he said. ""Because that’s how I can tell myself I am making a difference.""

""But I can tell you every client that I've lost and their names and how we lost and how their families dealt with it because I’ll never forget that,"" Cruz said. ""Those are the hardest conversations I’ve ever had in my life.""

Moulton said he would continue to press ICE to improve conditions at Burlington, adding ""there's no excuse that they have not had sleeping mats from June until now.""
Before going inside the ICE field office, Moulton told protest leaders that Democrats in Congress needed to do more to counter the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. ""
"" What's happening inside the Burlington field office, and to immigrants in general, is ""not acceptable and must stop,"" she said.","Congressman Seth Moulton visited the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Burlington on Monday and said little has changed there since June — there are still no beds or mattress pads, so people continue to sleep on concrete floors or benches.

The holding rooms are less crowded however, the Salem Democrat said after a 90-minute tour. There were fewer than 10 people being held Monday, down from close to 50 in June.

""It does seem that they are moving people through here more quickly,"" Moulton said. But he said that expediency means immigrants who are arrested and brought to the Burlington office are swiftly ""whisked off"" to detention centers in other states, like Texas and Louisiana, often without their families or lawyers being notified.

""Although the humanitarian standards are inadequate and we don't want people stuck here for a long period of time,"" he said, being quickly moved out of state is also a problem when it comes to protecting people’s rights.

""We want to give people adequate access to lawyers,"" he said.

Moulton, whose district includes Burlington, came for what his office billed as an oversight inspection amid ongoing public scrutiny over conditions at the ICE administrative building, located not far from the Burlington Mall. Former detainees have said they were often held for days at a time in overcrowded rooms and denied access to showers, medical care and sanitary supplies like pads and tampons.

By ICE's own admission, field offices are processing centers and not designed for long-term detention. On rare occasions, people are kept longer, a spokesperson told WBUR in June.

The agency has maintained that detainees are ""given ample food, regular access to phones, showers and legal representation as well as medical care when needed.""

Moulton's June visit coincided with the release of Marcelo Gomes da Silva, an 18-year-old Milford high school student who was detained for six days in a room with dozens of older men. At the time, Moulton and U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss showed up to the facility, having given ICE little notice, and asked for a tour, as was their right as congressmen. Not too long after, the Trump administration announced that elected officials must pre-arrange oversight visits. As a result, ICE agents knew Moulton was coming on Monday.

U.S. Sen. Ed Markey made an unplanned appearance there last week and was denied access; he has said he’s made arrangements for a future official visit. Moulton is challenging Markey for his senate seat.

On Monday, Moulton said he witnessed an asylum hearing and had the opportunity to ask federal agents a wide variety of questions, including what typically happens to people who are brought to the facility. He said immigration officials agreed to send him information about the number of people booked into the office and the length of time they were detained.

Earlier this year, the entire Massachusetts delegation asked ICE for this information. The agency did not disclose specifics, but a WBUR examination of data found that hundreds of people were held in the Burlington field office for more than two days during May and June.

Since then, ICE has continued to arrest people across Massachusetts; 1,400 people in September alone, according to the agency.

Moulton said he asked immigration officials if they were transferring people out of Massachusetts to avoid judges who may be sympathetic to immigrants or less inclined to deport them. He said he was told detainees are being moved because of limited in-state detention capacity. Massachusetts has one facility that holds men, the Plymouth County jail, and none that can accommodate women.

Asked if the solution is to build more detention centers in state, Moulton told reporters and dozens of protesters gathered at the site that he’s not pushing to open more facilities.

""But in the case of a female facility in Massachusetts, it actually probably would be smart so that they're not being sent out of state and that they get to go before Massachusetts judges,"" he said.

In at least two recent high-profile cases, immigrant women arrested in Massachusetts have been swiftly transferred to out-of-state detention facilities. In the first, Bruna Ferreira, a Brazilian native who had a child with the brother of White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, was arrested in Revere last month and taken to detention in Louisiana. And over the weekend, Any Lucia López Belloza, a freshman at Babson College was arrested at Logan Airport, transported to Texas and then deported to Honduras, a country she left 12 years ago.

Moulton said he would continue to press ICE to improve conditions at Burlington, adding ""there's no excuse that they have not had sleeping mats from June until now."" He also said he'd visit again soon, and called on local protesters who've been meeting outside the facility weekly to keep up the pressure.

"" Your presence here makes a huge difference,"" he said, gesturing to the crowd from the Essex County Community Organization. ""They know that they're being watched, they know that they're being held accountable, and we're going to continue doing that until this situation improves.""

Before going inside the ICE field office, Moulton told protest leaders that Democrats in Congress needed to do more to counter the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

"" The abuses of ICE need to be prosecuted,"" he said. ""Yes. Not just defunded — prosecuted. They need to be held accountable to the law that they claim to enforce.""

While many in the audience thanked Moulton for his oversight and efforts to help immigrants, not everyone thought he was doing enough to press ICE on the issue.

"" I was quite frankly disappointed,"" Rev. Bernadette Hickman Maynard said. ""I want to hear more than 'we're going to follow up and talk to them.' ""

The immigration fee was contained in a Sept. 19 presidential proclamation.
Only three Indian companies were among the top 25 employers of new H-1B visa holders in FY 2025, and executives at two of those companies, TCS and LTIMindtree, said they do not plan to file for new H-1B visa holders in the coming year.
The proclamation’s assertion that H-1B visa holders have prevented U.S. engineers and computer specialists from obtaining jobs lacks evidence.
DOJ argues the $100,000 fee “is not a fee” that would fall under the relevant parts of immigration law limiting how fees are assessed by U.S.","The Department of Justice has responded to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s lawsuit against the president’s $100,000 fee imposed on the entry of new H-1B visa holders. The immigration fee was contained in a Sept. 19 presidential proclamation. In the Defendants’ response and cross motion for summary judgment, the Trump administration rejected arguments made by the Chamber of Commerce and the American Association of Universities, which joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff. DOJ argues the president has “extraordinarily broad discretion to suspend the entry of aliens whenever he finds their admission ‘detrimental to the interest of the United States.’”

H-1B temporary visas are often the only way for high-skilled foreign nationals to work in the United States long term. Employers must pay the higher of the actual or prevailing wage paid to U.S. professionals with similar experience and qualifications. When companies recruit at U.S. universities, they find that international students account for approximately 70% of full-time graduate students in AI-related fields, such as computer and information sciences. The H-1B annual limit is 65,000, with an exemption of 20,000 for individuals with master’s degrees or higher from a U.S. university, or about 0.05% of the U.S. labor force.

In FY 2025, with sizable investments in artificial intelligence at stake, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Google had the most approved new H-1B petitions, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. At the same time, Indian-based companies have mostly disappeared from the top rankings, with their numbers plummeting. Only three Indian companies were among the top 25 employers of new H-1B visa holders in FY 2025, and executives at two of those companies, TCS and LTIMindtree, said they do not plan to file for new H-1B visa holders in the coming year.

According to guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the $100,000 fee would not apply to “change of status"" cases where people change from one category to another without leaving the country, such as moving from F-1 student status to H-1B status. It would apply to situations when a new H-1B visa holder needs to enter the United States.

The U.S. Chamber Of Commerce And AAU Immigration Lawsuit

On Oct. 16, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a complaint against the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. State Department, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Counsel for the plaintiffs include Daryl L. Joseffer of U.S. Chamber Litigation Center and Paul W. Hughes, Sarah P. Hogarth, Mary H. Schnoor, Alex C. Boota, Grace Wallack and Emmett Witkovsky-Eldred of McDermott Will & Schulte. The legal action followed an earlier lawsuit against the $100,000 fee filed on Oct. 3.

The Chamber of Commerce-AAU complaint argues that Congress, not the president, has the authority over the design of the H-1B visa category and the fees that govern it. The complaint states that the fee would inflict significant harm, forcing businesses to “either dramatically increase their labor costs or hire fewer highly skilled employees for whom domestic replacements are not readily available.” The complaint also argues the proclamation is misguided and unlawful: “The President has significant authority over the entry of noncitizens into the United States, but that authority is bounded by statute and cannot directly contradict laws passed by Congress.”

The complaint states that the proclamation “expressly overrides provisions” of immigration law that govern the H-1B visa category. The plaintiffs note that Congress established specific fees for H-1B visas, such as a fee that funds training and scholarships, and also allows the executive branch to charge fees for visas and services “sufficient to fund its activities related to those services,” but not more.

The plaintiffs also argue that any agency action implementing the proclamation would be unlawful and violate the Administrative Procedure Act. The $100,000 payment was not set by notice-and-comment rulemaking but by “presidential fiat.” According to the complaint, DHS and State cannot implement a fee that is not a valid exercise of the president’s authority, conflicts with other elements of immigration law and is “arbitrary and capricious.”

In one of the complaint’s strongest arguments, the plaintiffs state, “The INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] permits the executive branch to charge immigration fees in two circumstances: (a) where the fee is adopted via notice and comment rulemaking and set at a level necessary to recoup USCIS’s costs . . . or (b) where Congress itself has expressly authorized the fee through statute. The Proclamation’s exorbitant $100,000 application fee falls into neither category.”

The Trump Administration’s Response To The Immigration Lawsuit

In a filing on Dec. 1, the Justice Department rejected the plaintiffs’ arguments, declaring, “The Proclamation is a lawful exercise of the President’s authority to restrict the admission of aliens into the United States. The Court should therefore deny Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion in its entirety and enter summary judgment for Defendants.”

First, DOJ argues that plaintiffs’ claims are foreclosed by “the longstanding doctrine of nonreviewability, which bars judicial review of the Executive’s discretionary determination under the INA to restrict the entry of aliens into the United States.” Later in the response, DOJ points to the “principles of consular nonreviewability,” writing that “The Supreme Court has long held that ‘[t]he admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a fundamental sovereign attribute’ that is ‘largely immune from judicial control.’”

Second, DOJ states that plaintiffs do not have a cause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act because “it is well-settled that (1) the President is not subject to suit under the APA and (2) his statutory authority to regulate or restrict the entry of aliens into the United States derives explicitly from 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(f) and 1185(a).” The DOJ response adds, “Moreover, that authority is entirely discretionary, and judicial review to challenge such discretionary actions is unavailable via an ultra vires claim or the APA.”

Third, the response argues that the proclamation “does not conflict with any provision of the INA” and “simply adds an additional restriction on the entry of a class of aliens to further a key national interest: protecting American workers and national security.” The final DOJ argument: “Any claim by Plaintiffs that implementation of the Proclamation is procedurally deficient because it did not go through APA notice-and-comment rulemaking fails because Defendants have merely implemented what the Proclamation requires.”

DOJ states that even if plaintiffs’ claims are “justiciable,” the court’s review of the proclamation “must be exceedingly deferential” due to “the President’s discretion in exercising core Article II responsibilities’ addressing immigration, foreign affairs and national security.” The administration’s legal response several times evokes national security, including by repeating the proclamation’s assertion that “the President found that these abuses threaten national security because it ‘discourage[es] Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology, [thereby] risking American leadership in these fields.’”

An NFAP analysis of the Sept. 19 proclamation found it presented no empirical evidence linking the entry of H-1B visa holders or “abuses” of H-1B visas to discouraging “Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology.” Many H-1B visa holders are former international students. An NFAP study by University of North Florida economics professor Madeline Zavodny found, “Each additional 10 bachelor’s degrees—across all majors—awarded to international students by a college or university leads to an additional 15 bachelor’s degrees in STEM majors awarded to U.S. students.” Colleges devote more resources to STEM in response to international student interest, making these fields more attractive to American students. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence reported to Congress in 2021 that the U.S. government should liberalize, not restrict, the entry of high-skilled foreign nationals in science and technology fields.

The proclamation’s assertion that H-1B visa holders have prevented U.S. engineers and computer specialists from obtaining jobs lacks evidence. The number of U.S.-born workers employed in computer science and mathematical occupations increased by over 2.7 million, or 141%, between 2003 and 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, far higher than the 8% increase in the number of U.S.-born workers in the whole economy.

DOJ did not present a strong response to the plaintiffs’ argument that the president lacks the authority to tax and that any fee must go through notice-and-comment rulemaking or be expressly authorized by law. DOJ argues the $100,000 fee “is not a fee” that would fall under the relevant parts of immigration law limiting how fees are assessed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “The payment is not to cover costs, it performs a completely different function that is not expressly prohibited or otherwise governed by the INA,” according to DOJ. “Rather, the Proclamation payment was set by the President as a restriction on entry that he found ‘would be detrimental to the interests of the United States because such entry would harm American workers, including by undercutting their wages’ and it is paid into a general account for miscellaneous payments.”

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries “of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed.

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

Here’s a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week:

All asylum decisions suspended

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they’re granted asylum, they’re allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Justice Department.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn’t trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump’s January order didn’t affect those cases, Edlow’s social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency’s pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. USCIS said there are currently 1.4 million pending asylum cases at the agency. Just a few years ago, in 2022, it was 241,280, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. Separately there are about 2.4 million pending asylum applications in front of the Justice Department’s immigration courts.

A focus on countries ‘of concern’

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others.

No visas for Afghans

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department’s announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

A review of refugees admitted under the Biden administration

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That’s nearly 200,000 refugees.

Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.

Noem hints at updated travel ban

Late Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested in a post on X that more changes could be in the offing.

Noting that she had just met with Trump, Noem said she was recommending a “full travel ban” on countries she said were flooding the U.S. “with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Noem did not specifically name any countries and no timeline was given. The Department of Homeland Security said in an email Monday, “We will be announcing the list soon.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/6b4caf3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5213x2932+0+272/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd0%2Fc0%2F77e8677af0beb762fdab0cec1b12%2F2a096c597ab1409e96757cd051805d1a,N,,2025-12-02 12:57:28.993768

New York’s Democratic lawmakers are finding that defying President Donald Trump is easier said than done — even in a deep blue state.

Ideas that would satisfy their left-leaning base — like withholding taxes to the federal government — are proving legally and logistically questionable.

Proposals to curtail federal immigration enforcement efforts have languished in Albany.

And even symbolic measures like erasing Trump’s name from a state park haven’t gotten off the ground amid legal questions.

Democratic Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger is aware of the limitations. Last year, she raised the possibility of withholding tax payments to the federal government as a form of protest against Trump policies.

She now acknowledges doing so creates a series of legal problems for New York taxpayers.

“There’s lots of people who are very interested, but so far each proposal that I have explored sort of leads back to, well, you’d be putting the individual taxpayer at risk of violating federal law,” Krueger told Playbook. “I have no desire to encourage people to break federal law and end up facing criminal charges by the IRS.”

A bill that would limit local law enforcement officials from working with federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement also faces an unclear path in Albany.

The measure would put Gov. Kathy Hochul in a bind as she runs for a second full term this year — as well as cause heartburn for swing seat House Democrats.

Yet the proposal has traction among left-flank lawmakers who want to throw a wrench in the president’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies.

“There’s going to be a strong anti-Trump agenda to make sure New York is a place that’s affordable, safe and folks can live with dignity,” Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas said.

Republican state lawmakers scoff at the efforts to form a Resistance 2.0 in Albany.

“Democrats are the ones that created the affordability problem,” Assemblymember Chris Tague said. “They’re the ones that created the immigrant problem. Now all of a sudden it’s a crisis. It was a crisis when Biden was president. They screwed it all up and Trump had to come in and fix it.”

New York Democrats have no shortage of complaints with the president, who has been eager to exert power over blue states and cities, including his hometown.

He meddled in New York City’s mayoral election, dangling jobs in front of incumbent Eric Adams so he would quit the race to ease a path to victory for Andrew Cuomo. (Adams did drop out, but democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won anyway.)

The Trump administration and Republican-led Congress approved deep spending reductions for health care and food aid. Trump announced a spending freeze on major infrastructure projects like the Second Avenue subway and Gateway tunnel amid the federal government shutdown — a move meant to squeeze Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries.

Yet Trump has formed surprisingly cordial relationships with the state’s most prominent Democrats, Hochul and Mamdani.

The governor speaks frequently on the phone with the president and met with him twice in the Oval Office.

Mamdani’s lovefest with Trump — in which the two men bonded over addressing affordability and sharing the same voters — astonished the political world.

Many political insiders don’t expect this era of good feelings to last. And Hochul’s team is still prepping for the possibility of Trump further slashing federal aid or deploying the National Guard to the Big Apple’s streets. — Nick Reisman

ABOVE THE FOLD

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: Dozens of business groups spanning tech, health care, retail and other sectors are pressuring Hochul to veto the New York Health Information Privacy Act, one of several consequential health bills she must consider before the year’s end.

The coalition of nearly 50 groups charges in a letter to Hochul that the legislation has expanded beyond its original stated purpose and would increase costs for New Yorkers.

“Although the legislation was originally conceived to prevent the misuse of reproductive and gender-affirming care data, it has evolved into a comprehensive and unprecedented data privacy regime unlike any in the nation,” said Tech:NYC, Partnership for New York City, DoorDash, Warby Parker, several chambers of commerce and other signatories. “As drafted, NY HIPA would reclassify routine transactions, standard consumer interactions, and basic product development practices as regulated health information.”

The New York Health Information Privacy Act, sponsored by Krueger, is intended to protect sensitive data not covered under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. It would regulate companies that collect and sell health info.

Krueger, Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal and Attorney General Letitia James, all Democrats, have cited the bankruptcy of DNA testing company 23andMe — and the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the genetic data the company has gathered from millions of people — as an example of why the legislation is necessary.

“Our health data is being collected, tracked, and sold to third parties by the very companies that are supposed to be taking care of us — including women’s health apps, which tend to have vague or hard-to-find privacy policies,” Krueger said in March, urging Hochul to sign the legislation.

Hochul typically does not telegraph her positions on legislation awaiting her signature. A spokesperson said the governor would review the bill. — Emily Ngo

CITY HALL: THE LATEST

FIVE-BORO BACKING: City Council Member Julie Menin has all but sewn up the race to be speaker of the 51-member chamber but she wants to be sworn in with as broad a coalition as possible. To bolster her strength, she has been reaching out to her colleagues and has talked with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

Today, first reported in Playbook, Menin will announce she also has the support of all five Democratic county party chairs: Rep. Gregory Meeks of Queens, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn of Brooklyn, Assemblymember Charles Fall of Staten Island, state Sen. Jamaal Bailey of the Bronx and former Assemblymember Keith Wright of Manhattan.

She is endorsed by 37 council members — a supermajority — and several powerful unions including the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council and the Transport Workers Union.

The Manhattan moderate, who formerly led the Department of Consumer Affairs in Bill de Blasio’s administration, is regarded by some allies as a check on Mamdani. But she sought to emphasize in an interview earlier this week with Playbook the areas where she and the democratic socialist can collaborate. — Emily Ngo

NEW FROM PLANET ALBANY

MUM ON THE REFUND: The governor’s campaign is refusing to say how much money she was forced to return after a report found she received thousands in campaign donations that appear to run afoul of her own 2021 executive order.

Hochul’s chief GOP rival Rep. Elise Stefanik moved swiftly to attack her after a Saturday report in Gothamist showed the governor raked in $72,500 in campaign contributions from state appointees.

“The Worst Governor in America violated her own executive order to enrich her campaign in a pay-to-play scheme and is now being forced to return the cash and refund her appointees,” Stefanik said Monday in a statement. “But how deep does Hochul’s corruption run?""

Hochul’s campaign acknowledged to Playbook that the donations in question were being returned, but refused to talk about the matter on the record or share how much money is being refunded.

Her 2021 executive order outlines that “no State agency officer or employee who serves at the pleasure of the Governor or their appointing authority … may make or offer to make any monetary contribution to the campaign of the Governor.” It was first passed by then-Gov. David Paterson in 2008 and reinstated by the governor.

Hochul’s campaign referred Playbook to a statement from American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten.

“Governor Hochul has the highest ethical standards and is working day in and day out to put money back in families’ pockets. I’m proud to stand behind her.”

Democratic primary challenger Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado said the donations are an example of how “for too long, New York has been run in backrooms with deals made behind closed doors.”

In 2022, The New York Times reported Hochul accepted more than $400,000 in campaign contributions from political appointees largely selected by her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo.

The potential return of thousands in apparently improper donations comes as the governor has spent the autumn months doling out a completely different type of refund. Last week, the governor announced that more than 8 million inflation refund checks were mailed to New York taxpayers in time for Thanksgiving. — Jason Beeferman

AND THEN THERE WERE THREE: The Republican field for state attorney general is getting crowded.

Former federal prosecutor Saritha Komatireddy announced Monday she would seek the GOP nomination to take on Democratic incumbent Letitia James, making her the third Republican to enter the race. Her candidacy was first reported by the New York Post.

“I’m running for Attorney General because we need a prosecutor in charge, focused on New York and focused on safety,” she said in a statement.

Komatireddy joins Michael Henry and Khurram Dara on the GOP side. James is seeking a third term next year. — Nick Reisman

KEEPING UP WITH THE DELEGATION

ACA FIGHT INTENSIFIES: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is accusing Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) of undermining a White House proposal to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years as Congress stares down a fast-approaching deadline to avoid massive premium hikes.

“It even appears that the Trump administration was ready to put forth a plan that would at least have been worthy of consideration, and that Mike Johnson tanked it,” Jeffries said at a news conference Monday.

The New York Democrat was referring to a framework for extending the enhanced ACA tax credits that the White House was planning to release last week before the details were leaked and conservatives revolted, postponing rollout plans indefinitely.

Many congressional Democrats were cool to the blueprint, which would have paired an extension with other health policy changes sought by Republicans. But other Democrats called it a promising sign that Trump was finally getting ready to engage in negotiations over the future of the tax credits, which are due to sunset Dec. 31 without congressional action and around which Republicans are deeply divided.

“Obviously, Mike Johnson has zero interest in protecting the health care of the American people,” said Jeffries, adding that while Republicans “consistently said” they would discuss an extension of the subsidies after the end of the shutdown, “now we get nothing but crickets.”

But carwash workers also have a unique asset: an advocacy group called the Clean Carwash Worker Center.

Throughout the raids, one of the recurring targets of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents has been carwash workers.

Carwashes make a logical target for federal agents. It’s common knowledge that a significant share of that workforce lacks immigration authorization. The industry is dominated by small businesses with little political clout. They operate out in the open, making it difficult for workers to anticipate or evade arrest.

But carwash workers also have a unique asset: an advocacy group called the Clean Carwash Worker Center. Since 2007, the center has helped combat the industry’s exploitative labor conditions and unionize workers with the support of United Steel Workers Local 675. Clean was the driving force behind the 2014 Carwash Worker Law that established a restitution fund for victims of wage theft.

Since Trump took office in January, Clean’s work has shifted to confront the administration’s mass deportation agenda. At a time when migrants are being whisked away indiscriminately into detention centers, where they often lack access to a lawyer and face pressure to sign their own removal orders, Clean now serves as a unique link in a chain connecting legal aid groups and bond funds with families fighting deportation cases.

Clean has identified more than 101 ICE operations targeting carwashes in southern California since the raids began, resulting in the arrest of at least 346 carwash workers. Many of them were swiftly deported, according to Clean, but the organization’s efforts helped get 20 of them released on bond.

We spoke with Andrea Gonzalez, Clean’s deputy director, and Norma Fajardo, the organizing director, about how the organization is responding to the ongoing immigration raids. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.

It seems like these raids are putting undocumented car wash workers in an impossible position where they either show up to work and risk getting deported, or quit work and don’t get paid.

Andrea: I think it’s not just undocumented workers, I think it’s all car wash workers who are at risk. Our organization has been able to meet workers who are US citizens, who are legal permanent residents or have an ongoing immigration case that have been detained. The risk factor is there for any carwash worker at this point.

What effect are you seeing these raids having on the car-washing business writ large?

Andrea: There’s the financial impact. But since the raids in the beginning of June, many carwashes also decided to not open out of security reasons. Others had no choice but to shut down, because there weren’t any workers showing up.

Meanwhile, some customers have been afraid to go get their cars washed because they have also gotten swept up in raids at carwashes.

Have you seen a major change in the number of businesses targeted during the period from July to early September, when a federal judge’s order barred ICE from making indiscriminate arrests in southern California?

Andrea: Absolutely not. Things have slowed down now, but not because they’re following a judge’s orders. It’s slowed down because it’s been raining – and carwashes don’t open when it rains.

Clean was founded in 2007, which was a time when immigration enforcement was really ramping up – shortly after the creation of Homeland Security and ICE, but before the discretion policies the Obama administration implemented in 2011. How have the raids of the last few months compared with anything your organization has experienced since it was founded?

Andrea: This is a time that many of us, as organizers or as advocates, have never lived through. It’s a moment where you really are having to grapple with terror. It’s a terror that’s being inflicted on our communities.

It’s not just about financially people feeling stressed. It’s more of a psychological warfare. A sense of heightened insecurity, hyper-vigilance that people now have to live with. When we talk to workers after a raid happens, the trauma that is essentially stored in their body – many of them have shared: “I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. Every time I see an SUV or I see a particular vehicle or model, I’m constantly wondering, ‘Is this an agent?’”

That sense of just not feeling safe – not just in your own body, but the only place you feel a sense of safety is your home.

Our role when we started was really just to empower workers in the industry to learn about the rights they have here in California, and most importantly to help them exercise those rights. Right now, it’s beyond workers rights. We’re talking about their rights as human beings and their rights to be seen as a human being, and not to be hunted like animals. How do you restore the faith in someone’s humanity, when they are seriously feeling like: “I am being hunted, like an animal.”

Norma: When we realized that Trump had won the election, we knew that things were probably going to get a little scary. But in our wildest dreams, we would have never imagined that ICE or federal agents were going to be racially profiling and picking up anyone who looks brown or speaks Spanish or that they would target carwash workers.

I’m curious how you respond to all these threats that folks are facing.

Andrea: When we learned about Trump’s election, we took some time to check in with our membership, have conversations about people’s fears and concerns.

As time went on, we focused on preparing our community for attacks, and the ways in which we could continue to empower people to know their constitutional rights.

In retrospect, those things feel like they’re obsolete. Not because they’re not necessary, but it in this time and moment we’ve had to switch to just collaborating with people on the ground, community groups, legal organizations.

We have our mutual aid, which is access to food, but also access to financial assistance through our carwash worker solidarity fund. We also have created a legal fund. And through that legal fund, we’ve been able to help people access legal representation whenever someone is kidnapped from a carwash. And then lastly, the continued collaboration, the coalition of workers rights organizations who continue to elevate the crisis that is happening. We’ve partnered with NDLON, the National Day Labor Organizing Network – continuing to partner with the different organizations that are leading the fight to continue to protect our communities.

The people that are being targeted at carwashes are some of our most vulnerable community members. The carwash industry is comprised of predominately Latino males, but there’s also a lot of women in the industry. And some of them have been in the industry for decades. You’re not just talking about people who just got here last year. You’re talking about people that have been in our community for 30 years or more. There are senior citizens. Many of them have existing illnesses. Some of them are cancer survivors.

A lot of carwash workers have been detained since these operations began. What can you tell us about how their cases are playing out in immigration court so far?

Andrea: Our organization has been able to identify at least 346 carwash workers that have been kidnapped from a carwash. We’ve identified at least over 100 who were forced or coerced into signing a voluntary departure – which essentially means they didn’t even get a chance to fight their case. They were not given access to due process. These people are not the “worst of the worst”, their only crime was being at a carwash and coming to this country to seek a better life.

Norma: We know that there must be other workers we were never able to identify. We have a list of approximately 101 carwashes that have been raided. Some of these carwashes have been raided four or five times. And these federal agents before leaving, will say “we’ll be back”.

Andrea: Through our legal fund, we’ve been able to help some of those families fight against their deportation. We’ve been able to successfully get 20 carwash workers out on bond. All of them except one have been able to get bond through filing a habeas petition.

Others are still in detention. The administration’s changes have meant that the only way in which people are being granted bond at the moment is through the habeas corpus petition, and fighting that requires the help of another attorney. When a lot of our communities can barely afford an immigration attorney to represent their loved one in deportation proceedings, you can imagine just how inaccessible it is for people then to have to hire a separate attorney to have to file a lawsuit in federal court.

I think that has been the reason why so many people get coerced into signing, because they’re told: “You’re going to be in there forever – you’re going to be in there for six months or more.”

We’re really sad when we hear they signed, and if they’re from Mexico, sometimes if they’re detained on a Monday or on Tuesday they’ll already be in Tijuana. In a matter of 12 hours people’s lives can change.

Is it fair to say in the last 11 months Clean has come to almost fill that role of making sure that people don’t disappear into the detention system?

Andrea: That is our role. A lot of workers are here in the US on their own. If they don’t come home, they don’t have somebody waiting for them at home – they don’t even know that they disappeared.

What we’ve also found is that sometimes, because they are churchgoers, so they belong to a church community, their pastor or their church family, will be the ones in communication with Clean fighting for their liberation.

That is essentially what our role has become. But we’re also trying to find people before they disappear. Going out to carwashes, talking to employers, trying to let car washers know there’s a community that exists – that there’s a community that they should become a part of, so that whenever the worst happens, they know who to run to, they know who to call.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925d8205cdd39af3002ae9671fdefeb1a8a3eb77/465_0_4913_3930/master/4913.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f33d3f00034eed4608cc47452fcd61f1",N,,2025-12-02 09:59:20.430014

In a statement, the Coalition called the administration’s actions ""yet another step in a long-running campaign to dismantle every pathway — formal, lawful, and humanitarian—that allows Black and Brown immigrants to come to the United States safely.""

It is urging Congress to “reject these reckless actions and demand policies rooted in humanity, legality, and truth—not fear or opportunism.”

The coalition argues that the administration is not interested in creating orderly or legal processes for migrants, but rather in blocking access based on origin.

“For years, we have heard the phrase 'people should come the right way'. Yet, these actions make it clear that this administration does not want to establish legal pathways either,” said Tessa Petit, Executive Director at FLIC, in a statement on Monday.

“By shutting down asylum access, suspending immigration from developing nations, and restricting visas from regions whose populations are overwhelmingly Black and Brown, the administration is signaling that the issue is not process—it is people.”

The Coalition accused the administration of using the ""regrettable and tragic shooting of two National Guard members as a political weapon to justify extreme restrictions that have nothing to do with the facts of that incident.""

Since last week's shooting of two National Guard members in the nation’s capital by a suspect who is an Afghan national, the Trump administration announced a flurry of policies aimed at making it harder for some foreigners to enter or stay in the country.

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries ""of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment.

Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed.

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they're granted asylum, they're allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S.

Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5566ec8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1140x599+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwlrn%2Ffiles%2F201908%2FImmigration_Public_Benefits_36353.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 10:59:52.416675

Most Louisiana agencies and local offices with 287(g) agreements are under the task force model.","As President Donald Trump's administration presses federal agencies to ramp up immigration enforcement across the country, dozens of state and local agencies in Louisiana have entered into agreements pledging to assist with operations in the state.

Immigration enforcement is expected to expand swiftly in Louisiana this week as the Border Patrol mounts an operation dubbed ""Swamp Sweep,"" and recent arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the greater New Orleans area are stoking fears across local immigrant communities.

ICE agents arrested four people on Wednesday outside the Westside South Shopping Center in Gretna, and videos shared to social media showed Gretna Police Department officers assisting agents in detaining people. Deputy Police Chief Jason DiMarco said his agency did not charge anyone involved with state or local laws.

The Gretna Police Department is one of many local agencies that have joined a growing Department of Homeland Security program, known as 287(g) agreements, which partners local law enforcement and ICE. Officers with the Kenner Police Department, who also have a 287(g) agreement, helped federal law enforcement last month with a raid at a Kenner boat launch that led to the arrests of 15 people.

The agreements allow ICE ""to partner with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove criminal aliens who are amenable to removal from the U.S.,"" according to DHS. The program has long faced criticism over concerns about racial profiling and inadequate training for local police.

In May, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued an executive order requiring the Louisiana State Police, the Department of Public Safety & Corrections, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the State Fire Marshal and the Louisiana National Guard to join the 287(g) program.

The agreements are strictly with ICE and it is not yet clear if local or state agencies will assist the estimated 250 Border Patrol agents when they arrive. But state officials, including Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, have praised the plan and urged locals not to obstruct ICE or Border Patrol operations.

Types of agreements

The 287(g) program's existence dates back to 1996 when Congress approved the Immigration and Nationality Act. It has since been vastly expanded under Trump.

ICE has typically entered two kinds of deals with local law enforcement under 287(g) agreements: ""jail enforcement"" agreements, which allow deputized local officers to interrogate people about their immigration status once they're held in jail, and ""warrant service officer"" agreements, a creation of the first Trump administration under which local cops are trained and certified to execute immigration warrants.

Trump this year reinstated a third particularly controversial version of those agreements, the so-called ""task force model,"" which empowers local officers to conduct immigration enforcement during the course of their normal policing duties.

Most Louisiana agencies and local offices with 287(g) agreements are under the task force model.

“We were hurting, we were abandoned — and instead of help, we got soldiers with rifles,” one speaker told the crowd.
Standing near the edge of the crowd, 12-year-old Harry Masters said he came because many of his friends and community members are immigrants.
“They’re very important to the community, so it’s not good that they’re being forced out of their homes,” he said.
“The immigrants in our community are generally really helpful, good people, caring members of the community,” she said.","Several dozen people marched through downtown New Orleans on Monday evening, braving heavy rain to protest the expected deployment of about 250 Border Patrol agents to the city as part of “Operation Swamp Sweep.”

Chants of “The people united will never be defeated” and “No ICE, no fear — immigrants are welcome here” echoed off the buildings surrounding City Hall, where the crowd gathered after marching several blocks.

The federal immigration enforcement surge reportedly aims to arrest 5,000 people. Some news outlets reported the intended Dec. 1 start date did not come to pass. The protest, however, follows a raid last week in Gretna, where five people were arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers outside a Home Depot in what advocates say is a sign of more aggressive enforcement to come.

Among those addressing the crowd was Mitch Gonzalez, who told protesters that people close to them have already been detained and removed from the United States.

“This is my home,” Gonzalez said. “My trans sister was kidnapped and taken from me. Now she has to fight from Mexico, not even her home country, because they’re snatching people.”

Protesters emphasized that the raids and the presence of federal officers on city streets were instilling widespread fear, including among U.S. citizens and lawful residents. Others invoked the city’s history, drawing parallels to the military presence that followed Hurricane Katrina.

“We were hurting, we were abandoned — and instead of help, we got soldiers with rifles,” one speaker told the crowd. “Now again, they’re telling us the answer is more force, more surveillance. But we need housing, we need health care, we need real jobs — not soldiers.”

While many speakers were seasoned organizers, others were newer to demonstrations. Standing near the edge of the crowd, 12-year-old Harry Masters said he came because many of his friends and community members are immigrants.

“They’re very important to the community, so it’s not good that they’re being forced out of their homes,” he said.

He worried the raids would damage the city: “There’s no possible positive outcome.”

His mother, Diane Masters, said New Orleans doesn’t have an “immigrant crime problem” and described the federal tactics as unnecessary and harmful.

“The immigrants in our community are generally really helpful, good people, caring members of the community,” she said. “It’s not fair to be terrorizing people.”

Other longtime residents echoed that message. Kristen Dugas said she attended because New Orleans “was founded and built by Black and brown hands and immigrants.”

“Don’t come in our city that welcomes immigrants from the get-go and tell us we’re slamming doors in their faces,” she said. “No. Wrong.”

The protest was organized by New Orleans Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, with the support of groups including Freedom Road Socialist Organization, Indivisible NOLA, and Union Migrante, among others.

Late on Thanksgiving Day, Mr. Trump, who has used derogatory language to describe immigrants since the shooting, had said on social media that he intended to “permanently pause migration from all third world countries.” He also spoke of “reverse migration,” floating the possibility of stripping naturalized American citizens of their citizenship and vowing to deport all immigrants that he saw as “non-compatible with Western Civilization.”

The White House referred questions on the travel ban to the Department of Homeland Security. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman said that the agency would “be announcing the list soon.” The State Department is the federal agency that typically sets entry requirements for immigrants and foreign travelers, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Within days of the shooting of two Guard members less than half a mile from the White House, the Trump administration had halted the asylum process for all migrants in the United States, begun a review of green cards for people from 19 countries, mostly from the Middle East or Africa, and barred Afghans from entering the country.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Mr. Trump said that he intended to pause asylum for “a long time” because “we don’t want those people.”

In response to that shooting, President Trump is ordering a review of all Afghan nationals in the US and halting —

He says he has halted all asylum decisions after the ambush attack on the two National Guard members.

michael barbaro

President Trump has ordered a sweeping new crackdown on immigration —

archived recording 4

He’s also promising to expel millions of immigrants already here, revoking their legal status.

michael barbaro

— that has left almost no corner of the system untouched.

archived recording 5

He claimed he’s ready to expel anyone who is, quote, not a net asset to the United States. And he threatened to end immigration from, quote, all third-world countries.

michael barbaro

Today, my colleague, Hamed Aleaziz, on the shooter’s journey to the United States and the Trump administration’s wide-ranging response.

[THEME MUSIC]

It’s Monday, December 1.

Hamed, we are turning to you because what began as a horrific shooting in downtown Washington last week has now become a set of far-reaching changes to the US immigration system, which you cover for “The Times.” Just how far reaching would you say these changes are?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, even for an administration that has rewritten all the rules on how to handle immigration, what we’ve seen in just the last couple days has been remarkable. They have blocked pathways for people to come to this country, to remain in the country, and at the same time are going back and reviewing the records of people who have already gained status in the United States. And I haven’t seen anything like this during my time covering immigration.

michael barbaro

That fallout, which we will discuss in detail in this conversation because it very much feels like a template for the future of immigration policy in the US, it feels like it very much hinges on the specific of who the shooter in this case was, where he came from, the circumstances of how he came into the US. So let’s talk about that.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, the shooter’s name is Rahmanullah Lakanwal. He grew up in Afghanistan during this time period in which the United States had invaded. In fact, he was only five years old when 9/11 happened. And, of course, we know that the United States came into Afghanistan shortly afterward. During that time, the United States relied heavily on local troops. And one of the key groups that was essential to the United States presence in Afghanistan was this group called Zero Unit.

michael barbaro

Zero Unit. What is that?

hamed aleaziz

They were basically a CIA-backed group that hunted Taliban members, were really highly trained, highly vetted by the US government. Essentially reported to the US government and went after key leaders in the Taliban power structure.

michael barbaro

Kind of the tip of the spear when it comes to the US government and military in Afghanistan.

hamed aleaziz

Exactly. And Mr. Lakanwal was a part of that group. He was recruited by the CIA to join this unit. And his brother was a key leader in the group as well. So as a family, they were really enmeshed in this organization that was essential to the United States’ ability to maintain security in Afghanistan.

But human rights organizations criticized the work of this Zero Unit group. They alleged that Zero Unit went further than was necessary, and they called them death squads. They were conducting extrajudicial killings, killing civilians. These are all allegations that were made during this time about this group.

michael barbaro

And how comfortable were people like Lakanwal, Afghans in carrying out this kind of alleged brutality against other Afghans?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, what we’ve learned is that Mr. Lakanwal specifically really struggled with the actions that his group undertook in Afghanistan. And he expressed this to a friend in Afghanistan who actually spoke with one of our colleagues. And this friend said that Mr. Lakanwal was going through some mental health issues.

And really, in his telling, this was clearly somebody who was traumatized from his experience as a part of Zero Unit. But despite that, he remained in this unit up until the Taliban took over the country in 2021.

michael barbaro

Well, bring us to that very dramatic moment. What happens to Lakanwal when the US announces it’s going to withdraw, which, as we all remember, then brings the Taliban through the country toward Kabul, the Afghan military collapses in days, and the US military flees in what I think we can all agree is a kind of chaotic and somewhat humiliating withdrawal.

hamed aleaziz

For Lakanwal and other Afghans who closely helped the United States government, suddenly, they become targets for the Taliban. And there’s this incredible pressure on the Biden administration to not leave behind those people who risked their lives in protecting the United States government.

michael barbaro

Essentially, they are traitors to the now re-empowered Taliban.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah. And Mr. Lakanwal, along with other members of the Zero Unit, were among the first people to flee Afghanistan and be brought by the United States government to America for protection.

michael barbaro

So he’s brought to the United States by the Biden administration. What are his circumstances like? And what kind of vetting process occurs before he even gets to the US?

hamed aleaziz

So he comes to the United States as part of a program called Operation Allies Welcome. And as part of this program, the Biden administration set up layers of vetting. They collected biometrics from these people, and they ran their information through US databases for any potential terrorism hits, criminal hits, any potentially derogatory information. And then when these individuals came to the United States, the Department of Homeland Security conducted another layer of vetting by Customs and Border Protection officers at the airports.

michael barbaro

So pretty rigorous.

hamed aleaziz

Pretty rigorous. But at the same time, I think it’s important to note that the agency’s inspector general found that the Biden administration had allowed two people who were potential national security threats to enter the country despite that vetting. This was a really hurried process. This wasn’t something that was planned years in the making, months in the making. So there were clear issues with this program.

And Mr. Lakanwal comes really quickly as one of the first groups of people to arrive in the United States as part of this program in September 2021. He settles down in Bellingham, Washington, a town that’s near the Canadian border. And he’s trying to find jobs there. He’s a delivery driver.

He’s staying with his wife and five children in a apartment complex that is a place where people who are down on their luck are trying to rebuild their lives. But despite these kind of challenging circumstances for him, in April, during the Trump administration, he gains asylum.

michael barbaro

So he enters the US under the Biden administration, but he is officially granted asylum under the Trump administration.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, the Biden administration brought these people over from Afghanistan under a power known as parole. This is a temporary status that only lasts a few years. It did not provide these Afghans with a chance to stay in the country permanently. That was on Afghans individually in the country to figure out a way to stay here.

michael barbaro

And in this case, he figured it out.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, this was clearly good news for him to get asylum, to have a chance to remain in the United States, to gain a green card, to gain US citizenship. He was on that pathway. But the next thing we know is that he decides to drive from Bellingham, Washington, all across the country to Washington, DC, where he finds himself in the downtown of the city, about a block or two from the White House.

This is an area that has a lot of people going through it. And there are restaurants and coffee shops. And he is walking on the sidewalk near a bus stop, where he comes across two National Guard members from West Virginia, Sarah Beckstrom, a 20-year-old, and Andrew Wolfe, a 24-year-old. And Mr. Lakanwal decides to pull out his gun and shoot both of them multiple times.

As part of that gunfire, he himself takes on shots, and he is down on the ground. These shots were heard by colleagues here at “The New York Times.” Our bureau is very close to the site of this shooting. And just a day later, we found out that one of the guard members, Ms. Beckstrom, had died from her gunshot wounds.

michael barbaro

And suddenly, all of these dramas are colliding. The war in Afghanistan, which Trump loathed as a forever war, and his use of National Guard across American cities, it’s all colliding. And it’s a very strange moment.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, definitely. And you can see how, for President Trump, this is something that he personally is tied to.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

And for him, I think it really confirms a lot of the claims that he’s made in the past, a lot of his worst fears that an immigrant from a far-flung country would come here and shoot two US military members near the White House. And I think that’s really reason for him, in his mind and his advisors’ mind, to undertake a crackdown on the immigration system that’s unlike anything that we’ve seen this year.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

So, Hamed, describe what happens to the immigration system in the days since this shooting and how the Trump administration has explained those actions.

hamed aleaziz

In the telling of top Trump administration officials —

archived recording (jeanine pirro)

A 29-year-old Afghan who entered the United States under Biden’s Operation Allies Welcome, a program following the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. This is what happens —

hamed aleaziz

— including US Attorney Jeanine Pirro —

archived recording (kash patel)

This individual is in this country for one reason and one reason alone, the failure to vet in any way, shape, or form this individual and countless others.

hamed aleaziz

— the FBI director, Kash Patel —

archived recording (donald trump)

He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021 on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about. Nobody knew who was coming in. Nobody knew anything about it. His status was —

hamed aleaziz

— and President Trump himself, this shooting was the result of a series of Biden administration failures, not only in the way that they ended the war, which President Trump has often criticized, but in the way that they let these Afghans, including Mr. Lakanwal, into the country without, in their words, the necessary vetting.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

michael barbaro

Does the White House point to anything specific as they’re critiquing the vetting process? Because, of course, as you told us a little bit earlier in this conversation, it’s the Trump administration that grants that final asylum.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, no, there’s nothing specifically that they’re pointing to. And when President Trump was asked about this idea that they granted this man asylum during his administration in April, he wouldn’t engage with that answer. And again, he returned to this idea that Biden brought him. And once people are brought to this country, there’s not much that they can do. That’s essentially what he said.

michael barbaro

Understood. So let’s now turn to the crackdown that Trump has undertaken to the immigration system over the past few days and really understand the details of it.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, basically, in a matter of days, the Trump administration takes a series of actions that have just massive implications. At first, the Department of Homeland Security announces a pause on all immigration applications filed by Afghan immigrants. So for Afghans in the United States, this means a pause on their ability to seek a green card, US citizenship. For them, their ability to stay in this country long term is now on hold.

michael barbaro

All that’s just being shut down. Temporarily, perhaps, but shut down.

hamed aleaziz

Yes, exactly. And they build on that. They say they will review all asylum applications that were granted during the Biden administration. They’re going —

michael barbaro

No matter which country the asylum seeker’s from.

hamed aleaziz

All of it. They’re going to go back and look at those applications and figure out if there were any issues with those grants. And again, building on this idea that the Biden administration, in their words, did not do enough vetting.

michael barbaro

So suddenly, we’re now talking about a pause not just in those seeking asylum from Afghanistan, but potentially thousands or tens of thousands of people seeking asylum from any country in the world.

hamed aleaziz

Exactly. So they’re going back to look at those records. And they take it even a step further. They decide that, actually, we’re going to review all green card holders from countries that President Trump already banned from travel to the United States. These were countries like Iran, Eritrea, Sudan, and others. So people who are already in the United States who’ve gone through a lot of process now have their applications under review.

michael barbaro

In a sense, this is a retrospective look back at those who have, in some cases, already been granted their green cards. They’re basically saying the old system is suspect, so we will reopen your green card.

hamed aleaziz

There is definitely that potential. They’re going to go back and look at potentially hundreds of thousands of records.

michael barbaro

Wow.

hamed aleaziz

A massive review. We don’t how this is going to take shape and how they’re going to do this, but they’ve announced that they will do this. And then on Friday, after they’d already announced that they were going to review all the people that had gotten asylum between 2021 and 2024, but now people already in the United States trying to gain asylum in the process, those applications are now on hold as well, really going after the entire asylum system.

And on that same day, the State Department announces that there will be no more visas for Afghan nationals, cutting off another way for Afghans to enter the United States. And, in fact, a State Department cable that we obtained detailed how Afghan nationals who already had their visas granted and printed and were going to be dispersed to those Afghans, those needed to be destroyed.

michael barbaro

Wow.

hamed aleaziz

So they’re taking every step possible to target Afghans, not only in America, but abroad.

michael barbaro

And not just from what you said, Afghans, but really anyone seeking asylum or a green card. In a very real sense, it feels like the entire system of giving foreigners refuge in the US for political or economic circumstances is on pause.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, what’s really remarkable here is this idea that, yes, we’re going to pause a bunch of people from entering the United States. But we’re also going to go back, and we’re going to review people who’ve already obtained a form of status in the United States. We’re going to go back and look at those records as well. So it’s not only prospective, but it’s retrospective as well.

michael barbaro

Does this administration have the legal power to do everything you’re describing because it is so sweeping and so retrospective?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, these will undoubtedly lead to legal challenges, especially this idea of going back. These are people who have gone through layers of vetting, layers of interviews, extensive interaction with the US government that if they take action on those people, that will lead to, I think, legal action across the United States.

michael barbaro

So we’re going to have to wait and see how this plays out in our legal system. I want to return for just a moment to Afghanistan because as broad as some of these potential changes to our immigration system are, what stands out to me is what these changes will mean for the future of that promise that the US made to Afghans who helped America in the war.

And in the case of Lakanwal, yes, the promise was kept. But it’s clear from Trump’s actions that the promise won’t be kept for anyone else from Afghanistan in the future. And there’s a very revealing exchange about this on social media over the past couple of days that I want to discuss with you. It begins with an editorial from “The Wall Street Journal,” which is a very conservative editorial board. And I’m going to read you what they wrote in this editorial.

hamed aleaziz

OK.

michael barbaro

Quote, “Some will say that the shooting in downtown Washington means that the United States should never admit refugees like Lakanwal. But the alternative is abandoning allies who assist Americans in war.” And the editorial goes on to say, “You can be sure Americans will fight overseas again, and our troops will need allies on the ground to succeed.

How many,” the editorial asks, “will assist the US if they believe that there will be no exit for them?” Basically, this editorial asks, what happens when the US just leaves people behind on the battlefield?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, and one person who reads this editorial and disagrees with it strongly is the chief of President Trump’s immigration crackdown, Stephen Miller. He went online on social media and said, quote, “This is the great lie of mass migration. You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies. No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders. At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions and terrors of their broken homelands.”

michael barbaro

Will you just translate that?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, I think what’s remarkable about this tweet is that Miller is not only turning to the immigrants themselves who arrive in the United States, but he’s saying that their children are a threat as well.

michael barbaro

Right. And I think it’s worth saying just how much the “Wall Street Journal” editorial and Stephen Miller’s statements completely talk past each other because the editorial is saying that American credibility and the future of our foreign policy requires us to keep our commitments to those who risk their lives for the US, that it’s foundational to our ability to function in the world.

Miller’s statement completely bypasses that and says broken people from broken societies are just an existential danger to the US. Therefore, we can’t let them in. But what Miller’s argument doesn’t grapple with at all is the reality that America played a part, and a pretty big part, in breaking Afghanistan in the first place.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, for Miller, that’s besides the point. It’s not about what America owes people and countries. It’s about who’s good for the United States and who’s not good. People who are from countries that he has deemed to be failed societies do not deserve the opportunity to come to America.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s kind of an open embrace of collective punishment because, in Lakanwal, we clearly have someone who, and we don’t quite understand the mechanics of it, but becomes, at some point in his life, radicalized. But he’s just one of thousands, if not tens of thousands of Afghans who the US previously made a commitment to to protect and bring to the US. And Trump and Stephen Miller are now saying because one of them did this thing, none of them can come to the US.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, exactly. I think that’s right. But I also just want to point out this idea that you’re mentioning, collective punishment. These Afghans who helped the American military have been supported by veterans. I’ve spoken with veterans who have personally tried to bring those people who helped them translators and others to the United States, bring them to safety.

The plot point of this idea of Afghans helping American military members has been in movies and shows. And for now, this idea of helping Afghans who helped the American military in Afghanistan, that’s over.

michael barbaro

Just to end, Hamed, I don’t want to entirely lose sight of the National Guard and its place in this story. The second guardsman who was shot remains in critical condition in the hospital. And this deployment of the National Guard in Washington remains a source of really profound controversy.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, this idea of bringing the federal forces to the city was really opposed by a lot of citizens in Washington, DC.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

But in the days since the shooting, President Trump has announced that he was planning to send 500 more National Guard members to Washington, DC. So now this deployment, far from shrinking because of this shooting, is now going to expand because of it.

michael barbaro

Well, Hamed, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

hamed aleaziz

Thank you for having me. [MUSIC PLAYING]

michael barbaro

On Sunday, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, told NBC News that the alleged shooter may not have become radicalized until after he immigrated to the United States. That conclusion, if true, could undermine the Trump administration’s claims that the Biden administration had failed to properly vet him before he arrived into the country. We’ll be right back.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Here’s what else you need to know today. Over the past few days, President Trump has carried out a series of profoundly contradictory actions in his war against drug cartels. Trump declared in a post on social media that the airspace above and around Venezuela, which he has accused of flooding the US with drugs, should now be considered closed. It was his latest threat against the regime of Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro.

But at the same time, Trump announced a full pardon of a former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, who has been convicted in US federal court of conspiring with local drug cartels to bring vast amounts of cocaine into the United States.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, members of Congress from both parties said that the Trump administration may have committed a war crime in its offensive against boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean. According to “The Washington Post,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to kill everyone aboard such boats, leading a US military commander to carry out a second strike to kill those who had survived an initial airstrike back in September.

archived recording 1

Do you believe if there was a second strike to eliminate any survivors that that constitutes a war crime?

archived recording 2

It seems to. If what has been reported is accurate, I’ve got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over. Going after survivors in the water, that is clearly not lawful.

michael barbaro

Both Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona on CNN and Republican Representative Mike Turner of Ohio on CBS said that such a second strike would violate the rules of war.

archived recording (mike turner)

Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious. And I agree that that would be an illegal act.

michael barbaro

Turner said that the post reporting on the second strike would become the focus of an existing congressional investigation into the airstrikes on the boats.

It came after an immigration judge who was fired by the Trump administration filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, alleging she is a victim of unlawful discrimination.
The former Cleveland judge is among the more than 100 immigration judges who have been fired or resigned through the Department of Government Efficiency's ""Fork in the Road"" offer, or transferred out of immigration adjudication, according to the union representing immigration judges.

The former immigration judge is asking a court in D.C. for a ""declaration that the government violated her rights; reinstatement; and compensatory damages.""","The Trump administration fired eight immigration judges on Monday, according to an official with the National Association of Immigration Judges.

The judges who were dismissed worked at 26 Federal Plaza.

It came after an immigration judge who was fired by the Trump administration filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, alleging she is a victim of unlawful discrimination.

Tania Nemer, a former immigration judge in Ohio, filed a lawsuit Monday claiming she was dismissed based on her gender, her dual citizenship with the country of Lebanon, and her previous run for local office as a Democrat, in violation of civil rights law.

Nemer was ""abruptly fired"" in the middle of her probationary period despite receiving ""the highest possible performance,"" the lawsuit alleges.

Mass exodus of immigration officials could delay millions of deportations

""The lightning-fast, precipitous timing indicates that the incoming Administration's decision was made -- not as part of a careful evaluation of Ms. Nemer's qualifications or fitness for office -- but instead as part of a rushed attempt by the new Administration to target disfavored civil servants,"" the complaint states.

The former Cleveland judge is among the more than 100 immigration judges who have been fired or resigned through the Department of Government Efficiency's ""Fork in the Road"" offer, or transferred out of immigration adjudication, according to the union representing immigration judges.

The latest firings also come as the Department of Homeland Security is actively hiring ""deportation judges.""

In a post on X last week, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the jobs offer potential full-time remote work with salaries ranging from $159,951 to $207,500.

Immigrant advocates have called out the Trump administration for dismissing immigration judges who have experience in immigration law. There is also a backlog of more than 3.7 million immigration cases.

Nemer's attorneys said in the filing that she was escorted out of court at the time of her dismissal, and that Nemer's supervisor and the acting chief immigration judge both said they did not know why she was being fired.

""And to this day, the government has failed to offer any coherent and legitimate nondiscriminatory rationale for her termination,"" the lawyers wrote.

Shortly after she was fired, Nemer filed a formal discrimination complaint with an Equal Employment Opportunity office, which dismissed the case.

""The EEO office issued a final agency decision that dismissed Ms. Nemer's complaint and asserted that Title VII does not constrain discriminatory dismissal against immigration judges because the statute purportedly conflicts with the Article II removal power,"" according to the complaint.

""That is simply not true,"" her attorneys said in the complaint. ""Nothing in the Constitution gives the executive branch the right to discriminate.""

The lawyers called the DOJ's position that it can fire federal employees without a reason -- despite civil rights statutes -- a ""breathtaking assault on a landmark federal statute.""

According to the complaint, a DOJ official submitted an affidavit that detailed driving infractions involving Nemer, as well as two local tax cases from 2010 and 2011, which the former immigration judge alleged in the complaint that she had disclosed as part of a background check to become an immigration judge.

Nemer's attorneys said in the complaint that the DOJ official ""created the misleading impression that the prior infractions were somehow connected to Nemer's termination.""

The former immigration judge is asking a court in D.C. for a ""declaration that the government violated her rights; reinstatement; and compensatory damages.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oXj9Ch_ShtwwRX26xXusPg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.go.com/4c19f1ef27cca818cd1132cd6a55ef88,N,,2025-12-02 09:59:09.645153

v. Tarrant County, decided to drop it.
But it ends one of two lawsuits accusing Tarrant County of illegal racial gerrymandering.
In an emailed statement, Republican County Judge Tim O’Hare welcomed the news.
“An obvious explanation for the disparity exists: race and partisanship are highly correlated in Tarrant County, and districting decisions driven by partisanship will often have disparate racial effects,” their ruling read.","A group of Tarrant County residents who sued over the county’s new commissioners court precinct map withdrew their lawsuit Monday.

It’s not clear from court filings why the group that filed the case, titled Jackson et. al. v. Tarrant County, decided to drop it. But it ends one of two lawsuits accusing Tarrant County of illegal racial gerrymandering.

KERA News has reached out to attorneys on both sides for comment.

In an emailed statement, Republican County Judge Tim O’Hare welcomed the news.

“The Commissioners Court’s action to redistrict was constitutional from the outset and remains so,” he said. “With today’s legal development, Tarrant County will continue to stand as the best place to live and run a business in America.”

Earlier this year, O’Hare and Tarrant County’s Republican commissioners pushed ahead with an unusual mid-decade redistricting effort, redrawing the precinct lines in their own favor. Opponents countered with two lawsuits, accusing the Republicans of creating a new right-leaning seat by shoving a disproportionate amount of Black and brown residents into one precinct.

In both cases, judges allowed the map to go into effect.

In October, federal appeals court judges evaluating the Jackson case acknowledged the new map disproportionately affects Black and Latino voters. But they decided the complainants failed to prove commissioners had anything but partisan intentions.

“An obvious explanation for the disparity exists: race and partisanship are highly correlated in Tarrant County, and districting decisions driven by partisanship will often have disparate racial effects,” their ruling read.

The second lawsuit over the county’s redistricting, brought by the League of Women Voters of Tarrant County and the League of United Latin American Citizens of Fort Worth, is still pending in a county district court, online records show.

The Jackson case’s withdrawal was “highly predictable,” Republican County Commissioner Matt Krause wrote in a Facebook post.

“This Democrat law firm wasted taxpayer funds by filing such an obviously meritless lawsuit. Maybe they should refund the taxpayers for having to defend it?” he wrote, adding a smiley face emoji.

A court battle over Texas’ new congressional maps, also redrawn to favor Republicans, is underway.

The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily restored the new map after a lower court ruled it was racially gerrymandered. It remains unclear which map will be in effect for next year’s midterm elections.

I'm Native American.
They can also use people speaking Spanish, accented English, and working certain physical labor jobs to guess if someone is in the country without legal status.
Gabe Galanda, a Native American civil rights attorney, refers to what Miles experienced as “racialized profiling.” “They are being profiled based upon their skin color and their phenotype,” he said.
“This is reality,” said Miles, now worried about her in-laws and her extended family who come from Mexico and have mixed immigration status.","Amid the increase of reports of ICE arrests in the cities surrounding Seattle over the past weeks, a member of a federally recognized tribe says she was also stopped and interrogated by apparent immigration officials.

Elaine Miles is an actress best known for her role in the TV series “Northern Exposure” and, more recently, in an episode of HBO's “The Last of Us.” Miles is a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation near Pendleton, Oregon.

She was waiting for a bus in Redmond on Nov. 3, on the same day ICE arrested three people at a nearby shopping mall. Miles said she was also briefly stopped and questioned about her legal status.

Miles says a man ran up to her and started talking to her. She then noticed he had a hand on his gun.

“And I was looking at him, like, ‘What? What did I do?’” Miles said. “And then he's like, are you Mexican? And I go, ‘No, I'm not. I'm Native American. You want to see my tribal ID?’”

Redmond police did confirm ICE made the arrests at that location, including smashing a man's window to pull him out of a car.

Earlier this year, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation posted a statement on its social media, urging its members to keep their tribal membership cards on them “at all times, especially in PUBLIC,” for circumstances just like this. She said the officer who stopped her initially didn’t believe her tribal membership.

“Then these other men come up,” she said. “And it's scary when they run up on you. It's like, 'what did I do?'”

ICE did not respond to questions about why Miles was stopped, but U.S. immigration law gives agents authority to stop and question people in cases where they have ""reasonable suspicion"" about an individual’s legal status.

The factors ICE can use to make that determination have recently become the subject of ongoing lawsuits.

In Los Angeles, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling has temporarily allowed immigration enforcement agents operating in that city to use race as one of the reasons for a stop. They can also use people speaking Spanish, accented English, and working certain physical labor jobs to guess if someone is in the country without legal status.

While the legal challenges continue, the ruling in L.A. raises questions about how broadly federal immigration enforcement will be able to use this approach.

Gabe Galanda, a Native American civil rights attorney, refers to what Miles experienced as “racialized profiling.”

“They are being profiled based upon their skin color and their phenotype,” he said. “It's hard to make sense of any of it, but it's particularly hard to make sense of the federal government going after the original peoples of these lands under [the] guise of immigration enforcement.”

Earlier this month, a woman from Arizona’s Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community had an ICE detainer placed on her after serving a monthlong jail sentence in Iowa for driving without a license. It was only when her family brought her birth certificate to the jail that she was let go. The local county sheriff's office in Iowa said it was a human error and she was confused for another detainee with a similar name.

Miles has worked in the film and entertainment industry for decades.

At the beginning of this year, Miles and other co-workers were in New Mexico working on the set of a film where members of the nearby Mescalero Apache Tribe were questioned by ICE. It was a cause for concern, and all tribal members were urged to carry their membership cards.

Days after she was stopped, Miles said her son was also questioned by immigration enforcement at a higher education institution in Bellevue, but they didn’t question his tribal membership like they did for her.

To legal expert Galanda, it’s alarming.

“You should not have the original peoples of this country … for a second feeling uncomfortable about their own sense [of belonging] in this country,” he said. “They belong here more than anybody else in this country.”

The recent mass roundups of immigrant populations reminds Miles of when the U.S. government forcibly removed Japanese Americans from their homes and into internment camps. Miles’ grandmother had Japanese American friends who were taken to the prison camps back then.

Sponsored

“Sometimes they come back,” Miles recalls her grandma saying, “sometimes they didn't come back.”

Miles also remembers her grandma warning her it would happen again. “You can't trust these people,” Miles’ grandmother said. “They're too busy wanting only their country when we were here to begin with.”

Miles points to reports of the federal government planning to use bounty hunters and says it echoes a history of when Native Americans also had bounties placed on them.

Much of the recent messaging from the Department of Homeland Security’s social media appeals to nostalgia, sometimes centralized around white characters. One post titled “A Heritage to be Proud of A Homeland Worth Defending,” shows the painting of American Progress by John Ghast, an allegory to Manifest Destiny. That’s the belief that European American settlers were entitled to expand and control what is now the United States, while pushing others — in the painting's case, Native Americans — out. It and other propaganda shared by the Department of Homeland Security have been repurposed to reinvigorate support for mass immigrant deportation efforts.

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries ""of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed.

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

Here's a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week:

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they're granted asylum, they're allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Justice Department.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn't trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump's January order didn't affect those cases, Edlow's social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency's pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. USCIS said there are currently 1.4 million pending asylum cases at the agency. Just a few years ago, in 2022, it was 241,280, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. Separately there are about 2.4 million pending asylum applications in front of the Justice Department's immigration courts.

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others.

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department’s announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That's nearly 200,000 refugees.

Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.

Late Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested in a post on X that more changes could be in the offing.

Noting that she had just met with Trump, Noem said she was recommending a “full travel ban” on countries she said were flooding the U.S. “with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Noem did not specifically name any countries and no timeline was given. The Department of Homeland Security said in an email Monday, “We will be announcing the list soon.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/14682690-15b5-4903-8293-804cec218adc/wirestory_710973fb9bce4a83a9d979852865cdab_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-02 05:57:29.618394

The eight judges included Amiena A. Khan, the assistant chief immigration judge at 26 Federal Plaza, who supervises other judges there.
Before Monday, about 90 immigration judges had been fired this year across the United States, including six in New York City.
But immigration judges who were fired earlier this year suggested that the administration was targeting judges who were considered too lenient and was also trying to create a feeling of fear.","The Trump administration fired eight immigration judges in New York City on Monday, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

The firings followed an earlier round of job cuts in New York immigration courts and are part of a broader disruption across the country, which is taking place as the president seeks to accelerate deportations.

They were confirmed by an official at the National Association of Immigration Judges, a union representing immigration judges, and a Justice Department official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter. The immigration courts are under the control of the Justice Department.

All the judges were dismissed from the immigration court’s offices at 26 Federal Plaza, a building that houses the New York City headquarters for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and has become the epicenter of migrant arrests in the city. The eight judges included Amiena A. Khan, the assistant chief immigration judge at 26 Federal Plaza, who supervises other judges there.

Before Monday, about 90 immigration judges had been fired this year across the United States, including six in New York City. There are about 600 immigration judges nationwide, according to federal officials. Union officials said that 36 of the fired judges had been replaced nationwide, including two in New York.

Monday’s firings represented a significant downsizing of staff at 26 Federal Plaza, which employs 34 immigration justices. It is one of three federal immigration courts in the city.

“The court has been basically eviscerated,” said Olivia Cassin, who was fired from her job as an immigration judge at another New York City courthouse in November. Ms. Cassin said that she had the job for more than a decade. “It feels like a Monday afternoon massacre.”

A spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, a division of the Justice Department that oversees immigration judges, declined to answer questions about the dismissals, including their cause.

But immigration judges who were fired earlier this year suggested that the administration was targeting judges who were considered too lenient and was also trying to create a feeling of fear.

“All of the judges are now sitting speculating about whether they’re next, and the impact that that may have in their ability to remain impartial and do their jobs fairly,” said Carmen Maria Rey Caldas, who was fired from her job as an immigration judge in August after receiving an email from the Justice Department.

Ms. Rey Caldas is a Spanish immigrant who arrived in the country at age 11 and later became a naturalized citizen. Before becoming an immigration judge in 2022, she had worked as an advocate, drawing criticism from Republicans in 2022 for criticizing ICE during President Trump’s first term.

Monday’s firings occurred two days after nearly 200 protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to thwart a possible ICE raid, drawing the ire of federal officials. The Trump administration has vowed to ramp up deportation efforts in New York, and officials have frequently criticized its so-called sanctuary policies, which prevent local law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration authorities on most matters.

Mr. Trump’s threats against immigrants have intensified since two National Guard members were shot near the White House by a gunman who was identified by the authorities as an Afghan national. In two Truth Social posts, the president wrote that he would stop migration from “all Third World Countries” to enable “the U.S. system to fully recover.”

The courtrooms and holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza have emerged as a symbol of Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown in New York City. For months, scenes of chaos have unfolded as masked federal agents have arrested people showing up for routine check-ins, often drawing protests from onlookers and loved ones. In September, a video journalist was injured during a tumultuous moment involving federal agents outside a courtroom, less than a week after another officer was captured on video shoving a woman in a confrontation.

“The judges who were fired acted as judges — upheld the rule of law, gave equal time to each side, considered the cases carefully and did their jobs as independent adjudicators — for a very long time,” Ms. Cassin said. “It doesn’t make sense.”

Thai authorities extradited Bdap, 33, on November 28, 2025, two days after Thailand’s Court of Appeal upheld a criminal court’s 2024 ruling that he could be sent back to Vietnam. Thai immigration police initially arrested Bdap on immigration charges in Bangkok in 2024, after Vietnamese authorities requested his extradition. Bdap had been living in Thailand since 2018 and had been recognized as a refugee by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; his deportation violates the principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning people to places where they are likely to face persecution.

“The Thai government has blatantly violated the country’s anti-torture law and its international legal obligations by returning Y Quynh Bdap to Vietnam, where he faces a prison sentence after an unfair trial and the risk of torture,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Thai government’s willingness to assist Vietnam in repressing human rights activists is appalling.”

The Vietnamese government persecuted Bdap for years, Human Rights Watch said. Vietnamese state media have accused him of being from a family with “a tradition” of opposing the Vietnamese Communist Party and accused his grandfather of being “a henchman” for the United States during the Vietnam War. His father was imprisoned for three years for “inciting” a public protest.

In 2016, Bdap traveled to Thailand for a conference on religious freedom. When he returned to Vietnam, the Vietnamese police detained him for seven days and interrogated him about his trip. He was subsequently placed under intrusive surveillance, leading him to flee to Bangkok in 2018.

While in Thailand, Bdap founded the Montagnards Stand for Justice, which sought to protect and promote the right to freedom of religion and other rights of Montagnards in Vietnam’s Central Highlands. An Indigenous minority, Montagnards have faced political persecution, forced repudiation of their religious beliefs, shuttering of Christian house churches, and constant monitoring and surveillance by Vietnam security forces.

In June 2023, after an outbreak of violence in Dak Lak province in the Central Highlands, authorities arrested scores of Montagnards and criminally charged them and several others in exile, including Bdap, with “terrorism” and other crimes. During a short mass trial by a “mobile court” in January 2024 involving about 100 defendants, Bdap was convicted in absentia and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

In early March 2024, the Vietnamese government, without providing tangible evidence, labeled the Montagnards Stand for Justice and the Montagnard Support Group as “terrorist” organizations linked to the Dak Lak violence and other anti-state criminal activity.

Days later, Vietnamese police traveled to Thailand and visited two neighborhoods near Bangkok with populations of Montagnard asylum seekers and refugees, questioning dozens about Bdap’s whereabouts, intimidating several with accusations of illegally departing Vietnam, and urging them to return to Vietnam or face criminal charges and extradition.

Thai police then arrested Bdap in June on the basis of an extradition request by Vietnamese authorities. He had been in prison during his extradition trial and appeal, up until his forced return to Vietnam on November 28.

In a November 2025 report, Human Rights Watch documented how Vietnam has increasingly engaged in transnational repression in Thailand, targeting especially exiled ethnic minorities with harassment and intimidation. Thai authorities have increasingly participated in these abuses by cooperating with Vietnamese authorities and allowing Vietnamese police to interrogate asylum seekers and refugees. Exiles and immigration lawyers believe the Vietnam government presses Thailand to keep some exiles in immigration detention indefinitely, by denying them bail, to pressure them to cooperate with Vietnamese police.

UN human rights experts have criticized the misuse of terrorism charges in the 2023 mass trial of Montagnards in Vietnam and the reported use of evidence obtained by torture, and have said that targeting Bdap for his association with the Montagnards Stand For Justice is part of the intensifying discrimination and repression against the Montagnard population. Human Rights Watch has no information about Bdap’s involvement in the 2023 violence in Dak Lak but considers his trial in Vietnam unfair and is gravely concerned about his safety following his extradition to Vietnam.

Vietnamese authorities have not yet confirmed that they have Bdap in their custody.

Concerned foreign governments should strongly press the Vietnamese government to disclose his whereabouts and request access to him given the high risk of torture and other ill-treatment.

Bdap’s extradition violates Thailand’s Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearance Act, which prohibits extradition when there is a substantial risk of torture or ill-treatment upon return.

Thailand is also obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other serious ill-treatment, or a threat to their life. This principle is codified in the Convention Against Torture, to which Thailand is a party, and customary international law.

“The Bdap case demonstrates the Thai government’s unwillingness to respect international law and protect foreign human rights advocates who live in Thailand,” Pearson said. “Concerned governments should expedite resettlement of Vietnamese and other nationals at risk in Thailand to places where they will be safe.”",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2024/06/202406asia_thailand_Y-Quynh-Bdap.jpg?h=6189ac6c&itok=tkNuIxBD,N,,2025-12-01 20:57:59.353318

For months, Mr. Duffy has been threatening consequences for centers that enable drivers without proper qualifications and authorization to get commercial licenses.
Since then, the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted the arrests of dozens of cases of undocumented immigrants working as truck drivers.
“If you are unwilling to follow the rules, you have no place training America’s commercial drivers,” F.M.C.S.A.
He added that the Trump administration had “sent the right message” and that centers who were “issuing certificates to anyone who can fog a mirror” were “on notice.”","The Trump administration has revoked the accreditation of thousands of training centers that helped people obtain commercial driver’s licenses and threatened thousands more, senior administration officials announced on Monday, amid a widening campaign against noncitizen truck drivers.

According to an announcement from the Department of Transportation, nearly 3,000 of the estimated 16,000 training providers listed in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s Training Provider Registry have been removed “for failing to equip trainees with the Trump Administration’s standards of readiness.” The announcement said that another 4,000 had been warned that they would be removed for “noncompliance” with the standards within 30 days, unless they could prove otherwise. That could mean that more than 40 percent of U.S. training facilities would no longer be able to credential drivers.

“Under President Trump, we are reigning in illegal and reckless practices that let poorly trained drivers get behind the wheel of semi-trucks and school buses,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement accompanying the announcement.

For months, Mr. Duffy has been threatening consequences for centers that enable drivers without proper qualifications and authorization to get commercial licenses. To date, his warnings have focused largely on immigrant drivers and states that allow those without authorization to be in the United States to legally get behind the wheel of a truck.

The Trump administration began to raise alarms about illegal immigration in trucking after an August crash in Florida, in which an immigrant accused of being in the country without authorization made an illegal U-turn, causing a crash that killed three people.

Since then, the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted the arrests of dozens of cases of undocumented immigrants working as truck drivers. The Transportation Department in September issued emergency orders to make it more difficult for many noncitizens to obtain commercial driver’s licenses and threatened to withhold federal funding from states that failed to enforce new English-language proficiency standards for truckers or failed to revoke the licenses of drivers working in the United States without authorization.

According to a recent report by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, an advocacy group headquartered in Arlington, Va., the changes could result in nearly 200,000 people losing their commercial driver’s licenses — among them “refugees, asylees, humanitarian parolees and DACA recipients” — worsening what some report is an already severe shortage of truckers.

Mr. Duffy and some industry experts have pushed back on the idea that there is any lack of willing American truckers. Mr. Duffy has insisted that the national shortage of truck drivers, which was widely noted during the pandemic, stemmed from falling wages due to competition from drivers without proper credentials.

Monday’s announcement made no direct references to immigration status for drivers, legal or otherwise. The training facilities facing removal had been targeted, according to the Transportation Department, because they had either falsified or manipulated training data, neglected to meet curriculum standards or instructor qualifications or failed to maintain and provide complete documentation during audits.

“If you are unwilling to follow the rules, you have no place training America’s commercial drivers,” F.M.C.S.A. Administrator Derek D. Barrs said in the announcement. “We will not tolerate negligence.”

It was not immediately clear how many would-be truckers the move would affect, though the impact could be significant if so many of the country’s training institutes were to lose their accreditation by the end of the year. People seeking a commercial driver’s license are required to complete an entry-level training course, and graduates of entities that lose their accreditation will no longer be recognized as having completed the required course of study

But the move came as welcome news to the trucking industry. In a recent letter to lawmakers, the American Trucking Associations, a trade group, called on Congress to make reforms, including steps to “expedite the removal of noncompliant training providers” from the federal government’s registry.

Late on Monday, the head of the group praised Mr. Duffy’s move.

“Training someone to operate an 80,000-pound vehicle is not a weekend hobby,” said Chris Spear, the president and chief executive of the group. He added that the Trump administration had “sent the right message” and that centers who were “issuing certificates to anyone who can fog a mirror” were “on notice.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/01/multimedia/01trump-news-trucking1-qwzb/01trump-news-trucking1-qwzb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 21:56:32.171918

At the time, the Bush administration created a program known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System that asked for new registration requirements for immigrants from mostly Middle Eastern countries.
Concern over the new measures announced by the Trump administration are now reverberating in Afghan immigrant communities and beyond.
“We are feeling so nervous, hearing that they are reprocessing and reinvestigating those who were issued green cards,” Mr. Bahramuddin said.
With their asylum petition now on hold, she said she worried the obstacles to gaining legal status were becoming only harder, particularly for Black immigrants.","The sweeping crackdown President Trump declared last week after an Afghan national was accused of shooting two National Guard members is poised to radically curtail immigrants from legally entering and living in the United States, putting up roadblocks unparalleled in recent history.

Within a matter of days, the administration rolled out a series of far-reaching policy changes: pausing all asylum decisions for migrants currently in the United States; reviewing the green cards that allow people from 19 countries, mostly from the Middle East or Africa, to live and work permanently in the United States; reassessing the asylum approvals issued during the Biden administration; indefinitely halting immigration applications filed by Afghan nationals; and barring Afghans from entering the country.

The new rules are poised to potentially upend the status of as many as 1.5 million migrants with pending asylum cases in the country, the more than 50,000 who gained asylum from the Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration and untold more who had been hoping to seek refuge in the United States.

And Mr. Trump has hinted that further action could come as a result of the attack, floating the possibility of denaturalization, or stripping people of citizenship.

Taken together, the moves represent some of the most significant changes to immigration policy since he regained office on a platform of substantially curbing the number of people entering the United States and deporting record numbers of migrants.

It remains to be seen how the administration will conduct such large-scale reviews of people already living legally in the country, and the federal government cannot easily strip people of their status. But the threat that people could see their cases reopened provoked alarm in a wide array of migrant communities now grappling with the fallout.

“The U.S. government has never halted such a broad slice of the immigration system or devoted this level of resources to rechecking its own work,” said Sarah Pierce, a former Department of Homeland Security official who is now director of social policy at the center-left think tank Third Way.

While security reviews are responsible, Ms. Pierce said, “this isn’t a calibrated security response — it’s a sweeping disruption of the legal immigration system at a moment when the administration is looking for someone to blame.”

Amanda Baran, a former senior official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said she had never heard of the agency pausing asylum requests wholesale in the way the president had ordered.

“The protection of this country and of the American people remains paramount, and the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration’s reckless resettlement policies,” said Joe Edlow, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in a message posted on social media. “American safety is non negotiable.”

Hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America had already been on alert for months as federal officials slashed refugee numbers, rolled back temporary humanitarian programs and narrowed the path to asylum in immigration courts, immigration advocates and lawyers said.

Even before the National Guard shooting, migrants from the 19 countries subject to the president’s travel ban had been preparing for more stringent reviews of their green card applications after the Trump administration announced it planned to make it harder for them to get that form of approval and other kinds of immigration relief.

In Southern California, Ara Torosian, an evangelical pastor and Iranian refugee with U.S. citizenship, said he was worried about members of his congregation, including some who had already been detained after reporting to their asylum case check-ins in recent months.

“We don’t know what we should do, especially now,” said Mr. Torosian, who preaches at the Cornerstone Church in West Los Angeles. “So many people have become threats because of the actions of one person.”

Mr. Trump has said the pause on asylum requests will continue for a long period of time.

“We don’t want those people,” he told reporters on Sunday about those seeking asylum.

In a social media post last week, the president also threatened to strip citizenship from naturalized U.S. citizens “who undermine domestic tranquillity.”

Some immigration lawyers and advocates have cautioned against panic over the potential for sizable rollbacks for those who already have legal status, noting that green card holders, asylum grantees and other long-term legal residents have already had to undergo heavy vetting and meet high legal burdens to obtain forms of relief.

“Fortunately, this is a nation of laws, and the more status people have, the more rights people have,” said Ryan Costello, the policy director at the National Iranian American Council, which lobbies on behalf of Iranian Americans. “But it is certainly a time of a lot of uncertainty and concern in the community.”

Ahilan T. Arulanantham, a law professor with the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the U.C.L.A. School of Law, said the administration would have to meet significant legal burdens for the review to result in people losing their green cards or citizenship, including winning rulings for each individual case in court hearings.

The pause on asylum requests filed inside the country, known as affirmative asylum applications, could affect as many of 1.5 million people who had pending applications with U.S.C.I.S. as of June, according to government data.

It’s unclear how U.S.C.I.S. will conduct a review of so many cases. In recent years, the agency has struggled to lower its backlog of cases, according to the D.H.S. inspector general. Agency employees have already been tasked with carrying out other mandates issued by the administration, including processing in refugees from South Africa and considering new factors, like purported anti-Americanism, when considering people’s immigration requests.

The last major government crackdown on a specific group of migrants in the wake of a violent incident came after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

At the time, the Bush administration created a program known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System that asked for new registration requirements for immigrants from mostly Middle Eastern countries. The program, which was widely criticized by immigrant advocacy and civil rights groups for being ineffective and unfairly targeting Muslims, was later disbanded during the Obama administration.

Concern over the new measures announced by the Trump administration are now reverberating in Afghan immigrant communities and beyond.

Nooristani Bahramuddin, 35, who previously worked as a security guard and interpreter at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, said he was finally approved last year for a special visa program for Afghans that worked with the U.S. government. He and his family arrived in Chicago last August and were issued green cards a few months later. His son has severe autism, and they’ve since relocated and found a school in Richmond, Va., that can support him. Now they fear that the little stability they’ve created will be upended.

“We are feeling so nervous, hearing that they are reprocessing and reinvestigating those who were issued green cards,” Mr. Bahramuddin said. “I am just trying to be a good person here, and to teach my children the same.”

| Watch Boston 25 News NOW ©2025 Cox Media Group","DEDHAM, Mass. — A Dedham church is causing controversy over another political statement in their Nativity scene this holiday season.

A sign reading “ICE WAS HERE” sits in the middle of the nativity scene outside their front doors. Underneath, a sign reads “The Holy Family is safe in our Church... If you see ICE please call LUCE at 617-370-5023.”

Over the past decade, Father Stephen Jasoma has used the nativity scene to “hold a mirror to the world” for self-reflection, he told Boston 25 Monday.

In years past, he and his parish peace and justice group have decided to make statements surrounding mass shootings, global warming, and immigration issues across the country. In 2018, he displayed Jesus in a cage, another statement on immigration.

“We thought this was a good way to show the dynamic of what’s happening in the world today,” said Jasoma Monday. “This is a stance I’d hope all churches would take. We should be a welcoming community.”

Meanwhile, local Catholics and community leaders like CJ Doyle, the executive director of the state’s Catholic Action League of Massachusetts, spoke against Father Jasoma’s decision.

“We have a case of a dissident priest who has a long history of these crackpot, publicity stunts,” said Doyle outside the nativity scene Monday. “He’s politicizing Christmas. He’s exploiting the Holy Family. He’s using his position as the pastor of a Catholic parish to promote his left-wing political ideology.”

Doyle called on local Catholics to reach out to the archdiocese, which he claimed has allowed these “political stunts.”

He asked, “Is this not obstruction of justice they’re really pushing here?... If he doesnt really believe in the Catholic religion or thinks the Catholic church is a vehicle for political activism, perhaps he should find new employment.”

Father Jasoma, in response to criticism he recieved, told Boston 25, “I’ve some push back from total strangers, was called a murderer yesterday... What we celebrate at Christmas is the peace Christ brought into the world. It’s right here, it’s right now. We are to embrace it.”

Boston reached out to the Archdiocese of Boston and is still waiting for comment.

“ICE broke its own laws and regulations to arrest him and take him away from his family.” Dadfar and his family escaped Afghanistan “in fear for their lives,” the court order says.
They were admitted into the United States and given a date for immigration court.
He had applied for asylum in August 2024 and was scheduled to appear in immigration court in Colorado in February.
The “underlying facts” of his asylum claim have not changed and he was in possession of a valid document proving his status, the court order states.","A federal judge Monday ordered immigration officials to immediately release an Afghan immigrant who helped U.S. troops fight the Taliban before moving to Boulder County.

Mohammad Ali Dadfar, who lived in Louisville with his wife and four children after fleeing Afghanistan, was picked up in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement sting while working as a long-haul truck driver. He has been held in a detention center in Missouri for nearly two months following his arrest at a weigh station along an interstate highway in Indiana.

“Ali’s family is overwhelmed and excited to see him,” said Marissa Seuc-Hester, who leads a volunteer ministry for immigrants at Christ the Servant Lutheran Church in Louisville and had helped the family with housing and other support. “Our community is celebrating this just order and cannot wait to welcome him home.”

Within hours of the judge’s order, by late Monday afternoon, Dadfar walked out of the detention center in Missouri. Friends in Louisville made arrangements to pick him up, and others, including his wife, were driving east to meet him, Seuc-Hester said.

U.S. District Judge M. Douglas Harpool, in the Western District of Missouri, ruled that Dadfar’s constitutional right to due process was violated and that he is entitled to immediate release.

Dadfar’s attorney in Colorado, Tiago Guevara of Longmont, said the ruling was “one more step toward a just result in this case.”

“Mr. Dadfar is a hardworking family man who has followed the law at every turn,” he said. “ICE broke its own laws and regulations to arrest him and take him away from his family.”

Dadfar and his family escaped Afghanistan “in fear for their lives,” the court order says. He followed the path toward legal asylum, first by presenting himself and his family to border patrol authorities in San Ysidro, California, in June 2024. They were admitted into the United States and given a date for immigration court.

Dadfar was granted humanitarian parole, which does not expire until June 2026. He had applied for asylum in August 2024 and was scheduled to appear in immigration court in Colorado in February. He also has a work permit that is valid until June, according to court records, and had obtained a commercial driver’s license to work as a truck driver.

Dadfar was driving through Michigan City, Indiana, and had stopped at a weigh station along Interstate 94. “Then, without a warrant or any warning, Mr. Dadfar was detained and arrested,” the order states.

He was held for five hours at the weigh station, then taken into ICE custody by Chicago immigration agents. He was later sent to a detention center in Missouri.

Dadfar had worked in the Afghan Army for 14 years and provided security for U.S. soldiers. He and his wife, three daughters and one son fled Afghanistan in 2021, after U.S. troops had withdrawn and the Taliban returned to power.

They traveled first to Iran, and then to Brazil when the Brazilian government offered visas to Afghan refugees. After about a year in South America, the family made a treacherous journey through the jungle of the Darien Gap to reach the U.S. border.

They settled in Louisville, where Dadfar’s brother already lived.

The judge determined that there were no grounds for the federal government to terminate Dadfar’s humanitarian parole “because he has not departed from the U.S., and his parole has not expired.” He was also not given any written notice explaining the basis for revoking his immigration status, as required by law.

The federal government violated Dadfar’s rights to “freedom from imprisonment” and to have a hearing in court, the judge ruled. The “underlying facts” of his asylum claim have not changed and he was in possession of a valid document proving his status, the court order states.

“There was no evidence from his conduct that he was a flight risk,” the judge wrote. “He was simply performing his duties as a truck driver in Indiana (far from any border).”

The habeas corpus case was filed against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the acting assistant field officer for ICE in Chicago, and the sheriff of Greene County, Missouri, where Dadfar was detained.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/190327newyork1a.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 22:57:28.828718

A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia’s immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group has previously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government’s failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

Madeline Gleeson, Senior Research Fellow, Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW Sydney, said: ‘After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.’

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre, said: ‘Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people’s liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.’

Fr. Brett O’Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said: ‘JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group’s visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.’

“We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.”

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said: ‘Australia’s mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government’s obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.’

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said: ‘This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia’s immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.’

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said: ‘Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.’

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said: ‘Australia’s system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people – some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people.’

WATCH: Investigations of National Guard shooting reveal suspect worked for CIA in Afghanistan

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

Here’s a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week.

All asylum decisions suspended

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

READ MORE: Refugee groups worry about backlash after National Guard shooting

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they’re granted asylum, they’re allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Department of Justice.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn’t trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump’s January order didn’t affect those cases, Edlow’s social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency’s pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

READ MORE: Trump administration halts all asylum decisions after shooting of National Guard members

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. The number of asylum cases at USCIS rose from 241,280 in 2022 to a record 456,750 in 2023, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics.

A focus on countries ‘of concern’

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others.

No visas for Afghans

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

WATCH: Questions emerge about National Guard shooter’s motives and the impact on immigrants

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department’s announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

A review of refugees admitted under the Biden administration

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That’s nearly 200,000 refugees.

Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/12/2025-11-30T142453Z_1797166287_RC207IAAYGSI_RTRMADP_3_USA-SHOOTING-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 18:58:37.134497
,Agencies,2025-12-01 22:49:06+00:00,LAist,State Bar found LA attorney faked an ICE investigation in string of scams. He's facing disbarment,"Jordan Rynning, laist.com, jordan-rynning",,,,,https://laist.com/news/criminal-justice/la-attorney-fake-ice-investigation,"According to findings from the California State Bar, Zargarof charged Lui for a number of “fictitious services.” Zargarof’s license is currently suspended, according to State Bar records.
In October, more than three years after the email about the fake ICE investigation, the State Bar Court recommended Zargarof be disbarred.
“I was really rushing it and I really believed in what he said,” Lui told LAist.
“ Of the cases we file, a fair number involve misappropriations of funds or misrepresentations,” Cardona told LAist.
Zargarof told Lui he was using the card to hire private investigators for her case, she told LAist.","The email was urgent and alarming.

The message appeared to come from the L.A. Field Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It said Patty Lui’s toy business in downtown L.A. was under federal investigation, and she had 24 hours to contact the agency — “whether individually or by legal representative on your behalf.”

By the time Lui suspected something was wrong, she said she’d paid her attorney, Ronen Zargarof, tens of thousands of dollars. According to findings from the California State Bar, Zargarof charged Lui for a number of “fictitious services.”

Zargarof’s license is currently suspended, according to State Bar records. In October, more than three years after the email about the fake ICE investigation, the State Bar Court recommended Zargarof be disbarred. They found that Zargarof, who was already working for Lui on another matter, knew the purported ICE email was fake. There was no urgent ICE investigation.

Lui told LAist that when she ended up sending Zargarof about $90,000.

“I was really rushing it and I really believed in what he said,” Lui told LAist.

Zargarof did not cooperate with the State Bar’s investigation into his dealings with Lui, who ultimately complained to the bar, or contest the charges set forth in the accusation filed by the bar against him, court documents show. The California Supreme Court still has to rule on whether Zargarof will be disbarred.

Zargarof has not responded to LAist's requests for comment on this story. According to civil court filings, he also ignored multiple orders to provide discovery materials in his case.

The documents show that Zargarof’s defense lawyers argued in February 2021 that he was unable to attend a deposition because he was out of state with no estimated return date. The lawyers then filed to leave the case in April, shortly after Zargarof was ordered by the court to attend a deposition the following month. Zargarof did not attend the deposition, court records state, and the court ruled against him in a default judgement.

How to protect yourself

George Cardona, chief trial counsel of the State Bar of California, said people navigating immigration law are especially vulnerable to misconduct and misrepresentation.

The State Bar files charges against 100 to 200 attorneys each year, Cardona said. Those charges can lead to disciplinary actions like suspension, disbarment or fines.

“ Of the cases we file, a fair number involve misappropriations of funds or misrepresentations,” Cardona told LAist. “We have had other cases, particularly in immigration context, involving fabricated documents.”

As federal immigration cases have ramped up this year with the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation policies, there may be even more risk.

Cardona recommends anyone needing a lawyer to look into the attorney you plan to hire before trusting them to represent you in court.

A search of court records in late 2021, when Lui first hired Zargarof, could have turned up a judgment against him for more than $170,000. According to court filings, Zagarof was ordered to pay damages of $76,500 for breach of contract and $48,500 for “tort causes,” including battery, assault, domestic violence, negligence and infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff is listed as a “Jane Doe.”

“The Court finds Defendant's conduct was willful, wanton, oppressive and malicious,” the order states.

When it comes to keeping yourself safe from fraud, Cardona said, the first thing you should do is search for a lawyer on the State Bar of California's webpage before deciding whether to hire them.

“ First, it can confirm that they're a lawyer, and second, it will show if they have any disciplinary history,” he said.

Cardona said people posing as lawyers is especially prevalent in immigration cases.

After checking whether a lawyer is licensed or has a history of disciplinary actions, he said you should look online for reviews or check with friends who may have an attorney they know first-hand.

The lawyer will be acting on your behalf, Cardona said, “ so it's important to have someone you can trust.”

A cautionary tale

Lui initially hired Zargarof to handle a separate, civil employment case in November 2021.

She told LAist that she never met Zargarof in person. November is a particularly busy time for her business making and selling teddy bears, Lui said, and for a few weeks it seemed Zargarof was on top of the case.

“ He was always telling me that he just came out from the court and this is what I need,” Lui said, “I need to pay and pay and pay.”

Zargarof began asking for more money to cover various fees, she said, pushing her to quickly send him money.

“ I’d have to rush to send him a wire,” Lui told LAist. “I was so nervous.”

According to the State Bar’s findings, some of Zargarof’s fees were for “fictitious services,” including $2,500 to have her daughter dismissed from the civil case against Lui, and $6,000 for proceedings before the “Labor Board of Los Angeles County.”

The State Bar noted in court documents that Lui’s daughter was never accused of any wrongdoing in the case, and that the “Labor Board of Los Angeles County” does not exist.

The bar described in court filings how Zargarof made up these scenarios to charge Lui fees for services he never provided.

Zargarof sent text messages to Lui, which were quoted in court filings and provided more information on the investigation.

“There were two search warrant[s] . . . for your computers and files. We are dismissing those today,” Zargarof messaged Lui.

Zargarof said that he knew an “immigration experts partner,” named Tracey Pierantoni, and directed Lui to pay $10,000 into Pierantoni’s bank account.

“They are going to charge a flat rate of 5 [thousand] per file = 10k so I think it will be cheaper for you to wire them before 130 today instead of putting it on card,” said one message included in court documents.

There was no ICE investigation, according to the court documents, and Tracey Pierantoni Zargarof is not a licensed attorney in the state of California.

Court documents allege that Pierantoni Zargarof is one of several family members Zargarof used to accept payments from Lui.

Pierantoni Zargarof denies any involvement in the payments, and told LAist she intends to file charges against Zargarof for identity fraud.

“I have nothing to do with his criminal activity,"" Pierantoni Zargarof said when asked for comment. She added that she hasn't seen him in two or three years and doesn't know where he is or how to reach him.

Details from the State Bar Complaint

While Lui was trying to keep up with her business and pay Zargarof’s fees, court records document that Zargarof ran up a $25,000 bill on Lui’s credit card to pay for a hotel stay at the Rosewood Miramar Beach in Santa Barbara.

Zargarof told Lui he was using the card to hire private investigators for her case, she told LAist. Once she learned that wasn’t true she went to her bank with a fraud claim.

She also made a complaint to the State Bar of California in August 2022, which led to disciplinary charges against Zargarof in April 2025.

Lui said her bank was able to return the money that was charged to her card, but she hasn't been able to recover tens of thousands of additional payments that the State Bar found were for ""fictitious services.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a22aeea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2F6a%2Fefcea83a4d51ba610e0628770337%2F010720-ca-supreme-court-ap-cm-01.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 18:58:48.664315

Meanwhile, President Trump said the U.S. is poised to launch attacks inside Venezuela itself. This comes as Republican-led committees in the House and Senate say they’ll hold oversight hearings to investigate the Pentagon’s attacks on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, following a Washington Post report alleging Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the killing of all crew members on an alleged drug vessel, including the survivors of an initial strike. According to the Post, Secretary Hegseth ordered the killing of two people as they clung to the smoldering wreckage of their boat after the first attack, off the coast of Trinidad, on September 2. A source told the Post, “The order was to kill everybody.” Under international law, it’s a war crime to refuse to spare the lives of people who are attempting to surrender or otherwise unable to fight. Human rights groups, meanwhile, have condemned all of the Pentagon’s attacks on boats as war crimes. On Sunday, President Trump denied Hegseth gave an order to kill everyone aboard the vessel, but later in the evening, Hegseth contradicted Trump’s denial, posting a meme on social media depicting the children’s cartoon character Franklin the Turtle opening fire from a helicopter on boats below. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Vice President Delcy Rodríguez called on other oil-producing states in OPEC to oppose any U.S. attack on Venezuela.

Vice President Delcy Rodríguez: “Venezuela formally denounces, before this body, that the government of the United States of America intends to take control of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, the largest on the planet, through the use of lethal military force against the territory, the people and the institutions of the country.”

President Trump says he will pardon Honduras’s former president, who was sentenced by a U.S. court last year to 45 years in prison for directing a massive cocaine trafficking operation. Prosecutors showed how Juan Orlando Hernández, who was president from 2014 to 2022, ran Honduras as a “narco-state,” accepting millions of dollars in bribes from cocaine traffickers in exchange for protection, including deploying the Honduran National Police to safeguard cocaine loads as they were transported through Honduras. News of Trump’s looming pardon came just days ahead of Sunday’s presidential elections in Honduras, where a right-wing candidate from Juan Orlando Hernández’s party had taken a narrow lead with just under half the votes counted. Nasry Asfura is the former mayor of Tegucigalpa. He received a boost when Trump endorsed him and threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if voters elected one of his rivals, whom Trump assailed as “communists.”

The death toll from Israel’s more than two-year assault on Gaza surpassed 70,000 Palestinians over the weekend, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Al Jazeera is reporting that Israeli drones dropped a bomb near al-Farabi School Saturday morning, killing two brothers, Juma and Fadi Tamer Abu Assi. On Sunday, three more Palestinians were killed and two others injured in Israeli attacks, raising the death toll to 356 since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire went into effect on October 10. Meanwhile, Israel returned 15 more Palestinian bodies to Gaza as part of the first phase of the ceasefire deal. This comes as Israeli forces claim to have killed 40 Hamas fighters in southern Gaza over the past 40 days.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces on Thursday fatally shot two Palestinian men at point-blank range after they appeared to surrender to troops. The killings were captured on video showing the two men coming out of a garage holding their hands up and lifting their shirts to show they are not carrying explosives. The troops later shot the men dead. This comes as the Wafa news agency is reporting that Israeli forces have arrested a 16-year-old child at a military checkpoint in the occupied West Bank, as Israel intensifies drone operations over the Jenin refugee camp.

Israeli authorities have freed a Palestinian American boy after holding him for over nine months without trial in an Israeli military prison, where he says he was physically and psychologically tortured. Mohammed Ibrahim of Palm Bay, Florida, was just 15 years old when Israeli forces arrested him in the occupied West Bank for allegedly throwing stones at Israeli settlers’ vehicles. If convicted, he faced up to 20 years in prison. Ibrahim was released on Thanksgiving Day following a pressure campaign from more than 100 U.S. civil rights groups, as well as 27 members of Congress. He was hospitalized after his release, treated for severe weight loss and scabies that left him with a serious skin infection. His family said they had almost no direct contact with Ibrahim throughout his detention. In October, the boy told a human rights group he and other Palestinian prisoners suffered beatings, severe cold, starvation, social isolation and medical neglect.

The Trump administration has stopped issuing visas for Afghan nationals and has halted decisions on all asylum applications, after a 29-year-old Afghan opened fire near the White House last Wednesday, killing a soldier with the West Virginia National Guard and leaving another in critical condition. Rahmanullah Lakanwal has been charged with first-degree murder and will likely face terrorism charges. Lakanwal previously worked in a CIA-backed Afghan Army unit known as a Zero Unit. He entered the United States in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a program that saw the U.S. evacuate thousands of Afghans who faced reprisals from the Taliban over their support of the U.S. occupation. He applied for asylum in 2024 and was granted refugee status last April, under the second Trump administration. President Trump called the attack an “act of hatred” committed by an “animal” and pledged that his administration would re-vet every Afghan granted asylum in the U.S. Meanwhile, the United Nations’ special rapporteur on Afghanistan has spoken out against collective punishment. Richard Bennett said in a statement, “The perpetrator should face accountability, but the entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual.”

President Trump announced that he was canceling all executive orders signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen, which is a device that reproduces signatures. President Trump has also used autopen to sign official documents. Back in September, the White House hung a photo of Biden’s autopen signature instead of his portrait in the walkway featuring portraits of former presidents. Biden signed 162 executive orders during his presidency, though it’s unclear how many were signed using autopen. President Trump rescinded nearly 70 of Biden’s executive orders shortly after taking office, and another 19 in March.

President Trump on Wednesday blasted New York Times reporter Katie Rogers, calling her “ugly,” after she published a story raising questions about President Trump’s health, writing that he was “showing signs of fatigue.” The article also detailed an Oval Office event last month where President Trump appeared drowsy with drooping eyelids, dozing on and off for several seconds. President Trump also insulted CBS News White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Thursday after she asked him about the suspect in Wednesday’s attack on two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. Trump snapped back at her, “Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person?” Last month, President Trump called Bloomberg’s White House correspondent Catherine Lucey “piggy” after she questioned him about releasing the Epstein files.

In Hong Kong, officials say at least 151 people died in a fire that engulfed a high-rise apartment complex last Wednesday. The blaze is Hong Kong’s deadliest in more than 70 years, and the exact cause has yet to be determined. Eight people have been arrested on corruption charges after an investigation revealed that the netting that covered scaffolding used in renovations was not up to fire safety codes. This is Joey Yeung, whose grandmother’s home was consumed by the fire.

Joey Yeung: “All the memories have all gone, and it’s all because of those people who caused the fire. I can’t accept it. So, today I came with my father and my family to lay flowers. … I’m not asking to get anything back, but at least give some justice to the families of the deceased, to those who are still alive.”

A Babson College student was deported to Honduras while she was trying to fly from Boston to Texas to surprise her family for Thanksgiving. Nineteen-year-old Any Lucia López Belloza was told there was an issue with her boarding pass before she was detained by immigration officials and sent to Texas, and later Honduras. The day after she was arrested, a federal judge issued an emergency order prohibiting the government from removing her from the United States for 72 hours. López Belloza told The Boston Globe that she is currently staying with her grandparents in Honduras.

More than 1,000 people have died in devastating floods and landslides in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand, leaving hundreds of thousands of people stranded without shelter. In Indonesia, 600 people have died and over 500,000 people are displaced on the island of Sumatra as authorities frantically search for survivors. In Thailand, at least 170 people were killed in one of the worst floods in a decade. Meanwhile, in Sri Lanka, 334 people died as a result of Cyclone Ditwah, the worst natural disaster to hit the island in two decades since the devastating 2004 tsunami. On Sunday, low-lying areas of Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo were flooded after heavy rains triggered mudslides across the island. Nearly 148,000 people have been displaced.

Malika Kumari: “It rained nonstop for three days. We heard about the warnings of flooding, but we didn’t expect water levels would get this high. As usual, we moved our belongings that could be moved to a higher level. But that didn’t help. Everything is under water.”

In the Philippines, tens of thousands of protesters marched in the capital Manila calling for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to resign, after a corruption scandal revealed that his government took billions in kickbacks from faulty flood control projects. Heavy losses from two recent typhoons, which killed more than 250 people, spurred public outrage. Marcos has vowed that at least 37 government officials implicated in the corruption scandal will be in jail by December, but protesters say many more officials should be in jail sooner.

David San Juan: “It’s been five months since the flood control scam erupted, and no high official has been jailed yet. After what Ombudsman Remulla said, that at least 10% of Congress is involved in the anomalies in flood control projects, a case has been filed and a warrant issued for only one person. The senators and congressmen involved have still not been jailed.”

Bright, who has served in HR roles in government for nearly 30 years, had no performance or prior disciplinary issues, Owen said.
Trump administration officials had reportedly grown angry in recent months with the rate of hiring at ICE.
Bright received no indication that CBP was displeased with hiring efforts at her agency, said Owen, her lawyer.
Both CBP and ICE declined to comment for this story.","As two agencies at the center of President Trump’s efforts to clamp down on immigration and conduct mass deportations look to spend a windfall of new funding to bring on swaths of new employees, they will do so without the officials who have overseen those efforts since he took office.

Customs and Border Protection, which received $4 billion in Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act to hire 8,500 employees, recently fired Andrea Bright, a long-time career civil servant who has served since 2019 as the agency’s assistant secretary for human resources management. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, meanwhile, which received $8 billion to triple its workforce by hiring 10,000 officers and agents, recently saw its chief human capital officer, Tyshawn Thomas, take a similar role at another agency.

Bright received no indication of why she was fired, her attorney, Kevin Owen, told Government Executive, and the dismissal came as a surprise. Her termination notice stated she was fired pursuant to the president’s powers under Article II of the Constitution, a novel argument the administration has made repeatedly when firing employees since January. Bright, who has served in HR roles in government for nearly 30 years, had no performance or prior disciplinary issues, Owen said.

“There’s nothing about her that we believe this administration would find objectionable, so this really is an absolute mystery,” Owen added. “She’s a competent civil servant who does her job.”

In an August interview with Government Executive, Bright expressed confidence CBP would meet its lofty hiring goals and said years of built up capacity would help it do so. She called the hiring surge realistic, though she conceded it would depend on conditions in the job market and said CBP was entering “the unknown.”

Bright had overseen a dramatic uptick in those seeking CBP law enforcement roles—taking in 50,000 applications in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, a 40% jump from the previous year—though Border Patrol and the rest of the agency had struggled to build its actual hiring rate above that of attrition. Trump administration officials had reportedly grown angry in recent months with the rate of hiring at ICE.

Thomas left ICE within the last few weeks on his own volition, according to multiple officials familiar with his move, to return to the Office of Personnel Management—where he had worked for seven years before leaving for ICE in 2024—as its top HR official. Carmen Garcia served as OPM’s chief human capital officer until she left for the private sector last week.

The push to rapidly recruit and onboard 10,000 new officers and agents had created a “chaotic” situation within ICE HR, a source familiar with the matter said, which incentivized Thomas to return to OPM. ICE has offered $50,000 signing bonuses to employees, expanded student loan repayment, removed age caps and nearly taken over the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center as part of its effort to rapidly transform the agency’s workforce. Thomas' departure follows widespread reports in late October of significant shakeups within ICE's top ranks.

Bright received no indication that CBP was displeased with hiring efforts at her agency, said Owen, her lawyer.

He added it would be “terrible management if they’re not meeting hiring goals to fire their head of HR who’s got decades of experience in federal hiring.”

Bright has appealed her firing to the Merit Systems Protection Board and is currently awaiting a hearing. Both CBP and ICE declined to comment for this story.

The median years spent as a permanent resident for all naturalized citizens in 2024 was 7.5 years.
Irina Manta, a Hofstra University law professor who compiles denaturalization cases, found 168 denaturalization cases filed in federal courts during Trump's first term in office and 64 during Biden's.","What they're saying: ""We have criminals that came into our country and they were naturalized maybe through [former President Joe] Biden or somebody that didn't know what they were doing,"" Trump told reporters on Sunday.

""If I have the power to do it — I'm not sure that I do, but if I do — I would denaturalize, absolutely.""

Trump also repeated previous anti-immigrant comments, criticizing people from Somalia who have been living in the U.S. and threatening to pause new asylum claims for ""a long time.""

""We don't want those people. Does that make sense? You know why we don't want them? Because many have been no good and they shouldn't be in our country.""

The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Flashback: The U.S. Department of Justice is now prioritizing stripping naturalized Americans of their citizenship when charged with certain crimes, according to a June memo.

Yes, but: For revocation of naturalization, the U.S. Attorney's Office needs to file charges in federal court.

""The government holds a high burden of proof when attempting to revoke a person's naturalization,"" per U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

Here's what to know about the Trump administration's threats to naturalized citizens:

What naturalized citizenship is

Naturalization ""is the process by which U.S. citizenship is granted to a lawful permanent resident after meeting the requirements established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),"" per USCIS.

What Trump has said about naturalized citizens following the National Guard shooting

Trump's comments following the shooting have involved renewed threats to naturalized U.S. citizens.

In his lengthy Thanksgiving Truth Social post, Trump said that he would ""end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.""

Reality check: A wealth of research shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born people.

A 2023 study led by Stanford University economist Ran Abramitzky found that immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than their U.S.-born counterparts.

Relative to the U.S.-born, the researchers found, immigrants' incarceration rates have declined since 1960.

The Justice Department's targeting of naturalized citizens

The Justice Department directed attorneys this summer to prioritize denaturalization in cases where naturalized citizens commit specific crimes.

At the time, a department spokesperson told Axios that ""denaturalization proceedings will only be pursued as permitted by law and supported by evidence against individuals who illegally procured or misrepresented facts in the naturalization process.""

""Those who gain citizenship through unlawful means and endanger our national security will not maintain the benefits of being an American citizen,"" the statement said.

Zoom in: The Justice Department is targeting those charged with war crimes, gang activity, extrajudicial killings, and ""other serious human rights abuses,"" the department said in June.

It also directs Civil Division attorneys to investigate ""any individuals convicted of crimes who pose an ongoing threat to the United States.""

How many immigrants are naturalized citizens

By the numbers: Out of the 46.2 million immigrants living in the U.S. in 2022, 24.5 million – 53% – are naturalized citizens, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis of government data.

Who is eligible to become a naturalized citizen

Zoom out: In the past decade, the U.S. naturalized more than 7.9 million citizens, according to the USCIS.

Naturalized citizens undergo an involved application process, but eligibility criteria include being a lawful permanent resident for at least five years, with exceptions for spouses of citizens and members of the U.S. military.

The median years spent as a permanent resident for all naturalized citizens in 2024 was 7.5 years.

The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that naturalization applicants pass tests proving their English language abilities and knowledge of U.S. history.

How many citizens have been denaturalized

By the numbers: From 1990 to 2017, the DOJ filed 305 denaturalization cases, about 11 per year, according to The Miami Herald.

The number has surged since Trump's first term.

Irina Manta, a Hofstra University law professor who compiles denaturalization cases, found 168 denaturalization cases filed in federal courts during Trump's first term in office and 64 during Biden's.

That's an average of 42 per year under Trump and 16 under Biden.

Since January 2017, the USCIS has selected some 2,500 cases for possible denaturalization and referred at least 110 denaturalization cases to the Justice Department for prosecution by the end of August 2018.

At least one person was denaturalized following a conviction this year.",https://images.axios.com/57WSoFWgwti6wkdOZYmxgbmYB8w=/363x271:3241x1890/1366x768/2025/12/01/1764613371066.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 17:56:40.262491

Yet multiple religious groups have filed lawsuits similar to this one seeking to bar ICE and other agencies from such actions.
In their action filed in January, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship along with Sikh and Quaker groups were granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE raids on member properties.
An SBC spokesperson said neither Pressley nor the executive committee have been briefed about planned ICE raids, according to the report.
The presence of immigration agents during the holiday season would be harmful to faith communities even if the reported raids do not occur, according to the filing.","A coalition of religious groups has asked a federal court to prevent federal immigration agents from raiding houses of worship during the holiday season.

The plaintiffs in New England Synod, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, et al., v. Department of Homeland Security, et al. filed the petition amid swirling rumors and news reports that the US Department of Homeland Security has plans to apprehend worshipers in Spanish-speaking and other congregations during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other holiday services in the coming weeks.

“If these reports are true, it is outrageous that the administration would so blatantly seek to undermine the freedom to worship freely as we enter an important time for many faiths,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which serves as co-counsel in the action.

The possibility that raids could be carried out on church campuses and in sanctuaries creates even more urgency for the lawsuit on behalf of the Alliance of Baptists, American Baptist Churches in the USA, Metropolitan Community Churches, and numerous Quaker and Evangelical Lutheran Church in America regions, Perryman said.

“The reports circulating this week are alarming and incompatible with our Constitution. We are taking swift action to ensure that the protections already recognized by the court are upheld and that faith communities can gather and worship, free from government coercion.”

The concern stems from the Trump administration’s January termination of longstanding federal prohibitions against immigration raids in sensitive locations such as churches, hospitals, and schools. Since then, federal agents have arrested undocumented immigrants on or near church properties, but incursions into sanctuaries and other buildings have not been reported.

Yet multiple religious groups have filed lawsuits similar to this one seeking to bar ICE and other agencies from such actions.

In their action filed in January, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship along with Sikh and Quaker groups were granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE raids on member properties. Fellowship Southwest, now known as FaithWorks, the Hispanic Baptist Convention, and other groups were denied a restraining order in their separate lawsuit filed earlier this year.

Both social media and news accounts have been stoking fears that DHS plans to sweep through houses of worship during the holiday season. A WhatsAPP message warning of impending church raids in Atlanta sparked apprehension in that city, while reports of federal officials briefing Baptist, Catholic, Pentecostal, and Jewish leaders of impending actions has raised concerns throughout New England.

“Two Hispanic pastors who lead Southern Baptist churches in New England say that SBC President Clint Pressley and its Executive Board received briefings on the plan and discussed it with Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller and White House Border Czar Tom Homan,” This Week in Worcester reported.

An SBC spokesperson said neither Pressley nor the executive committee have been briefed about planned ICE raids, according to the report.

A Hispanic Pentecostal pastor said his church had been visited several times by ICE and FBI agents, according to the publication, which cited unnamed DHS sources. “In all three conversations, agents asked questions about the names of specific congregation members, their home addresses and the frequency they attended church services.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the agency is targeting churches, according to the National Catholic Reporter: “ICE does not raid churches—regardless of if it is holiday season or not. This is just another false narrative to try and demonize our brave ICE law enforcement who are facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them and a 8000% increase in death threats.”

However, the department vowed that no house of worship will be off limits thanks to President Donald Trump’s January directive opening health care, education, and sacred spaces to enforcement actions: “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense.”

But plaintiffs in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America lawsuit are taking no chances. The notice they filed November 21 in US District Court in Massachusetts cites continued immigration enforcement actions at or near member facilities, including the presence of masked and armed agents in church parking lots and apprehensions being made on or near church properties.

The presence of immigration agents during the holiday season would be harmful to faith communities even if the reported raids do not occur, according to the filing. “Plaintiffs respectfully request the court’s prompt intervention to prevent serious and irreparable harm to worshippers’ ability to practice their faith in community with others during a time of such vital religious significance.”",https://www.christiancentury.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/images/courtroom3.jpg?h=ea7b3a3c&itok=dmgomx0h,N,,2025-12-01 17:57:14.645119

Rep. Seth Moulton is visiting the federal immigration field office in his district at 10 a.m. to check out conditions at the site where some immigrants have been detained for days after being arrested.

He invited both Sen. Ed Markey — who he’s looking to oust from the Senate — and Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join the tour and “stand united in getting the facts, supporting our communities, and ensuring that this facility is operating responsibly, humanely and within the law,” Moulton said in announcing the visit.

Neither will be there today with the Salem Democrat. Instead, Markey has his own tour of the facility set in the coming weeks — and he got a little bit of a jump on Moulton last week, stopping by the Burlington facility the day before Thanksgiving to meet with protestors who regularly demonstrate near the building.

“I have been demanding answers about the conditions at that facility and will be returning soon to continue my oversight there,” he said in a vdeo posted on social media.

Moulton plans to monitor agents’ conduct and conditions in the facility, according to his office. “We have seen the excessive use of force and inhumane treatment by ICE personnel in Massachusetts and around the country and want to ensure that it does not happen moving forward,” he said in the statement announcing this morning’s visit.

Members of Congress have to plan these visits ahead as a result of a new Trump administration policy that bars them from making unannounced visits to ICE field offices, like the one in Burlington. Members can still conduct site visits at detention facilities unannounced.

Burlington town officials have warned of “inhuman treatment of detainees” in the facility that serves as a temporary holding place for immigrants after they’ve been arrested. Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, the 18-year-old Milford high school student who was detained there earlier this year, described the conditions as “not good,” after he said he went six days without showering while sleeping on a cement floor. Federal immigration officials disputed that portrayal at the time.

IN MEMORIAM

‘NO ONE MORE LOYAL — State Rep. Ann-Margaret Ferrante died Thursday after a years-long battle with pancreatic cancer. She was 53. Tributes poured out for the longtime lawmaker, who served as vice chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.

“Ann-Margaret Ferrante lived a life full of purpose, joy, and service,” House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement. “For nearly 17 years, Ann-Margaret served the people of Cape Ann as their state representative with a relentless commitment to helping those in need.”

She was “not only a trusted legislative partner, but also a cherished friend — someone my family and I considered part of our own,” said Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr, whose district overlapped with Ferrante’s.

Gov. Maura Healey described Ferrante as “a fierce champion for the people of Cape Ann for more than 15 years.”

“She was one of the most selfless people I know, and there was no one more loyal to her friends, family and the constituents she served,” Healey added.

— Babson College freshman speaks out about her deportation to Honduras ahead of Thanksgiving by Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, The Boston Globe: “The college freshman was thrilled to board her flight to surprise her family for Thanksgiving. Any Lucia Lopez Belloza thought about the embraces she would share with her little sisters, ages 2 and 5, and about everything she would tell her mother and father about her first semester at Babson College studying business. She would share how happy she was, about how all of her hard work — and her family’s hard work — was finally paying off. Instead, shortly after showing her ticket to a gate agent at Logan airport last Thursday morning, she was suddenly whisked away by immigration officials to an unmarked car.

— Hegseth order on first Caribbean boat strike, officials say: Kill them all by Alex Horton and Ellen Nakashima, The Washington Post: “The longer the U.S. surveillance aircraft followed the boat, the more confident intelligence analysts watching from command centers became that the 11 people on board were ferrying drugs. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken directive, according to two people with direct knowledge of the operation. ‘The order was to kill everybody,’ one of them said. A missile screamed off the Trinidad coast, striking the vessel and igniting a blaze from bow to stern. For minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck. The Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions, two people familiar with the matter said.”

The Massachusetts Seal, Flag, and Motto Advisory Commission is itself the second iteration of a group the Legislature created in 2021 amid a groundswell to replace a seal and flag long criticized as offensive to Native Americans. … the full 10-person panel has not gathered in a meeting since, nor has the commission held a series of legally mandated hearings to gather public input ahead of a Dec. 15 deadline to produce its recommendations.”

How the National Guard wound up in the district Trump initially mobilized 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital in August after claiming a “crime emergency” in the district, despite a documented three-decade low in crime.
The administration filed the emergency motion the same day as the attack on the two National Guard members.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has accelerated his drive to curb legal immigration, after a native of Afghanistan who had been granted asylum was accused in a shooting in the nation’s capital that left one member of the West Virginia National Guard dead and another in critical condition.

“In the wake of last week's atrocity, it is more important than ever to finish carrying out the president's mass deportation operation,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during Monday’s press briefing. “They must go back to their home countries.”

The Trump administration at the beginning of the president’s second term launched an unprecedented crackdown on all forms of immigration. The deadly shooting on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, in a commercial area of the District of Columbia just blocks from the White House, has intensified the push.

The Department of Homeland Security in a social media post after the Wednesday attack called for immigrants to “remigrate,” which is a far-right concept in Europe that calls for the ethnic removal of non-white minority populations through mass migration.

“There is more work to be done,” Leavitt said, “because President Trump believes that he has a sacred obligation to reverse the calamity of mass unchecked migration into our country.”

The suspect in the guard shooting is a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the country during the Biden administration through a special immigrant visa program for Afghan allies after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country in 2021.

Authorities identified him as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who worked for a CIA counterterrorism operation in Afghanistan, according to the New York Times. He was granted asylum under the Trump administration earlier this year.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia plans to charge Lakanwal with first-degree murder after one of the National Guard soldiers, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died as a result of her injuries.

Still hospitalized is U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24. Trump has indicated he intends to honor both Beckstrom and Wolfe at the White House.

District officials said the shooting of guard members was “targeted,” but the motive remains under investigation.

Pauses on asylum

Leavitt said the Trump administration will continue “to limit migration, both illegal and legal,” after the shooting.

Separately on Wednesday, the administration ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 330,000 nationals from Haiti, opening them up for deportations by February.

Within hours of Wednesday's shooting, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services halted all immigration requests from Afghanistan nationals. On Thursday, USCIS head Joseph Edlow announced that by direction of Trump the agency would reexamine every green card application from “every country of concern,” which are the 19 countries on the president’s travel ban list.

And by Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed all U.S. embassies to suspend all visa approvals for individuals with passports from Afghanistan.

Over the weekend, Trump told reporters that those pauses on asylum could last “a long time,” although it’s unclear what authority the executive branch has to suspend a law created by Congress through the 1980 Refugee Act.

This is not the first time Trump has tried to end asylum this year, as there is a legal challenge to the president barring asylum seekers from making asylum claims at U.S. ports of entry.

Venezuelan boat strikes

During Monday’s press conference, Leavitt also defended the Trump administration’s continued deadly strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela allegedly containing drugs. The attacks have been occurring since September.

The president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated, without evidence, that the boats’ operators are narco-terrorists and that the strikes are legal, since they have taken place in international waters. Roughly 80 people have been killed in nearly two dozen attacks since September.

Leavitt disputed any questions of wrongdoing by the administration during a Sept. 2 strike, when two survivors clinging to boat wreckage were allegedly killed by a follow-on strike, as first reported by The Washington Post Friday.

“President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war,” Leavitt said, adding that Hegseth authorized a military commander to conduct the operation.

However, the attacks have raised concern among members of Congress, and following the Post story, the U.S. Senate and House Armed Services committees moved to open bipartisan inquiries into the military strikes, with a focus on the alleged follow-on attack that killed two survivors.

How the National Guard wound up in the district

Trump initially mobilized 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital in August after claiming a “crime emergency” in the district, despite a documented three-decade low in crime.

Many were instructed they would be carrying service weapons, The Wall Street Journal reported on Aug. 17. The White House effort was accompanied by a heightened U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence in the district.

The mobilization then became tied up in court for months.

A federal district judge in the District of Columbia found the administration’s deployment of more than 2,000 guard troops in the city illegal but stayed her Nov. 20 decision for three weeks to give the administration time to appeal and remove the guard members from the district’s streets.

The guard troops had been expected to remain in the district through the end of February.

The administration filed an emergency motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for a stay to be issued on the order by Thursday. The administration filed the emergency motion the same day as the attack on the two National Guard members.

Trump ordered an additional 500 guard members to the district following the shooting.

The Joint Task Force District of Columbia has been overseeing guard operations in the district, including units from the district, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-12/beckstrommemorial.jpg?h=a52b4261&itok=scyAXr-1,N,,2025-12-01 17:56:45.579504

25-5289 (DC Circuit).","FAIR shows President may send mass parolees home

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a brief in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals supporting the President’s authority to roll back Biden mass parole programs, which have let millions of aliens who are not immigrants pour into the United States.

In one parole program alone, the Biden administration let 532,000 aliens from four countries—Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela—sign up on an app and come to ports of entry, where they were given automatic parole and sent into the interior of the country. The Trump administration has acted to terminate these grants of parole, but anti-borders groups won an order blocking that termination from the DC federal district court.

In its brief on appeal of that order, FAIR shows that President Trump has authority directly from the Constitution to send these parolees home. The Supreme Court has long recognized that those given parole—which by statute must only be given case-by-case for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, requirements Biden ignored—have not even entered the country in a legal sense. As far as the law is concerned, they are still at the border, wherever they are physically located. And the Court has also long recognized that the President has inherent constitutional authority to block aliens from entering the country.

“Because no President has the power to let in a vast influx of aliens Congress has excluded, Biden’s en masse parole programs were unlawful to begin with,” said Dale L. Wilcox, executive director and general counsel of FAIR. “At the same time, the Supreme Court could not have been clearer that the President has inherent power to block the entry of aliens, including these parolees. We hope the court sees how much the legal and constitutional landscape favors the President’s authority here, and reverses the lower court’s order.”

Immigration detainers are critical public safety tools because they focus enforcement resources on removable aliens who have been arrested for criminal activity. Detainers increase the safety of all parties involved because it allows ICE to arrest these individuals in a secure and controlled custodial setting as opposed to at-large where a criminal alien can continue harming the community in which they would have otherwise been released. Additionally, detainers conserve scarce government resources by allowing ICE to take criminal aliens into custody directly rather than expending resources locating these aliens at large.

DHS continues to focus its enforcement efforts on the most serious criminal offenders—including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, terrorists, and other dangerous individuals. Nationally, 70% of the illegal aliens arrested by ICE have criminal convictions or pending charges in the United States. This figure does not include those wanted for violent crimes in other countries, individuals with INTERPOL notices, human rights violators, gang members, terrorists, and others who pose significant threats to public safety.

Matt Grossmann: Who now directs spending? Congress or the President? This week on The Science of Politics. For the Niskanen Center, I’m Matt Grossmann. Donald Trump has taken extraordinary actions to redirect or ignore congressional appropriations, from dismantling foreign aid to making the education department a ghost town, to offering employee buyouts across government. But how unique are Trump’s efforts to redirect spending toward his priorities and avoid spending when he does not favor it?

This week, I talked to Kevin Angell of the University of Chicago about his new paper Who Has the Power of the Purse? He compares what Congress appropriated to what agencies actually spend, finding that presidents have long moved spending toward their preferences. Even after impoundment controls, presidents have found ways of not spending money they never requested from Congress. Trump is more blatant and could be more extreme, but administrations have long used their tools to obtain some power of the purse from Congress. I think you’ll enjoy our conversation. So tell us about the findings and takeaways from your new paper Who Has the Power of the Purse?

Kevin Angell: The main finding from my new paper is that presidents are able to influence government spending in a rather substantial way after they have agreed to a budget with Congress. So after they’ve done their negotiations with Congress, after Congress has passed the budget and the president signed it, presidents are still able to shift government spending so that it more closely reflects their priorities than is reflected in the original budget.

Matt Grossmann: And give us a sense of the size of these effects and how much they matter in terms of the actual policy outputs of government or potential outcomes from policy differences.

Kevin Angell: We see that the power is really concentrated in presidents trying to spend less than what Congress has passed and that these effects are pretty substantial. So for every about a dollar change in the President’s budget, we see about 40 cents less in spending that’s occurring in that year by that government subunit, which you can think of as a subset of an agency.

Matt Grossmann: Just to clarify, the president proposed $4 of spending, Congress proposed $5 of spending, and the president is able to move the final spending about 40% less than the difference between those two, that dollar, is that right?

Kevin Angell: Correct. We can think about this as, suppose we have two budgets, both of which Congress has passed $5 of spending. In one case, the president had wanted to spend $4 and the other case the President had wanted to spend say, $3. We’d expect that the president and his administration is going to spend about 40 cents less in the case where they asked for $3 than when they had asked for $4.

Matt Grossmann: Great. Give us some, I guess, more direct examples here. Where are these agencies differences between the president and Congress most common? Are there quintessential cases that come to mind where we can say there was a fight between Congress and the president, Congress won, but in the end, the president was able to get more by a couple of years later?

Kevin Angell: I think that one of the quintessential cases of this is actually slightly before the time period that I study, and we actually have really good evidence from our qualitative history about this happening. And that’s with the Truman administration. In aftermath of World War II, Truman and the House and Senate were in a dispute over how big the Air Force should be. The House, in particular, wanted a substantially larger Air Force than President Truman did.

And the way that Truman and the Congress resolved this is that Truman basically goes to the Senate, which shared his priority to have a smaller Air Force, and said, “Look, let’s just agree to the House number where we’ll accept the extra money that they’re going to appropriate for us, and then I’ll have a handshake deal with you, the Senate, that I’m just not going to spend it.” So what happened is that Congress passed the higher budget, President Truman signs the budget and then immediately places all of the extra funds into what he called reserves so that he didn’t ultimately have to spend it on the Air Force.

Matt Grossmann: And what about the contemporary mechanisms for this? Presidents maybe. Maybe we’re back to being that abrupt, but for a long while, I imagine that this was a little more hidden, or at least in the weeds in terms of hiring or contracting or materials cost. So what do we know about the actual mechanisms for this and how much is from the agency versus directed from the Office of Management and Budget of the White House?

Kevin Angell: First, what I’ll say is I’m going to bracket the last, call it, six years or so. This paper’s data ends in 2018 so I can’t speak to the current moment about exactly how it’s happening. And in many ways, I think as we’ll talk about later, things have definitely shifted in terms of the opaqueness and blatantness that this is occurring. But since the Impoundment Control Act in the 1970s, things have really shifted, so they are more opaque. Presidents haven’t been able to clearly and publicly give these direct orders to not spend funds. And that’s kind of been considered, based off of my interviews and my data analysis, to be the red line where presidents can come up with all sorts of other ways to justify not spending funds, whether that be program timing, whether it be changing paperwork, but they couldn’t say, “I’m doing this to not spend this money,” even if that might be the ultimate end result of that action.

So until the present moment, you’re right, presidents haven’t been able to say the goal is to impound funds. They look for other reasons to justify those changes. In terms of how this is happening, this relates to some work that I’m currently doing trying to disentangle whether this is changing in awarding the contracts or changing in the number of personnel that are employed. Those are very disparate data sets, and I don’t have final results to share there. But based off of some interviews with practitioners, this seems to be a product of, one, there’s a lot that has to do with administrative burden and administering these programs where presidents and their agencies can strategically change how much burden there is. But then also in terms of whether this is coming from the president or not, I’ve chatted with some folks, including some folks at independent agencies that say ultimately while they’re in control of it, they might and do definitely take into account the preferences of those who may have appointed them or otherwise influencing the budget when they’re making decisions about how much to spend their budget.

Matt Grossmann: So you can, of course, imagine innocent explanations for this underspending. “We were trying to hire someone, they didn’t accept our job, we contracted, but the contractor didn’t finish the work within the year,” those kinds of things. How much is there assigned that these kinds of explanations are partially responsible versus their excuses?

Kevin Angell: You’re totally correct that they’re all, like you said, innocent explanations for this. However, in my approach, what I’m doing is I’m trying to take account for those and look at changes that are clearly correlated with changes in how much presidents propose. Yes, there might be cases where the bridge goes over budget or maybe you get a great deal on your bridge contract and you come in under budget, but we shouldn’t see those only happening when presidents want them to happen.

If presidents don’t want to spend funds in a particular area, say public assistance, and what do you know that year there aren’t mysteriously the number of people who apply for public assistance drastically falls, that starts to look a lot less like random chance and more so like active implementation changes. I’m fairly confident, especially given the size of these effects, that this isn’t just due to one-off innocent impacts.

Matt Grossmann: But we might imagine that the president’s going to appoint people to the agencies where he wants to see cuts that also don’t think the money needs to be spent or that the budget could signal the kinds of priorities of the people in these agencies. I don’t know, how much evidence do we have that it really requires intervention rather than anticipation or the personnel at those agencies?

Kevin Angell: I think this is a really good point, Matt, and this is something that my paper doesn’t disentangle between, whether this is anticipation of a presidential directive or whether this is because of behind-the-scenes directed from the president. If anything, I perhaps myself would lean more towards this is due to anticipation or because presidents have appointed those who share their ideology. But if you think about the classic principal agent framework in which presidents are trying to exercise influence in an agency, whether or not the president is directly telling the head of an agency, “Don’t spend this money,” or is going and finding someone who is just going to not spend that money on their own, that might shape our understanding of exactly what we should expect and where we should look as we’re trying to investigate this, but it doesn’t change the overall effect that this money isn’t getting spent when Congress has instructed that it be spent.

Matt Grossmann: Regardless of the mechanisms or even the president as the cause here, it seems like this should really change our theories of how the president and Congress come to consensus on appropriations about bargaining, about the role of presidential power. How much should this change our theories of how the president and Congress interact, and does it explain any anomalies in budget deals that we’ve seen, maybe similar to that example that you mentioned about the Air Force?

Kevin Angell: Sure. I think one of the big ways that this should shape our understanding of congressional bargaining and presidential power is that the bargaining process doesn’t simply end with the adoption of legislation. And this is something we’ve seen pieces of in previous research about how policy decisions, whether that be where grants are made or who gets grants, that after the legislation has passed in Congress, all of a sudden the lobbying all shifts to the executive branch. So it goes from the halls of Congress to maybe the halls of the EEOB, the Eisenhower Executive Building, where a lot of the OMB staff sit. So I see this paper as really reinforcing the fact that as we’re considering who wins in the legislative bargain, we also need to take account who is able to win in executive implementation because the person that might look like a winner upfront might end up losing when it comes to the White House and the person who lost in Congress may be able to get their second chance by lobbying the president and the staff.

In terms of how this shapes our other understandings, one of the things that I really want to focus on is why this is occurring. You can think of three main reasons why Congress would allow this to happen. The first is that Congress just doesn’t have the information it needs at the time that it’s making its decisions to know about this. So this could be Congress doesn’t really know that this is happening, this is happening behind the scenes, and that’s why it’s continuing. The second idea might be that Congress does know about it and that they’re fine with it. You might imagine that Congress knows that they’re going to have to pass some things that they don’t particularly like, maybe some pork that they think is wasteful or whatnot, but they’re relying on the president to really exercise his management authority and cut those out so congressmen can go home to their congressional district and say, “Look, I got this pork for you. Go blame the President, he’s the one who cut it.”

And then the third one would be that Congress does know about it, but they’re unable to solve the collective action challenges that are necessary to enforcing their own budget legislation. This is the area that I think is probably perhaps most likely is that Congress faces this big issue, it’s got its committee system, it’s got all sorts of other areas where Congress is splitting its oversight. The people who might be most interested in the funds aren’t the ones with the best access to information about whether it’s spent or maybe they are, but they have different preferences in the rest of the chamber. So I really think that all those accounts can be really informed by this. And this opens up a lot of new lines for inquiry.

Matt Grossmann: It seems to explain some regularities that maybe seem odd without knowing yet. One is that the president submits a budget and Congress completely ignores it. We also have this idea that the appropriations committees are extremely powerful and usually get what they want. And yet we have the anomaly that people in the administration certainly spend a lot of time preparing the budgets for the president’s budget proposal. So maybe this does connect those together to say everybody is sort of acting in line with the findings. The presidential budget process is maybe not as much for winning in Congress, but for preparing afterwards. What do you think of that story?

Kevin Angell: When we talk about the government budget, I do want to be a little bit precise here. The president submits, at the start of every year, a budget that’s in compliance with the 1921 General Accounting Act, what we usually call the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. And then after they deliver that to Congress, Congress takes it and has a whole bunch of different appropriation bills and the usual process. Sometimes you get a nominal bust like we’ve had in recent years.

But what I think is important here is that, yes, in theory, Congress takes the president’s budget and throws it away. It’s actually not what we necessarily see in the data. There’s lots of cases where the number that comes out of Congress is the number that came in the president’s budget. So now whether that’s on important issues or not, I’ll leave individual readers to think, everyone has something they think is important. But empirically, we don’t see the budget being in Congress starting from scratch from the budget that the president submitted. That’s one of the reasons why the president is required to submit the budget.

… president submitted. That’s one of the reasons why the president is required to submit the budget, because this is an enormous task that Congress at the time didn’t have the resources and now probably doesn’t want to use its resources on producing that document from scratch.

In terms of the irregularities, I think what this really can highlight is the fact that the people who have the expert knowledge in this are going to be in the classical setting your committees and your committee members, and so those are going to be the people that are best empowered to cut those side deals with Congress because they’re the ones that are going to be exercising oversight of this moving forward. And so one area that I’m working on right now is looking at, are the people who have better access to resources in Congress, namely that committees, better able to see their priorities continue to be reflected in presidential implementation of the budget?

Matt Grossmann: So I know we don’t want to get too far into the weeds of your adventure collecting all of this data, but it sort of helps to explain why journalists and members of Congress maybe haven’t been as on this as you might expect. So how did you go about doing this? Why does it take two years to wait to get a final number? And how many people do you think have seen these discrepancies before and know about this process, at least within their agency or domain?

Kevin Angell: Yeah, so in terms of the process, what I did is I went back to those budget documents that presidents propose every year. We have them going back for decades. So I went and I found those scans, and for every subunit, so these are units inside of agencies, I went and I found how much the president asked for in that year’s document. I did that for all the agencies, and then I would go two years later when the president is required to submit, how much the budget actually ended up being and then how much the budget was actually spent. For each of those agencies, I gathered that itself and then I linked them up. And so all this data is coming from the budget. So in theory, anyone could have gone out and gathered this and could still do it, but especially when you’re trying to do it over multiple years, it just takes a long time. Like you said, presidents only submit the actuals about a year and a half later, so for the, say, 2022 budget, we’ll get the actuals in the 2024 budget.

And so at that point, may have had an election cycle, the people who were in Congress, when the budget was passed may be different, they might have different priorities. And so that lag I think is an important factor in explaining why we don’t have as much policing on this because Congress doesn’t have its own ability to do all its own accounting. It’s relying on, in many ways, OMB and other agencies inside the executive branch to do that accounting.

Matt Grossmann: And what about the second part? Is this kind of a known thing within these agencies when they’ve underspent and they know it before those final numbers are submitted, or is this kind of opaque to everyone until later?

Kevin Angell: I think the agencies would have the ability to know it themselves. Whether they know the exact number is going to depend on some of the timing of contracts at the end of the year. But I think it’s pretty fair to say that the agencies will have an understanding that they are under budget, especially in cases when… I will say agencies are much more worried about going over budget than they are under budget. Going over budget has much more severe penalties laid out in statute than underspending. And so my understanding from interviewing agency staff is that going over is their focus. They don’t mind going under, especially if they’re not going to face congressional repercussions, but that essentially do or die on making sure not to go over.

Matt Grossmann: So we know that the basic pattern is that these cuts happen most when presidents proposed underspending and that underspending is way more common than overspending. What are the other big variations? Were there some presidents that moved this a lot more than others? Are there certain kinds of budget accounts or agencies where this is easy?

Kevin Angell: The primary difference that I really see is between discretionary and mandatory spending, and I think this is something that isn’t necessarily obvious that it should fall in one or the other. So on one hand, discretionary spending, with its usually annual appropriations process, might have greater congressional oversight. It’s the Appropriations committee fighting for what the budget is each year, and they know what was spent last year; they’re reviewing the receipts as they’re moving forward. And so we might think that discretionary spending, this would happen less. On the other hand, we could make the same case for mandatory spending where Congress sets the eligibility formula for a particular program, and then the president goes off and implements it and is able to make all sorts of adjustments on exactly how to implement that without the same sort of annual oversight process. So conceptually, it’s not quite clear which one we should expect the most in.

What I see from the data is that very strong, I’d say… We see strong evidence that it’s predominantly focused on discretionary spending, so it’s inside of discretionary spending that presidents are able to exert this influence, whereas we don’t see that in our mandatory spending programs.

Matt Grossmann: You explained a bit that it is much more common to see underspending than overspending. Give us a little bit of the reasons for that. Are these political constraints? Are they just kind of administrative patterns? And why doesn’t this give an inherent advantage to conservative presidents? Why don’t we see the big changes being Republican presidents facing Democratic congresses? Is it because they don’t really have the differences in priorities that we expect, or is there some other explanation?

Kevin Angell: Yeah. So in terms of why we see differences in overspending and underspending, the first thing we want to highlight is that the two operate under very different legal regimes. Overspending is governed by what’s known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which actually carries both criminal and administrative penalties for violating it. So if you’re involved in spending money without congressional authorization, spending money that shouldn’t be spent, you can actually be prosecuted for that. Whereas if you don’t spend money that has been authorized, you might get an Impoundment Control Act investigation initiated against you by GAO, but there’s no clear penalties for that.

And so one thing that I can highlight is at the heart of the first Trump impeachment, which we cannot classically hear about it being the Ukraine scandal, at the heart of that was an Impoundment Control Act violation. Money was supposed to be spent that wasn’t. Ultimately President Trump was impeached for it, though he wasn’t convicted. So if you’re a civil servant, that might be a much more remote penalty to you than if you authorize an overspending and you potentially get criminally charged for that. So that’s kind of one reason why I think that this predominates and can be reflected of this.

In my conversations with staff, OMB systems, agency systems are all set up to be very, very strict about overspending, so if you try to go in and spend money that your agency doesn’t have, in some cases it’s quite literally hard-coded you can’t do that. In other cases, it sends up all sorts of alarm bells. Whereas there’s not the equivalent on the underspending side. It’s not like there’s an alarm bell that goes off if you spend 95%, not 100% of your budget. And if there are controls, it’s very much weaker than preventing you from putting in that payment that is going over your budget.

In terms of how this plays out partisan-wise, I do want to make a distinction between the ability to influence and how much the presidents actually use that influence. So seeing the data is that when presidents tried to underspend, presidents are equally successful regardless of their party. So Democrats have the same ability to underspend as Republicans do, but sure, we see Republicans do this more frequently. They want to spend less money in general, at least that’s what classical understanding says, and so they in fact do propose more spending cuts and implement more spending cuts.

But I think the one reason why we don’t see this massive focus on it’s only Republicans is that everyone can find some government spending that they don’t like. It might be in different areas. Using the contemporary situation, perhaps Democrats want to spend more on public assistance, but they want to spend a whole lot less on, say, ICE. Whereas Republicans might be the reverse. So everyone likes their own pot of government spending, but that means they equally don’t like other areas. You can see this in the Department of Agriculture, this huge department, and I look at some pieces of it, but it encompasses everything from food assistance for needy Americans to crop subsidies to farmers. And so you might think that even inside what we look as, oh, agriculture spending, you still have parts of it that you like and parts of it that you don’t.

Matt Grossmann: So just to clarify, Republican presidents overall do request bigger cuts compared to congressional appropriations; they just move it about as much in the same direction as Democrats. Is that right?

Kevin Angell: That’s correct. And so one other thing to add here is that, why don’t we see Republican presidents maybe taking this to the limit? The classic understanding is that not giving people funds is likely going to perhaps be more painful than if everyone gets extra. If you think about your administering a grant program and you spend over, an extra organization gets a grant, you’re not necessarily going to have as many people calling and yelling at you than if you were to tell a bunch of organizations, “Actually, this year, you don’t get your funding.” And so there are these natural factors that influence underspending and overspending. Underspending might get more angry phone calls, overspending, harsher penalties, and at some point there’s just not money left in the bank.

Matt Grossmann: So the folk history of this is that it was kind of going on a little bit for a while, but that Nixon really took it to an extreme, and then Congress responded to that with a policy change that had more teeth. How much does that really show up in your data? And if this wasn’t a solution, why wasn’t it? And is this just a story of the continuity is there and just the legal justifications and routes change, or are there real breaks when we notice?

Kevin Angell: So the first piece of that that I’ll tackle is, what is different about Nixon? So if we look at the different breakdowns by president, Nixon doesn’t really stand out as particularly an outlier in how much funding he’s influenced. But what you do see if you read some of the more qualitative accounts is that, one, that the type of program that he goes after is different than what happened in the immediate past. So prior to that, a lot more had been in your defense or national security areas, whereas Nixon really drives it home with domestic assistance programs, most notably, say, urban renewal or urban development. So you’re right that Congress does come out and they pass the Impoundment Control Act, but I really want to highlight, it’s actually a cluster of three reforms and cases that really could be doing the work. And so in my paper, I don’t highlight on any specific one. I just do, “Look, we have these three reforms that happen over these two years, and what we can see is before and after that.”

So we have the Impoundment Control Act, which tries to create this categories for how presidents can propose deferrals or rescissions. We have a case called Train v. New York, which is a litigation about what existing statutes allowed the president to do. And Train v. New York, it said that presidents were exceeding their authority under existing statutes to impound funds. And then the third one is there’s a revision to the Anti-Deficiency Act, which Congress intended to pass to prevent presidents from overspending, while also allowing them to set aside funds to account for things like inflation or changing circumstances. But that gets really tightened in the 1970s because previously presidents had said, “Look, we know you passed this law to keep people from spending too much, but one way we can keep from spending too much is we can decide that we don’t want to spend any of this,” and Congress was reacting to that misuse in their view of the Anti-Deficiency Act.

In terms of how this changes before and after, you’re right, it introduces a whole new regime where now presidents are required to follow these set procedures when they want to not spend funds, but I want to highlight, the Impoundment Control Act isn’t that clear of a law, and there’s not clear enforcement mechanisms. Like I mentioned earlier in the interview, there’s no criminal penalties for violating it. It’s also not clear what in fact an ICA violation is. I’ll defer to the lawyers on this; there’s a whole history there. But some basic facts that we think we know. Does the Comptroller General have the ability to sue in federal court to enforce spending? The statute gives them that power, but that ability and the constitutionality of that has never been tested. The Comptroller General has only ever filed suit once and dropped that suit because the administration released the funds before it carried forward.

And so there’s a lot of uncertainty with how this is going to come out if this is litigated. There’s categories like programmatic delays or deferrals that kind of are created by GAO to classify things that are these innocuous reasons why money isn’t spent, but those don’t have a clear definition in statute; it’s not in the Impoundment Control Act. And so what you’re seeing now and what you see after the ICA is passed is that presidents are looking and poking around and trying to find the holes, and I would say my paper is-

… holes and I would say my paper is evidence that they have been successful in finding holes.

Matt Grossmann: And just to clarify, did it take them a while or do we not really see any difference in terms of Ford and Carter and Reagan? They were all able to kind of influence appropriations right away?

Kevin Angell: Yeah. So if I make a little bit more assumptions in the data analysis process, I am able to plot a yearly estimate of how much influence presidents have. And so what you do see there is it looks like there’s a pretty sharp drop right around the Impoundment Control Act, the ADA revision and Train vs. New York, although it rebounds afterwards. So I want to be cautious about not over interpreting that, but I think it’s suggestive evidence that it at least did take the presidents a little bit of time to figure out how to operate under the new regime.

I will say one of the surprising things and that I’m currently investigating right now, is why does Nixon sign the Impoundment Control Act? There’s actually a famous political cartoon where Nixon has three henchmen that he’s using to control Congress. One is the veto power, one is executive privilege and one is impoundment, yet Nixon rolls over quickly and signs the ICA. So it makes you wonder what was going through Nixon’s head about why he allowed this. Did he just think, well, I can survive the formal restriction by coming up with all sorts of new means or what was happening?

Matt Grossmann: A lot of people think we’re at another big break in our time series with the second Trump administration. I know that you have no data from the new administration and you have only a couple of years of data from the first Trump administration. But I want to talk a little bit about it, at least let’s just start, theoretically.

One story is that this is just an administration with very different preferences. So these budgets, and particularly Russ Vought’s vision of government is just very different. So even if Trump was only able to influence spending as much as previous presidents, he just starts with a very different preference. So 30% or 40% of his moves would just be huge moves. How should we think about that, sort of the breadth of the vision here versus the abilities and tools?

Kevin Angell: I think that there’s kind of two areas to focus on here. The first one is the openness with which it’s being done. And the second one, and I’ll bracket that for now, is the scale at which it’s being done on. The first thing with openness, the previous rule of thumb that had existed prior to the first Trump administration that actually some things happened related to it in the Biden administration, was that if you were trying to not spend funds, you didn’t come out and say it, because if you came out and say it, that would be a clear trigger for a GAO investigation. Now all of a sudden you have the president on record, or agency staff member on record saying, the reason why we’re doing this is because we don’t want to spend funds.

That makes it very hard to claim that actually no, this is about some program decision that has incidental impacts on not spending funds, but is actually because of some program priority. And so what we see here is even prior to the Trump administration taking office for their second term, President Trump was pretty clear that he believed the Impoundment Control Act to be unconstitutional, that he wanted it to be challenged in court. And as we can see in Roosevelt’s confirmation hearings, he’s pretty clear that he supports the position of administration. In the administration’s opinion, the ICA is unconstitutional and they seem to be eager for a challenge to it. And so I think part of this is trying to push the limit because they want that lawsuit. They want that Supreme Court decision that strikes down the Impoundment Control Act, and this is their way of triggering that.

In terms of the scale, I think one of the pieces that really you see openly here that you didn’t see before is in personnel, which opens a whole nother can of worms because personnel politics are very complicated, you have all sorts of regulations for how and when you can fire people, under what reasons. And so that’s something that we’re seeing openly happen in the Trump administration that at least wasn’t on the surface happening prior to it, although I am doing more research to see how much was this adjustments. Although I think it’s fair to say that to the scale that we know DOGE, where the focus is on the riffing of thousands of people, I haven’t seen any instances of that in previous impoundment discussions.

Matt Grossmann: And then just did you want to address this kind of theoretical issue of how should we think about it, if it ends up being the case that Trump is no better at moving things towards his priorities, but just that they’re just so different than Congress says, that the spending reductions are going to look bigger because the proposed reductions are bigger?

Kevin Angell: Yeah, I think theoretically the question to ask here is normally, do we want this to occur and do we want presidents to be able to shift by a percentage rather than give them a subset flexibility? I think it’s conceivable that a reform might be, look, presidents have X percent on either side that they can spend as kind of discretionary funds, but that outside of that there’s stricter guardrails. And so as we’re considering what does it mean for the Trump administration to try to cut spending and should we restrict it, we have to ask ourselves normally what do we want and why? And if we want flexibility, why do we want flexibility? I don’t think in many people’s mind flexibility in itself is the goal, it’s to have some sort of better government outcome.

Matt Grossmann: So you said that there wasn’t much precedent or you couldn’t find much precedent for the DOGE or reduction in forces. I know that they also kind of canceled a bunch of contracts for future spending in DOGE. And then we have these examples like USAID where a whole agency has kind of been moved within the State Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau where they tried to kind of zero out the accounts. Are there proto versions of those kinds of moves in your data or anything that we could look on as precedent for that?

Kevin Angell: Yes. I mean, there’s lots of examples of government trying to modernize and reorganization. And Congress has gone through various iterations where they’ve delegated different authority to the president to reorganize executive departments. And there’s mechanisms inside of various budget bills where you can reprogram funds that are meant for one purpose to another related purpose.

But I do think that, we haven’t seen this example where government departments have become this key focus of a DOGE-like instrument. Republicans for a long time talked about getting rid of the Department of Education, and there were lots of plans for doing so. Legislation got proposed, et cetera, but we didn’t have this DOGE equivalent that just went in and sent everyone home until the current moment. So again, normally it’s up to listeners to know whether they want presidents to have this flexibility, but it’s not clear what the limit is on that.

Matt Grossmann: So one of the reasons that they’ve been able to do more is that they’re not maybe as constrained by the courts as people expected. It takes the contractors or the people who would lose money to have standing, they’re often told to go to specific government courts to adjudicate their own contracts rather than bring a broader one. They have been winning a lot of lower level rulings but then are overruled by Supreme Court rulings. How did previous presidents think about this? Did they think there was really a court block on going too far or has this just sort of always been available and Trump is kind of the first to push the envelope?

Kevin Angell: I think that before we focus on the court enforcement of the spending, one of the things I want to highlight is one of the natural ways that Congress, or I shouldn’t say natural, one of the frequent ways that Congress has required an enforced presence to spend funds has been through a tool known as committee reports. These are essentially specific requests or directions or suggestions, depending on what language is used, made by the committee to the agency for how money should be spent. And so the classical understanding is the way that Congress would oversee if presidents didn’t spend the money in a particular area, is that if an agency wasn’t spending funds, there’d be some sort of oversight hearing or communication from the chair ranking member about, “Hey, Mr. Secretary, please, you’d better spend these funds.” And then there’d be threatened retribution against next year’s budget for that agency if those funds weren’t spent.

And so this is prior to the year even ending. You have this, and it is not really happening in the courts, it’s happening via this congressional oversight. That’s something that has changed over the years as we’ve moved away from all these separate appropriations bills towards omnibuses, exactly what committee reports are doing. What if that is adopted in, who’s conducting that oversight, has started to get a little bit murky. And so that’s the classical way this is addressed rather than through a court case. Although we’ve had our share of those, Train vs. New York, like I mentioned before, was an example of New York City not receiving the funds that it believed it was entitled to. And they did litigate that. But I think in previous years we just saw this addressed through congressional oversight rather than judicial oversight.

Matt Grossmann: And we do have a curious case here where the president, or at least DOGE wanted to tout the amount of spending that they saved, and it turned out that the numbers didn’t seem to bear that out. We also have people trying to verify the daily government spending amounts overall, and saying that not as much is changing as it might look. I know that you have to wait a year and a half to see what actually happened here, but do you think there’s a case that actually not as much is happening as people think, or do you think we are really going to see real shifts this year?

Kevin Angell: I’m not sure, Matt, and a couple of reasons why is one, we had these banner changes in how much was spent and canceling of contracts. At the same time, we did see at the end, a few different agencies rush to get money out the door towards their preferred grant recipients or their preferred programs. And so I am not quite sure how much has gone out the door, because especially if they go out the door at the end, there’s a lag for when those actually show up in the various government recording systems.

So I’ll be very interested to see, and I’ll be tracking it closely as we start to get the data, but I don’t know that we know right now at a macro level how much change we’ll see. In general, I’m a little bit skeptical that you can really turn around a government and slash spending all this quickly, especially without legislation. I mean, we did have a rescissions package that went through, but relative to the scale that the DOGE team was trying to cut, I think that rescissions package was quite small, although it was large in absolute terms. And we’ll have to see what happens as, like I said, as the data comes in.

Matt Grossmann: So yeah, we did actually pass one rescissions package and then we had one pocket rescission officially kind of move forward. And that does seem to be at least one kind of acknowledged error in the Impoundment Control Act, is that it does enable these very late requests that Congress doesn’t have time to respond to.

So let’s say that at least maybe under the next Democratic president, we do start to get some, at least behind the scenes, work on an update to the Impoundment Control Act and some effort to kind of rein in the president here. What would those kinds of tools look like or reforms look like? And does the history here suggest that this is not something that’s going to work for very long because presidents are going to find a way around it?

Kevin Angell: Yeah, I think in terms of what a reform would look like, one that I could see happening is just clearer definitions for what all the terms mean in the Impoundment Control Act. So I think there’s a broad recognition that Congress can’t say you have to spend exactly $1 billion, and if there’s one over, one under, this is some sort of major crisis. It’s hard for me to go to the grocery store and spend exactly 20 bucks, much less trying to spend $20 billion on a complicated government program. So because of that, I would expect that there’d be some sort of definition for how much leeway is okay. And then inside of that band, you’re going to have congressional oversight for, are those justifications valid? And then outside of those bands, you’re going to have much stronger judicial oversight for, okay, this isn’t just a question of does Congress buy your declaration that this is necessary, now it’s a legal consequence if it hasn’t met certain requirements.

So I would expect that to be one. I would imagine there’d be a discussion about how many votes does it take to pass a rescissions request? In some ways, when things go through budget reconciliation, the threshold is the same as it is with a rescission. It’s a bare majority, but that doesn’t reflect what’s needed in a traditional bill to overcome the filibuster. So I imagine there’ll be just some discussion over there. The reason why the ICA does privilege that bill is because there’s a recognition that Congress should vote on this before the end of the fiscal year, or at least quickly, so that the president has his instruction-

… at least quickly so that the president has his instructions on what to spend. So there could be tweaks about maybe not just they have 45 days to do it, but a vote must be held and on other forms on that front.

In terms of the effectiveness, I’m not really sure. We’d have to assess any bill that came out to really understand what effects it would have. I would say presidents are pretty protective of this. Presidents don’t want to give up this discretion and have in the past fought to avoid it.

One thing that is a possibility and that I do want to raise is that in previous instances of this, going back to as far as FDR is when I have evidence of it, when there has been concern about presidents impounding funds, presidents have been very skillful at mollifying or assuaging the concerns of the key senators to prevent them from going after discretion overall.

So there’s a famous case under FDR. FDR impounds funds for a dam during World War II. Congress starts to put the fit about this, particularly the Senator who’s concerned with this dam being built. A writer gets floated to limit on the president’s ability to impound funds generally. What do you know that the senator gets his dam and the writer disappears? So that’s a whole lot of politics there and going beyond my expertise in forecasting how the political aspect is going to turn out. But I wouldn’t be surprised if we had some sort of deal being cut to assuage concerns on a particular set of areas in exchange for there not being a wholesale reform of the ICA.

Matt Grossmann: So we had on another episode, we covered the history of war powers, and the timeline is sort of remarkably similar in that the president gains powers that were previously thought to reside in Congress. There’s attempted reforms, but they don’t really change the underlying facts on the ground. And you did title your paper about the power of the purse and kind of point to these sort of fundamental constitutional issues, so is it fair to say that this is kind of another example that the executive is kind of going to gain power over time and that kind of regardless of where the Constitution vests power, that the system has centralizing of power in the Executive Branch built in?

Kevin Angell: I think in many ways you’re right that this is reflective of a broader trend towards centralization of power in the Executive Branch. I won’t go so far as to say that’s inherent to the system that we’ve built and that in the sense that it’s unstoppable. I mean, I think one of the reasons why we’ve had a centralization of powering of the president is one, Congress has all these collective action problems that might naturally push power towards the president, but also a lot of these functions have been things that Congress has gone along with and in many cases has willingly delegated.

So take a requirement that the president be the one to do all the accounting and to present the annual budget. That goes back to 1921. That isn’t necessarily a presidential function. Congress could have established an agency that takes on that function and reports to it. We could imagine some supersized CBO that just wasn’t about legislative scoring but was actually about drafting a comprehensive budget in advance of the president doing it, or maybe the president doesn’t do it at all. And so this centralization I think is both a function of national forces, but also Congress and in many cases, the American people, or at least people point to the American people as wanting this power to shift to the president.

So everyone lines up differently. I’m a big fan of Congress when it’s writing its budget legislation to be specific what it wants, because it is constitutionally the first branch and has the ability to exercise power over the purse. But if it’s vague about what it wants or its instructions, I think we’re going to see presidents try to exploit that vagueness if Congress hasn’t been as specific as possible and doesn’t have the oversight that it needs.

Matt Grossmann: Yeah. So if you’re willing, just help us think through a little bit of this normative implications here, at least a couple of, I guess, more of the sort of straightforward arguments why this might be acceptable. First of all is that agencies just might know best, and if the alternative is we’re going to buy a bunch of computers on the last day of the fiscal year because we have to spend this amount, then maybe this is better than that. And then second, I guess, is the issue that the system doesn’t have a whole lot of built-in mechanisms for spending less. We do have out of control deficit spending relative to the amount we’re willing to tax. So is this a reasonable overall check on that?

Kevin Angell: I mean, I think one of the big concerns that I have about this process is the fact that it’s not transparent. You can go look up and see what did Congress pass for this budget and who voted against it, who voted for it, what’s the legislative history of that? But if this is happening kind of behind closed doors, it’s not subject to the FOIA process because it’s all deliberative decisions and things of that nature, or at least one could make an argument. There’s real questions about, yes, the agency might say this is best, but what went into that? Was there opportunity for comment by individuals? Is this consistent with what the legislatures intended? So I think that is a major normative concern, regardless of where you fall on whether or not we want presidential discretion.

In terms of, do agencies just know best on what to spend on? I think political science tells us that agencies likely are going to have perhaps different preferences than those who are providing their budget. You might imagine that the military is going to want to spend more money on the military and the EPA is going to want to spend more money in environmental regulation, and that might not be shared by either the president or Congress or the American public. And so yes, we can point to cases where an agency bought a bunch of very nice office chairs, I could use a new office chair myself, on the last day and say, “Okay, this is waste.” But as you try to scale up, just differentiating waste or what adequate spending is gets pretty hard.

And because let’s take an example of even something on a bridge, right? So Congress gets specific and says, “You must build this one bridge, here’s the budget to do so.” Congress is likely not legislating exact dimensions of the bridge or how good the concrete is or what color it should be painted and all these sorts of things that do have implications for how much it costs.

And so I’m in favor of Congress providing a more clear criteria to agencies for what it considers best and how it should weigh, all these different decisions. But at the end, if that decision making process is opaque, it’s hard for the American public to assess whether they think it’s done right and is a normative challenge.

Matt Grossmann: So on the other side, I want to give you a chance to address the argument that there’s a big shift in the second Trump administration. We’re descending into authoritarianism and you’re papering it over here, Kevin, by saying this is a long-term trend and that presidents have kind of always been able to do that and that there aren’t kind of real lines being crossed here. So what would you say to that?

Kevin Angell: I guess the first thing that I would say is I started this project before the second Trump administration and so this isn’t a paper that’s in reaction to it. This was long going before it. I’m going to keep studying this during this administration, during the next administration, whoever it might be. And so this is in no way, shape, or form trying to weigh in on the merits or the normative implications of this discretion.

And in my view, in order for us to make a decision about how much discretion there should occur, we need to understand how much is happening right now. And previously to, I think, the current moment in political science, a lot of political scientists just assumed that there was none or at least not ones that were big enough for us to pick up. And so I see this paper as really showing that actually no, even with the current situation, even with the Impoundment Control Act prior to the Trump administration, there were holes in it the presidents were able to exploit.

And so like I mentioned before, there are differences with the current moment or at least looks to be both in terms of size and blatantness. And we didn’t even tackle all the sorts of things about in all the DOGE rifts and the firings and the layoffs, were proper procedures being followed, et cetera. So like I said, this is in no means meant to defend any current practices. I don’t have data on them even if I wanted to, and it’s just meant to inform both the public, political scientists, and policymakers about what’s happened in the past. We can make better decisions about as we look towards reforming the process, what worked in the past. You can’t stamp something out if you don’t know if your past efforts worked.

Matt Grossmann: And is there anything we didn’t get to that you wanted to include or anything you want to tell about what is next?

Kevin Angell: Yeah. So first off, I want to say thank you to a couple of funders, the National Science Foundation, the Levin Center for Oversight Democracy, as well as the Bach Fellowship for Congressional Studies for the generous financial support. That also comes with a disclaimer that all the views that I express in this podcast are my own and don’t reflect that of any of those funders. So the information you got today is my own opinion and exactly that and doesn’t necessarily reflect the NSF, the Bach Foundation, or the Levin Center.

In terms of what’s coming next, I’m working on follow-up papers to explore a lot of the dynamics I alluded to here, whether that be if the adjustments to spending are due to personnel changes or due to contracting, how presidents are able to exercise or take advantage of this influence, whether that be through appointments or direct decisions or politicized agencies. I think there’s a lot of conflicting theories for where we should see this. On one hand, in politicized agencies, presidents might have the most ability to exercise this discretion. On the other hand, in those politicized agencies, presidents might not have any need to because if people are controlling the spending that agree with you, they can go spend it on areas that you like rather than you needing to just halt the spending altogether.

So lots in store. I’ll keep doing my interviews with practitioners and Congress and the agencies. Those got put on pause a little bit with the government shutdown, so that definitely road blocked my research for a bit, but much more of that to come.",https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iStock-621905776-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:58:02.388590

Their rap sheets cumulatively include attempted murder, thousands of assaults, and hundreds of burglaries, robberies, drug offenses, weapons offenses and sexual predatory offenses.
Also caught and released by New York authorities was career criminal migrant Alexander Moreno Montoya, who has charges including assaulting a police officer, criminal possession of a weapon and cocaine possession.
“We are calling on Letitia James to stop this dangerous derangement and commit to honoring the ICE arrest detainers of the more than 7,000 criminal illegal aliens in New York’s custody.
Criminal illegal aliens should not be released back onto our streets to terrorize more innocent Americans.”","New York state has released nearly 7,000 known illegal migrant criminals without notifying ICE since President Trump took over, and has more than 7,000 others locked up in jails and prisons, the Department of Homeland Security revealed.

All of them are being protected by sanctuary laws, DHS says, and the feds are now demanding that New York Attorney General Letitia James hand them over so they can be deported, according to a letter DHS sent to the state’s embattled top lawyer Monday.

The feds laid out how many of the migrants have been involved in thousands of crimes — including violent offenses — but have been released back into the community or on bail or parole — all without notifying ICE.

“These are people who are not only in the country illegally, but who have committed additional crimes, including heinous crimes like murder, rape, possession of child pornography, armed robbery, and many others,” a demand letter penned by acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent to the AG’s office Monday.

The letter obtained by The Post points to a staggering 6,947 illegal aliens with active ICE detainers who were released back onto New York streets since Jan. 20.

Their rap sheets cumulatively include attempted murder, thousands of assaults, and hundreds of burglaries, robberies, drug offenses, weapons offenses and sexual predatory offenses.

New York’s sanctuary laws tie the hands of law enforcement when cooperating with immigration agents, which means instead of being deported to their countries of origin, they were simply turned loose.

“Virtually all Americans agree that people like this should be swiftly removed from the United States when they leave New York’s custody and not be returned to our streets to wreak havoc on law abiding citizens,” Lyons wrote.

Currently, ICE says, another 7,113 aliens are locked up in New York with active detainers, who are responsible for a combined 148 homicides, 717 assaults, 134 burglaries, 106 robberies, 235 dangerous drug offenses, 152 weapons offenses and 260 sexual predatory offenses.

The letter follows a similar missive sent to James on Sept. 15, which DHS says she ignored.

James’ office referred The Post to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office.

The agency included a supplemental with its letter highlighting a dozen migrants with heinous criminal histories who were released from custody in New York in recent months rather than being turned over to immigration authorities.

Among them was Anderson Smith Satuye Martinez, a Crips gang member with a prior assault conviction who was busted Aug. 19 for criminal possession of a weapon and possession of a controlled substance. Despite an ICE detainer lodged against him, he was released by local authorities before ICE picked him up again on Sept. 11 in the Bronx.

ICE also locked up Jose David Hernandez Hernandez, who was arrested for rape, strangulation and assault before being released. After immigration agents’ intervention, he’s now in ICE custody awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings.

Also caught and released by New York authorities was career criminal migrant Alexander Moreno Montoya, who has charges including assaulting a police officer, criminal possession of a weapon and cocaine possession.

Although he was under an ICE detainer, he was released from Rikers Island on March 17, only to be caught by ICE ERO NYC on July 7 and removed from the US.

“Please confirm whether the State of New York plans to honor detainers on these aliens or whether each of these barbarians will someday walk the streets of New York again,” the letter to James pointedly concludes.

“Attorney General James and her fellow New York Sanctuary politicians are releasing murderers, terrorists, and sexual predators back into our neighborhoods and putting American lives at risk,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement to The Post.

“We are calling on Letitia James to stop this dangerous derangement and commit to honoring the ICE arrest detainers of the more than 7,000 criminal illegal aliens in New York’s custody. It is common sense. Criminal illegal aliens should not be released back onto our streets to terrorize more innocent Americans.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/116515245.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-01 16:58:21.310587

The states may each provide the federal government with 1,000 random driver’s license records for verification to help improve the database.
The settlement involves several states that have left the Electronic Registration Information Center, a nonprofit that helps roughly two dozen states update their voter rolls.
Becker said that the DHS data has gotten mixed reviews for accuracy, and states that have tried to make a big splash investigating immigrant voting have come up nearly empty handed.
“If I were a resident of one of those states, I’d be very concerned about my information security,” he said.","Officials from four Republican-led states reached an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security making it easier for states to access immigration data used to investigate potential migrant voting.

The settlement between DHS and officials from Florida, Indiana, Iowa, and Ohio—filed Friday in federal court, ahead of the case’s dismissal on Monday—resolves a quartet of federal lawsuits pursued since 2024 as part of broader efforts by conservatives to combat illegal voting by immigrants, which studies have shown is exceedingly rare.

The states will negotiate with the federal government within three months to enter new information sharing agreements to help improve and modernize DHS’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database. The states may each provide the federal government with 1,000 random driver’s license records for verification to help improve the database.

“In 2024, Florida sued the Biden admin over its refusal to follow federal law and provide immigration information to ensure only U.S. citizens were voting in our elections,” Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier (R) posted Monday on X. “Thanks to the Trump admin, we’ve reached an historic agreement that will provide the states with an invaluable amount of immigration information so we can protect our elections for years to come.”

DHS has two months to ensure the database has certain capabilities, according to the agreement. They include free service for state and local agencies, the ability to use Social Security Administration data for certain searches, the capacity for states to bulk upload verification requests, and the ability to obtain immigration-status information either within two days or within a reasonable period.

Certain other outstanding verification requests made with the federal government must also be fulfilled within a month.

The settlement involves several states that have left the Electronic Registration Information Center, a nonprofit that helps roughly two dozen states update their voter rolls. Instead of using that secure process, these states appear to be giving the “crown jewels” of personal identifiable information to the Trump administration which has already uploaded such things to vulnerable servers, said David Becker, the executive director of the nonpartisan nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research.

“If you can find people that for whatever reason are ineligible, states should remove them. The question is at what cost?” he said.

Consolidated Suit

The states filed their lawsuits separately but joined together on Friday in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida for a new combined complaint before filing the settlement agreement. A similar lawsuit filed in Texas remains pending.

The agreement could supercharge enforcement by Uthmeier, who’s made prosecuting migrants a focus in his first year in office. Uthmeier has supported local efforts to prosecute migrants using Florida’s criminal code and has touted work by his branch’s Office of Statewide Prosecution, which received permission to prosecute migrant voting crimes by a Florida appeals court.

Similar efforts are underway in Ohio, where Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R) has made criminal referrals to the state attorney general’s office and the Justice Department for what he said were suspected election-related crimes.

“Ohio has a duty to ensure that only US citizens are registered to vote, and this agreement gives us the tools to do that job right,” LaRose said in a news release Monday.

Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird (R) said in a news release Monday that the agreement “will help Iowa safeguard the integrity of our elections for years to come by preventing an illegal vote to cancel out the vote of Iowa citizens.”

A DHS spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Becker said that the DHS data has gotten mixed reviews for accuracy, and states that have tried to make a big splash investigating immigrant voting have come up nearly empty handed. Texas has claimed that thousands of noncitizens were registered but has prosecuted only a few dozen, while LaRose claimed there were hundreds of examples but only a handful of cases were pursued.

States have to weigh these cases against potentially supplying residents’ dates of birth, drivers’ license numbers, and Social Security numbers to an administration that uploaded Social Security numbers to an unsecured cloud server and inadvertently released the governor-elect of New Jersey’s full number this year.

“If I were a resident of one of those states, I’d be very concerned about my information security,” he said. “What happens if the federal government accidentally releases this information—if someone applies for a fraudulent mortgage using data they never should have had, where does a person go to receive compensation?”

The agreement, filed in federal court last week, compels DHS to retrofit the decades-old Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program — a system built to determine eligibility for federal public benefits, not citizenship status or voting eligibility.

Under pressure from Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio, DHS will now make SAVE capable of mass, automated citizenship checks using Social Security numbers and state driver’s license data, despite long-standing warnings that the system is structurally ill-suited for voter verification and prone to flagging U.S. citizens as potential noncitizens.

“Within 90 days of the execution of this Settlement Agreement, and consistent with any new ISA, representatives from each State Plaintiff (i.e., Florida, Ohio, Iowa, and Indiana) may provide Defendants with 1,000 randomly selected driver’s license records from their state (including First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Driver’s License Number or State Identification Number, and State of issuance), for which verification is requested, and for assistance in developing and improving functionality for SAVE by making state-level data available to SAVE,” the settlement reads.

That means state DMVs — where most voters register and where some of the most sensitive personal information is stored — may become sources feeding a federal system never considered for election administration.

The terms of the agreement are set to remain in force for at least two decades, allowing the states to demand continued federal cooperation regardless of who occupies the White House.

The settlement also compels DHS to fundamentally restructure the SAVE system’s internal machinery. The agency must incorporate Social Security data, expand the system’s search options and allow states to submit massive batches of voter information at once.

The agreement requires, among other upgrades, “Free service for state, territorial, tribal, and local government agencies,” as well as “The capacity to process bulk upload verification requests so that users of the system will not need to input verification requests one-by-one.”

While the lawsuit involved only four states, the settlement’s impact is national.

Because DHS agreed to rewrite the underlying SAVE system itself — not just its agreements with Florida, Ohio, Indiana and Iowa — every state that uses SAVE will gain access to these new bulk-search tools, Social Security–based matching and expanded data checks once the upgrades are implemented.

States could run entire voter lists through a system that has repeatedly been shown to misidentify naturalized citizens, married voters who changed their names and anyone whose records contain minor inconsistencies.

And the system’s reach may grow even further.

DHS explicitly reserved the option to explore enhancements that would allow citizenship checks with even less information.

“Defendants may, in their discretion, undertake a feasibility study to determine whether the SAVE system could be enhanced or another system developed that would allow Plaintiffs to obtain U.S. citizenship or immigration-status information when providing only first name and last name and date of birth,” the settlement adds.

The consequences are likely to land hardest on the communities that have already faced historical barriers to voting — including minority voters, naturalized citizens and married women who changed their names.

In October, dozens of federal agents swarmed through Chinatown and arrested nine people DHS said were in the US illegally.
That raid attracted another spontaneous protest by residents and sparked criticism by leading New York Democrats, including Zohran Mamdani, who was elected mayor of the city in November.
A spokesperson for Mamdani, who will take office on 1 January, condemned Saturday’s federal action as “cruel and inhumane” in a statement to Time.
“It’s really despicable,” Christopher Marte, the Democratic city commissioner, told the New York Times.","A raid by federal immigration authorities on Saturday in New York City was thwarted by about 200 protesters, several of whom were arrested after scuffles with police officers.

The episode was the latest in which citizen activists have stood up to agents enforcing Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda through targeted raids in various cities across the country after his second presidency began in January.

Similar recent actions by federal authorities elsewhere, including in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chicago, Illinois, have been met with resistance by citizens opposed to the administration’s escalating program of detentions and deportations.

According to the New York Times, Saturday’s confrontation took place on the edge of Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood, where US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents were assembling with counterparts from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The newspaper reported that scuffles with police took place at a parking garage in lower Manhattan beginning in the late morning, with some protesters blocking the government vehicles from leaving with makeshift barricades including garbage bags and metal barriers.

By early afternoon, the Times said, about 200 protesters had gathered, chanting and shouting at the agents, and the confrontation turned violent when some of the vehicles emerged from the garage and were chased along Canal Street. A number of the protesters were “hurling planters and trash cans after them”, the newspaper said, and a masked occupant in one of the vehicles sprayed several people with what appeared to be a chemical irritant.

Time magazine reported government agents abandoned their raid, which would have been their second large-scale operation in six weeks in lower Manhattan. In October, dozens of federal agents swarmed through Chinatown and arrested nine people DHS said were in the US illegally. That raid attracted another spontaneous protest by residents and sparked criticism by leading New York Democrats, including Zohran Mamdani, who was elected mayor of the city in November.

A spokesperson for Mamdani, who will take office on 1 January, condemned Saturday’s federal action as “cruel and inhumane” in a statement to Time.

“New York City’s more than three million immigrants are central to our city’s strength, vitality, and success, and the mayor-elect remains steadfast in his commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of every single New Yorker, upholding our sanctuary laws, and de-escalation rather than use of unnecessary force,” said Monica Klein, of Mamdani’s transition team.

A statement sent to Time by DHS blamed the violence on the protesters and said arrests were made by the New York police department (NYPD) assisting with crowd control.

“Following social media posts calling agitators to ICE’s location in New York City, individuals dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles showed up and began to obstruct federal law enforcement officers including by blocking the parking garage,” it said.

“NYPD was called and responded to hundreds of violent rioters, which resulted in the arrest of multiple agitators.”

The involvement of the NYPD and its strategic response group (SRG) in Saturday’s action drew criticism from local politicians, who noted it was barred by city law from assisting the federal government in immigration arrests.

“It’s really despicable,” Christopher Marte, the Democratic city commissioner, told the New York Times.

“It seems like the NYPD, specifically the SRG, is working to clear the way for ICE agents to go out in our city to do arrests and put people in the process of deportation.”

Mamdani announced after his election that he would retain Jennifer Tisch as NYPD commissioner a year after she was appointed by outgoing mayor Eric Adams.

The Times said Tisch had a phone conversation Saturday with Ricky Patel, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations, the law enforcement arm of DHS. During the call, a source said, Tisch called Saturday’s government action “unacceptable” and said it put New Yorkers, federal agents and NYPD officers in harm’s way.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c40f333cc097ef57e86b82e7c9b689a831b0225a/182_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdf0087b001b2c739d6074f7a5a9317a",N,,2025-12-01 15:58:13.325568

“If I get out, I’m going back to my house, and then I have to appear in county court,” Miguel said.
The Fond du Lac County Jail has transferred 10 people into ICE custody in 2025, Sheriff Ryan Waldschmidt said.
Fond du Lac County received nearly $25,000 through the program in fiscal year 2024, according to Waldschmidt.
He was scheduled to appear by video in Fond du Lac County court on the morning of Nov. 20.","This story was produced and originally published by Wisconsin Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom.

Stacey Murillo Martinez arrived at the Fond du Lac County courthouse in June to pay a $1,500 cash bond for her husband, Miguel Murillo Martinez, as he sat in jail facing drunken driving, bail jumping and firearms charges.

Scraping the funds together was no small feat. Stacey lives on a fixed income, so Miguel’s boss chipped in. She expected the court to eventually return the $1,500. Bond is meant to serve as collateral to incentivize defendants to show up for their court dates, as she believed Miguel would.

She did not know U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would wait inside the Fond du Lac County Jail later that day to take Miguel, an immigrant from Honduras, into their custody.

Months later, Miguel still sits in an ICE facility near Terre Haute, Indiana. His detention caused him to miss a court date in September, prompting the Fond du Lac County judge to issue a bench warrant for his arrest.

“They didn’t tell me, ‘You’re guilty’ or ‘You’re not guilty,’ ” he said, his voice muffled and distorted by the facility’s phone system.

“I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Stacey said in early November, referring to the fate of her husband and the bail money – three times the monthly rent for the couple’s double-wide in a Fond du Lac manufactured home park.

ICE records list more than 130 arrests at county jails in Wisconsin between January and July 2025. Nearly 40% were awaiting a ruling in their first criminal case.

While defendants sit in ICE custody, their criminal cases generally continue without them — sometimes with no explanation of their absence to the court. As ICE ramps up its enforcement efforts nationwide, Wisconsin courts are increasingly left with loose ends: defendants without their day in court, victims without a chance to testify and thousands of dollars in forfeited bail paid by family, friends and employers.

“If I get out, I’m going back to my house, and then I have to appear in county court,” Miguel said.

Miguel is not the only recent example: ICE picked up his nephew, Junior Murillo, at the Fond du Lac County Jail in October as he faced charges for disorderly conduct and domestic abuse.

The Fond du Lac County Jail has transferred 10 people into ICE custody in 2025, Sheriff Ryan Waldschmidt said. His county is among 15 Wisconsin local governments to have signed agreements with ICE to assist in identifying and apprehending unauthorized immigrants. These are often called 287(g) agreements, referencing the section of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act authorizing the program.

Fond du Lac is also among the more than two dozen Wisconsin counties participating in the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, through which the Department of Justice partially reimburses incarceration costs for agencies that share data on unauthorized immigrants in their custody. Fond du Lac County received nearly $25,000 through the program in fiscal year 2024, according to Waldschmidt.

Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney said ICE has been “very easy for us to communicate and work with,” and his prosecutors inform judges if a defendant is arrested in the courthouse. Waldschmidt noted that while his office communicates with prosecutors about inmates in county custody with ICE holds, it lacks a written policy requiring them to notify prosecutors of handoffs to ICE.

Criminal and immigration courts collide

Wisconsin courts do not consistently track whether a defendant has entered ICE custody, but multiple Wisconsin defense attorneys told Wisconsin Watch that immigration authorities frequently arrest defendants shortly after they post bail.

“The judge will issue a $500 cash bond, somebody in the family will post it before I’m able to tell them, ‘please don’t,’ and the client will get transferred into immigration custody, where they’re really not able to make the appearance in circuit court,” said Kate Drury, a Waupaca-based criminal defense and immigration attorney.

In rare cases, prosecutors work with ICE to extradite defendants from detention centers in other states – or, even rarer, from other countries. Doing so is complicated and expensive, especially for smaller counties.

Toney said his office can’t justify expenses for bringing any out-of-state defendant back to prosecute lower-level cases, such as driving without a license.

Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne is similarly reluctant to spend thousands to extradite defendants from faraway detention facilities. “If it’s a misdemeanor retail theft (charge), let’s say, and the person is in California, that extradition cost may be $5,000,” he said. “We’re probably not going to spend $5,000 or bring that person back.”

Ozanne’s office did, however, successfully fight for custody of a Honduran woman accused of killing two teenagers while driving drunk on Highway I-90 north of Madison in July. ICE detained Noelia Saray Martinez Avila, 30, after her attorney posted a $250,000 bond to release her from the Dane County jail in August. Martinez Avila is scheduled to appear in Dane County court in December.

Defendants in ICE custody can sometimes appear for Wisconsin court hearings via video call, though some attorneys report struggling to schedule those from immigration detention centers.

“Jails and private prisons that operate immigration detention facilities aren’t super focused or motivated in helping defendants make their scheduled court appearances,” Drury said.

When a defendant misses a court date, Toney’s office typically requests a bench warrant and moves to schedule a bail forfeiture hearing — regardless of whether ICE detention caused the absence, he said.

Making exceptions for ICE detainees would mean “treating somebody differently because of their immigration status,” Toney said. Still, attorneys in his office can exercise their own discretion when deciding whether to seek a warrant or bail forfeiture, he added. The prosecutor responsible for Junior Murillo’s case, for instance, did not request that the court forfeit his bail after his ICE arrest.

Ozanne argued against forfeiting defendants’ bail if they miss a court date while in ICE custody.

“It wasn’t their unwillingness to show up” that prevented them from appearing in court, he said, adding that his office would be willing to return bail money to whomever posted it on the defendant’s behalf.

“The problem is that we don’t necessarily know” whether a person is in custody, Ozanne added. While he, like Toney, has reported no difficulties communicating with ICE, the agency doesn’t proactively inform his office when it arrests immigrants with active cases in Dane County.

ICE did not respond to emailed questions from Wisconsin Watch.

Mindy Nolan, a Milwaukee-based attorney who specializes in the interaction between criminal cases and immigration status, said judges generally issue warrants for defendants in ICE custody to keep their criminal cases alive if ICE releases them or they return to the country after deportation.

“Over the years, what I’ve heard from judges is (that) if the person is present in the United States in the future, they could be picked up on the state court warrant,” she said.

Hearings without defendants

Wisconsin law gives courts at least 30 days to decide whether to forfeit a defendant’s bail.

“The default assumption seems to be that the immigrant could appear and the statute places the burden on the defendant to prove that it was impossible for them to appear,” Drury said. “But how does the defendant meet that burden when they’re being held in immigration custody, transferred all over the country, potentially transferred outside the United States?”

Wisconsin courts have held more than 2,700 bail forfeiture hearings thus far in 2025, though the state’s count does not provide details on the reasons for defendants’ absence. If the defendant misses the hearing, the defendant’s attorney or those who paid the bail can challenge the forfeiture by demonstrating that the absence was unavoidable.

On a Friday morning in late October, a Racine County judge issued a half-dozen bail forfeiture orders in just minutes. The court had scheduled a translator for most of the cases, and she sat alone at the defense table, occasionally scanning the room in case any defendants slipped in at the last minute.

“The problem is getting someone at the bond forfeiture hearings to assert those arguments on behalf of clients,” Drury said. Public defenders are often stretched thin, and family members may be unaware of upcoming hearings. Court records indicate Miguel Murillo lacks a defense attorney assigned to his case in Fond du Lac, leaving only Stacey to argue against bail forfeiture.

Such hearings tend to be more substantial when attorneys are present, boosting the likelihood of bail money being returned.

Miguel Murillo’s case does not involve an alleged victim, meaning forfeited bail would go to Fond du Lac County. Court costs typically exceed the value of forfeited bail, Toney said.

When cases involve alleged victims, Wisconsin law requires that courts use forfeited bail for victim restitution – even without a conviction.

What’s missing are judicial findings that the defendant is responsible for the alleged actions and caused suffering to the victim, Drury said.

“Without a conviction, I don’t understand how you maintain that policy and the presumption of innocence, which is such an important constitutional cornerstone of this country.”

Immigration arrests often throw a wrench in the gears of the criminal justice system, Ozanne said.

“It’s most problematic for us when the person hasn’t gone through their due process,” he said. “We have victims… who don’t really get the benefit of the process or have the ability to communicate with the courts about what they think should happen.”

“In a sense,” he added, “that person has a get-out-of-jail-free card.”

Miguel Murillo left Honduras a decade ago, initially settling in Houston. While in Texas, he says he survived a shooting and sought, but never obtained, a U-visa, which provides temporary legal status to victims of certain crimes.

The shooting prompted him to head north to Wisconsin, where he found construction work and married Stacey, a lifelong Wisconsinite. Court records mark occasional run-ins with law enforcement and misdemeanors over the last five years, culminating in the April 2025 charges that preceded his ICE arrest.

Stacey, who is receiving treatment for breast cancer, relied on her husband to keep their household afloat. In his absence, she said, “I have to beg, plead, and borrow to get any assistance.”

“Right now, as I go through this situation… there’s no one to take care of her,” Miguel told Wisconsin Watch. The couple hope that argument will sway a Chicago immigration court judge to release him from ICE custody. The court held its final hearing on his order of removal case in late October, Stacey said, but has yet to issue a ruling.

Junior’s case progressed far more quickly. After his arrest in October, he spent just over a week in ICE custody before immigration authorities put him on a plane to Honduras.

Miguel, on the other hand, has spent roughly five months in various ICE detention facilities. He was scheduled to appear by video in Fond du Lac County court on the morning of Nov. 20. He never joined the call.

“I don’t know what happened,” he wrote to Wisconsin Watch afterwards. “I was waiting and (facility staff) didn’t call me.”

Stacey couldn’t attend the hearing for health reasons, and Miguel has yet to secure an attorney for his Fond du Lac case. Court records do not indicate whether the prosecutor requested forfeiture of his $1,500 bail.",https://wisconsinpublictv.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ww-courts-immigration-ice-defendants-murrilo.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 15:58:28.100853

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday said the second strike was carried out “in self-defense” and “in accordance” with laws governing armed conflict.

President Donald Trump was expected to meet with his national security team Monday as bipartisan scrutiny has mounted over a report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order in September to strike the vessel.

Democrats have said that the allegations first reported by The Washington Post last week could amount to a war crime, and Republicans have also voiced their concerns about the legality of the Sept. 2 attack in the Caribbean. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees have opened investigations into the recent U.S. military strikes on vessels in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.

The Latest:

Outlets that reach millions denied access to rare Pentagon news briefings this week

The briefings are instead being held for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s hand-picked media organizations.

It’s not as if there’s little to talk about, with both the Senate and House Armed Services committees opening investigations into U.S. military strikes against alleged drug couriers in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.

Hegseth’s team says the briefings are part of special orientation events for a newly credentialed Pentagon press corps, consisting primarily of conservative outlets that agreed to his new rules for operation.

Most mainstream outlets exited the Pentagon this fall rather than agree to the new rules. The Defense Department says they are “common sense” regulations designed to prevent the spread of classified information. But many news outlets worried they would effectively be agreeing only to report news approved by Hegseth.

US air travelers without REAL IDs will be charged a $45 fee

Air travelers in the U.S. without a REAL ID will be charged a $45 fee beginning in February, the Transportation Security Administration announced Monday.

The updated ID has been required since May, but passengers without it have so far been allowed to clear security with additional screening and a warning. The Department of Homeland Security says 94% of passengers are already compliant.

REAL ID is a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that meets enhanced requirements mandated in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Obtaining the ID — indicated by a white star in a yellow circle in most states — means taking more documents to the motor vehicle agency than most states require for regular IDs.

Beginning Feb. 1, travelers 18 and older flying domestically without a REAL ID and who don’t have another accepted form of ID on them, such as a passport, will pay the non-refundable fee to verify their identity through TSA’s alternative “Confirm.ID” system.

Admiral who ordered follow-up strike on drug boat to brief lawmakers this week

U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Frank Bradley will provide a classified briefing to key lawmakers overseeing the military on Thursday as they investigate a U.S. military attack on a boat allegedly carrying drugs that included a second strike that killed survivors.

Bradley, who was commander of Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the Sept. 2 attack, ordered the follow-up strike, the White House said Monday as it defended Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s conduct following a report from The Washington Post.

Rep. Mike Rogers, the Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said he was “satisfied” following a conversation with Hegseth on the attack, but that he also wanted to hear from Bradley.

“We’ll all have clarity on Thursday afternoon,” Rogers said.

GOP senator says if an official ordered strike on survivors, they should ‘get the hell out of Washington’

North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said he wants more information on a report that top military officials ordered an attack on survivors of a boat strike, calling the claim potentially “rage bait.” Still, he said “we need to get to the bottom of it,” and that, if true, it would amount to “a violation of an ethical, moral or legal code.”

“If it’s substantiated, whoever made that order needs to get the hell out of Washington,” Tillis said.

Tillis, who announced earlier this year he won’t seek reelection, was a deciding vote in confirming Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Chair of Senate Armed Services Committee pledges boat strike investigation will be ‘by the numbers’

Republican Sen. Roger Wicker says he wants vigorous oversight following a report that top military officials ordered an attack on survivors of a boat strike.

“We’ll find out the ground truth,” he said, adding that the ramifications of the report were “serious charges.”

Wicker added that he expected a briefing from U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Frank Bradley, who was overseeing the operation, but avoided saying whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will be called to testify.

Experts explain what the law says about killing survivors of a boat strike

The U.S. military would have committed a crime if it killed the survivors of an alleged drug boat after it was first attacked, legal experts say.

It doesn’t matter whether the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels as the Trump administration asserts. Such a fatal strike would have violated peacetime laws and those governing armed conflict, the experts say.

“I can’t imagine anyone, no matter what the circumstance, believing it is appropriate to kill people who are clinging to a boat in the water,” said Michael Schmitt, a professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College.

The White House confirmed Monday that a second strike was conducted in September against a vessel accused of trafficking drugs off Venezuela and insisted it was legal.

Bill Cassidy celebrates Trump signing law on health care

The Louisiana senator, who is emphasizing his ties to Trump ahead of a tough primary, posted a video touting the president’s signature on a Senate bill.

“It’s all about making America healthy again,” Cassidy says in the video, taken from a car. The SUPPORT Act is meant to boost programs that treat substance use disorders, overdoses, and mental health.

Cassidy posted earlier today that he was invited to the White House for the bill signing. Trump has not made an endorsement in the 2026 Senate race in Louisiana, where Cassidy is up for reelection. Cassidy — highlighting what he’s previously called a “great working relationship” with Trump — drew multiple challengers from his own party after voting to convict Trump on an article of impeachment.

Schumer calls Hegseth a ‘national embarrassment’ and demands release of boat strike video

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the Defense secretary childish and insecure, and said Hegseth’s social media post of a cartoon turtle firing on suspected drug traffickers is “something no serious leader would ever think of doing.”

Schumer said the Armed Services committees conducting oversight should demand that Hegseth release the video of the strike and testify under oath about what happened.

Senate GOP Leader wants ‘all the particulars’ on Venezuelan boat strike

Sen. John Thune says he’s glad the Armed Services committees in Congress will be conducting oversight of the boat strikes on alleged drug traffickers that critics have described as war crimes.

“I don’t have, at this point, an evaluation of the secretary,” Thune told reporters. “Others can make those evaluations.”

He said he expects the committee to look into “what happened when and what orders were given.”

“I don’t think you want to draw any conclusions or deductions until you have all the facts,” Thune told reporters. “We’ll see where they lead.”

Trump honors National Guard troops at White House Christmas party

In a video of the party posted online by White House aide Margo Martin, Trump noted that he spoke to the parents of U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, who was killed in last week’s shooting in Washington.

“Her parents couldn’t believe it, what happened to their baby, what happened to their daughter,” Trump said Monday. “She’s gone.” He said another National Guard member — U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, whom Trump called “a fabulous young man” — was “fighting for his life.”

“Maybe he’ll be OK, he’s going through a lot,” Trump said. “Maybe he’ll be OK.”

The press was not invited into the Christmas gathering, which an aide said was the first one at the White House this year.

“We have a little more than three years left, and three years for Trump is an eternity,” Trump said to applause and laughter, according to the video posted by Martin.

Sen. Kelly says Trump is trying to bully him: ‘I won’t let it happen’

Facing a Pentagon investigation after President Donald Trump accused him of sedition “punishable by DEATH,” Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona is showing little interest in backing down.

“For most of Donald Trump’s career, bullying people has worked out for him. But not now, because I won’t let it happen,” Kelly told reporters Monday.

The Pentagon launched its inquiry last week after Kelly appeared in a video with other Democratic lawmakers urging U.S. troops to defy “illegal orders.” Kelly, viewed as a potential 2028 presidential contender, has stayed in the spotlight since by directly challenging the president.

“President Trump has crossed the line, and this time it’s not going to work. I will not be intimidated by this president,” Kelly said.

Top military officer talks with congressional leaders

Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held the weekend call following reports that the military conducted a second strike in September on the survivors of an attack on an alleged drug boat.

Caine spoke with the four bipartisan lawmakers leading the Senate and House Armed Services Committees “to share perspectives on ongoing operations” and reiterate “his trust and confidence in the experienced commanders at every echelon,” Caine’s office said.

The committees have opened reviews following the report.

The call focused on “addressing the intent and legality of missions to disrupt illicit trafficking networks which threaten the security and stability of the Western Hemisphere,” the statement said.

Three of Schumer’s offices targeted with bomb threats

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said three of his New York offices received emailed bomb threats from an email address alleging the “2020 election was rigged.”

Schumer said in a statement that local law enforcement received bomb threats referencing his offices in Rochester, Binghamton and Long Island with the email subject line “MAGA.”

“Local and federal law enforcement responded immediately and are conducting full security sweeps,” Schumer said. “Everyone is safe, and I am grateful for their quick and professional response to ensure these offices remain safe and secure for all New Yorkers.”

Trump and France’s Macron hold call to discuss Ukraine

The French president spoke with Trump by phone after he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris on Monday.

Trump and Macron “discussed the conditions for a robust and lasting peace in Ukraine and the next steps in the mediation efforts undertaken by the United States,” according to a French government statement. “The President of the Republic notably underscored the central importance of the security guarantees required for Ukraine and our determination to work on them together with the United States.”

Ukraine’s president spoke optimistically Monday about the progress of revising the Trump administration’s peace plan, saying “it looks better” and the work will continue during talks on how to end Russia’s nearly four-year war.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials held talks in Florida about the U.S. proposal.

White House physician says Trump is in ‘excellent overall health’

Sean Barbabella said in a statement that Trump’s physical exam included “advanced imaging” that is “standard for an executive physical” in Trump’s age group.

Barbabella concluded that the cardiovascular and abdominal imaging was “perfectly normal.”

Trump to meet with his national security team to discuss strikes off of Venezuela

Leavitt said the meeting will take place Monday afternoon, and that strikes against suspected drug vessels off Venezuela — as well as other topics — will be discussed.

White House says second strike on suspected drug vessel followed armed conflict laws

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said a second strike was conducted against an alleged drug vessel off Venezuela on Sept. 2 “in self-defense and “in accordance” with laws governing armed conflict.

“The president has the right to take them out,” Leavitt said of alleged drug vessels, if they are “threatening the United States of America.”

Leavitt’s comments came after reports that defense officials gave a verbal order to leave no survivors after a first U.S. strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean on Sept. 2 left survivors.

White House say

s Biden ‘recklessly released’ nearly 100,000 Afghans into the U.S.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pre-Thanksgiving shooting of two National Guard members in Washington shows it is “more important than ever to finish carrying out the president’s mass deportation operation.”

She said the Trump administration is “ensuring the monster responsible for this atrocity” is held accountable, and reckoning with what made the attack possible — including scrutinizing past immigration decisions involving Afghans and other migrants.

Leavitt blamed what she called Biden’s “historic failure in Afghanistan” and said it “continues to haunt this country and our men and women in uniform.”

South Carolina to send 300 National Guard troops to Washington this month

The troops were already set to go to the nation’s capital before last week’s shooting that killed one National Guard member and wounded another from West Virginia, Gov. Henry McMaster said.

The Republican governor said there are no plans to increase the number of soldiers after President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard troops following last week’s shooting.

The governor noted South Carolina has also sent National Guard troops to the Mexican border and other places in the world.

“We’ll keep sending them, and they are willing to go and capable of going,” McMaster told reporters Monday.

The South Carolina troops will replace soldiers from Georgia. They were the replacements for the first round of South Carolina soldiers in Washington who returned home in September.

Melania Trump and Usha Vance write holiday cards for deployed service members

The wives of the president and vice president spoke briefly to the roughly 100 military spouses, American Red Cross volunteers and others gathered inside a hangar at Joint Base Andrews near the nation’s capital for the event.

The first lady praised the spouses for carrying “the weight of family life” while their husbands or wives are away from home serving the country.

Usha Vance, whose husband, Vice President JD Vance, is a former Marine, said the holiday season is a time to “lift up” those who serve.

After speaking, both women took up positions at tables to help stuff “comfort kits” as they were being filled with Rice Krispies treats, peanuts, granola bars and handwritten notes. They also joined others who were writing holiday cards for deployed service members.

The first lady wrote in one of her cards: “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! Thank you for your service. Our nation is proud of you!” and signed it, “With warm wishes, Melania Trump.”

Trump holds call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

“The two leaders stressed the importance and obligation of disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, and discussed expanding the peace agreements,” according to a statement from the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The call comes a day after Netanyahu asked his country’s president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, a move that would end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Trump has publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to President Isaac Herzog during his speech to Israel’s parliament during an October visit. Trump also recently sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Trump urges Israel to maintain dialogue with Syria amid growing tensions

The president in a social media posting said his administration is “very satisfied” with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s efforts to stabilize Syria as the Mideast nation nears the one-year anniversary of the ouster of Bashar al-Assad.

But Trump also underscored that it’s “very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State.”

Trump’s comments come as Israel moves to secure its northern borders. Israeli military forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people in the deadliest Israeli attack since its troops seized a swath of southern Syria a year ago.

A Border Patrol-led immigration crackdown is coming to greater New Orleans

Around 250 federal border agents are aiming to arrest 5,000 people after Monday’s expected launch of what they’re calling “Swamp Sweep,” a monthslong immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The deployment centered in liberal New Orleans is the latest to target a Democratic-run city as the Trump administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign. Many people in the greater New Orleans area have been on edge since the planned operations were reported this month. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

What to expect in Tennessee’s special congressional election

After a string of Democratic victories last month, the next test comes Tuesday in a special congressional election in Tennessee.

Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who led the Tennessee Department of General Services and has Trump’s endorsement. Behn is a progressive state representative who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

The GOP is looking to pad its narrow six-vote House advantage. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years, but it has more Democratic voters since Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 to include parts of Davidson County, which is home to Nashville.

Aiming for a 9-0 sweep, Republicans would split Indianapolis among 4 districts

Indiana House Republicans published a draft of a map on Monday morning with new boundaries designed to oust the state’s two Democratic U.S. House members.

The city of Indianapolis would be split among four congressional districts, a major change to the current map where the city makes up the entirety of the 7th District that reliably backs Democrats.

Indiana’s other current Democratic district is in the state’s northwest corner near Chicago. The new map would instead group a large portion of Republican counties in northern Indiana with the cities of East Chicago and Gary to make a new 1st Congressional District.

Indiana lawmakers have been under mounting pressure from the White House to redistrict like Republicans in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina have. To offset the GOP gains, Democrats in California and Virginia have moved to do the same.

Indiana legislators to convene state House session with redistricting top of mind

Indiana House members are expected to convene Monday to push for redrawing the state’s congressional districts in the Republicans’ favor, increasing pressure on their defiant counterparts in the GOP-led state Senate to meet Trump’s demands.

Republicans who control the House have said there’s no doubt redistricting will pass that chamber. The proposal’s fate remains uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans have resisted pressure to redistrict for months. Senators have now agreed to meet Dec. 8 and resolve the issue.

Republicans hold seven of Indiana’s existing nine U.S. House seats. Trump and other Republicans want a map that could enable a 9-0 GOP sweep and make it harder for Democrats to flip the Republican majority in Washington.

First lady Melania Trump reveals White House Christmas decorations

“Home is Where the Heart is” is the theme she chose for her family’s first Christmas back at the White House.

The decorations also nod to next year’s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the founding of the United States of America.

The gingerbread White House, an annual highlight dating to the Nixon administration, showcases the South Portico and provides a glimpse into the Yellow Oval room as decorated by the Trumps.

Former Trump lawyer Alina Habba is disqualified as New Jersey prosecutor

A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Trump administration’s maneuvers to keep the president’s former lawyer Alina Habba in place as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor were illegal and she is disqualified.

The panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes amid the administration’s push to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges questioned the government’s moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Habba said after the Oct. 20 hearing that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied Senate hearings.

Venezuelan leader Maduro and his allies resist US pressure

Venezuelan opposition leaders hoped U.S. military threats would weaken President Nicolás Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party’s leadership continues to hold, despite the buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast.

The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

Everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy

So what does it mean? The upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise. The bottom points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.

The term helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and unemployment has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth slows, making affordability much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households.

▶ Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy

Rubio calls US-Ukraine talks on Russia war productive

U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks Sunday aimed at finding an endgame to the war just days before a U.S. envoy is due in Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It’s not just about the terms that ends fighting,” Rubio said. “It’s about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. … I think we built on that today, but there’s more work to be done.”

US halts all asylum decisions after shooting of National Guard members

The move by Trump’s administration intensifies efforts to limit legal immigration.

The Republican administration is promising to pause entry to the United States from some poor nations and review Afghans and other legal migrants already in the country.

Trump says he’ll release MRI scans

“If you want to have it released, I’ll release it,” the president said during an exchange with reporters as he traveled back to Washington from Florida.

He called the results of the October tests “perfect,” but said he could not recall which part of his body was scanned.

Since April 8, Mohan Karki, a Bhutanese Nepali refugee and resident of Blacklick, Ohio, has been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the bulk of his time spent in a Michigan jail under threat of deportation.

These months have been particularly tumultuous for Karki’s wife, Tika Basnet, who in June delayed giving birth to the couple’s daughter by two weeks in order to contend with developments in Karki’s case that then included his being shuffled from Butler County Jail outside of Cincinnati to Michigan’s St. Clair County Jail with plans for immediate deportation to Bhutan – a tiny Himalayan country in which he has never set foot. (Karki, who has not yet met or held his now 5-month-old daughter, was born in a refugee camp in Nepal.)

On June 10, a judge granted a stay against Karki’s removal, and in the months since multiple attorneys have waged a supportive battle on multiple legal fronts. Attorney Brian Hoffman has led the work to stay Karki’s deportation – a case that Hoffman said currently rests with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals – and attorney Diana Marin has focused her efforts on the habeas corpus case challenging Karki’s extended detention by the government, for which Karki was set to appear in federal court on Wednesday, Dec. 3. (Marin said the habeas case is based on the manner in which ICE revoked Karki’s order of supervision, as well the length of time he has been detained, both of which she described as violations of due process.)

“Then on Wednesday [Nov. 26], I received a message and I spoke to the attorney for the government in the habeas case, who said, ‘I want to file a motion to vacate the judge’s order for Mohan to appear in person [on Dec. 3] because his deportation is imminent,’” said Marin, who joined Hoffman, Aisa Villarosa of the Asian Law Caucus, and Robin Gurung, co-executive director of Asian Refugees United, for a late November interview. “And when I called him to ask what this was about, he said, ‘There’s a final order of removal in place, they have a travel document for Mohan, and they have scheduled a commercial flight for him to leave the country on December 2. And that’s how we learned of [the deportation], which obviously set other things in motion.”

With time limited by the pending Thanksgiving holiday, Hoffman filed an immediate emergency motion for a stay with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, while Villarosa and Gurung communicated these developments to Basnet, who was in the midst of preparations to host the couple’s extended families for the holiday ahead of a planned trip to Michigan to be in court with Karki for his early December habeas hearing.

“It’s just so fatiguing [for Basnet], and it’s been marathon after marathon,” Villarosa said. “Even something so basic as, ‘Can my husband hold his baby?’ becomes a battle.”

Hoffman said the legal team only learned about the order of removal because the habeas case was in motion, describing instances with other refugee clients in which he received an email from the jail an hour or less ahead of a planned virtual visit informing him that the person he was scheduled to speak with was no longer being held at the facility. “And that’s how we learn that person has been removed,” he said. “And it’s chilling.”

With the information surrounding these new developments in hand, the team supporting Karki and Basnet began to engage on multiple fronts, with Hoffman filing for an emergency stay and Gurung martialing community members to begin contacting the ICE Field Office and politicians who might advocate on the family’s behalf. Others also petitioned ICE to follow its posted directives pertaining to parental rights, trying to ensure that if the worst-case scenario comes to pass and Karki is deported to Bhutan, that he’ll first be able to meet and hold his infant daughter – something he has been unable to do while held within St. Clair County Jail, which Villarosa said doesn’t allow in-person visitation, even for parents.

“In some ways, the immigrant community has even fewer rights than a criminal defendant who is incarcerated, even though they’re supposed to have more, because it’s a civil matter and not a criminal offense,” said Marin, who noted there might be a point at which Karki’s team is forced to shift from fighting his removal to helping the family prepare as best it can for his deportation. “I don’t know at what point the team will decide we need to pivot, but that would mean helping Mohan and his wife and family prepare for the inevitable. And most people don’t even get that opportunity. And they aren’t able to plan. … and get even the most basic things in order, like, do I have a cell phone that’s going to work in this new country? Do I have access to my bank accounts? Do I have access to my family, my relatives, my children?”

Karki’s case is further complicated by his standing as a stateless person, having been born 30 years ago in a refugee camp in Nepal, which denied him legal status. (Karki is one of more than 100,000 Bhutanese Nepalis whose families fled ethnic cleansing in Bhutan, the majority of whom eventually settled legally in the United States.)

“And immigration courts are not really set up to deal with the issue of statelessness,” Hoffman said. “The very first sentence denying our motion and dismissing our appeal said, ‘The respondent, a citizen and native of Nepal,’ which is not true. And over and over again that has been an issue in the litigation.”

The detainment and potential deportation of Karki have served as both a galvanizing point and cause for alarm within the U.S. Bhutanese Nepali community, said Gurung, who shared a video by the Asian Refugees United storytelling group in which artist Nawal Rai tells of how Karki was detained by ICE after appearing for a routine check-in. “The community is in a state of shock and fear and confusion,” he said. “We came to this country through the formal refugee resettlement program, and there was a perception that they were not going to come after us. So, when our community members all of a sudden started to disappear, we were not prepared. And now our work has had to shift toward virtual and in-person rights training, so people are aware of how to respond and how to protect their family members.”

Members of the Bhutanese Nepali community have long existed in legal limbo, having previously been made stateless by the Bhutanese government, which began to strip them of their citizenship rights in the 1980s. In May,the Guardian reported on two dozen Bhutanese Nepali refugees who had been deported to Bhutan a month prior by ICE, at least four of whom were rejected by Bhutanese authorities and expelled to India, where several are now believed to be missing. In July, Basnet expressed the fears she felt in knowing her husband could similarly be deported to a country “where he might be tortured, imprisoned, persecuted, or even killed.”

“And those conditions have not changed,” said Villarosa, who noted that upon landing in Bhutan, Karki would be immediately expelled from the country, with Nepal existing as one potential destination. “At this point, Nepal has said, ‘You can stay here, kind of.

Even if Karki were to make it safely to Nepal, Marin said that his lack of legal documentation (as a stateless individual, Karki doesn’t have a passport or a birth certificate) would severely restrict his ability to work or travel. “So, everything that has been documented about what happens to Bhutanese Nepali refugees when they are deported,” the attorney said, “that’s exactly what awaits him.”

The unknowable situation attorneys and advocates anticipate for Karki upon his arrival in Bhutan continues to drive their work, which is partially rooted in an understanding that if the young father is forced to board a commercial flight for a country that will immediately expel him, the prospects of him ever reuniting with his wife and infant daughter dim significantly.",https://d30oozggxy9369.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/01091551/signal-2025-06-30-130443-1536x1183-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 15:58:17.495363

Mike Turner, R-Ohio noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations.

The House and Senate Armed Services Committees have opened investigations supported by lawmakers from both parties into U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. They cited a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for surviving crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack.

The lawmakers said that if true, the allegations first reported by The Washington Post last week pose serious legal concerns. “This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.

Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information on what happened. “Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said.

President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump is also weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.

The Latest:

White House says Biden ‘recklessly released’ nearly 100,000 Afghans into the U.S.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pre-Thanksgiving shooting of two National Guard members in Washington shows it is “more important than ever to finish carrying out the president’s mass deportation operation.”

She said the Trump administration is “ensuring the monster responsible for this atrocity” is held accountable, and reckoning with what made the attack possible — including scrutinizing past immigration decisions involving Afghans and other migrants.

Leavitt blamed what she called Biden’s “historic failure in Afghanistan” and said it “continues to haunt this country and our men and women in uniform.”

South Carolina to send 300 National Guard troops to Washington this month

The troops were already set to go to the nation’s capital before last week’s shooting that killed one National Guard member and wounded another from West Virginia, Gov. Henry McMaster said.

The Republican governor said there are no plans to increase the number of soldiers after President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard troops following last week’s shooting.

The governor noted South Carolina has also sent National Guard troops to the Mexican border and other places in the world.

“We’ll keep sending them, and they are willing to go and capable of going,” McMaster told reporters Monday.

The South Carolina troops will replace soldiers from Georgia. They were the replacements for the first round of South Carolina soldiers in Washington who returned home in September.

Melania Trump and Usha Vance write holiday cards for deployed service members

The wives of the president and vice president spoke briefly to the roughly 100 military spouses, American Red Cross volunteers and others gathered inside a hangar at Joint Base Andrews near the nation’s capital for the event.

The first lady praised the spouses for carrying “the weight of family life” while their husbands or wives are away from home serving the country.

Usha Vance, whose husband, Vice President JD Vance, is a former Marine, said the holiday season is a time to “lift up” those who serve.

After speaking, both women took up positions at tables to help stuff “comfort kits” as they were being filled with Rice Krispies treats, peanuts, granola bars and handwritten notes. They also joined others who were writing holiday cards for deployed service members.

The first lady wrote in one of her cards: “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! Thank you for your service. Our nation is proud of you!” and signed it, “With warm wishes, Melania Trump.”

Trump holds call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

“The two leaders stressed the importance and obligation of disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, and discussed expanding the peace agreements,” according to a statement from the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The call comes a day after Netanyahu asked his country’s president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, a move that would end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Trump has publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to President Isaac Herzog during his speech to Israel’s parliament during an October visit. Trump also recently sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Trump urges Israel to maintain dialogue with Syria amid growing tensions

The president in a social media posting said his administration is “very satisfied” with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s efforts to stabilize Syria as the Mideast nation nears the one-year anniversary of the ouster of Bashar al-Assad.

But Trump also underscored that it’s “very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State.”

Trump’s comments come as Israel moves to secure its northern borders. Israeli military forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people in the deadliest Israeli attack since its troops seized a swath of southern Syria a year ago.

A Border Patrol-led immigration crackdown is coming to greater New Orleans

Around 250 federal border agents are aiming to arrest 5,000 people after Monday’s expected launch of what they’re calling “Swamp Sweep,” a monthslong immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The deployment centered in liberal New Orleans is the latest to target a Democratic-run city as the Trump administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign. Many people in the greater New Orleans area have been on edge since the planned operations were reported this month. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

What to expect in Tennessee’s special congressional election

After a string of Democratic victories last month, the next test comes Tuesday in a special congressional election in Tennessee.

Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who led the Tennessee Department of General Services and has Trump’s endorsement. Behn is a progressive state representative who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

The GOP is looking to pad its narrow six-vote House advantage. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years, but it has more Democratic voters since Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 to include parts of Davidson County, which is home to Nashville.

Aiming for a 9-0 sweep, Republicans would split Indianapolis among 4 districts

Indiana House Republicans published a draft of a map on Monday morning with new boundaries designed to oust the state’s two Democratic U.S. House members.

The city of Indianapolis would be split among four congressional districts, a major change to the current map where the city makes up the entirety of the 7th District that reliably backs Democrats.

Indiana’s other current Democratic district is in the state’s northwest corner near Chicago. The new map would instead group a large portion of Republican counties in northern Indiana with the cities of East Chicago and Gary to make a new 1st Congressional District.

Indiana lawmakers have been under mounting pressure from the White House to redistrict like Republicans in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina have. To offset the GOP gains, Democrats in California and Virginia have moved to do the same.

Indiana legislators to convene state House session with redistricting top of mind

Indiana House members are expected to convene Monday to push for redrawing the state’s congressional districts in the Republicans’ favor, increasing pressure on their defiant counterparts in the GOP-led state Senate to meet Trump’s demands.

Republicans who control the House have said there’s no doubt redistricting will pass that chamber. The proposal’s fate remains uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans have resisted pressure to redistrict for months. Senators have now agreed to meet Dec. 8 and resolve the issue.

Republicans hold seven of Indiana’s existing nine U.S. House seats. Trump and other Republicans want a map that could enable a 9-0 GOP sweep and make it harder for Democrats to flip the Republican majority in Washington.

First lady Melania Trump reveals White House Christmas decorations

“Home is Where the Heart is” is the theme she chose for her family’s first Christmas back at the White House.

The decorations also nod to next year’s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the founding of the United States of America.

The gingerbread White House, an annual highlight dating to the Nixon administration, showcases the South Portico and provides a glimpse into the Yellow Oval room as decorated by the Trumps.

The Yellow Oval is a sitting room in the president’s private living quarters on the second floor of the White House.

Former Trump lawyer Alina Habba is disqualified as New Jersey prosecutor

A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Trump administration’s maneuvers to keep the president’s former lawyer Alina Habba in place as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor were illegal and she is disqualified.

The panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes amid the administration’s push to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges questioned the government’s moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Habba said after the Oct. 20 hearing that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied Senate hearings.

Venezuelan leader Maduro and his allies resist US pressure

Venezuelan opposition leaders hoped U.S. military threats would weaken President Nicolás Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party’s leadership continues to hold, despite the buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast.

The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

Everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy

So what does it mean? The upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise. The bottom points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.

The term helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and unemployment has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth slows, making affordability much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households.

▶ Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy

Rubio calls US-Ukraine talks on Russia war productive

U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks Sunday aimed at finding an endgame to the war just days before a U.S. envoy is due in Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It’s not just about the terms that ends fighting,” Rubio said. “It’s about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we built on that today, but there’s more work to be done.”

The government put an immediate pause on all asylum decisions, halted visas for individuals traveling from Afghanistan and said it would reexamine green card holders from 19 “high-risk countries of concern.”

The shooting also prompted President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security to float broader but less specific actions to restrict immigration and remove immigrants from the United States, including a stop to migration from “third-world countries,” the denaturalization of immigrants and a vision for “remigration.”

Trump administration officials announced the policy changes on social media after the Nov. 26 shooting. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, has been in critical condition with no updates as of Monday morning.

The shooter was among the 76,000 individuals from Afghanistan the Biden administration admitted in 2021 after the U.S withdrawal from the country, according to multiple media reports.

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, posted on Nov. 28 that all asylum decisions would be put on hold, with no time given for when those processes would resume.

“USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” Edlow said. “The safety of the American people always comes first.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a similar message on protecting Americans in his announcement Nov. 28 that he would halt visas for people seeking to travel into the country from Afghanistan.

“President Trump’s State Department has paused visa issuance for ALL individuals traveling on Afghan passports,” Rubio said. “The United States has no higher priority than protecting our nation and our people.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed the announcement asylum decisions would be put on hold, and announced DHS would engage in “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from all 19 high-risk countries of concern.”

“Under President Trump, we are putting the American people, our safety and national security FIRST,” Noem wrote Sunday on social media. “We are putting an end to idiotic policies that allowed millions of illegal aliens and hundreds of thousands of foreigners into our country unvetted.”

A DHS spokesperson confirmed on Monday that those countries are Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Republic of Congo, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Yemen.

Those are the same countries listed in a travel ban Trump issued in a presidential proclamation in June. A DHS memo dated Nov. 27 points to that proclamation and states the administration “will consider relevant country-specific facts and circumstances” when determining “discretionary benefit requests” from individuals from these countries.

These benefits, the memo states, include “certain adjustment of status applications, extension of nonimmigrant stay, and change of nonimmigrant status.”

Trump, speaking with reporters Sunday on Air Force One, said he would make sweeping changes such as a permanent pause on migration from all “third-world countries” and an effort to “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.”

Trump said he would “absolutely” revoke the U.S. citizenship of certain immigrants if he had the authority to make the call.

“We have criminals that came into our country, and they were naturalized,” Trump said. “If I have the power to do it — I’m not sure that I do, but if I do — I would denaturalize. Absolutely.”

And Trump posted on social media Thursday he would “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.”

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump posted.

The DHS social media account on Friday posted about “remigration,” something it had also posted about in October along with a link to a mobile app the Trump administration has repurposed as a way for migrants to voluntarily self-deport.

The term has been used in connection with far-right groups in Europe as a concept for deporting the influx of non-white immigrants, some critics have pointed out.

Press Club v. Kristi Noem at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Drawing on nearly four decades of PHR research about the potential health harms of crowd-control weapons, PHR medical and legal experts reviewed court declarations and news reports on Trump administration immigration agents’ excessive and reckless force against peaceful demonstrators as well as journalists, medics, and bystanders at the L.A. protests. PHR finds that the court record and reporting indicate that federal agents used crowd-control weapons in a manner inconsistent with international standards such as the United Nations Guidance on Less-Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement.

“Crowd control weapons like rubber bullets, pepper balls, and tear gas may be labeled ‘less lethal,’ but medical research shows they can cause serious injury or even death. The risk of grave harms is even greater when law enforcement misuses these weapons as the court record indicates was the case in Los Angeles this summer,” said Michele Heisler, MD, MPA, medical director at PHR and professor of internal medicine and public health at University of Michigan.

“The court record shows that federal law enforcement in Los Angeles targeted the heads and faces of journalists and protestors with rubber bullets. They fired even at the backs of journalists and protestors,” said Dr. Heisler. “Federal agents also deployed vast quantities of tear gas and shot pepper balls and tear gas cannisters into groups of protestors when there was no evidence agents were being threatened. Officials fired dangerous disorientation devices like flashbangs into large crowds. The examples that the court highlighted show how federal law enforcement repeatedly misused crowd control weapons in a manner that risked serious injury to non-violent protestors, journalists, and bystanders.”

PHR’s analysis draws on a wide range of medico-legal documentation of the health and human rights harms of crowd-control weapons around the world. This includes Lethal in Disguise, a seminal report that offers the best available evidence of the deaths and severe injuries caused by kinetic impact projectiles (such as rubber bullets), chemical irritants (such as tear gas), and other crowd-control weapons in the United States and around the world.

PHR’s amicus brief highlights some of the severe injuries documented in the court record and news accounts as resulting from federal agents’ misuse of crowd-control weapons. For example, Ryanne Mena, a journalist who was covering protests in Paramount, was hit just an inch above her right ear with what is believed to have been a rubber bullet, resulting in a concussion. Alexander Nadolishny, a 55-year-old engineer attending the protests in Camarillo, was hit in the ear with a pepper ball as he was running away from the protest. Agents fired tear gas on a group of protestors in Paramount, including the 52-year-old Diya Cruz, which triggered an asthma attack for Cruz.

Following the summer 2025 protests in Los Angeles, a coalition of journalists, legal observers, protestors, and journalist associations sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Their complaint alleged that in June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched an operation to arrest immigrants in and around Los Angeles, “setting new sky-high targets for daily immigration arrests and expanding the scope of its operations far beyond immigrants with criminal histories.” Plaintiffs alleged that DHS responded to protests over these immigration raids with excessive force by using tear gas, pepper balls, chemical spray, and rubber bullets.

The court granted the preliminary injunction on September 10, finding that federal agents’ use of force has been and would continue to be disruptive to both peaceful protest and media coverage.

In its new amicus brief, PHR urges the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to uphold the district court’s granting of the preliminary injunction in order to prevent the further dangerous and harmful misuse of crowd control weapons that has been visited upon protestors and journalists in Los Angeles.

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration.
Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.
“A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.
But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website.","Gutting of key US watchdog could pave way for grave immigration abuses, experts warn

This article features Government Accountability Project and was originally published here.

The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

A group of fired watchdogs has filed a whistleblower complaint to Congress through the Government Accountability Project (GAP), and a coalition of human rights organizations sued the administration, demanding the employees be reinstated. There is deepening concern that a system of oversight that was already weak is now hanging by a thread, even as criticism surges over treatment of detainees in the ballooning immigration jail network.

“They want to be able to abuse people with impunity,” said Anthony Enriquez, vice-president of US advocacy and litigation at the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights advocacy group based in Washington, which is representing the group suing the government.

He added: “They want to be able to operate a system that doesn’t have any rules and that can be used to maximize brutality against people, in order to accomplish a mass deportation agenda.”

The DHS has repeatedly, through assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin, insisted when asked about reports and complaints of abuses that there are “no sub-prime” conditions in immigration custody in the US.

But Dana Gold, a senior director of the GAP, which is working with those behind the whistleblower complaint, echoed Enriquez’s warning.

Without a robust oversight system “there’s just a blank check for impunity”, she said.

The second Trump administration early on fired hundreds of officials in federal oversight offices, typically known as watchdogs.

This included at the DHS. The main watchdog team there overseeing civil rights, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) – one of three DHS oversight offices – has been cut from a staff of 150 to just nine. This despite there being about 550 investigations that were active and alleging serious civil rights violations by DHS officials and contractors, including inside immigration detention centers.

Cases that were active when Trump returned to office include civil rights officials then in post investigating allegations of civil and human rights abuses, according to CRCL documents that were previously public, original complaint records submitted to the CRCL and the whistleblower disclosure, reviewed by the Guardian. Among the cases, were the following allegations:

Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a CRCL document confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.

Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL document. This included an investigation into a 2024 incident during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original complaint, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.

In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL complaint submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.

Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower complaint.

This last one, into Khalil, who was arrested by ICE agents for his pro-Palestinian activism, was one of the final investigations launched before the mass firing of civil rights watchdog officials in March.

The status of these investigations, and hundreds more, is unknown. Enquiries by the Guardian to the DHS last week about the above specific cases and the many others previously understood to be active elicited no response.

However, in response to requests for comment by the Guardian, also submitted to DHS last week, McLaughlin issued a statement, saying: “These claims are ridiculous. All of legally required functions of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) continue to be performed, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the department’s mission of securing the homeland.”

It went on to say: “As it existed in the past, the CRCL obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS’s mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.

“CRCL and OIDO, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, regularly inspect detention facilities, document conditions in accord with facility standards, investigate detainee complaints, and issue recommendations to ICE and CBP [Customs and Border Protection] when appropriate.”

An investigation by the Guardian based on interviews with five recently dismissed DHS civil rights officials, hundreds of pages of documents, and interviews with immigration attorneys, has found that the already limited oversight practiced within the DHS prior to January 2025 now appears almost nonexistent.

Of the nine people now working at the CRCL, one is its acting officer, installed in May, Troup Hemenway, a former adviser to the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint for conservative government.

Congress originally tasked the three offices, including CRCL, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) and the Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS), with oversight at DHS. The watchdog bodies process complaints, initiate investigations and provide guidance to DHS agencies in various areas of interest.

Now, those operations have seemingly been halted, or at least significantly slowed.

In recent months, the former DHS officials who have filed the whistleblower complaint have watched as the Trump administration has targeted political adversaries, expelled immigrants to a foreign prison, allowed officials to arrest immigrants at court appearances, encouraged officers to wear face coverings during arrests and targeted people who have lived in the US for years and have no criminal record.

Few know much about what is happening behind closed doors inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers and at secretive holding facilities.

Former DHS employees the Guardian spoke with, who were dismissed from their positions at CRCL, spoke with the Guardian on condition of anonymity to discuss matters more freely and avoid retaliation.

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration. “That’s why they fired us all. They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants. Even when we were there, they didn’t want to hear what we had to say – they didn’t want to let us do our jobs.”

One morning in late March, top DHS officials emailed employees at the three oversight offices, ordering them to stop working. Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.

A coalition of immigrant rights organizations sued the administration in Washington, declaring the cuts illegal and demanding all oversight employees be reinstated. According to a declaration filed by a top DHS official, , [sic.] nearly every single employee from the offices was fired, including 147 employees at the CRCL, 118 at the OIDO and 46 at CIS.

The Trump administration wants “no oversight into what they are doing,” said Enriquez from RFK Human Rights.

Following the lawsuit, the DHS walked back its claims that the offices were being abolished. Instead they told the federal judge they reduced the number of staff in order to “refocus” the offices and “create more efficient processes.” The internal oversight work was continuing, the DHS said, arguing the lawsuit should be tossed.

Throughout litigation, the administration has put out various staffing figures, most recently that only nine people total, including Hemenway, now worked at CRCL. Five of them are “contract” investigators, meaning that as of August, there were only two full-time CRCL investigators. Fifteen additional contractors are also reportedly at CRCL, according to the DHS court declaration, exclusively focusing on internal Equal Employment Opportunity cases for DHS employees.

“When there was a fully-staffed, robust CRCL, there were regular inspections of ICE facilities. There were contracted experts who went on those on-site oversight visits to the facilities, who provided detailed recommendations and corrective action that had to be taken when conditions were poor or when staff was mistreating the detained individuals,” the former official explained in a telephone interview with the Guardian.

“By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.”

But now, “ I don’t think they’re happening – it certainly doesn’t seem CRCL has the staff to be doing those inspections”, the former official added.

Gold, at the GAP, said of the whistleblowers she is working with: “The idea that getting rid of basically every employee with institutional knowledge and replacing them with just a few – in the wake of daily multiple examples of the kinds of things that CRCL would have dealt with – is just deeply disturbing to them.”

Oversight at the DHS “is a guardrail that has been deliberately decimated to make sure that sand is not put in the gears of executive branch priorities”, Gold added.

Many CRCL investigations focused on complaints inside ICE detention centers, including allegations of medical neglect, sexual abuse and deaths in custody, the whistleblower complaint said. Now, the Trump administration is further expanding its immigration detention network.

“ I don’t think they care about the conditions of these facilities. I think they’re just trying to round up as many people as they can and get rid of them without any due process and without any regard for conditions,” said the former official, who worked on CRCL investigations into allegations of abuse at several facilities.

A third former official, speaking to the Guardian, warned of dangers for immigrants targeted by ICE.

“If there isn’t oversight that keeps pace, the potential for real danger is great,” that former official said, adding: “You are left to ICE policing itself.”

In 2023, the CRCL’s compliance branch received 3,104 complaints and investigated 25% of them, according to a report to congress.

“I don’t know if they’re actually reading and investigating those complaints or doing anything with the complaints,” said the former CRCL official quoted first in this report.

Sophia Genovese, an immigration attorney and faculty member at Georgetown University Law Center, has submitted over 100 complaints to CRCL.

“Nine people can’t cover a detention center, much less an entire country – especially with so many new detention centers popping up left and right,” she said. “It’s laughable that they think that they can do anything with so few staff.”

As the Trump administration ramps up its enforcement operations, Genovese is seeing an increase of cases of ICE threatening physical violence on immigrants, pressuring them to self-deport – an allegation CRCL would have likely investigated.

“I’m getting referrals every day from people who have family members who are picked up, detained and are being coerced into signing deportation orders,” said Genovese.

Immigrant advocates for years were already frustrated with CRCL’s limited powers. Typically after an investigation, CRCL officials make recommendations to DHS agencies to improve their civil rights practices but can rarely mandate changes.

“Structurally speaking, the way congress set up the agency, there were some real weaknesses,” said Enriquez from RFK. But he argues that any oversight, no matter how limited, is significantly better than no oversight. “A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.

That appears highly unlikely in the current climate.

Gold said of CRCL: “Even with its weaknesses at some level, it did investigations, it could mitigate problems and it provided a really important oversight function – also in terms of just getting information to Congress to do [additional] oversight. And without that, there’s just a blank check for impunity.”

CRCL always used to publish memos about completed investigations and those they were initiating, which, Genovese said, journalists and attorneys found valuable in helping reveal conditions inside ICE detention centers and other problems within the DHS.

But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website. (The Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog, later published the majority of the CRCL public records after they were scrubbed by the DHS).

“It’s a real breakdown in the rule of law. It’s really concerning,” said one former CRCL official. “It’s very upsetting.”

The main avenue of resort now is public protest and legal action, Genovese said.

“We’re seeing really incredible acts of bravery by members of the public,” she said. “That’s been helpful at preventing detention in some ways, but also educating the public about the horrors of detention.”",https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shutterstock_71874889-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:57:31.730771

Immigrant-rights group Siembra NC says ICE plans to deploy roughly 50 agents this week.

Know and assert rights: remain silent, request a lawyer, refuse consented searches.

Prepare documents and emergency plans; learn about local legal aid and support groups.

Just weeks after large-scale Border Patrol operations rattled communities in Charlotte and Raleigh, immigrant-rights advocates say another wave of federal agents is headed for the Triangle.

Immigrant-rights group Siembra NC says it learned that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to deploy 50 agents to the Triangle region this week, The News & Observer previously reported.

The news comes after Border Patrol agents were deployed to Charlotte during “Operation Charlotte’s Web” and to the Triangle last month, where hundreds of people were detained.

Here’s what you need to know.

What to do if law enforcement asks about your immigration status

According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), if law enforcement asks about your immigration status, you should stay calm and keep your hands visible. Don’t run, argue or resist, and never lie or show false documents.

It’s also important to know your rights:

You have the right to stay silent and don’t have to discuss your immigration status.

If asked by immigration agents, show your papers only if you have them.

You can refuse a search, since agents need your consent or probable cause.

If you’re over 18, carry your papers. If you don’t have them, say you want to remain silent or speak to a lawyer.

If you get pulled over, you must show your license, registration and proof of insurance, but you don’t have to discuss your immigration status.

What to do if ICE agents show up at your home

If immigration agents show up at your home, the ACLU says you should:

Ask if they’re immigration agents and what they’re there for.

Request to see their badge or ID through a window or peephole.

Ask if they have a judge-signed warrant and have them show it under the door or against the window.

Don’t open the door unless they show a judicial warrant with your name or address. Say: “I don’t consent to your entry.”

If they force entry, don’t resist. Say you’re exercising your right to remain silent and want to speak to a lawyer.

Don’t lie, show false documents, or sign anything before talking to a lawyer.

If you’re on probation with a search condition, officers may legally enter your home.

What to do if you are arrested or detained by ICE

If you are detained by ICE or Border Patrol, you can hire a lawyer, but one won’t be provided, according to the ACLU. However, you can ask for a list of free or low-cost options.

You also have the right to call family or a lawyer, meet with your lawyer in detention and have them with you at immigration hearings.

What to do if a loved one is arrested or detained

If a loved one is arrested or detained by ICE, you can try looking for them on the ICE Detainee Locator page, according to Carolina Migrant Network.

You also have the right to call family or a lawyer, meet with your lawyer in detention and have them with you at immigration hearings.

To search, you need:

The detained person’s Alien Registration Number (A-Number).

Their first and last name.

Country of origin.

Date of birth.

If your loved one is not listed in the system, you can try calling nearby detention centers. You can find a list of nearby detention centers at ice.gov/detention-facilities.

How to prepare for ICE ahead of time

Here are some ways you can prepare ahead of time if ICE arrives in the Triangle, according to the Legal Aid Justice Center:

Keep emergency contact numbers for family handy.

Make a plan for who can take care of children, pets, or property if someone is detained. You should also keep this document handy and never share it with law enforcement.

You can also try reaching out to local support groups that provide free services, such as legal clinics and rapid response help.

But a new lawsuit filed in Washington, D.C., suggests what happened to Nemer — and why — has the potential to scramble the federal workforce and upend foundational civil rights laws.

Nemer alleges that despite top performance reviews, she was dismissed from her job because of her gender, her status as a dual citizen of Lebanon and the fact that she once ran for municipal office in Ohio as a Democrat. Those reasons, she says, are all in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the First Amendment.

The government has responded by arguing that the president's power to oversee the executive branch under Article II of the U.S. Constitution essentially overrides that core civil rights law, Nemer's attorney said.

""This is a case in which the President of the United States has asserted a constitutional right to discriminate against federal employees,"" wrote her lawyer, Nathaniel Zelinsky, of the Washington Litigation Group. ""If the government prevails in transforming the law, it will eviscerate the professional, non-partisan civil service as we know it.""

The administration abruptly fired Nemer in early February, summoning her from the bench and escorting her out of a federal building in Cleveland. Both her supervisor and the chief immigration judge there told her they didn't know why she was being dismissed in the middle of her probationary period, the lawsuit said.

Federal workers on probationary status have fewer rights to contest their firing than other civil servants do, but they are still covered by constitutional protections barring retaliation for their political speech; and by civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex and national origin.

Nemer filed a formal discrimination complaint with an Equal Employment Opportunity office a month after she was fired. That office dismissed her claims in September, asserting in its decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act conflicts with the president's power to remove federal workers within the executive branch.

The implications sweep far beyond a single immigration judge, the new lawsuit said.

""According to the final agency decision, the President may now fire female federal workers like Ms. Nemer — because of their sex — and the law would have nothing to say about it,"" according to the new lawsuit. ""According to the final agency decision, the President can now fire federal workers born to immigrant parents with dual citizenship like Ms. Nemer — because of their national origin — and they would have no recourse. And under the same logic, the President can fire federal workers like Ms. Nemer — because of their political activities and affiliations — and the courts would be powerless to act.""

Nemer is seeking reinstatement, back pay and an order erasing her termination.

She said she never got official notice about any reasons for her dismissal.

But her lawsuit pointed out that in the administrative process, a senior Justice Department immigration official mentioned driving offenses from the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well as two local tax cases Nemer had disclosed as part of a background check to become an immigration judge — issues her lawsuit casts as a ""pretext.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x1688+0+129/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2f%2F74%2Fb933eb01451e8cbc71100fd48452%2Fgettyimages-53002540-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:57:43.052356

But a new lawsuit filed in Washington, D.C., suggests what happened to Nemer—and why—has the potential to scramble the federal workforce and upend foundational civil rights laws.
Those reasons, she says, are all in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the First Amendment.
The government has responded by arguing the president's power to oversee the executive branch under Article II of the U.S. Constitution essentially overrides that core civil rights law, Nemer's attorney said.

But a new lawsuit filed in Washington, D.C., suggests what happened to Nemer—and why—has the potential to scramble the federal workforce and upend foundational civil rights laws.

Nemer alleges that despite top performance reviews, she was dismissed from her job because of her gender, her status as a dual citizen of Lebanon, and the fact that she once ran for municipal office in Ohio as a Democrat. Those reasons, she says, are all in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the First Amendment.

The government has responded by arguing the president's power to oversee the executive branch under Article II of the U.S. Constitution essentially overrides that core civil rights law, Nemer's attorney said.

""This is a case in which the President of the United States has asserted a constitutional right to discriminate against federal employees,"" wrote her lawyer, Nathaniel Zelinsky, of the Washington Litigation Group. ""If the government prevails in transforming the law, it will eviscerate the professional, non-partisan civil service as we know it.""

The administration abruptly fired Nemer in early February, summoning her from the bench and escorting her out of a federal building in Cleveland. Both her supervisor and the chief immigration judge there told her they didn't know why she was being dismissed in the middle of her probationary period, the lawsuit said.

Federal workers on probationary status have fewer rights to contest their firing than other civil servants do, but they are still covered by constitutional protections barring retaliation for their political speech; and by civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and national origin.

Nemer filed a formal discrimination complaint with an Equal Employment Opportunity office a month after she was fired. That office dismissed her claims in September, asserting in its decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act conflicts with the president's power to remove federal workers within the executive branch.

The implications sweep far beyond a single immigration judge, the new lawsuit said.

""According to the final agency decision, the President may now fire female federal workers like Ms. Nemer—because of their sex—and the law would have nothing to say about it,"" according to the new lawsuit. ""According to the final agency decision, the President can now fire federal workers born to immigrant parents with dual citizenship like Ms. Nemer—because of their national origin—and they would have no recourse. And under the same logic, the President can fire federal workers like Ms. Nemer—because of their political activities and affiliations—and the courts would be powerless to act.""

Nemer is seeking reinstatement, backpay and an order erasing her termination.

She said she never got official notice about any reasons for her dismissal.

But her lawsuit pointed out that in the administrative process, a senior Justice Department immigration official mentioned driving offenses from the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as two local tax cases Nemer had disclosed as part of a background check to become an immigration judge—issues her lawsuit casts as a ""pretext.""

Trump holds call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

“The two leaders stressed the importance and obligation of disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, and discussed expanding the peace agreements,” according to a statement from the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The call comes a day after Netanyahu asked his country’s president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, a move that would end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Trump has publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to President Isaac Herzog during his speech to Israel’s parliament during an October visit. Trump also recently sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Trump urges Israel to maintain dialogue with Syria amid growing tensions

The president in a social media posting said his administration is “very satisfied” with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s efforts to stabilize Syria as the Mideast nation nears the one-year anniversary of the ouster of Bashar al-Assad.

But Trump also underscored that it’s “very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State.”

Trump’s comments come as Israel moves to secure its northern borders. Israeli military forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people in the deadliest Israeli attack since its troops seized a swath of southern Syria a year ago.

A Border Patrol-led immigration crackdown is coming to greater New Orleans

Around 250 federal border agents are aiming to arrest 5,000 people after Monday’s expected launch of what they’re calling “Swamp Sweep,” a monthslong immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The deployment centered in liberal New Orleans is the latest to target a Democratic-run city as the Trump administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign. Many people in the greater New Orleans area have been on edge since the planned operations were reported this month. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

What to expect in Tennessee’s special congressional election

After a string of Democratic victories last month, the next test comes Tuesday in a special congressional election in Tennessee.

Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who led the Tennessee Department of General Services and has Trump’s endorsement. Behn is a progressive state representative who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

The GOP is looking to pad its narrow six-vote House advantage. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years, but it has more Democratic voters since Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 to include parts of Davidson County, which is home to Nashville.

Aiming for a 9-0 sweep, Republicans would split Indianapolis among 4 districts

Indiana House Republicans published a draft of a map on Monday morning with new boundaries designed to oust the state’s two Democratic U.S. House members.

The city of Indianapolis would be split among four congressional districts, a major change to the current map where the city makes up the entirety of the 7th District that reliably backs Democrats.

Indiana’s other current Democratic district is in the state’s northwest corner near Chicago. The new map would instead group a large portion of Republican counties in northern Indiana with the cities of East Chicago and Gary to make a new 1st Congressional District.

Indiana lawmakers have been under mounting pressure from the White House to redistrict like Republicans in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina have. To offset the GOP gains, Democrats in California and Virginia have moved to do the same.

Indiana legislators to convene state House session with redistricting top of mind

Indiana House members are expected to convene Monday to push for redrawing the state’s congressional districts in the Republicans’ favor, increasing pressure on their defiant counterparts in the GOP-led state Senate to meet Trump’s demands.

Republicans who control the House have said there’s no doubt redistricting will pass that chamber. The proposal’s fate remains uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans have resisted pressure to redistrict for months. Senators have now agreed to meet Dec. 8 and resolve the issue.

Republicans hold seven of Indiana’s existing nine U.S. House seats. Trump and other Republicans want a map that could enable a 9-0 GOP sweep and make it harder for Democrats to flip the Republican majority in Washington.

Former Trump lawyer Alina Habba is disqualified as New Jersey prosecutor

A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Trump administration’s maneuvers to keep the president’s former lawyer Alina Habba in place as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor were illegal and she is disqualified.

The panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes amid the administration’s push to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges questioned the government’s moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Habba said after the Oct. 20 hearing that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied Senate hearings.

Venezuelan leader Maduro and his allies resist US pressure

Venezuelan opposition leaders hoped U.S. military threats would weaken President Nicolás Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party’s leadership continues to hold, despite the buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast.

The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

Everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy

So what does it mean? The upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise. The bottom points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.

The term helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and unemployment has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth slows, making affordability much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households.

The Republican administration is promising to pause entry to the United States from some poor nations and review Afghans and other legal migrants already in the country.

For good measure, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, also appointed Ms. Habba a “special attorney” with jurisdiction over New Jersey.","A federal appeals court said on Monday that Alina Habba had been serving unlawfully as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, dealing a blow to the Trump administration and most likely setting up a showdown at the Supreme Court.

Ms. Habba is one of a number of U.S. attorneys whom the Trump administration has sought to keep in power through a series of unusual maneuvers even though she was neither confirmed by the Senate nor appointed by district trial court judges — the two traditional pathways. Defendants in New Jersey had challenged her authority as U.S. attorney, leading to Monday’s decision.

In its ruling, the three-judge panel, based in Philadelphia, affirmed an earlier ruling by a Federal District Court judge. The court said that the government’s tactics had violated the law as written and concluded that, overall, the Trump administration appeared to have become frustrated by legal and political barriers to placing its favored U.S. attorneys in charge.

It was not immediately clear how the ruling would affect legal proceedings in the New Jersey federal courts or whether Ms. Habba will continue to lead the office in the near future. The courts had already been operating in a kind of limbo, given her uncertain status. Certain types of criminal cases were slowed, and some grand jury proceedings were halted.

The Justice Department and a spokeswoman for Ms. Habba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The lawyers who challenged Ms. Habba’s authority, Abbe D. Lowell, Gerald Krovatin and Norm Eisen, said in a statement that the ruling showed that “President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions.”

They vowed to continue their challenges to “President Trump’s unlawful appointments of purported U.S. attorneys.”

The case involving Ms. Habba may be the first of its kind to reach the Supreme Court, though it is possible that a similar case involving the U.S. attorney in Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, could be expedited by virtue of being entangled with criminal cases against President Trump’s enemies.

Last week, a federal judge found that Ms. Halligan, too, had been unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. The Justice Department has vowed to appeal.

Ms. Habba, 41, had represented Mr. Trump in several civil cases and played a public role in his 2024 presidential campaign. But she had no experience in criminal law before the president named her in March to a 120-day interim term as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor. Mr. Trump nominated her to take on the role permanently, but her appointment was doomed by opposition from the state’s two Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim.

In July, judges in the District of New Jersey declined to extend Ms. Habba’s term and instead tapped a veteran prosecutor, Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office. That led Attorney General Pam Bondi to disparage the judges, fire Ms. Grace and elevate Ms. Habba to the role of acting U.S. attorney through a complicated series of maneuvers that were at the heart of the appeal.

But on Monday, the three judges — L. Felipe Restrepo, D. Brooks Smith and D. Michael Fisher — said that each of those maneuvers had violated the complex set of laws that governs vacancies at the top of federal agencies.

When Ms. Grace was fired, the Trump administration designated Ms. Habba to fill her role as first assistant — the highest-ranking position in the office given that there was no U.S. attorney — and argued that doing so meant that Ms. Habba was effectively acting U.S. attorney.

For good measure, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, also appointed Ms. Habba a “special attorney” with jurisdiction over New Jersey.

But the judges wrote that the automatic elevation of the first assistant occurred only at the actual time of the vacancy, and that neither the president nor anyone else could jury-rig that process. As for the special attorney appointment, they said, it was “plainly prohibited” by law.

The Monday decision affirms a ruling by Matthew W. Brann, the chief judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, who concluded in August that Ms. Habba had been serving as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney without legal authority since July 1.

Lawyers with the Department of Justice, which had appealed Judge Brann’s decision to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, had argued that the president’s power was broad and gave the executive branch “substantial authority to decide who is executing the criminal laws of the United States.”

Lawyers for Cesar Humberto Pina, a defendant indicted in New Jersey on fraud charges on July 10, had countered that Ms. Habba’s installation as the state’s top prosecutor violated a law known as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

The lawyers, Mr. Lowell and Mr. Krovatin, said in court papers that Mr. Trump had “pursued a shell game to keep her in power.”

“Relying on a chimera of at least seven different statutes, the government has, at various times, described Ms. Habba as ‘interim U.S. attorney,’ ‘acting U.S. attorney,’ ‘first assistant U.S. attorney’ and ‘special attorney,’” they wrote. “But she does not have the authority to lead the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of New Jersey under any of those titles.”

Monday’s ruling was the second time in a week that a federal appeals court panel has dealt a heavy blow to Mr. Trump and Ms. Habba.

On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals based in Atlanta upheld nearly $1 million in penalties meted out by a lower court judge against the president and Ms. Habba for filing “frivolous” lawsuits against more than two dozen of his enemies, including Hillary Clinton, James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and the Democratic National Committee.

A doorbell video of law enforcement and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents visiting a home in Burlington Township on Nov. 8 has gone viral on social media.

The seven-minute video, posted to Facebook by U.S. Rep. Herb Conaway, D-New Jersey, shows masked officers speaking with the homeowner through the Ring doorbell. The homeowner's identity was redacted for their privacy and safety, a representative of Conaway's office said.

According to the congressman, the officers were on private property and ""harassing"" the homeowner without a warrant.

In a statement provided to this publication, Conaway said the video was ""another instance of ICE and federal agents acting lawlessly toward American citizens.""

""I am appalled by what is happening, and I will continue to work with my colleagues in D.C. to do everything we can to hold those responsible accountable,"" he added.

The post has received more than 52,000 reactions and nearly 19,000 comments.

Immigration concerns, and scrutiny over ICE operations, have been a rising topic of conversation over the last year in South Jersey and across the U.S., spurred by new ICE policies, talks of building a potential detainee center in Burlington County and arrests of community leaders pending immigration hearings.

According to the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Statistics dashboard, there were 1,649 arrests out of the Newark and Philadelphia offices during the 2025 fiscal year.

The video, which was sent to Conaway's office by a constituent, showed at least four masked officers identifying themselves as federal agents on the homeowner's lawn and front porch area.

When told that the homeowner was out of town, one agent questioned the cars parked outside. When asked why they were wearing masks, an agent said, ""It's cold out here, ma'am.""

The agents continued to knock on the homeowner's door, questioning her through the camera about the individual they were looking for, whose name was redacted for privacy.

The agents continued to knock on the door and peer through windows after the homeowner told them that nobody was home and that they were out of town for a death in the family.

""For people in the community who are concerned, or who have neighbors worried that this could potentially happen to them, I encourage you all to learn your rights if you encounter such a situation,"" Conaway said.

One of the arrests was captured and posted to Facebook last week by Cathie LeBlanc, who had stopped for gas at Holderness on her way to work Tuesday morning.

“It was totally out of the blue,” she said. “I don't have any rapid response training or anything like that. It's not something I've really thought I would need to do. Honestly, it's shocking that it happened up here in rural New Hampshire.”

Other reports of ICE detentions in the area are still unconfirmed, which troubles Grace Garvey, an organizer with the group Central New Hampshire Indivisible.

“We're all grappling with the same kind of circumstances of misinformation and lack of understanding and lack of information,” she said.

The identity of the man in the video has not been made public, nor have the charges or reasons why he was detained by what appear to be ICE officers. ICE did not respond to NHPR’s request for confirmation of the social media reports, but the Plymouth Police Department confirmed that they were notified that ICE was in town on Tuesday morning.

The Plymouth police said they were not involved in the detention.

Ken Wolf of Thornton said he’s concerned by the lack of information about the ICE actions in his community. He wore a headlamp and stood outside the Common with his wife, Barbara, Sunday evening.

“My major concern is the people who are being taken off the streets who have committed no crimes to our knowledge, and only are detained because of the color of their skin,” he said. “And we find that abhorrent in this country today.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a0c9844/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4643x2438+0+329/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F31%2Fad%2F289b73894277850dd7dc5b57fb54%2F11-30-25-plymouth-protest.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 15:58:21.897129

Multidistrict litigation now makes up well over half of all federal civil cases, with lawsuits that address product liability and other topics consolidated before one judge to avoid them being filed in different courts and resulting in potentially different pretrial rulings. The new rule, 16.1 under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is meant to give judges and parties a framework to get those cases off the ground, while still giving them the chance to modify them as needed for each case.

Those opening steps include an initial management conference to figure out pretrial proceedings. The rule also says parties should provide a report ahead of that conference to lay out their views on whether leadership counsel should be appointed in the case, and if so, what their roles should be.

Parties should also tell the court their initial views on discovery in the litigation, how parties will share information about the factual bases behind their arguments, and the main factual and legal issues that are likely to come up, the rule says.

Some lawyers told Bloomberg Law they had concerns about earlier drafts of the rule, saying too much rigidity would hurt the MDL process by forcing courts to follow steps that don’t fit all cases. The Judicial Conference’s Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure unanimously approved a version that its authors said was meant to be adaptable.

“Not all MDL proceedings present the management challenges this rule addresses, and, thus, it is important to maintain flexibility in managing MDL proceedings,” reads the committee note attached to the rule, which gives additional guidance to judges interpreting it.

The judiciary’s policymaking body—the Judicial Conference—and later the Supreme Court approved the rule. It was among a slate of rule changes sent to Congress, which permitted the measures to go into effect.

A draft of the rule was presented for public comment in 2023, but got pushback from plaintiffs’ attorneys over a provision that said judges could appoint “coordinating counsel” to deal with logistics in the case. Drafters dropped the language after that testimony.

Some plaintiffs’ lawyers also testified that they thought too many topics were included in the list of items that could be addressed at the initial hearing. The advisory committee drafting the rule said it’s not meant to serve as a mandatory agenda that requires a view on each listed issue.

Class action lawyers also told Bloomberg Law the rule seemed focused more on mass tort MDLs rather than their cases, which commonly involve data breaches, privacy, and antitrust issues.

The rule has its supporters. Implementing initial steps in the cases gives a pathway for finding and dismissing claims that don’t belong in the litigation, said Alex Dahl, general counsel for the advocacy group Lawyers for Civil Justice, which has pushed for the new MDL rule.

“This rule should strongly discourage the filing of meritless claims and give courts and parties an effective mechanism for identifying and dismissing them at the early stages of a new MDL,” Dahl said in a statement.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/eb1ce7e/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2F4b%2F52a782f344e585a6f94e286ac0f4%2Fgettyimages-634444702.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:30.721654

On today’s Playbook Podcast: Jack and Dasha talk missile strikes, peace talks … and the finest Christmas decorations in D.C.

Good Monday morning, and welcome to December. This is Jack Blanchard, excitedly peeling back the corner of the political advent calendar to see what the month has in store. Get in touch.

Spoiler: We’ve got peace talks in Ukraine and possible war moves in Venezuela, an angry row over interest rates next week and an angry row over ACA credits the week after. We’ve got a glitzy FIFA World Cup draw complete with foreign guests, major Supreme Court action and at least one more immigration clampdown to squeeze in before the year is out.

In today’s Playbook …

— Pete Hegseth under pressure over “illegal” boat strike order.

— GOP rallies in Tennessee ahead of showdown election.

— New Orleans next in line for the Greg Bovino roadshow.

DRIVING THE DAY

HAPPY MONDAY: It’s only 6 a.m. on Monday morning, and it’s already a difficult week to be Pete Hegseth. The Defense secretary is now facing multiple inquiries into a lethal attack he ordered on a Venezuelan ship in September, following reporting in the Washington Post that a second deadly missile strike was ordered by U.S. forces specifically to kill off two shipwrecked survivors.

Questions, questions: President Donald Trump last night told reporters he will “find out” what happened in the Sept. 2 attack, adding a presidential line of inquiry to the two congressional oversight investigations launched at the end of last week. Venezuela’s national assembly last night also set up a special commission to investigate the attack, per Reuters.

Recap: You’ve presumably already read WaPo’s original story from last Friday, but in case not, here’s the link. Hegseth is reported to have issued a verbal order to “kill everybody” to U.S. commanders who were monitoring an alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean. WaPo reports they took him at his word — and struck the ship with a second deadly missile, after two survivors of the first attack were spotted clinging to the wreckage.

Right of reply: Hegseth has dismissed the story as “fabricated,” and was last night merrily posting AI-generated images making light of Caribbean missile strikes that have now killed close to 100 people.

But this story looks like it has legs. Here’s why:

First: Congress is taking these allegations extremely seriously. Democrats like Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) are using the phrase “war crime.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for full, unedited video of the attack to be released. Republicans including Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said the reported actions, if true, would be illegal. Most significantly, the Senate Armed Services Committee announced it will be “conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts.” The House Armed Services Committee will do the same.

Second: Trump sounded intriguingly lukewarm last night when asked about the story on Air Force One. The president’s typical reaction to this type of reporting is either to aggressively dismiss it as “fake news” or a “Democrat hoax,” or to lean in and embrace the supposed offense as a positive. (An example: When it was put to Trump his immigration enforcers were going too far in Chicago, he shot back: “I think they haven’t gone far enough.”)

But Trump didn’t say any of that last night. “I don’t know anything about it,” the president told reporters on Air Force One when asked about the story, thus carefully distancing himself from his government’s actions. “[Hegseth] said he did not say that, and I believe him, 100 percent.”

So would Trump have supported a second strike? “We’ll look into it,” Trump said. “But no, I wouldn’t have wanted that. Not a second strike. Uh, the first strike was very lethal, it was fine. And if there were two people around …” He trailed off. “But Pete said that didn’t happen.”

Pressed again if there had been a second strike, Trump said: “I don’t know. I’ve gotta find out about it. But, uh, Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.”

So in short: More than two days after WaPo broke the story, the president can offer no assurances about what actually happened, says he would not have supported a second strike on the ship and will now be figuring out what happened himself. It’s hardly a ringing endorsement of the Pentagon leadership.

But Hegseth is typically unruffled. On Friday he dismissed the story as “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory,” before leaning into the approach taken by U.S. forces. “As we’ve said from the beginning … these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes,’” Hegseth wrote on X. “Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.”

More noise: Hegseth’s Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell has since said the “entire narrative” was “false.” White House comms director Steven Cheung added yesterday: “The Washington Compost provided NO FACTS and NO SUBSTANTIATION. They literally just printed what some unnamed random person said and reported it as fact.”

The important context here is that plenty of Republicans and supporters were already deeply unnerved by U.S. activity in the Caribbean — both the legality of the boat strikes, and the risk America is about to be sucked into a broader conflict. Trump made the case for military action again last night, claiming each destroyed boat would have cost “25,000 American lives” due to the quantities of illegal drugs on board. The president is well aware that getting tough with drug traffickers plays well with both Hill Republicans and core MAGA voters.

But there’s a problem here too: At the weekend Trump just happened to pardon a convicted drug trafficker in Juan Orlando Hernández, a former Honduran leader who a U.S. jury found to be facilitating mass shipments of cocaine into America. (The NYT has a great piece on the jaw-dropping nature of Trump’s decision.) Even in an age of truly bonkers use of the pardon power, this is causing huge consternation to Hill Republicans who have been out there trying to defend Trump’s Caribbean policy to a skeptical public.

Heard this one before: Trump last night blamed Hernández’ conviction on Joe Biden, and said a pardon was the correct decision. Let’s see how many GOP senators agree when they start returning back to the Hill later today.

All of which means: This is definitely a good day for the Pentagon to welcome some less independent-minded media types in for a chat. The new-look Pentagon press corps — the fringe, largely conservative outlets who were willing to sign up to Hegseth’s subservient reporting rules, in exchange for access — have their first on-site briefings starting today. “Press secretary Kingsley Wilson is scheduled to conduct a briefing for the new media crew, which is then set to have a meet-and-greet and press gaggle” with Hegseth, WaPo reports.

MEANWHILE IN MOSCOW: Venezuela is hardly the only overseas issue dominating the president’s time this week. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner head to Moscow today ahead of their expected summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow, with all Ukraine holding its breath. Witkoff is expected to take with him the latest contours of a Kyiv-approved peace plan to elicit a response from Putin.

Latest from the Ukraine side: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris today. Three of Zelenskyy’s top officials met with Witkoff, Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Miami yesterday. The WSJ reports the meeting was hailed as “productive” and “included talks on possible elections, land swaps and security guarantees.”

TRAIL MIX

FEELING SPECIAL: It’s the final day of campaigning before the special election in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, and Republicans are sprinting to ensure that what should be an easy victory does not turn into another disaster. Trump will hold a tele-rally this evening with Speaker Mike Johnson to bolster Republican Matt Van Epps, as Axios reported last week. Before that, Johnson will rally with Van Epps in Franklin at 9 a.m. Eastern and in Clarksville at 6 p.m., where RNC Chair Joe Gruters will join. The national intervention follows multiple Trump Truth Social posts over the weekend urging Tennesseans to pick Van Epps over Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn, who he claimed “openly disdains Country music” — a reference to resurfaced comments Behn made in 2020 — among other things.

The stakes: In this Trump +22 district, which stretches from Nashville’s Music Row through wealthy suburbs to rural areas, Van Epps is still the favorite, despite some polling showing a tight race, USA Today’s Joey Garrison and Zac Anderson preview. Though the predictive ability of special elections can be limited, a slim Van Epps win — let alone a Behn shocker, which would narrow the GOP’s House majority — would make Democrats feel good about the midterms. But Republicans have lately projected optimism that they’ve sufficiently galvanized national attention to turn out the base. They’re highlighting Behn’s progressive activism and social media comments, while she focuses intently on affordability, as CNN has reported.

Also happening tomorrow: Jersey City, New Jersey, heads to a mayoral runoff that pits former Gov. Jim McGreevey against Councilmember James Solomon, POLITICO’s Matt Friedman and Ry Rivard preview. Both are Democrats, and the race is nonpartisan. But the election offers voters another high-profile clash between younger progressives and older establishment figures, in a city once synonymous with the Garden State’s political machine — and in the shadow of Zohran Mamdani’s NYC.

RED-LIGHT REDISTRICT: Indiana state Sen. Jean Leising, one of the holdouts who has helped prevent Republicans from pushing through a new congressional gerrymander, was targeted by a pipe bomb threat at her home this weekend, she announced. Leising blamed the “D.C. political pundits” pushing mid-decade redistricting and said she “will not cave.”

PRIMARY COLORS: Even as Democrats increasingly feel upbeat about the midterms, they’re also staring down a number of high-profile, hard-fought House primaries in both safe seats and swing seats that could rend the party ideologically and generationally. POLITICO’s Nick Wu and colleagues run down the contests to watch, from California to Maine. Republicans by comparison foresee smoother sailing in the primaries.

IMMIGRATION FILES

THE CRACKDOWN CONTINUES: Trump’s series of targeted immigration enforcement operations turns to its next big city today as “Swamp Sweep” kicks off in and around New Orleans, AP’s Jack Brook and colleagues preview. Some 250 border agents will begin a push — led by Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, just as in LA, Chicago and Charlotte — that intends to secure 5,000 arrests in Louisiana and Mississippi. Similarly aggressive tactics are expected. Most unauthorized immigrants in Louisiana are Honduran.

Preparations underway: Like in those other places that have seen the Border Patrol sweep in, immigrant communities around New Orleans are hunkering down, planning to stay home or get out of the area. Taqueria Guerrero, a prominent Mexican restaurant, is closing temporarily out of concern for staff and customers, Nola.com’s Ian McNulty reports.

The national impact: Other cities are still sorting through the effects of Border Patrol bursts that rounded up thousands of people. Though DHS has emphasized the arrests of “the worst” violent criminals, WaPo’s Arelis Hernández and colleagues report that just a fraction of the more than 4,000 arrested in Chicago have been publicly identified as having serious criminal records. Meanwhile, people who oppose the mass deportation campaign around the country have trained in rapid-response tactics to monitor immigration agents, NBC’s Nicole Acevedo reports. Many Japanese Americans whose families recall internment camps are especially motivated and involved in and around the LA area, NYT’s Jill Cowan reports.

D.C. SHOOTING FALLOUT: At the same time, the Trump administration is growing more determined to limit immigration after an Afghan refugee was charged with shooting two National Guard troops in D.C, killing one. Trump said yesterday that he’s invited the parents of both the late Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe to the White House at some point to honor their children, per the AP. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said this weekend that Wolfe is still “fighting for his life.” AG Pam Bondi said on Fox News that she’ll meet with his family.

Knowing Rahmanullah Lakanwal: The suspected shooter worked in secretive “Zero Units” in Afghanistan in coordination with the CIA, Afghan groups that had intense and dangerous combat assignments to go after the Taliban, NBC’s Dan De Luce and Rich Schapiro report. These were “among the most extensively vetted of any Afghans who worked with American forces.” Many have struggled with unresolved legal work status since coming to the U.S.

BEST OF THE REST

FIRST IN POLITICO — The ACA debate: As Congress returns today, the debate over expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies will take center stage — particularly as the cost of living and fears of premium spikes dominate the campaign trail. While some Republicans talk about an extension of the tax credits that makes changes, like further abortion restrictions, Planned Parenthood and Reproductive Freedom for All are warning Democrats not to fold on a clean extension. “Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Freedom for All will score any vote that adds additional abortion restrictions to the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” the organizations are announcing to members in a new letter today. Read it here

The big question: What about Trump? With just a few weeks left to figure out a solution, both parties on the Hill say a decision by the president — who has sent mixed signals so far — will be pivotal to determining what comes of this sprint, POLITICO’s Jordain Carney reports. A Senate vote on something will take place next week. It’s not clear what. Republicans have multiple competing proposals in the ether, from an extension with reforms to a comprehensive Obamacare overhaul. And Democrats aren’t unified on how much to budge either. More from POLITICO’s Inside Congress

Ailing America: In West Virginia, many ACA recipients are steeling themselves for a financial crisis if premiums explode — as in 150 percent increases or more — without the same subsidies, FT’s Guy Chazan reports from Charleston. The cliff looms just as some of the sweeping health care cuts in Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act start to hit. SNAP recipients who just got food stamps back after the shutdown-triggered lapse could start to lose them in March due to new work requirements, CNN’s Tami Luhby reports. And CNN’s Eva McKend has the story of Churchville, Virginia, where a health clinic cited the Medicaid cuts when it closed.

SCOTUS WATCH: The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments beginning at 10 a.m. in two cases, including a landmark internet piracy case that examines whether Cox Communications has to pay out $1 billion in damages to dozens of record labels for not stopping copyright infringement. It’s “a case both sides say could have huge consequences for both the industry and internet users,” USA Today’s Maureen Groppe previews.

WHAT LARRY ELLISON IS READING: “White House officials have raised antitrust concerns over Netflix’s bid for Warner Bros. Discovery: sources,” by the N.Y. Post’s Charles Gasparino: “Senior White House officials recently discussed antitrust concerns surrounding Netflix’s interest in acquiring the Warner Bros. studio and the HBO Max streaming service … Several White House officials also suggested during the sitdown that a broader investigation is necessary focusing on Netflix’s market power … The meeting comes as the Warner Bros. Discovery board has scheduled a Monday afternoon deadline to receive a second round of offers.”

FED UP: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at a Stanford University event at 8 p.m. Eastern, with nine days to go until the central bank’s fraught upcoming decision on interest rates. Trump told reporters yesterday that he’s already decided on his pick to succeed Powell, though he didn’t reveal the name yet, per Bloomberg.

SIGNS OF WITHDRAWAL: “Record-setting personnel issues are marring Trump’s second term,” by POLITICO’s Jordain Carney and colleagues: “Trump has withdrawn 57 nominations, according to Senate data … The pace of withdrawals, the highest since at least the Ronald Reagan presidency, has flown below the radar in the day-to-day churn.”

BEHIND THE DOCUMENT DUMP: “Robert Garcia leads Democrats’ strategy on Epstein probe, to GOP’s dismay,” by the LA Times’ Ana Ceballos: “Rep. Robert Garcia and his team faced a monumental task on Nov. 5: Sift through more than 20,000 documents obtained from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein … After six tedious days combing through the records, Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and four staff members identified three emails that would go on to ignite a political firestorm. In the emails, Epstein wrote that Trump had ‘spent hours’ at the late financier’s house with one of his victims and that he ‘knew about the girls.’”

Trump has denied any wrongdoing here, and there’s no evidence that he participated in Epstein’s trafficking operation.

TALK OF THE TOWN

OPEN THE DOORS — After months of closure while the East Wing was being demolished, White House tours will begin again tomorrow — just in time to see the new holiday decorations, which volunteers erected over the Thanksgiving long weekend. Journos are being invited in this morning for a sneak peak, but Fox News has already been given an early look.

The scoop they all wanted: Per Fox News, this year’s decorations include LEGO portraits of Donald Trump and George Washington, plus a gingerbread house made from “120 pounds of gingerbread dough, 100 pounds of pastillage dough, more than 10 pounds of chocolate, nearly 80 pounds of royal icing and five pounds of isomalt sugar.” Nobody tell RFK Jr.

BILL OF HEALTH — Trump told reporters he will release his October MRI, which the White House hasn’t yet provided details about. He said he had “no idea” what body part the MRI scan was focused on, but insisted it wasn’t his brain.

Lawyers say thousands could benefit from the order, but it’s expected to be appealed.

U.S. District Judge Sunshine S. Sykes on Tuesday expanded an order from last week granting detained immigrants with no criminal history the opportunity to request a bond hearing. Now, instead of only impacting a few named in the California lawsuit, the decision will apply to immigrants held in detention nationwide.

It’s part of an ongoing lawsuit challenging changes the Trump administration made over the summer when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was revisiting its authority to detain people and would make noncitizens ineligible for bond hearings before an immigration judge.

Prior to the policy change, most noncitizens with no criminal record who were arrested away from the border had an opportunity to request such a hearing and if bond was granted remain free while their cases wound through immigration court.

Sykes issued an order on Thursday that found the new policy unlawful.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, released a statement Wednesday that pointed to a September decision from the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals allowing the new policy.

She said the previous policy “dangerously unleashed millions of unvetted illegal aliens into American communities—and they used many loopholes to do so.”

Her statement did not say whether Sykes’ decision would be appealed and the department did not respond to questions on the matter.

Tuesday’s decision could impact thousands of immigrants but not all. Those with criminal convictions or who have an expedited removal order would still not be allowed a bond hearing.

Matt Adams, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said he has heard of immigration judges already advising some immigrants of their right to a bond hearing since Sykes’ orders were filed.

“These are people who’ve been living here in the United States, many for years, many for decades, who have U.S. citizen family members, who have no criminal history, who do not present any danger or threat of a flight risk, and yet they were being locked up without any possibility of being released during these lengthy proceedings,” Adams said.",https://nydailyrecord.com/files/2024/02/Depositphotos_643534474_L.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:36.378800

An immigration judge recently denied Ngựa asylum but granted him protection under the anti-torture convention.
In an order granting F.B.’s release last month, U.S. district court judge Tanya Walton Pratt in Indiana said the government’s claim that F.B.","R.V. had already spent six months detained at a facility in California when he won his case in immigration court in June.

He testified that he had fled his native Cuba in 2024 after protesting against the government, for which he was jailed, surveilled and persecuted. So, after being kidnapped in Mexico, he entered the U.S. illegally and told border agents he was afraid for his life.

An immigration court judge granted him protection against deportation to Cuba, and R.V., 21, was looking forward to reuniting with family in Florida.

But R.V., who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation from the government, hasn’t been released. At the detention center, he said, agents have told him they’ll still find a way to deport him — if not to Cuba, then maybe Panama or Costa Rica.

“The wait is so hard,” he said in an interview. “It’s as if they don’t want to accept that I won.”

R.V. is among what immigration attorneys describe as an escalating trend: some immigrants who win protection from deportation to their home countries are being detained indefinitely.

Often, the person has been held while the federal government appealed their win or sought another country willing to take them in.

The government has long had the ability to make such appeals or to seek another country where it could deport someone; the Department of Homeland Security generally has 90 days to find somewhere else to send them.

But, in practice, such third-country removals were rare, so the person was typically released and allowed to remain in the U.S.

That practice has changed under the Trump administration. Recent instructions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel favor keeping people detained. A June 24 memo, for instance, states that “field offices no longer have the option to discretionarily release aliens.”

At issue are cases involving immigrants who, rather than winning asylum, are granted one of two kinds of immigration relief, known as orders of “withholding of removal” and protection under the international Convention Against Torture. Both have higher burdens of proof than asylum but don’t provide a pathway to citizenship.

These forms of relief differ from asylum in a key way: while asylum protects against deportation anywhere, the others only protect against deportation to a country where the person risks harm or torture.

Jennifer Norris, an attorney at the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said the government’s actions now effectively render withholding of removal and protection under the anti-torture convention meaningless.

“We have entered a dangerous era,” Norris, said. “These are clients who did everything right. They won their cases before an immigration judge and now they’re treated like criminals and remain in detention even after an immigration judge rules in their favor.”

Laura Lunn, advocacy and litigation director with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network in Colorado, noted that rules against double jeopardy do not apply in these cases, so the government has the ability to appeal when it loses.

“Here, they have so much control over whether someone remains detained because, if they just file an appeal, that person can just sit in detention for at least six months or what could be years,” Lunn said.

Homeland Security did not respond to specific questions and declined to comment.

Lawyers representing immigrants in prolonged detention say the government is keeping people locked up in hopes of wearing down their clients so they abandon their fight to remain in the U.S.

Ngựa, a Vietnamese man who asked to be identified by his family nickname, meaning horse, has been detained in California since he crossed the southern border illegally in March.

Ngựa fled Vietnam last year after being tortured by police officers who tried to extort him for a “protection tax,” according to his asylum application. When he refused, the officers beat and jailed him, and threatened to kill him and his family.

An immigration judge recently denied Ngựa asylum but granted him protection under the anti-torture convention. His pro bono lawyers have appealed the asylum denial.

In an interview through an interpreter, he said he chose to seek safety in the U.S. because he believed that the government of any other country would deport him back to Vietnam. He said he didn’t anticipate that U.S. officials would try to get rid of him.

Ngựa said ICE officers told him they know they can’t send him back to Vietnam, but will find another country willing to take him in. Every morning, he said, an officer goes from dormitory to dormitory asking whether anyone wants to self-deport.

The thought of being sent away keeps him up at night, but the alternative is nearly just as bad: “I’m afraid that I will be detained here for years,” he said.

DHS regulations allow continued detention when “there is a significant likelihood of removing a detained alien in the reasonably foreseeable future.”

Such scenarios are increasingly possible since a Supreme Court ruling in June broadened the ability for immigration authorities to quickly deport people to countries where they have no personal connection.

After the ruling, ICE released guidance directing agents to generally give migrants slated for removal to a third country “at least 24 hours” notice, but as little as six hours in “exigent circumstances.”

The guidance also said the U.S. needs to receive credible diplomatic assurances that the deported people will not be persecuted or tortured.

This year, the Trump administration has brokered deals with several countries, including Ghana, El Salvador, and South Sudan — which is on the brink of civil war — to accept deportees.

“It has just become more of a regular practice for the government to hold onto people who win protection because they are actively looking, in most cases, for a third country to accept them,” said Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance.

Realmuto is one of the lead attorneys in the case challenging Homeland Security’s practice of third-country removals.

Federal law states that Homeland Security should first seek out alternative countries to which the person being deported has some personal connection, and then, if that’s “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible,” find a country whose government is willing to accept them.

Realmuto said the Trump administration is skipping straight to that last resort. As a result, she said, several people who were deported to a third country have been sent by officials there back to the country they originally fled.

Among them is Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a 58-year-old woman who fled Sierra Leone’s civil war 30 years ago and settled in Maryland until ICE agents detained her this summer during her annual check-in.

NBC News reported that because a judge had banned ICE from sending her back to Sierra Leone, where she had been tortured, the agency deported her to Ghana. But Ghanaian officials forcibly put her on a bus to Sierra Leone.

In fiscal year 2024, 2,506 people were granted withholding of removal or protection under the anti-torture convention, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Realmuto said that, like Kuyateh, tens of thousands of immigrants have been granted withholding or deferral relief over the course of several decades. Such people could now be at risk of being detained again while the government works to remove them to another country, she said.

The case of F.B., a 27-year-old Colombian woman who entered the U.S. at the San Ysidro port of entry in 2024, further illustrates the government’s approach toward the anti-torture convention. F.B. asked to be identified by her initials out of fear of retaliation by the U.S. government.

In February, F.B. won protection under the anti-torture convention. But instead of releasing her, Homeland Security said it was attempting to remove her to Honduras, Guatemala or Brazil.

In September, lawyers for F.B. filed a petition in federal court for her release.

“It’s kind of hard to argue somebody’s removal is imminent when they’ve been detained for eight months,” said her attorney, Kristen Coffey.

Court records show the judge initially denied the petition after ICE officials claimed they had booked a flight for her to Bolivia that would leave three days later.

But a month after that, she was still in U.S. custody.

In an order granting F.B.’s release last month, U.S. district court judge Tanya Walton Pratt in Indiana said the government’s claim that F.B. would be imminently deported had “proven false,” and that keeping her detained was “contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States.”

Can they win a battle with Trump?,"Melissa Gomez, www.latimes.com, melissa-gomez",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-01/la-county-supervisors-ordinance-banning-masked-ice-agents-trump,"On Tuesday, L.A. County supervisors Janice Hahn and Lindsey P. Horvath will introduce the ordinance for a vote.
The ordinance would also require law enforcement officers, including local, state and federal, to wear identification and make clear their agency affiliation.
The masks and lack of identification have sowed fears the armed men could be people posing as law enforcement officers.
“This is how an authoritarian’s secret police operate — not legitimate law enforcement in a democracy,” she said.
“Sanctuary politicians attempting to ban our federal law enforcement from wearing masks is despicable and a flagrant attempt to endanger our officers,” she said in a statement.","Los Angeles County supervisors plan to vote soon on an ordinance that would prohibit law enforcement, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, from wearing masks or disguising their identities while conducting operations in unincorporated L.A. County, probably setting up a legal battle with the Trump administration.

On Tuesday, L.A. County supervisors Janice Hahn and Lindsey P. Horvath will introduce the ordinance for a vote. The ordinance would also require law enforcement officers, including local, state and federal, to wear identification and make clear their agency affiliation.

Since immigration agents began raiding Los Angeles neighborhoods and worksites in June, many local leaders have pushed for action on the issue. Residents are concerned about the masked agents, often disguised with face coverings and masks. The masks and lack of identification have sowed fears the armed men could be people posing as law enforcement officers. Residents have called on sheriff’s deputies and police for help, only to be told that local agencies do not interfere with federal operations.

If the ordinance is approved, it will — per county policy — go again before supervisors for a second vote, scheduled for Dec. 9. It would then go into effect 30 days later. But legal experts have cast doubt that federal agents would be required to follow the ordinance, and federal officials have already issued a legal challenge to similar state-level legislation.

L.A. County counsel Dawyn R. Harrison told the supervisors the ordinance “would most likely be challenged on the supremacy clause,” which holds that federal law supersedes state and local law.

Hahn has acknowledged that the federal government will probably take action against the ordinance. Still, she said in a statement, she never thought she would see the day when a “masked, anonymous federal police force” would target people based on their skin color and spoken language and force people into unmarked vans at gunpoint.

Just last week, her office said, nine people were picked up by masked ICE agents at worksites across Long Beach. According to the Long Beach Post, ICE agents chased a gardener into a restaurant in front of Long Beach police officers. Hahn said that the ordinance is driven by repeated instances of L.A. County residents encountering plainclothes or masked agents who refuse to identify themselves or show ID.

“This is how an authoritarian’s secret police operate — not legitimate law enforcement in a democracy,” she said. “This is about our residents’ constitutional rights — and this ordinance is designed to protect them. So, if this means a fight with the federal government in the courts, I think it is a fight worth having.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has defended the tactic of agents wearing masks in order to protect their identities and keep them safe amid reported increased violence against federal officers. Previously, she stated that officers do verbally identify themselves, wear vests identifying their agency and use vehicles that include the name of the department, although agents are also often seen detaining people while wearing street clothing, without visible badges and driving unmarked cars.

McLaughlin said the administration will not abide by any attempt to ban masks.

“Sanctuary politicians attempting to ban our federal law enforcement from wearing masks is despicable and a flagrant attempt to endanger our officers,” she said in a statement.

Hahn, when asked if the board is considering alternatives if the ordinance fails to stand legal muster, said supervisors would “cross that bridge if we come to it.”

Since the immigration raids began on June 6 in Los Angeles through Aug. 26, the Department of Homeland Security has arrested at least 5,000 undocumented people in the county, the board’s Tuesday motion states, a number that has only gone up with the raids continuing. The motion states the ordinance would make exceptions for law enforcement officers wearing face coverings during undercover operations, as part of SWAT duties or for protection reasons.

“In an unprecedented moment when Los Angeles County’s immigrant communities are under attack, it is essential that the Board implement policies that cement its support for immigrants’ rights, and the rights of all people who may interact with law enforcement,” Hahn wrote in a motion for the ordinance. “It is reasonable to expect all officers — local, state, and federal — to comply with an ordinance that simply requires them to clearly show the public that they actually are law enforcement officers who are acting within the course of their duties.”

The California Legislature passed a similar bill that would require agents to identify themselves and prohibit on-duty officers from covering their faces.

After Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill, the federal government sued to stop it from taking effect.

Atty Gen. Pam Bondi made it clear the government would challenge any and all similar legislation, which she said is unconstitutional.

“California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents,” Bondi said in a statement. “These laws cannot stand.”

During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals.
The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns.","A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia's immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group haspreviously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government’s failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

Madeline Gleeson, Senior Research Fellow, Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW Sydney, said: ‘After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.’

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre,said: ‘Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people’s liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.’

Fr. Brett O’Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said: ‘JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group’s visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.’

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said: ‘Australia’s mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government’s obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.’

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said: ‘This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia’s immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.’

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said: ‘Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.’

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said: ‘Australia's system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people - some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people

The audits come amid wider federal pressure on California’s trucking sector:

FMCSA revoked 17,000 non-domiciled CDLs issued to foreign nationals earlier this month after finding the state failed to verify legal residency. Another 44,000 remain under review.

A reinstated English-language proficiency requirement for CDL holders has already pulled 7,248 drivers off the road since June.

ICE workplace enforcement actions in California rose sharply in 2025, with 77 Northern California trucking firms hit in the first half of the year alone.

Industry sources say many smaller Punjabi carriers still operate with 1099 independent contractors, a model that keeps costs competitive but leaves them exposed to both AB5 labor claims and now federal immigration audits.

Scale of the Punjabi Trucking Community in California

California is home to an estimated 50,000–74,000 Punjabi/Sikh truck drivers and owner-operators – roughly 40% of the state’s total long-haul driver pool.

Nationwide, the Punjabi/Sikh trucking community is estimated at 150,000–200,000 drivers and owners, controlling up to 20% of U.S. trucking companies despite representing only about 4–5% of the overall driver workforce.

The North American Punjabi Trucking Association (NAPTA) lists more than 1,400 member companies operating over 9,000 trucks, though this represents only a fraction of the total community.

There has been tremendous solidarity and outrage from the community over the construction of the 36,000 square foot facility in Milwaukee, according to Neumann-Ortiz.
Neumann-Ortiz said that by calling the ICE facility a processing center, it whitewashes and scales down the abuses that often occur in these facilities.
“It is about building a larger facility for processing,” Neumann-Ortiz said.","Construction of a new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility began on the north side of Milwaukee, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.

Community members, including organizations such as VOCES de la Frontera and Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, protested outside the new building Nov. 15, according to Wisconsin Examiner. There has been concern about the lack of transparency and communication with local leaders by ICE, according to VOCES de la Frontera executive director Christine Neumann-Ortiz.

“The position of the federal government has been that the local government doesn’t really have a voice in whether to move forward with this,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “In the current context, we’re witnessing an ICE and Customs and Border Patrol that has been profiling people, physically assaulting them for no reason and violating people’s due process in a myriad of ways.”

Neumann-Ortiz said the Trump administration’s “campaign of terror” is unwanted by communities as it is based on white supremacist ideas and is a misuse of tax dollars. She said the federal government is spending billions of dollars on this, while people go hungry and cannot access affordable housing and healthcare.

“It’s been called the deadliest year in terms of ICE custody because they’re going after everybody, [including] seniors and people in our community who have health conditions,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “The conditions in which they’re [ICE] holding people are not good, and they’ve been notoriously not good, and we’ve seen an increase in death because of lack of medical care and suicide.”

Neumann-Ortiz said organizations and community members need to make sure this facility expansion does not take place through nonviolent activity and lobbying. VOCES de la Frontera is seeking policies that actually make the community better and support good immigration reform at the federal and state level, Neumann-Ortiz said.

Milwaukee is home to the largest population of immigrants in Wisconsin, and many are a part of mixed-status households, according to UW professor in the School for Workers Armando Ibarra. The expansion of this facility is perpetuating uncertainty for immigrants and individuals who come from immigrant households, Ibarra said.

“This idea that there was a facility that was going to be expanded in Milwaukee was announced in January of 2025, and even back then, there were elected officials and some organizations that were speaking up against this,” Ibarra said. “ICE used a federal exemption to avoid the city approval process, and they modified this building into this processing slash detaining center.”

There are many individuals on campus in precarious situations because the Trump administration has designated certain immigration statuses as less stable than in the past, according to Ibarra.

Ibarra said that there is increased uncertainty for international students, international professors on H-1B visas and individuals under DACA. Immigrants and individuals from mixed-status families are also at a heightened risk and experiencing a lot of fear, according to Ibarra.

Ibarra said many people are pushing back against what is happening with ICE expansion nationwide, namely in cities such as Chicago, Charlotte and Los Angeles. Some people who were not politically active in the past are now participating in these movements, according to Ibarra.

“They’re [protesters] protecting their neighbors, they’re protecting the community, they’re protecting their loved ones or [they have] just a sense of patriotism that is inclusive of their neighbors, loved ones and people that are positive members of their communities,” Ibarra said.

VOCES de la Frontera considers the Keeping Families Together and State Driver’s License bills as important areas of advocacy in Wisconsin, according to Neumann-Ortiz. Both of these are important pieces of legislation for holding ICE accountable, she said.

Neumann-Ortiz said that by calling the ICE facility a processing center, it whitewashes and scales down the abuses that often occur in these facilities. She said these facilities are essentially jail since they do not allow freedom of movement, and often lead to people being moved to other facilities and then deported.

“It is about building a larger facility for processing,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “It could mean we’re going to move you to another detention facility in another state, which is happening right now, where people are not able to access their attorneys or connect with family.”",https://badgerherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMGL4385-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:22.097085

Michael Vastine is a faculty member of the Stetson University College of Law and also serves as an Academic Advisory Board Member for the Acacia Center for Justice. A nationally recognized expert, leading litigator, and academic in the fields of immigration law and immigrant defense, he has also held numerous elected and appointed leadership at the national level of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and the AILA South Florida Chapter, including a term as Chair. Professor Vastine has litigated extensively before the U.S. Courts of Appeals, in cases arising from his clinical practice and primarily construing the “categorical approach” for determining the immigration consequences of crimes, including foundational cases on questions of mens rea elements, definitions of controlled substances, trafficking, firearms, and crimes involving moral turpitude. He also argued the Florida Supreme Court case establishing the post-Padilla v. Kentucky standard for effective criminal defense of immigrants. He has separately authored numerous amicus curiae briefs for AILA and other organizations in litigation of similar issues at the Courts of Appeals and, occasionally, before the U.S. Supreme Court, in addition to work challenging the constitutionality of the prolonged detention of immigrants.

This blog post is a crosspost with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, you can find their version of the post.

Following a recent court order, the U.S. government has resumed fully funding the “National Qualified Representative Program” (NQRP), a formal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Justice (DOJ) program which provides legal counsel to “certain detained immigrants deemed incompetent to represent themselves by an immigration judge.” Since 2013, the NQRP has improved due process for detained people with debilitating mental health conditions and has also, as a consequence, help to make the immigration courts run more efficiently. Despite these efficiencies, the program became one of the many ironic casualties of DOGE government cuts. A federal judge found the cessation of counsel to be “arbitrary and capricious,” further noting that the executive branch had conceded the point. With NQRP funding restored for only the next year, it is critical to understand the purpose and impact of the program, so it can be recognized and protected. This moment of reprieve also underscores the need for a more secure foundation for the program. At present, the program is only protected by court order and is reliant, entirely, on the opinions of the judiciary of the California District Courts to keep it alive. For the sake of its long-term sustainability, NQRP should also be written into legislation, enacted by state or federal-level Congressional representatives.

Fifteen years ago, for the first time, a judge ordered the federal government to provide representation for two detained immigrants in their removal cases before the immigration court. This step was unprecedented, because while immigrants have a right to be represented, unlike in the criminal court system, they don’t have a right to be provided an attorney at government expense. The two immigrants at issue presented such profound mental health conditions that it was impossible for them to represent themselves. I agreed to co-represent pro bono one of the two, a homeless refugee client whom the judge noted to present “very active and pronounced psychotic disorder, schizophrenia of the paranoid type ... frequent auditory hallucinations .... [and] psychosis … that prevented him from expressing himself”, a condition so serious that he had years earlier been voluntarily committed to a treatment facility. In this test case, we lost our client’s case for bond, with the immigration judge setting a bond amount that was prohibitively high, given his life circumstances.

These cases affirmed that attorneys’ management of these cases and advocacy for their vulnerable clients – presenting evidence, expert materials, testimony, and argument - is helpful for delivering justice. It is also very helpful for the cost management of these cases. Why?: 1) Detaining people is expensive (at least $152 daily, per detainee), but detaining mentally ill immigrants is very expensive; and 2) court cases (which sometimes can languish for years, even in the detained setting) move much faster in the hands of a defense attorney than when a mentally ill immigrant attempts to represent themself. I took the case because I thought it was valuable to see if a system of appointed attorneys might help, even if the pro bono model was unsustainable over the long term. Through our advocacy, the client did not immediately win his freedom, but his case was part of an important moment.

Soon thereafter, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued the first in a line of rulings explaining standards and safeguards for immigration court cases of immigrants with severe mental health conditions. The BIA rulings were limited victories for immigrants and largely procedural. The factual basis for a non-citizen’s removal often is simple to prove (e.g. they lack a visa, overstayed their authorized time in the U.S., or committed a removable offense), but the court had to first affirm the noncitizen’s understanding of the purpose of the proceedings, and take steps to facilitate the case, often in the form of permitting a “friend of the court” (a non-attorney relative, friend, caretaker) to actively participate and engage with the judge. Cases for “relief” from removal were much more complicated, as incompetent non-citizens faced inevitable challenges in proving that they merited favorable discretion or faced likely future persecution in their country of origin if removed. Without assistance of defense counsel, immigrants’ legal outcomes were daunting. As well, judges, already faced with crushing case backlogs, can’t shoulder the responsibility of facilitating fair hearings without investing an inordinate amount of time, themselves, in exploring the cases of immigrants who cannot effectively communicate these case details to the court.

Thus, the government, during the Obama administration, realized that investing in due process provided tangible returns and made the NQRP part of formal DHS and DOJ policy. The caseload of the NQRP is modest in real numbers amounting to just over two thousand cases over the last twelve years. Less than 900 of these cases were open at the time funding was cut in early 2025. Nevertheless, each represented case was a realization of the American promise of a system of laws and due process.

Year one of the second Trump administration is a remarkable time for the United States which, until recently, proudly proclaimed itself a nation of immigrants. By the narrowest of margins, Congress recently authorized a spending increase for immigration detention and enforcement that would add up to more than 1 trillion dollars over a period of ten years. This massive increase in spending has been justified under the pretext of countering criminality, despite the bevy of academic research showing that there’s no connection between immigration and crime rates. Moreover, immigrants who do commit crimes are already subject to removal and most are subject to mandatory detention under existing laws. The Supreme Court is permitting this enforcement to include removal of immigrants to harsh, dangerous foreign prisons or war-torn places to which they have no ties.

Against this factual backdrop, the accompanying rhetoric, and military on the city streets of our heretofore free society, it is perhaps quaint to invoke principles, even those enshrined in the constitution, but due process matters, even – especially – for unpopular groups and even more so for vulnerable ones such as the mentally disabled. Due process ensures that the awesome power of justice is meted out appropriately, including the power of a country to remove a person from its territory. In this context, principle converges with practicality, as investment in representation produces efficiency.

The recent court order rejected the arbitrary way in which NQRP met its demise. The administration has, thus far, complied with the court’s order to continue fully funding NQRP, through its major stakeholders, who have an established track record of implementing services for the target recipients nationwide. There was no financial reason not to pursue the principled path. Now that it is restored, funding for the National Qualified Representative Program must be permanently protected, and Congress should move to enact legislation on its behalf.",https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/meta_open_graph/public/2025-12/tingey-injury-law-firm-ycdpu73kgsc-unsplash.jpg?itok=PQcXf16B,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:44.534844

Trump 'wouldn't have wanted' second strike on Caribbean boat

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One yesterday, the president defended Hegseth, saying he believed his statement “100%” that he hadn’t ordered the second strike.

“I’m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.”

When asked if he would have wanted a second attempt to kill the survivors, the president said:

We’ll look into it, but no, I wouldn’t have wanted that – not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal.”

The Washington Post reported that Hegseth “gave a spoken directive” to “kill everybody” on board in September. When there were still two men left after the first strike, a Special Operations commander ordered the follow-up to comply with Hegseth’s direction, the newspaper reported.

Hegseth has strongly denied the report, calling it “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory”.

He also said the US’s strikes on boats so far in the Caribbean had been “lawful under both US and international law”.

As Pete Hegseth continues to face scrutiny following a Washington Post report that he “gave a spoken directive” on 2 September to “kill everybody” on board in a second strike on an alleged drug-trafficking vessel, the defense secretary appeared glib on social media.

He posted a picture on Sunday evening, which shows a parody cover of a Franklin the Turtle book, where the beloved character is shooting small boats below him filled with men transporting drugs. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth captioned the illustration.

The defense secretary continues to deny the Post’s claims. “As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland,” he wrote in a statement on Friday.

Trump backs GOP candidate in Tennessee special election as race tightens

Over the weekend, the president threw his weight behind Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate in the special election in Tennessee’s seventh congressional district. Van Epps is running against Aftyn Behn – a Democratic state representative – to replace former GOP congressman Mark Green. A reminder, that Trump carried the district by 22 points in 2024, but after the success of November’s elections for Democrats across the country, the party is hoping to flip the Maga stronghold.

“HE WILL BE A GREAT CONGRESSMAN,” Trump said of Van Epps on Truth Social, adding that while he “cherishes Christianity and Country Music”, his opponent “hates them both”. This comes after Republicans have criticized Behn for resurfaced comments on a 2020 podcast. “I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music,” she said of Nashville, which is part of the district she’s running to represent.

My colleague, Chris Stein, reports that a survey from Emerson College Polling and the Hill found Van Epps up by just two percentage points over Behn, leading with 48% support to her 46%. He adds that the district is mostly made up of the sort of rural territory in which Democrats have struggled to compete, but also includes part of blue-leaning Nashville, as well as the city of Clarksville, a swing area whose residents may well decide the race.

Trump continues to lambast Democratic lawmakers over troops video

The president has picked up where he left off before Thanksgiving, when it comes to his anger at the six Democratic lawmakers who took part in a video urging service members to “refuse illegal orders”.

A reminder, that Trump initially went on a Truth Social tirade, accusing the members of Congress (all of whom are veterans or former intelligence officials) of sedition, adding that their actions are “punishable by death”.

In the early hours of Monday morning (12:45am ET to be precise) Trump recounted the US Code, including a section which calls for the fine or imprisonment, for up to 10 years, for those who “interfere, impair, influence the loyalty, moral or discipline of the military and naval forces”.

“DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE!!!,” Trump concluded on social media today.

Trump's envoys Witkoff and Kushner to meet with Putin in Moscow

Donald Trump’s top envoy, Steve Witkoff, is set to meet with Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday. He’ll be joined by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has been integral in the ongoing negotiations with Russia. This comes after a Bloomberg report from last week included a leaked transcript between Witkoff and a senior Moscow official, about how Russia could curry favor with Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, in Paris, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and France’s president Emanuel Macron met today.

“Peace must become truly durable. The war must end as soon as possible. Much now depends on the involvement of every leader,” Zelenksyy wrote on social media following their closed-door discussion. “We will also be speaking with other leaders today,” he added.

Trump invites families of national guard members shot in DC to the White House

After two members of the West Virginia national guard were shot in DC last week, the president has invited their families to the White House.

One soldier, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, was killed in the attack –which took place the day before Thanksgiving. Her fellow service member, US air force staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition. Vigils across West Virginia have taken place in their memory.

“I said: ‘When you’re ready, because that’s a tough thing, come to the White House. We’re going to honor Sarah,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. “And likewise with Andrew, recover or not.”

My colleague, Marina Dunbar, reports that mourners came together over the weekend at Webster County high school in West Virginia to honor Beckstrom. Both she and Wolfe had been serving with the West Virginia national guard as part of Trump’s federal initiative to support policing efforts in DC.

Venezuela called the strikes 'murder'

Venezuela’s National Assembly has accused the US of committing “murder” with the strikes. It is one of the first acknowledgements by Venezuelan officials that their citizens have been targeted.

“There’s no declared war [between the US and Venezuela)] therefore this cannot be classified as anything but murder,” Jorge Rodriguez, the National Assembly president, told a press conference on Sunday.

“Every human being has the right to due process; no human being can be killed in a brutal manner.”

And a quick reminder of the background to US strikes in these waters:

Since September, the US has expanded its naval presence in the region, carrying out strikes on what it says are drug-smuggling boats in waters off Venezuela and Colombia.

More than 80 people have been killed according to the US Defence Department.

The US has said it is destroying boats bringing in harmful drugs, and thus its attacks are launched out of self-defence – a legal justification for military attacks under international laws of armed conflict.

But it has provided scant evidence of the alleged criminality of the boats, and has also declined to provide identification details of the people it has killed on board the boats.

Venezuela’s National Assembly has accused the US of committing “murder” with the strikes.

The UN’s human rights chief Volker Turk has said there’s “strong evidence” such strikes constitute extrajudicial killings. He’s been calling for Congress investigate.

The reports then from the weekend add another layer of suspected illegality. The Washington Post reports that the US navy on 2 September struck a drug-running vessel, killing some of the 11 on board in the first strike. After commanders saw on the live drone feed that there were still two survivors clinging to the wreck, they executed an order to strike again, to kill all those on board.

Follow-up strikes are forbidden under the rules of war and engagement, i.e. what is legal fighting between parties in a conflict.

Clauses in the the Geneva Conventions also forbid the targeting of wounded participants, saying that those participants should instead be shielded, rescued and if applicable, treated as prisoners of war with relevant rights.

Republican-led committees launching investigations

There’s been a swift response from lawmakers following the reports. Republican-led committees overseeing the Pentagon have vowed to conduct “vigorous oversight” into the boat strikes.

Senate Armed Services Committee:“Has directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances”.

House Armed Services Committee: “Is taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question”.

And lawmakers on both sides, speaking on talk shows on Sunday, called for congressional review.

“This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” said Democrat Senator Tim Kaine on CBS’s Face the Nation programme.

Republican lawmaker Mike Turner said Congress did not know yet if the report of the follow-up strike was true.

“Obviously if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” said Turner, a former chairman of the Intelligence Committee.

Now, according to Los Angeles County Assistant Public Defender Graciela Martinez, those funds are financing the new removal defense unit within the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office — one that operates outside the office’s traditional criminal practice.
LA Public Press requested an interview with the inaugural fellow, Niki Nguyễn, through both UCLA Law and the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.
The term crimmigration refers to the increasingly inseparable intersection of criminal law and immigration law.
What Padilla v. Kentucky eventually mandated was already taking shape inside LA County’s public defender’s office.","A few weeks ago, Giselle said, her friend had been driving an intoxicated friend home late at night.

“That person left an open can in her back seat, and she didn’t realize it,” she said. “Police pulled her over for no reason and called it a DUI without even doing the tests.”

Charges were dropped and her friend was released from jail, Giselle said, but she didn’t get to go home.

“ICE was waiting,” said Giselle, who asked that her last name not be used for fear of reprisal from federal authorities. “Now she’s in Mexico, and her husband and kids are all here.”

For immigrants who get caught up in the criminal justice system, the conclusion of their case doesn’t necessarily mean their ordeal is over. Instead, in LA County, as with many other places in the country, some have been subject to continued detention and a trip to immigration court, where the Public Defender office can no longer help them with their case.

That last part, however, is about to change.

For the first time in its 111-year history, the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office will be able to represent people in immigration court. A new unit will screen individuals for immigration representation, offer guidance and referrals and, for those who qualify, provide direct legal defense in immigration proceedings through in-house immigration attorneys.

Between 2010 and 2014, more than 18,500 people — many of whom had already completed their sentences — were held past their release dates because they had immigration detainers. These detainers are requests from ICE asking local jails to keep someone in custody longer than the law allows so federal agents can take them into immigration custody.

In 2012, that system was challenged in a lawsuit known as Roy v. County of Los Angeles, arguing that the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD), which oversees the county jails, violated both state law and the Fourth Amendment by detaining people solely on the basis of an ICE request, without a warrant or probable cause of a crime.

The county eventually settled the case. As part of the agreement, LASD officials were forced to rewrite their policies so that immigration detainers could no longer justify extended detentions. The county also agreed to pay $14 million to those who had been unlawfully held.

Roy v. County of Los Angeles ultimately defined three groups of people harmed by the policy: immigrants who were held past their lawful release dates solely because of an ICE detainer, those who would have been released on bail but were kept in custody because of an immigration hold and immigrants who were denied bail altogether.

But many of the victims entitled to compensation could not be found. The unclaimed funds, called cy pres funds, cannot be returned to the agency responsible for the harm; instead, they must support work that benefits similarly affected communities.

Now, according to Los Angeles County Assistant Public Defender Graciela Martinez, those funds are financing the new removal defense unit within the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office — one that operates outside the office’s traditional criminal practice. The unit will take on federal deportation cases, a space public defenders normally do not enter under current law. The distinction matters: the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to counsel only in criminal proceedings, leaving immigrants in civil immigration court without a government-appointed attorney.

While representation is a significant part of the new effort, according to Martinez, the unit’s responsibilities extend beyond it. Community members will be screened to determine whether they qualify for full legal defense, and even those who do not will receive guidance, referrals, and information about their options. The office is also still navigating whether any portion of the cy pres funds can be used to pay immigration bonds for people detained in ICE facilities.

“The public defender’s office is a crucial backstop. If there were more funding, more fellows could be out there doing this work,” said Ingrid Eagly, co-director of UCLA Law School’s Criminal Law and Policy Consortium.

LA Public Press requested an interview with the inaugural fellow, Niki Nguyễn, through both UCLA Law and the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office. UCLA Law directed questions to the Public Defender’s Office, which confirmed that Nguyễn would not be available for an interview before publication.

For Martinez — a 31-year veteran attorney who helped drive the Roy litigation — the unit marks a kind of institutional reckoning. “The leftover cy pres funds allow us to serve people like them — people who were impacted but cannot be identified,” she said. “This is about looking at people as individuals — not as criminals, not as monsters.”

The path to this moment began well before the landmark 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Padilla v. Kentucky, which required defense attorneys nationwide to warn clients when a criminal case could affect their immigration status. “We didn’t even call ourselves ‘crimmigration’ people back then, but now we do,” said Martinez, who is also the first Latina and first foreign-born individual to lead the California Public Defender’s Association (CPDA).

The term crimmigration refers to the increasingly inseparable intersection of criminal law and immigration law. In this space, a single arrest, charge, or conviction can trigger life-altering immigration consequences far beyond the criminal courtroom.

What Padilla v. Kentucky eventually mandated was already taking shape inside LA County’s public defender’s office. Martinez said she had already been warning clients that a plea could trigger deportation or other immigration consequences since 2002, eight years before Padilla. She said she was mentored by Katherine Brady, an attorney widely regarded as a pioneer of “crimmigration.” Together, they helped create some of the earliest training materials still used by public defenders nationwide.

Despite that groundwork, enforcement often advanced more rapidly than safeguards. At one point, Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the nation, was holding more immigrants on ICE detainers than any other county in the nation — more than most states, according to the ACLU. Whether that volume reflects the county’s sheer size remains unclear. Martinez recalls that during the years covered by Roy v. County of Los Angeles (2010-2014), she repeatedly called jail staff to insist that clients be released, reminding them there was no legal basis to keep anyone in custody. “And still,” she said, “they would hold people until ICE arrived.”

An uneven landscape

As the new removal-defense team takes shape, its arrival also exposes the uneven terrain of public defense across California. The state’s 58 counties operate independently, with varying levels of funding, political will and willingness to address immigration consequences. “There are counties that are very anti-immigrant, and they’re not going to fight for this,” said Christopher Punongbayan, the executive director of California ChangeLawyers, a statewide foundation that funds early-career lawyers and advocates, with a focus on expanding access to justice for marginalized communities. “We look at where the need is.”

In Ventura County, more than 100,000 people commute to and from Los Angeles each day, moving between jurisdictions with vastly different levels of immigrant legal protection — differences that became especially visible this summer. In August, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors declined to expand its immigrant legal defense program, leaving a gap that city leaders in Oxnard chose to fill themselves. In response, the Oxnard City Council approved up to $600,000 in matching funds over three years to support an additional Ventura County public defender — a commitment that will take effect only if the county agrees to participate.

Ken Rozell, the city’s chief assistant attorney, said the proposal is intended to bolster support for the immigrant community, though the specifics are still being worked out. “We don’t dictate how the Public Defender’s Office would use that position,” Rozell said. “But it’s really to provide funding so they can assist in the way that the public defender can assist with those immigration issues.” LA Public Press has reached out to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors for comment and to ask about a timeline for a decision but had not received a response by publication.

“This is about due process,” Oxnard City Manager Alexander Nguyen said in a recorded livestream. For local organizers and families, the decision underscored their argument that cities can act even when counties refuse.

That local momentum reflects a broader shift across California. At the state level, data from the California Immigrant Policy Center shows that it was largely during the first Trump administration—amid an escalation in federal immigration enforcement—that California significantly strengthened its immigrant legal-defense infrastructure. That effort deepened with the 2019 Budget Act, which created the state’s first immigration legal fellowship to expand the pipeline of removal-defense attorneys in regions that need them most.

Even with new state funding, the gap between enforcement and representation remains stark. Los Angeles County’s removal-defense unit is a meaningful step, but it enters a system where demand far exceeds capacity. According to the Vera Institute, of the more than 450,000 people ordered removed in immigration court over the past 12 months, roughly 75 percent had no legal representation.

The reality behind those numbers is visible in daily life. Immigration arrests continue in homes, parking lots and near schools, fueling constant demand for legal help and straining volunteer-run hotlines. And across California — including its most progressive regions — many immigrants still appear in court without a lawyer. The State Bar of California reports that even with recent investments, including an additional $25 million in the 2025 budget, available resources fall well short of rising need.

For Giselle, those systemic failures were etched into her daily life.

“Our biggest crime is being brown,” Giselle said. Beside her, her friend Jessica nodded in agreement. For both women, their immigration status compounds the risks they already face.

Jessica said the strain of daily life had become its own barometer of inequity. Because she and her family are all vulnerable to immigration enforcement, she often feels pressure to shoulder more — a calculation shaped, she said, by her lighter skin and the belief that she is less likely to be singled out in a system where racial profiling by ICE has been repeatedly reported. “I’m working two jobs right now because I have to provide for my family,” she said. “I’m light-skinned, and even though I don’t look Mexican, I am.”

The removal-defense unit is unlikely to mend every fracture in the system. But it signals a turning point: for the first time Los Angeles County has embedded immigration attorneys within its own public defender’s office to defend clients in immigration court, reshaping a system that once funneled people directly from local jails into deportation proceedings.

“This is a critical moment — immigrants are being arrested every day by federal agents who show up in masks, without warrants, and engaging in profiling based on race,” said Eagly.","https://cdn.lapublicpress.org/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect,metadata=none/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC03525-2.jpg",N,,2025-12-01 11:58:48.305282

Shooting of US National Guard

The move comes at a time of heightened tension in the US following a deadly shooting of two National Guard members, one of whom has succumbed to their injuries and died. In response, US President Donald Trump vowed to freeze migration from what he referred to as ""third-world countries"".

In a post on X, US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow confirmed the suspension.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who is the main suspect in the shooting, was wounded during the encounter with security forces. Lakanwal was reported to have worked with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for over a decade while living in Afghanistan.

After the Taliban takeover in 2021 and the withdrawal of US troops, Lakanwal came to the US with his family. According to media reports, Lakanwal had a hard time integrating into the US societal fabric and may have been dealing with PTSD.

Rejection of outside interference

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz publicly rejected what he described as US pressure on European migration policy, saying, ""Migration policy is our business, and we decide it as we see fit… We don't need any admonitions from outside.""

Germany, under a federal admissions program, offers Afghan nationals who had served in German offices or missions before the takeover of the Taliban settlement in Germany, along with their families. After suspension and much debate, the government resumed admissions for some Afghans with legally binding entry approvals.

The Chancellor added that Germany, together with the other EU countries, is in the process of forging a common European asylum and immigration policy, and insisted that these decisions should be made internally, without outside interference.

Merz’s response points to a broader concern among some EU leaders that foreign pressure, especially from the US, could complicate efforts to manage migration in a way that balances security, legal obligations, and humanitarian commitments.

Migrants implicated in crime

The public perception of migrants involved in crime, especially violent and sexual crimes, remains controversial and often misleading.

High-profile cases, such as a case that involved an asylum seeker in the UK embroiled in sexual assault, sparked riots in different parts of the country while fueling debate over whether migrants have a greater propensity to commit sexual or violent crimes.

Media coverage also tends to overrepresent crimes committed by foreigners relative to their actual share of offenders in police data.

Research shows that although foreigners may appear disproportionately in some crime statistics, once factors such as urban concentration, younger age profile, and socioeconomic conditions are accounted for, there is no clear causal relationship between migrants’ presence and higher crime rates.

Official statistics from the general population show rising sexual-offence figures overall, but not a conclusively disproportionate share can be attributed directly to migrant groups.",https://scd.infomigrants.net/media/resize/my_image_small/6b2f41b0ae60dfe4a1ec2e5b652103554174708e.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:18.577037

She is sore. She is tired. And she is alone.

Oscarina and her husband escaped violence in Venezuela and moved 2,000 miles north to Missouri in 2023, seeking more stable housing and a better future for their daughter. Neither have permanent legal status in the United States, and when she learned she had a second child on the way, Oscarina wondered how they could afford to raise another baby.

Eight weeks into the pregnancy, her husband was detained while delivering a DoorDash order. He was deported back to Venezuela a short time later.

“All my pregnancy, I cried every single day,” Oscarina, who lives in Kansas City and asked not to use her name out of fear of deportation, told The Independent through an interpreter.

When she went into labor prematurely earlier this month, her husband cried as he called in over video from Venezuela.

When their daughter was born, he helped with night feedings. This time, there is no help. And what little money her family had saved up quickly disappeared during the deportation process.

Now she lives in constant fear about what would happen if she gets detained.

There are days her oldest child doesn’t attend school because Oscarina worries she could be taken while walking her to the bus stop.

She wonders what the point of the “American Dream” is. Her family suffered under Venezuela’s dictatorship, and in America she suffers, too.

“I would like to go back to my country,” Oscarina said. “But my husband is saying that things are very bad there right now, and I don’t think it’s a good idea to bring both of the kids right now.”

So they will remain separated.

“I live in fear every day,” Oscarina said. “ … It’s too heavy to carry being by myself with my daughter and my little boy and not having my husband because he will always care for us. The fact that he doesn’t get to be with us, everything changed for us.”

Oscarina’s story is one of many shared with The Independent over the past month as women who are undocumented in Missouri navigate pregnancy, birth and postpartum without legal paperwork.

Several community health care workers, doulas and nonprofits that work with immigrants and expectant mothers shared the struggles the families face. Few were willing to speak on the record, fearful that federal agents could target their offices or the federal government could restrict funding if they spoke out about their work with undocumented immigrants.

The organizations located across Missouri shared stories of pregnant and postpartum women who’ve shuttered themselves in their homes. Many are facing labor or postpartum in isolation, their husbands deported and the fear of the same fate keeping them housebound, at times too afraid to seek medical care.

Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been increasingly visible on America’s streets, including in Missouri, sparking protests across the state and nation. Arrests have made headlines as videos circulate of ICE agents detaining parents at school drop-offs and arresting teachers, including inside a preschool.

In rare cases, ICE has reportedly posted up outside maternity wards.

Under previous administrations, schools, hospitals and churches were considered sanctuary spaces where ICE was not allowed under almost any circumstances. That changed this year, raising new fears for families with young children like Oscarina.

“This is the worst that I’ve seen in many, many years,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project.

Under former President Joe Biden’s administration, pregnant women were protected from ICE detention. While that policy remains in place, the ACLU earlier this year uncovered several examples of women who were either pregnant or miscarried while in federal detention centers.

“The trauma it has on children and parents and families is heartbreaking,” Cho said. “And it’s completely unnecessary. These are families that have been living and working and contributing to our communities, often for years or decades.”

ICE threats send mothers, children into hiding in Missouri

Neysha Reyes Cruz is one of a handful of bilingual doulas in Missouri.

Through her company, Olas de Amor Doula Services, she has advocated for almost 90 women through pregnancy, birth and postpartum over the past three years. Of those 90, about 70 were undocumented, she said. This year, she estimates she’s stood in as the support person for about half a dozen women who gave birth after a close family member was deported.

Reyes Cruz, who is from Puerto Rico and moved to Missouri in 2016, often serves as an interpreter as well as a doula for her clients, the majority of whom give birth in hospitals. But in recent months, as the threat of ICE raids permeates her Kansas City community, she said her job has increasingly expanded into helping families with more than birth.

The messages she gets from moms are often desperate. One recently asked Reyes Cruz if she could get her formula from the store after the mother said she saw ICE agents out on her street that day.

Many of her clients skip non-crucial doctor’s appointments. Others miss WIC appointments or have been cut off from food stamps. She has a donation closet to help with clothing and baby supplies.

Instead of going to the pediatrician, many new moms instead call Reyes Cruz to ask if their baby is sick enough to warrant risking leaving the house. The child birth class she used to host in-person is now virtual because too many families feared driving to her.

“I have had moms that have withdrawn their kids from school and have just left the country so those kids never ended their school year. Mamas that were in situations where their partners became so depressed and anxious they started becoming abusive, and from there, having to find refuge for them,” she said. “This is the hardest thing, finding a refuge for a mama that is single, is pregnant or with maybe older kids, does not speak English and doesn’t have a prior family here.”

She encourages her clients to designate someone who is a citizen to get custody of their baby if they’re deported. One mom requested that Reyes Cruz be that person for her baby girl.

“As a doula, I’m being pushed to support this community because they don’t feel safe with anyone else,” she said.

She fears the elevated stress thrust on these families is affecting their babies. Of the past 10 births she’s attended, five were babies born prematurely.

Missouri still among worst states for infant, maternal health as new Medicaid cuts loom

Reyes Cruz’s experiences aren’t unique.

A health care provider in the Ozarks who was too afraid to speak on the record said she has Hispanic patients who fear coming into the clinic amid increasingly visible ICE raids around the country.

Other nonprofit workers shared the difficulties of helping parents obtain birth certificates for their newborn children so they could self-deport back to their home country. Legal aid groups help parents establish custody plans in case they are detained and their children are left alone.

Community health workers in urban centers of the state said they are doing more home health visits for pregnant and postpartum women who fear leaving the house, or who are waiting until later in pregnancy to see their doctors. Others help arrange Uber rides to get the women to their appointments.

“I’m heartbroken for any woman who feels fearful to leave her home, especially to try to receive prenatal care,” said Laura Brandt, director of Pregnancy Help Center of South County in St. Louis.

She said her nonprofit serves anyone who walks through the door and doesn’t question their status.

“This is such a polarizing topic and people have a lot of really strong opinions going either way on the matter,” Brandt said. “Regardless of what your opinions are on a policy level, on a personal level, every human being is deserving of dignity and compassion and care.”

Some families turn to self-deportation

In just a couple days, Monica is self-deporting. She purchased a one-way flight from Kansas City back to Chile, where she is from. Her 6-month-old son will be on her lap.

Monica, who asked not to use her name because she is undocumented, moved to the United States on Mother’s Day last year, seeking better education opportunities for her son, who is 8.

She learned she was pregnant a couple months later. She was sad to be experiencing a new life without her friends and family by her side.

When she was less than two weeks postpartum, Monica said her husband became violent during an argument. She called her therapist, who reported the abuse to the police. He was arrested and deported back to his home country of Venezuela.

Now alone, Monica can no longer afford to care for her two children on her own. She delivers for DoorDash, and on each trip she fears being caught by immigration agents. Her fear is amplified now that she has a second child. What happens to them if she’s detained?

“Life got more difficult for me,” she said through an interpreter as her son babbled from his perch on her hip.

Tim Rudolph, a St. Louis-based immigration attorney for Hacking Immigration Law, said it’s not uncommon for people to self-deport in today’s political climate.

He encouraged anyone considering self-deportation to talk with a lawyer first, noting that if someone has a child who is a U.S. citizen, they may have some legal paths to staying in the country if they want to stay.

“Even though the government is saying ‘if you leave you can come back the right way, we’ll let you do it,’ that’s not often the case,” Rudolph said. “That tends to be what they say to get people out of the country, and a lot of times you’ll be barred from returning.”

While Monica doesn’t yet know if she’ll ever try returning to the U.S., her current vision of her children’s future has been shattered. While she still believes the move to America was worthwhile to attempt to give her children a more promising future, she feels some relief to return home to her parents and to leave the constant fear of deportation behind.

“People need to be strong emotionally to come over to the United States,” Monica said. “Because even though the United States is a very great country full of opportunities, it can be very emotionally draining to be here with this situation.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2193563646-2048x1368.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 10:59:03.689184

A rapidly shifting landscape of humanitarian protections presents ongoing compliance challenges for employers. As the latest example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nationals of Haiti, Burma (Myanmar), and South Sudan while a federal court has temporarily blocked the termination of TPS for Syria.

TPS Terminations: Haiti, Burma (Myanmar), South Sudan

Haiti

Back in July, we covered litigation developments from a US District Court decision that extended TPS for Haiti until February 2026.

On November 26, 2025, DHS published a notice ending TPS for Haiti. At the time of writing, the official Federal Register has not been published yet, but the termination is set to take effect on February 3, 2026. The termination will affect around 330,000 nationals from Haiti.

Burma (Myanmar)

On November 25, 2025, DHS published a notice ending TPS for Burma. The termination will take effect on January 26, 2026, and will affect nearly 4,000 nationals from Burma who were granted TPS after the military coup in 2021.

South Sudan

On November 5, 2025, DHS published a notice ending TPS for South Sudan. The termination will take effect on January 5, 2026.

Possible Termination of Somalia

On November 21, 2025, President Trump announced that he intends to end TPS for Somalia. At the time of writing, no official notice from DHS has been released. We will continue to monitor for official updates from DHS.

Please reference the table below to track the upcoming work authorization expiration dates for each TPS-designated country:

Country Date Work Authorization Expires South Sudan January 5, 2026 Burma (Myanmar) January 26, 2026 Haiti February 3, 2026

Litigation Halts Termination: Syria

Back in October, we covered the announcement of the termination of TPS for nationals from Syria. The Federal Register notice scheduled the termination to take effect on November 21, 2025, citing national security concerns as the basis for the decision. The decision would have affected nearly 4,000 Syrian nationals. However, on November 19, 2025, a judge in the Southern District of New York issued an order staying the termination of Syria TPS. We will update as the litigation develops.

Employer Considerations

Employers should be aware that affected TPS holders will lose both protected status and their work authorization unless they have transitioned to another lawful immigration status. This could result in the loss of employees who rely on TPS-based work authorization.

Employer Next Steps

Continued Form I-9 Compliance: Employees with TPS may have Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) that expire when their TPS ends. Employers should review and track card expiration dates for the TPS (A12 or C19) designations, follow reverification procedures, and closely monitor updates from DHS.

ICE I-9 Inspections: Employers may face increased scrutiny from Immigration and Customs Enforcement during I-9 inspections if their records are not updated timely, or if individuals without valid work authorization maintain employment.

Ongoing Communication: Employers should be prepared to address questions from affected employees and provide resources for legal counsel.

Stay Informed: Monitor updates from DHS and follow our blog for updates.

*** There’s a lot of complicated immigration law here, and I’m already giving short shrift to some of the nuances.
Noncitizens “stopped at the boundary line” who have “gained no foothold in the United States,” do not enjoy the same constitutional protections afforded to persons inside the United States.

I’m grateful to all of you for your continued support—and I hope that you’ll consider sharing some of what we’re doing with your networks:

Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“On the Docket”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“The One First ‘Long Read’”); and some Court-related trivia. If you’re not already a subscriber, I hope you’ll consider becoming one—and upgrading to a paid subscription if your circumstances permit:

I wanted to use today’s “Long Read” to write about an issue that, at least in my universe, hasn’t gotten a lot of public attention—but that may well be one of the more quietly important legal stories of the year: The role federal district courts are playing in pushing back against a massively significant change to immigration detention policy that the Trump administration quietly attempted to implement back in July.

In a nutshell, the executive branch has radically expanded its interpretation of which non-citizens can be arrested and detained without bond pending their removal proceedings—a move that has exposed hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of individuals already living inside the United States to immigration arrest and detention to which they would not realistically have been subject prior to this summer, and with no right to seek release once they’ve been arrested. Many of those arrests have taken place at ICE facilities or courthouses when these same individuals have appeared for regular check-ins or for the next steps in their asylum applications. But regardless of where these arrests are taking place, it’s safe to say that this quiet attempt to expand what’s often shorthanded, however inaccurately, as “mandatory detention” is directly connected to many of the arrests we’re seeing during ICE raids in U.S. cities.

The Trump administration’s new interpretation of a 29-year-old statute, in turn, has been rejected by a truly staggering array of federal district courts across the country. According to Politico’s Kyle Cheney, since July,

At least 225 judges have ruled in more than 700 cases that the administration’s new policy, which also deprives people of an opportunity to seek release from an immigration court, is a likely violation of law and the right to due process. Those judges were appointed by all modern presidents—including 23 by Trump himself—and hail from at least 35 states . . . . In contrast, only eight judges nationwide, including six appointed by Trump, have sided with the administration’s new mass detention policy.

What is striking about this pattern is not just its volume or the scorecard; it’s that the judges in many of these cases are writing thorough, persuasive opinions explaining why the Trump administration is utterly wrong on the law—including an especially strident ruling from Judge Lewis Kaplan in the Southern District of New York just last Wednesday. Kaplan appended to his 33-page decision a list of more than 350 of additional rulings by his district court colleagues. And although the litigation has proceeded at a retail, case-by-case level to date (hence the high number of cases), last Tuesday, Judge Sunshine Sykes in the Central District of California certified a nationwide class action at least for purposes of declaratory relief against the policy—which may accelerate how quickly this issue moves to the courts of appeals and, inevitably it seems, to the Supreme Court.

I’ve written before about the role federal district courts have played in issuing coercive relief against Trump administration policies over the past 10 months. These cases have not been part of the dataset my research assistants and I have maintained because they have been, to date, individual requests for release from detention rather than lawsuits seeking coercive relief against the policies themselves. But excepting changes to federal criminal sentencing laws, I can’t recall any other example of a federal policy that provoked quite so much litigation in such a short period of time—or litigation in which so many judges from across the geographical and ideological spectrum so overwhelmingly rejected the executive branch’s new interpretation of the relevant statutes. It’s a striking story not just about the Trump administration’s zealotry when it comes to immigration policy, but about the critical role hundreds of federal judges have played in steadfastly holding the executive branch to the law.

But first, the (SCOTUS-related) news.

On the Docket

The Merits Docket

Last week’s regular Order List brought with it the Court’s first two opinions of the term—both of which were “summary reversals” in which the justices reversed a court of appeals at the certiorari stage in an unsigned (“per curiam”) opinion, without hearing oral argument or otherwise conducting plenary review:

In Pitts v. Mississippi, the Court reversed the Supreme Court of Mississippi—which had rejected a Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause challenge to a Mississippi statute mandating the physical screening of all child abuse victims from criminal defendants during their testimony. As the Court reaffirmed in a five-page opinion, the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause requires trial courts in those circumstances to make case-specific determinations of whether such screening truly is necessary, regardless of any categorical state law rule to the contrary. There were no public dissents.

And in Clark v. Sweeney, the Court reversed the Fourth Circuit—holding that it had wrongly granted post-conviction habeas relief to a Maryland prisoner based upon an argument that the prisoner had failed to fully and fairly present himself (in a case in which one of the jurors had visited the crime scene without authorization and had subsequently been dismissed). The only issue the prisoner had preserved, the Court held in a four-page opinion, was whether his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by agreeing to allow the case to proceed to a verdict once the juror was dismissed.

When Will Baude coined the term “shadow docket” in 2015, he was specifically responding to a significant uptick at that moment in these kinds of certiorari-stage “summary” rulings. They had rather petered out over the ensuing decade, so it will be interesting to see if the two rulings last Monday end up as outliers, or as a sign that more of these rulings are incoming. Time will tell.

The only other especially noteworthy developments in last Monday’s Order List were the separate opinions respecting the denial of certiorari in Beck v. United States. The issue in Beck is the so-called “Feres doctrine,” an (entirely atextual) interpretation of the Federal Tort Claims Act adopted by the Supreme Court in 1950 that bars any and all lawsuits by military servicemembers against the federal government for torts “arising out of, or incident to” their military service. Justice Thomas has long been (quite rightly, in my view) a staunch critic of Feres, and has been calling, for years, for the justices to revisit that precedent. Alas, he seems to once again have come up short. Although Justice Gorsuch also noted that he would have voted to take up this case, Justice Sotomayor penned a separate “statement” suggesting that it should be up to Congress to fix the mess the Court created—“out of respect for the Court’s rules of stare decisis, and in recognition of the reliance interests that Feres has generated.” Of course, it’s hard to imagine any Congress, let alone the current one, making it easier for servicemembers to sue the federal government. That’s why Feres, handed down just four years after the FTCA was enacted, was so problematic in the first place.

The Emergency Docket

It was a surprisingly quiet week with respect to emergency applications. The only action of note from the full Court came Wednesday—when the Court issued an order … declining to act … on the Trump administration’s request to freeze a lower court ruling that had blocked the attempted removal of Shira Perlmutter as the Register of Copyrights. The Court’s order, from which only Justice Thomas publicly dissented, noted that the application is being deferred pending the Court’s consideration of Trump v. Slaughter (set to be argued next Monday) and Trump v. Cook (set to be argued in January). Frankly, I don’t get it. The underlying question in Perlmutter is a very specific, statutory question (is the Library of Congress an “executive agency” for purposes of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act) the answer to which won’t be implicated at all in those two other cases. And although the second question the justices asked the parties to address in Slaughter (what’s the remedy for federal officers who are unlawfully removed) could obviously affect other cases, Perlmutter is still … in her job, and doesn’t need to be reinstated by a court. This last point, of course, means that the ruling is effectively a loss for the Trump administration. But it’s not clear to me why there wouldn’t (and shouldn’t) have been five votes to just say that now.

The Week Ahead

This morning kicks off a busy week at the Court—with the beginning of the December argument session starting at 10. We also continue to wait for the Court to rule on the two especially high-profile emergency applications that remain pending—Texas’s application in the Texas redistricting case; and the Trump administration’s application in the Illinois National Guard case.

As has so often been true with the Supreme Court this year, there’s a lot going on.

The One First “Long Read”:

Mandatory Detention and the Lyons Memo

To understand the flood of immigration detention cases currently inundating the federal courts, it may be helpful to start with a brief background on immigration detention. I’ll also refer folks who’d like even more detail to this helpful 2019 Congressional Research Service report.

Background

In particular, three points seem especially foundational here.

First, the general immigration detention statute, section 236(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)), provides rules for the arrest and detention of any non-citizen “pending a decision on whether [they are] to be removed from the United States.” But detention under section 236(a) comes, among other things, with a right to a bond hearing (based upon a showing that the individual poses no danger to others; security threat; or flight risk) and eligibility for parole—denials of both of which are subject to judicial review. What’s more, detention under section 236(a) has always been understood to be discretionary—meaning there is no requirement that individuals subject to detention under that provision actually be detained.

Thus, as Judge Kaplan put it last week, “Section 236, since a 1996 amendment, has given immigration authorities essentially two options at the outset of removal proceedings. One option is to keep the noncitizen in custody throughout the proceedings. The other option is to release the noncitizen on bond or parole.” For a host of reasons, the norm, historically, has been to choose the latter—especially for those individuals who have committed no crimes, and who are subject to removal only because they are present in the United States without legal authorization. Those individuals will usually be entitled to release on bond—which, for obvious reasons, has led the executive branch to not prioritize arresting and detaining them in the first place.

Second, and in contrast, there are a handful of more specific “mandatory” detention statutes, which, at least in theory, require the detention of individuals who meet the more specific statutory criteria. The one that is especially relevant here is section 235(b), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b). That provision actually includes two separate authorities. Section 235(b)(1) is for non-citizens stopped at (or near) the border who are “inadmissible”—and who are subject to “expedited” removal “without further hearing or review unless the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution.” (The grounds on which someone can be “inadmissible” are a lot more specific than the grounds on which they can be removable.)

Section 235(b)(2), in contrast, mandates detention for the duration of “regular” removal proceedings “in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.” Historically, both parts of section 235(b) have been understood to refer, as the section heading reflects, to “applicants for admission” to the United States, i.e., those stopped either (1) at the border; or (2) within some temporal and geographic proximity to having entered the country without inspection. Those who are inadmissible [section 235(b)(1)] can be placed in expedited removal; those who are not [section 235(b)(2)] must go through ordinary removal proceedings during which they can be detained without bond.

Indeed, when section 235(b)(2) applies, not only is there no statutory right to a bond hearing, but the only mechanism for internal review by ICE (a narrow form of humanitarian parole) is not subject to judicial review, either. Thus, there are massively significant differences between detention under section 235(b)(2) and detention under section 236(a)—including not just the likelihood of detention but also the ability of someone detained under these provisions to challenge the factual or legal basis for that detention, or even to seek release on bond while those proceedings continue.

Third, during both the first and second Trump administrations, the executive branch has separately tried to expand the category of individuals subject to expedited removal (and mandatory detention under section 235(b)(1)) based upon when they entered into the United States without inspection. In other words, it’s tried to move the line for who counts as an “arriving alien” to include at least some individuals who have been in the United States for some time. For context, in 2004, the Bush administration had (controversially) interpreted that category to include those stopped at the border or those apprehended (1) within 100 miles of the border and (2) within 14 days of entering the country without inspection. That was a big enough move, but that was the understood (and judicially sustained) limit on who could be subjected to “expedited removal” for decades.

The Trump administration has since sought to expand that category dramatically—to include anyone found anywhere in the United States who cannot prove their continuous presence in the United States for more than two years (the statutory maximum Congress authorized in 1996). But that attempted policy shift was blocked by a D.C. federal district judge on August 29—primarily on the ground that it likely violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by depriving those with significant connections to the United States of a meaningful opportunity to challenge the basis for their expedited removal. Just last Monday, the D.C. Circuit, by a 2-1 vote, denied in relevant part the federal government’s application for a stay of that ruling pending appeal.

***

There’s a lot of complicated immigration law here, and I’m already giving short shrift to some of the nuances. (The American Immigration Council has published a fantastic practice advisory that goes into much more detail for those who are so inclined.) The key for present purposes is that, prior to the July 8 detention policy shift, even the Trump administration’s view had been that, once an individual had been continuously present in the United States for at least two years, they were no longer subject to expedited removal as if they were an “arriving alien” under section 235(b)(1)—and the “ordinary” immigration process [section 236(a)] would otherwise apply barring special circumstances. Those individuals could still be subject to mandatory detention if they fell into one of the specific categories of such detention (e.g., certain individuals convicted of crimes or for the 90 days preceding the effectuation of a removal order). But absent those special circumstances, individuals who had been continuously present in the United States for at least two years (under the Trump administration’s contested view) or even just two weeks (under the Bush administration’s view) were subject to arrest and detention only under the more generous, bond-eligible, discretionary authority of section 236(a).

I’m not aware of any specific data on what percentage of the total population of non-citizens living today in the United States without inspection has been continuously present in the United States for at least two years. But a 2024 DHS report found that 79% of undocumented immigrants had been present in the United States since before 2010. It stands to reason that the percentage of that population who have been in the United States since at least November 2023 is … much higher. In other words, there are a lot more undocumented immigrants who have been continuously present in the United States for more than two years than who have not been.

The July 8 Memo and Subsequent Developments

On July 8, Todd Lyons, then the Acting Director of ICE, issued a memorandum titled “Interim Guidance Regarding Detention Authority for Applicants for Admission.” In it, Lyons wrote that “It is the position of DHS that [any non-citizens who entered the United States without being admitted] are subject to detention under INA § 235(b) and may not be released from ICE custody except by INA § 212(d)(5) parole.” To make the point clear, the memo continued, “For custody purposes, these aliens are now treated in the same manner that ‘arriving aliens’ have historically been treated.” The only non-citizens who would still be covered by the “ordinary” detention provision would be those who had been lawfully admitted to the United States upon entry or received some lawful status thereafter, only to have committed some immigration or criminal offense that subjects them to removal.

Just to underscore the point, the Lyons memo effectively subjected to immediate arrest and to mandatory detention pending removal every single non-citizen physically present in the United States who had never been lawfully admitted, no matter how long they have been here or how carefully they’ve followed the law since their arrival. And although initial headlines (e.g., in the Washington Post) highlighted that the memo revoked those individuals’ right to a bond hearing, no less important is the extent to which it subjected them to arrest and detention in the first place—arrest and detention that would not have been a realistic possibility, even if it was formally available, under section 236(a). A non-citizen, for instance, who came to the United States with their parents when they were a child, and who has lived in the country for decades without committing any crimes, is now subject to mandatory detention with no possibility of bond under the July 8 memo; before that, even if the law might have allowed for their arrest and detention, they would almost certainly have been released on bond for the duration of their removal proceedings—assuming the government wanted to remove them in the first place.

Almost overnight, as ICE started implementing the July 8 policy, individuals who, all of a sudden, were subject to arrest and detention under the new interpretation of these 29-year-old statutes brought habeas petitions challenging their detention in the federal district court in which they were held. This led to a remarkable flurry of rulings by federal district judges across the country—as reflected in a public database maintained by the American Immigration Council in conjunction with the University of Iowa immigration law clinic. And the judges in the overwhelming majority of those rulings have concluded that the July 8 policy is unlawful—because section 235(b), by its terms, does not apply to individuals who are not “seeking admission into the country” (because they have already been here for some time). As one district court succinctly put it in August, “someone who enters a movie theater without purchasing a ticket and then proceeds to sit through the first few minutes of a film would not ordinarily then be described as ‘seeking admission’ to the theater.”

Although I could link to any of dozens of these rulings, two especially illustrative examples are last Wednesday’s decision by Judge Kaplan in Manhattan; and a ruling from the previous week by Judge Lynn Winmill in Idaho. As Judge Kaplan concluded, “Requiring the detention of noncitizens like [the petitioner in that case] would be inconsistent with how immigration law in this country long has worked, not to mention the rule of law and basic notions of due process.” And in Judge Winmill’s words,

Since the United States began restricting immigration into this country in the late 19th century, it has distinguished between those noncitizens seeking entry into the country and those already residing within it. Noncitizens “stopped at the boundary line” who have “gained no foothold in the United States,” do not enjoy the same constitutional protections afforded to persons inside the United States. But once a noncitizen enters the United States, “the legal circumstance changes,” for the constitutional right to due process applies to all “persons” within our nation’s borders, “whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.” This distinction between noncitizens who have entered and reside in the United States and those who have not yet entered “runs throughout immigration law.”

It’s not just that this distinction “runs throughout immigration law”; it’s that it also reflects the more humane reality that, however they entered the United States, those who have lived in the country for years (if not decades), and who have pose no risk to their communities or the country, may lawfully be subject to removal—but they do not pose the same risk justifying aggressive (and expensive) uses of law enforcement resources along the way.

To be sure, there have been a handful of rulings in the other direction—most notably a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (which is in the Department of Justice) in September—which, among other things, effectively bars any of the Department’s internal immigration judges from ruling otherwise. Indeed, that’s a big part of why so many of these cases have ended up in federal district court. But the arguments the district courts keep embracing seem pretty straightforward to me, regardless of one’s preferred approach to statutory interpretation. Even the Supreme Court, as recently as 2018, was clear on the core distinction here: “U.S. immigration law authorizes the Government to detain certain aliens seeking admission into the country under §§ 1225(b)(1) and (b)(2). It also authorizes the Government to detain certain aliens already in the country pending the outcome of removal proceedings under §§ 1226(a) and (c).” Indeed.

***

It’s hard to predict exactly what’s going to happen next in these fast-moving cases. As Kyle Cheney noted in his Politico piece last week, “The Trump administration has asked appeals courts in the Texas-based 5th Circuit and the Missouri-based 8th Circuit for expedited rulings on the matter. But it has also asked appeals courts in other parts of the country to slow-walk their consideration.” And the class certification order in the Central District of California case can also be immediately appealed—at least with the permission of the Ninth Circuit.

One way or the other, it stands to reason that the legality of the Lyons memo will make its way to the Supreme Court sooner, rather than later. And when it does, it will necessarily be one of the most important immigration disputes to arise out of this administration’s efforts to date—not just because of the number of people who are directly affected by the policy (and how it affects them), but because of how fundamentally it attempts to rewrite a distinction that U.S. immigration law (and the Supreme Court’s own case law) has maintained since at least the 1950s: Between those stopped at the border, and those who, through whatever means, are living their lives on U.S. soil—to whom the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment unquestionably applies. To borrow a line from Adam Serwer, the cruelty may well be the point of the Lyons memo. But the law demands—and ought to demand—a heck of a lot more.

SCOTUS Trivia: The First Monday in … December?

This isn’t Supreme Court trivia, per se. But I’ve been spending a lot of time recently with old congressional records, and wanted to flag a quirk that’s in the text of the original Constitution and that says quite a lot about how the Founders originally envisioned the job of being a member of Congress. Specifically, as Article I, Section 4, Clause 2 of the Constitution provided, “The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.”

Thus, congressional sessions typically began on the first Monday in December, even for a Congress that entered into office that March—from the Founding all the way through the entrance into force of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933. Section 2 of that latter proviso specifies that “The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.” And although Congress has, at various points, appointed a different day for the beginning of the next session, the strong norm has been to follow the constitutional formulation (as amended) throughout our history.

Among other things, the First Monday in December Clause meant not only that Congress was often out of session for months even after newly being elected, but that the second session of each Congress typically post-dated the intervening elections—during which many of the members would often be “lame ducks.”

There’s broad consensus on why the Founders initially opted for December. As one historical note on the Senate’s website explains, “The 18th-century framers of the United States Constitution, accustomed to an agriculturally based economy with its cycles of planting, growing, and harvesting, considered the mostly dormant month of December to be a particularly good time for senators and representatives to begin their legislative sessions.” The Supreme Court, too, eventually followed the same pattern—with its term beginning on the first Monday in January as of 1827; and the first Monday in December as of 1844 (where it remained until 1873). In other words, the First Monday in December used to mark the beginning of the work year for official Washington—with the business at hand usually (albeit not always) wrapped up by the end of June, if not sooner. Even back then, it seems, no one wanted to spend their summers in the District of Columbia.

Former Select Board member Terri Ackerman says Immigration and Customs Enforcement flights raise key questions for Hanscom Field administrators.

She hopes authorities embrace a possible legal answer.

“Don’t they want to protect against human trafficking?” she asked in a recent Concord Bridge interview, flagging fears about due process violations and unsafe conditions. “Don’t they want to have safety protocols so nobody dies on the plane?”

An ICE spokesperson confirmed the agency resumed using Hanscom in September to shuttle detainees around the country.

As human rights advocates ramp up pressure, New Hampshire-based lawyer Megan Chapman has offered to discuss options under the constitutional “Anti-Commandeering Doctrine” to at least extract detainee protections.

“It has to be carefully crafted, but there are ways states, state agencies, [and] state subdivisions can stand up and assert their independent sovereignty,” she told the Hanscom Field Advisory Commission.

Massport spokesperson Jennifer Mehigan told The Bridge in a statement that the agency “is open to any and all suggestions,” but “our understanding is” that a federal court rejected this argument under similar circumstances.

Facing related transparency demands, one leader recently doubled down on claims that Massport wasn’t being notified when ICE used its runways. Newly released emails show that wasn’t entirely true.

Email disclosures

ICE staff won’t share specifics about their Hanscom presence.

Airport advisors asked Massport for ICE flight data. Hanscom Director Christopher Willenborg responded with a letter saying, in part, that officials “do not receive advance notification.”

An advocate tested this with a public records request and received a September 5 exchange between Willenborg and a representative for Signature Aviation, an airfield service provider.

Signature’s Hanscom general manager, Tony Caruso, told Willenborg that “ICE charter flights” were set for “this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon,” according to a copy of the emails that was shared with The Bridge.

Willenborg asked Caruso to call him.

The advocate who obtained Caruso’s emails asked to remain anonymous. The Lexington Observer first reported the content of the conversation.

Ackerman, who represents Concord on the Hanscom advisory panel, said the contradiction between the emails and Willenborg’s letter to the group “speaks for itself.”

Mehigan said this was the only email chain related to ICE flights at Hanscom in the two years covered under the advocate’s request.

Signature is one of three Hanscom “fixed base operators.” FBOs provide services such as hangar space and, in some cases, refueling.

Mehigan said Massport “has no direct involvement in the scheduling or operations of these flights” and they’re “managed exclusively by the fixed base operators.”

Refueling-hazard questions

Willenborg referred the advisory commission to ICE for flight data. On November 18, members peppered an ICE representative with additional questions.

HFAC Chair Margaret Coppe asked whether agents leave shackled detainees in their seats while crews refuel planes.

“What if, God forbid, there were some sort of accident during the refueling?” she said.

Chris Celozzi, an ICE Boston public affairs representative, said he couldn’t answer questions himself but would report back to his bosses. The Bridge contacted an ICE spokesperson after the meeting, but didn’t hear back.

Demonstrators have rallied against detainee flights and singled out Signature for allegedly supporting detainee flights.

In an unsigned statement this summer, a corporate spokesperson said Signature doesn’t release client information.

The spokesperson said Signature must “indiscriminately support flight operations” that meet applicable requirements and said the firm is focused on providing “safe, consistent, and comprehensive” support.

Not everyone opposes current federal policy or calls to bounce ICE from Hanscom.

“They’re following the federal law,” Concordian Chris Reynolds said during an early-October demonstration in Monument Square. “If the law needs to be changed, then we should change the law — not decide not to obey it.”

On the advisory commission, most panelists have condemned immigration enforcement tactics under President Donald Trump.

HFAC pressured Massport, and members now hope the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine — rooted in the 10th Amendment — will spur the quasi-public agency to stiffen its spine.

Rules and guardrails

Chapman said she and others on a pro bono legal team have been in touch with New Hampshire authorities about previous flights at Pease International Airport. She’s presented at several meetings in recent months and told the Hanscom advisory commission that she’d be “more than happy” to help Massport draft requirements for ICE.

Ackerman suggested these could include guardrails around refueling and a requirement to share information.

Chapman said rules could also include screening of each passenger to make sure ICE isn’t denying anyone due process or moving someone in violation of a court order.

These kinds of requirements have precedent, Chapman said, adding, “When those kinds of restrictions are put in place, oftentimes it means that ICE decides to stop operating through that airport.”

Chapman suggested meeting with Massport’s legal team. Hanscom Manager of Administration Amber Goodspeed said she would relay the invitation. Ackerman volunteered to be part of a meeting.

“I’m very interested to see if Massport will hear us out,” Ackerman told The Bridge. “We’re hoping that they will see the light.”",https://concordbridge.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HANSCOM-ICE-1-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 08:57:31.440498

The organization used publicly available aviation data to monitor and document flights conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, including deportation flights and domestic transfers between U.S. detention centers and deportation staging facilities.
In Colorado, 74 domestic transfer flights left in 2024, and the 2025 numbers represent a 55 percent increase.","More than 115 immigration detention flights have left Denver this year for other U.S. cities, an extraordinary number that is making it hard for immigration lawyers to help their clients and perhaps accelerating the number of deportations out of the U.S.

“The purpose of detention is so they can show up to court. It’s illegal for it to be punitive because it’s civil confinement, so it’s particularly head-scratching that someone who has a court hearing in Aurora tomorrow is transferred away,” said immigration attorney Laura Lunn. “We show up to court and a GEO (detention center) official is telling us, ‘Oh, this person isn’t here, they were transferred,’ and the judge asks, ‘Well, are they going to be brought to court?’ And the answer sometimes is ‘no’”

The surge in domestic detention flights is also seen in deportation flights to other countries.

A report by the Human Rights First organization analyzed 11 months of deportation and removal flights from various cities with detention facilities, like Aurora. The organization found that more than 1,700 removal flights reached 77 countries under the Trump administration.

That is a 79 percent increase in flights compared to the previous year during the Biden administration. Trump’s administration has also added 34 countries to the list of where people are heading.

New removal destinations this year include Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), Iran, Jordan, Mali, Sri Lanka and Morocco.

The organization used publicly available aviation data to monitor and document flights conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, including deportation flights and domestic transfers between U.S. detention centers and deportation staging facilities.

In Colorado, 74 domestic transfer flights left in 2024, and the 2025 numbers represent a 55 percent increase.

The report found that there was a record number of “third country” transfers, which means immigrants were transferred to countries they’re not from. Those transfers included non-Guatemalans to Guatemala and non-Hondurans to Honduras. There were also third-country nationals sent to Eswatini and Ghana, both African countries, the report said.

In Colorado, the 115 flights that departed from here were sent purely to other domestic destinations, though researchers found a number of those destinations, including in Arizona, Texas and Louisiana, were deportation staging areas to out-of-country locales like Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and earlier in the year, to El Salvador.

El Salvador houses the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center, a prison known for human rights abuses and torture. The ACLU of Colorado told a federal judge in April that at least 11 Venezuelans detained in Aurora’s GEO detention facility were transferred there in the early parts of 2025.

More commonly, however, the immigrants detained in Colorado were just shuffled to another detention center in another state, far away from family and their lawyers — if they had counsel, said Sari Arvey with the D.C.-based Human Rights First organization.

Arvey said being moved at a moment’s notice, sometimes days or hours before a hearing, is chaotic and unfair.

“It’s a disoriented process; people often don’t know where these flights are going, they only find out upon arrival,” Arvey said. “Tracking these flights around the United States has given us some insight into the rapid movement of people from our communities around the country.”

The federal government’s own policies say that transfers within immigration detention should only happen in “exigent” circumstances and shouldn’t take place if that immigrant has an attorney on record, said Lunn, a detention attorney for the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network.

“None of that guidance is being followed right now,” she said.

Lunn has been representing people inside detention for 14 years, and she’s never seen such frequent confusion and movement within the system as in 2025. Lunn has been the lawyer sitting at the table with a no-show client because they were moved in the middle of the night without any notification.

Brian Green, a Denver-based immigration attorney who represents people in habeas corpus lawsuits, said it’s happening more now, but there are also more people being detained now.

“It’s probably a product of both,” Green said.

Green said once someone is detained, he’s often quickly filing emergency petitions to get the person either released or at least an order for them to stay in their home state.

“I’m filing emergency lawsuits as fast as possible, and I’m trying to get the habeas before they get moved,” he said.

He said he had a West Virginia client who was moving around, and when the habeas petition was granted by a judge, ICE had to stop shifting her around detention centers.

Lunn, too, has filed emergency motions, sometimes in 30 minutes, to get clients’ planned transfers halted. Her biggest fear is that they’ll be moved to a third country, a place they’re not from and have no family or counsel.

“At this point, I’m telling clients affirmatively this is the plan of what you should do if you get word you’re getting transferred, it’s so common,” Lunn said, noting that ICE turns off phones inside the Aurora detention center when a transfer is planned so they can’t reach her, even if it’s the middle of the night. “Promptly, with my heart beating, I file something quickly with the district court to try and make sure my client stays here in Colorado.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/deportation-flight-texas-file-ap-01.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 08:57:50.447982

But that principle depends upon social confidence that our asylum system is fair, effective and humane.
Since it has long been impossible to travel to the UK lawfully with a view to claiming asylum, arrivals can mean only one thing – boat arrivals.
And now the final action point... A new asylum system – fair or manageable?
People with a British partner or child do not take a dangerous boat trip to claim asylum.","On 21 November 2025 the government published a new policy paper, Restoring Order and Control: A Statement on the government's asylum and returns policy, described as ""perhaps the most substantial reform to the UK's asylum system in a generation"".

In the Foreword to the Statement, the Prime Minister goes out of his way to proclaim his (Labour's) unwavering commitment to fairness, compassion and humanity in the treatment of refugees: ""The principle that people genuinely fleeing danger and persecution should be welcomed is one this government will always defend – an expression of the UK's values in action. But that principle depends upon social confidence that our asylum system is fair, effective and humane. This statement shows how a reformed asylum system, that deters arrivals and speeds up the removals of those with no legal right to be here, can deliver that confidence in a dangerous world.""

By a coincidence, or a subconscious nudge, I happened to wash the Statement down with Casablanca, a 1942 film by Michael Curtiz, set in Vichy controlled Casablanca in 1942. It sends shivers down the spine to think that most of the actors in this film were refugees from the Nazis. It's a perfect foil to the current crisis, and it helps to take the Statement with a pinch of salt. After all, it is all sound a fury but, unlike Casablanca, played out by second-rate thespians.

The Statement has three action points:

Reducing arrivals

Increasing removals

New rules to make the system (un)fairer for refugees and (less) manageable for authorities

Reducing arrivals

This part of the Statement must refer to small boat arrivals, not arrivals by plane or Eurostar. Since it has long been impossible to travel to the UK lawfully with a view to claiming asylum, arrivals can mean only one thing – boat arrivals.

The bad news is that there is not a single word in the Statement as to how to reduce boat arrivals. Promises of destitution, ill treatment, marginalisation, no recognition of human rights, quick refusal of applications, reduced rights of appeal, denial of accommodation and subsistence, all sound like thunder and fury, but unlikely to deter anyone fleeing a war or seeking adventure.

The scary part of the Statement is, of course, that ill treatment, destitution and marginalisation will become an official endorsed and authorised part of the society. The hungry, homeless, destitute and marginalised arrivals will be funnelled into shadow economy and/or ...

Here we come to the second action point.

Increasing removals

Not that before the Statement was published the official policy was to reduce removals. Not at all. If someone's visa had expired and their rights of appeal were exhausted, they have always been expected to leave. For those who could not afford a plane ticket the government has been offering assisted return. Those who absconded and went to ground have long been liable to removal without consent.

The problem is not that the laws are lax, but that for some reason enforcement action is often delayed for years and years.

Until 2012, 14 years' delay on the part of the authorities resulted in acceptance of the individual as a lawful and permanent resident. Since 2012, this rule changed and it has been 20 years' delay on the part of the authorities that resulted in recognition of an individual's claim to regularise their immigration status, with a further 10 years of lawful residence required to become permanently settled.

By taking away this highly remote possibility of being accepted within the legal system, the government doesn't support the declared commitment to increase removals. On the contrary, the marginalised and destitute will remain so forever, or at least until the authorities finally decide to remove them, be it after 20, 30, 40 or 60 years. Moreover, their children and possibly grandchildren will be in the same boat, so to speak.

We can pause for a moment when it comes to children. The Statement contains some chilling remarks to the effect that parents exploit the fact that they have children who came with them on a dangerous trip, to thwart removal from the UK. The missing part to this, is that the child is only considered to have put down roots in the UK if they have lived in the UK for 7 years and it is not reasonable to expect them to leave!

There is still a rule allowing registration of children born in the UK as British citizens (provided their parents don't forget to do so before the child turns 18!). There are also rules allowing regularisation of status of young adults (under 25) who have spent more than half of their life in the UK. (Young adults have to think about it before they turn 25!)

We don't yet know whether children and young adults will be left with some options, or these options will also be taken away to deter the parents from hoping for a brighter future for the kids. The logic and fierce zeal of the Statement suggests that sooner or later the children will also go to the infernal nooks of the shadow economy.

And now the final action point...

A new asylum system – fair or manageable?

Instead of grant of asylum for 5 years with a review at the end of the 5-year period and subsequent grant of permanent right of residence, refugees will have to repeatedly claim asylum every 2.5 years for a 20-year period, before they can qualify for permanent status.

No right to family reunion – meaning a refugee who has made it to the UK and has been recognised as a person in need of protection will not be allowed to invite spouse and children to join them.

No legal obligation to provide support for destitute asylum seekers

Expropriation of assets with the exception of wedding rings

No financial support for those who have the right to work. You will see the irony of this proposition if you realise that right to work is only granted to those whose claim has not been decided for 12 months and only in extremely limited occupations listed in the Immigration Salary List. Examples include: social and humanities scientist, biological or chemical scientists, graphic designers, classical ballet dancers and choreographers, orchestral musicians who are leaders, principals or numbered string positions in internationally recognised UK orchestras. Further options include racing grooms and stallion handlers, nursing auxiliaries and assistants, as well as carpenters, roofers and bricklayers. You can almost hear the piteous personal entreaty. If you know a decent carpenter, please let me know!

A new appeals body to be created. The Statement refers to it an independent body with professionally trained adjudicators. It remains to be seen if the independent bodies will not simply be part of the Home Office. There will be no right of appeal from their adjudication and no judicial control over legality of their decisions.

Denying appeal rights for clearly unmeritorious claims – there is not much new in this. As it is claims certified as manifestly unfounded can only be appealed from outside the UK.

Review of Article 8 balancing exercise which weighs public interest against the right to protection of family life for individual families.It may be appropriate at this point to clarify that Article 8 is not, and has never been, a basis for claiming asylum.

As mentioned above, since 2012, the right to private life protected under Article 8 ECHR only applies in immigration context if the person has lived in the UK for a continuous period of 20 years. The right to protection of family life applies where there is a British or settled partner and/or a British or settled child. People with a British partner or child do not take a dangerous boat trip to claim asylum. They make an application for a visa as a partner or parent.

A quick glance on the role of Article 8 in family immigration.

The Immigration Rules provide that only insurmountable obstacles to living with British partner outside they UK would justify waiver of the financial requirements for the partner visa. Where the financial requirements can be met but not through the specified sources of income, the requirement can be waived only if the refusal could result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their partner or child. Where the refusal would clearly result in unjustifiably harsh consequences, the decision-maker must exercise discretion. The only other exception applies where refusal of permission to stay would break a relationship between parent and child settled in the UK.

In summary

There is much less news in the ""most substantial reform"" than the government would like to make it sound. Denial of financial support to destitute asylum seekers and expropriation of assets from people arriving in small boats sounds macabre, but it's hardly promising in terms of restoring order or control. The statement, like life itself, is full of sound and fury signifying nothing.

Any major policy change naturally attracts national attention. The proposed Bill C- 12 immigration amendments have become one of the most talked-about developments this year, mainly because of the wide range of concerns raised across the country.

Refugee advocates, legal experts, settlement workers, and community groups have voiced worries that the bill could affect the rights of vulnerable individuals. With a final parliamentary vote approaching, many Canadians want clarity. This blog breaks down what the bill contains, why it has sparked debate and what this means for newcomers and refugees planning their future in Canada.

Why Bill C-12 Immigration Reform Matters Right Now

The conversation around Bill C-12 immigration reform began because several groups believe the proposed changes could influence safety, due process, and access to protection. The bill affects the refugee determination process, information sharing practices, and the government’s authority to review or suspend immigration documents.

Instead of increasing efficiency, groups fear that the policy may create more obstacles and greater risks, especially for individuals escaping dangerous conditions. At the heart of the concern lies one core message: any shift in immigration laws must protect the rights of people who look to Canada for safety.

Key Issues Raised by Refugee and Human Rights Groups

To help readers understand the situation more clearly, here are the major themes raised across Canada:

1. Limited Access to Fair Refugee Hearings

Many organizations worry that the bill introduces shorter timelines and restricted appeal opportunities. These changes may prevent refugee claimants from presenting complete evidence, especially those recovering from trauma or fleeing recent threats.

Legal experts caution that reduced appeal pathways can lead to higher refusal rates and more cases being pushed toward federal courts, increasing delays rather than reducing them.

2. Impact on People Affected by the Safe Third Country Agreement

Canada’s agreement with the United States already limits access for many refugees. Concerns are rising that the bill could intensify these challenges, sending more individuals back to the U.S. system, where human rights groups have documented serious problems.

For newcomers who rely on Canada’s fair and transparent processes, this sparks fear of being denied protection even in situations involving real risk.

3. Increased Government Power Without Clear Safeguards

Bill C -12 grants authorities the ability to suspend or cancel immigration documents based on broad public interest reasons. Critics argue that the bill does not define these reasons clearly enough.

The lack of safeguards could create unfair outcomes, especially for people with ongoing claims or those waiting for decisions.

4. Concerns About Sharing Sensitive Personal Information

Another major issue is the sharing of private immigration details with various agencies. This includes information about gender identity or refugee claim status, which could expose individuals to discrimination or harm.

Advocacy groups believe that stronger privacy protections are essential to keep vulnerable individuals safe.

5. Broader Social Effects Linked to Drug Policy Provisions

A portion of the bill ties immigration rules to drug enforcement measures. Public health organizations argue that this method has not improved safety in the past. Instead, they recommend investing in social supports and housing to create healthier communities.

Why These Concerns Matter to Canadians

Canada has always taken pride in being a safe and welcoming destination for people seeking a new beginning. For decades, the country has provided protection to families escaping danger and offered a structured pathway to rebuild their lives. Any policy that risks reducing fairness or safety deserves careful review. This is why so many Canadian organizations have called for more debate, more hearings, and more public input before the bill moves forward.

Across Canada, people want clarity on how the bill will be implemented, who will be affected, and what protections will remain in place.

What Newcomers Should Expect in the Coming Weeks

Since parliamentary review is still underway, nothing is finalized yet. However, based on what has been shared publicly:

More debates are expected before the final decision.

Community organizations continue to request amendments.

Additional details from the government may be released soon.

For anyone currently in Canada or planning to apply, it is important to stay updated and rely on verified immigration news sources.

United Nations human rights experts have highlighted “widespread and systematic” exploitation, deception, and deepening debt bondage of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia.

Over 800,000 Bangladeshis have Malaysian work permits, making them the largest group of documented foreign workers in the country. According to information received by the UN, thousands of workers are stranded in Bangladesh or face exploitation in Malaysia after some paid recruitment fees five times higher than the official rate.

Other abuses, including confiscation of passports by Malaysian employers, false job promises, discrepancies between contracts and promised employment packages, and a lack of support from responsible government agencies, are common in Malaysia.

Workers without proper documentation are at risk of arrest, detention, ill-treatment, and deportation under Malaysia’s draconian immigration act, which criminalizes irregular entry, and other anti-migrant policies. Malaysian authorities conduct frequent immigration raids and hold an estimated 18,000 migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in immigration detention centers…

The Bangladeshi and Malaysian governments, as well as those of other labor-sending or receiving countries and those where buying companies are headquartered such as the US, EU members, and the United Kingdom, have obligations to ensure labor migration is conducted in a way that protects workers’ rights. Malaysia and labor-sending governments like Bangladesh should implement the UN experts’ call to promptly investigate reported abuses and provide effective remedies.

“A lot of scandals may not have the impact that they once had because people are in these silos or echo chambers,” said Scott Basinger, a University of Houston political scientist who’s extensively studied the nature of political scandal.","A few weeks ago, Katie Porter’s campaign for California governor was reeling. A day after an irritable TV interview went viral, an old video surfaced of the former Orange County congresswoman cursing and berating one of her aides.

Around the same time, the race for U.S. Senate in Maine was shaken by a number of disturbing online posts. In them, Democratic hopeful Graham Platner disparaged police and Black people, among other crude remarks. Soon after, it was revealed Platner had a chest tattoo resembling a Nazi symbol.

Meanwhile, in Virginia, several old text messages swallowed attorney general nominee Jay Jones in a cumulus of controversy. The Democrat had joked about shooting the Republican leader of the state House and blithely spoken of watching his children die in their mother’s arms.

Once — say, 20 or 30 years ago — those blow-ups might have been enough to chase each of those embattled candidates from their respective races, and maybe even end their political careers altogether.

But in California, Porter has pressed on and remains in the top tier of the crowded gubernatorial field. In Maine, Platner continues to draw large, enthusiastic crowds and leads polling in the Democratic primary. In Virginia, Jones was just elected attorney general, defeating his Republican opponent by a comfortable margin.

Clearly, things have changed.

Actions that once caused eyes to widen, such as the recreational puffs of marijuana that cost appeals court judge Douglas Ginsburg a Supreme Court seat under President Reagan, now seem quaint. Personal indiscretions once seen as disqualifying, such as the extramarital affair that chased Gary Hart from the 1988 presidential race, scarcely raise an eyebrow.

And the old political playbook — confession, contrition, capitulation — is obviously no longer operative, as candidates find it not only possible but even advantageous to brazen their way through storms of uproar and opprobrium.

Look no further than the extravagantly checkered occupant of the White House. Donald Trump has seemingly survived more controversies — not to mention two impeachments, an $83.3-million judgment in a sexual abuse and defamation case and conviction on 34 felony counts — than there are stars winking in the nighttime sky.

Bill Carrick has spent decades strategizing for Democratic office-seekers. A generation or so ago, if faced with a serious scandal, he would have told his candidate, “This is not going to be sustainable and you just better get out.” But now, Carrick said, “I would be very reluctant to tell somebody that, unless there was evidence they had murdered or kidnapped somebody, or robbed a bank.”

Kevin Madden, a veteran Republican communications strategist, agreed. Surrender has become passe. Survival is the new fallback mode.

“The one thing that many politicians of both parties have learned is that there is an opportunity to grind it out, to ride the storm out,” Madden said. “If you think a news issue is going viral or becoming the topic everyone’s talking about, just wait. A new scandal ... or a new shiny object will be along.”

One reason for the changing nature of political scandal, and its prognosis, is the way we now take in information, both selectively and in bulk.

With the chance to personally curate their news feed — and reinforce their attitude and outlook — people can select those things they wish to know about, and choose those they care to ignore. With such fragmentation, it’s much harder for a negative storyline to reach critical mass. That requires a mass audience.

“A lot of scandals may not have the impact that they once had because people are in these silos or echo chambers,” said Scott Basinger, a University of Houston political scientist who’s extensively studied the nature of political scandal. “They may not even hear about it, if they don’t want to hear about it.”

The sheer velocity of information — “not only delivered to you on your doorstep, or at 6:30 p.m. by the three networks, but also in your pocket, in your hand at all times, across multiple platforms,” as Madden put it — also makes events more fleeting. That makes it harder for any one to penetrate deeply or resonate widely.

“In a world where there’s a wealth of information,” he said, “there’s a poverty of attention.”

Seven months after abruptly dropping out of the 1988 presidential race, Hart jumped back into the contest. “Let’s let the people decide,” he said, after confessing his marital sins.

(He also said in the same interview, a few months before relaunching his candidacy, that he had no intention of doing so.)

Hart did not fare well. Once he’d been the overwhelming front-runner for the Democratic nomination. As a reincarnated candidate, he trudged on for a few months before dropping out for good, having failed to secure a single convention delegate or win double-digit support in any contest.

“The people have decided,” he said, “and now I should not go forward.”

That’s how it should be.

Porter in California and Platner in Maine both faced calls to drop out of their respective races, with critics questioning their conduct and whether they had the right temperament to serve, respectively, as California governor or a U.S. senator. Each has expressed contrition for their actions. (As did Jones, Virginia’s attorney general-elect.)

Voters can take all that into account when they pick their candidate.

If they want a governor who drops f-bombs and snaps at aides, a senator with a history of off-putting remarks or — gulp — an adulterous convicted felon in the White House, that’s their choice.

“While we know that this news might cause alarm, we have no sense that ICE is planning the kind of activity that we saw Border Patrol do,” said Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena in a Sunday call with reporters. “The report that we got is that 50 additional agents were going to be deployed to North Carolina for activity starting December 1st.”

The grassroots immigrants rights organization has also had reports that ICE has reserved the same charter flights between Charlotte and Florida’s Jacksonville International Airport as they did last week, scheduled from Dec. 2 to Dec. 6.

Many naturalized U.S. citizens and green card holders have started to carry their passports just to go grocery shopping.

“My own parents are naturalized U.S. citizens, and we had to talk about what would happen, what they should do, were they stopped by a border patrol agent,” Marín Baena said.

She believes the anticipated ICE’s operation in Raleigh comes as the result of remarks made by North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall. Last week, Hall told The News & Observer that ICE and the border patrol were doing important work.

“It looks like they’re doing a pretty good job at it right now. And so, we don’t have much to ask, other than to come back,” Hall said.

Home Builders Association, Duke Energy and Lowe’s Home Improvement,” said Marín Baena. “We are inviting people to write letters and create illustrated cards to Speaker Hall’s top campaign contributors, specifically explaining why children and their parents should not have to live in fear.”

For business owners who have closed because employees are sheltering in place, Siembra NC is inviting people to post placards explaining that they’re closed “Courtesy of Speaker Destin Hall.”

The organization has also suggested that immigrant workers who miss work because they are sheltering in place can send a “Destin Hall Pass” to their employer.

Hall said on social media that he supports the enforcement action and that Gov. Joh Stein should be “more concerned about the safety of our citizens than protecting criminal illegal aliens.” Hall also faulted Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden for blocking previous ICE detainers and putting undocumented immigrants back onto the streets.

“They’re stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city,” Hall said in a Nov. 17 post on X expressing support for the Border Patrol.

Over the holiday weekend, Homeland Security officials pivoted to focus on the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump announced on Thanksgiving that he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”

The five-day crackdown by Border Patrol in North Carolina resulted in 370 arrests.

Marín Baena said Sunday that many of those detained could eventually see charges dismissed.

“And we actually don’t know, of those 370 people, how many they’ve already had to let go because they were actually U.S. citizens or green card holders and how many they will have to let go because we’ve documented that they were unconstitutional arrests,” she said.

Marín Baena said she hopes that ICE’s plans change and it does not resume indiscriminate arrests in North Carolina in December. But if they do return, she says immigrant advocates are prepared.

“Thousands of people across the state of North Carolina have received training to get their neighbors safely to school, safely to work. And so, we are a little bit more prepared at this moment in time.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251116_no-ice-rally_che-1024x7101764549061.jpg?h=208a1168&itok=k-V_R8BZ,N,,2025-12-01 03:56:27.503580

The visit comes at a critical juncture, as governments across the country pursue ‘tough on crime’ reform to bail and youth justice laws that experts warn will disproportionately impact First Nations people – including children. Most recently, the Allan Government in Victoria introduced the Adult Time for Violent Crime Bill which will mean that children as young as 14 could be locked away for life and will remove the principle that prison for children is the ‘last resort’.

The visit also coincides with the Albanese Government’s attempts to re-detain migrants and refugees previously held in arbitrary immigration detention, the banning of mobile phones in immigration detention and the expansion of Australia’s offshore warehousing regime. Almost 100 people are trapped in Nauru under offshore processing arrangements and 37 people have been abandoned in Papua New Guinea.

Under a new secret offshore deportation deal, at least five refugees living in the Australian community have been permanently exiled to Nauru, with hundreds of further deportations threatened by the Albanese government. Uncertainty also remains for the 800 people previously subjected to Australia’s offshore processing regime who have now built homes in Australia, but remain in limbo on temporary visas.

The Working Group will meet with representatives of government, civil society and people who have experienced detention or incarceration to assess Australia’s compliance with human rights standards in its treatment of people in custody, and to document cases of arbitrary detention.

The Working Group will deliver its preliminary findings at the end of its visit on 12 December 2025 and will present a full report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

This visit to Australia provides a crucial opportunity for governments across the country to be held accountable for laws and policies that harm people and communities.

Maggie Munn, Director, First Nations Justice at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“The Working Group’s visit to Australia comes at a critical time, with governments across this country funnelling children and adults into prisons and places of detention in unjust and unbearable conditions.

“First Nations children belong in playgrounds and with their families and communities. Instead, we see them pipelined into the criminal legal system as young as 10 years old, and subject to inhumane conditions like prolonged solitary confinement, strip searching, and spit hoods. The Working Group’s visit is an opportunity to hold governments accountable to international human rights standards and ensure that all children are safe and thriving.”

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Migration Justice at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, fuelled by unfair laws and policies that deprive marginalised people of their liberty,. Migrants and refugees are facing extended periods in immigration detention and are increasingly criminalised through punitive surveillance measures that extend detention into the community.

The Trump administration was sued in federal court over the program’s suspension and its revocation of congressionally approved resettlement funds.","The Trump administration plans to review and possibly revoke the legal status of refugees resettled in the U.S. during Joe Biden’s presidency.

The order affects more than 200,000 refugees who entered the country legally between Jan. 20, 2021, and Feb. 20, 2025, according to a federal memo reviewed by Reuters.

The document signed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joe Edlow also freezes the processing of permanent residence applications filed by refugees during the previous administration.

“The USCIS memo, dated November 21, said the agency will terminate the refugee status of people already in the U.S. if they are found to not meet refugee criteria,” Reuters reported. “The memo claims the Biden administration potentially prioritized expediency, quantity and admissions over quality interviews and detailed screening and vetting.”

President Donald Trump has taken aggressive measures to end the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program — one of the most secure and highly vetted process for immigrants to come to the United States. His Jan. 20 order, “Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program,” cast refugee resettlement as a threat to national security and contrary to the interests of the nation. He later announced a record-low refugee cap of 7,500 for the current fiscal year and said it would be reserved mostly for white South Africans.

By comparison, refugee limits under Biden reached 125,000 per year from 2022 to 2025. Caps were set much higher in previous years, including more than 220,000 during the Reagan administration.

The Trump administration was sued in federal court over the program’s suspension and its revocation of congressionally approved resettlement funds. A district judge ordered the admission of previously cleared refugees. The litigation, Pacito v. Trump, remains under appeal before the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.

However, the new USCIS memo refers to the president’s executive order freezing admissions due to the nation’s inability to “absorb large numbers of migrants,” according to Reuters.

Refugee advocates teed off on the administration’s intention to review the cases of resettled immigrants, pointing to the years of rigorous background checks and in-person interviews they underwent to be granted admission.

“To relitigate cases that have already met the demanding security standards of our refugee program is a dramatic reversal of long-standing practice,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge. “Moreover, a review of this scale would divert scarce government resources toward duplicative work, rather than efforts that genuinely strengthen our nation’s security and humanitarian leadership.”

The process also would severely traumatize individuals who escaped severe hardship and oppression in their home countries, she said.

“The administration is attempting to change what it means to be American by targeting who gets to belong.”

“This unprecedented decision introduces profound uncertainty into the lives of families who have endured and legally demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution. It risks destabilizing families who have been rebuilding their lives here, working in our communities, sending their children to school, and contributing to the country they now call home.”

Refugees should receive protection instead of further punishment from the U.S. government, added Uzra Zeya, president of Human Rights First.

“Far from being necessary, these purported ‘reviews’ and ‘re-interviews’ are a pretext for the administration’s broader unjust and discriminatory objectives,” she said. “It is abundantly clear that this policy’s impact and its ultimate goal are to deport immigrants from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East who have legal status in the United States and prevent them from becoming citizens.”

The action will destabilize families and American due process, she added. “The administration is attempting to change what it means to be American by targeting who gets to belong. The administration has hijacked the refugee resettlement capacities of the U.S. government to try to deny protection to actual refugees while misusing them to facilitate the migration of white Afrikaners.”

Church World Service condemned the directive as “cruel, illegal and massively wasteful.”

“This administration’s disdain for refugees and newcomers is well-documented, yet it continues to find new ways to outdo itself,” said CWS President Rick Santos. “The decision to review and re-interview resettled refugees — who have already passed through the most stringent of vetting processes — is not merely a re-litigation, but a retraumatizing of individuals who were assured of their safety and a chance to live free of persecution.”

The proclamation came just one day after the protest against US Immigration & Customs Enforcement agents got out of hand, with cops caught in the middle — and protesters now vowing to keep doing it.

“We do not apologize for standing up,” city Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said at a press conference with members of the New York Immigration Coalition, one day after more than 150 protesters battled with cops outside an ICE deployment center.

“We’ll do it every single time,” Williams vowed.

Police said Sunday that “multiple individuals were taken into custody” at the out-of-control demonstration outside the US General Services Administration building on Centre Street before noon Saturday that saw police officers called in, only to be bombarded with trash and debris.

Cops would not provide more details nor reveal how many were charged, but said cops repeatedly warned the mob to move along, leading to confrontations between the two sides when they refused.

Sources said at least 18 of the demonstrators were charged.

Protesters, who descended upon the city over the weekend, converged on a Lower Manhattan parking garage where federal immigration agents were allegedly ready to deploy for an immigration round-up raid, law enforcement sources said.

On Sunday, advocates called the ongoing raids “horrifying and idiotic.”

“Our neighbors, New Yorkers of every stripe, mobilized, took time out of their day to come here and defend their neighbors to make sure that people were not disappeared, that families were not separated, and stood here for hours,” coalition president and CEO Murad Awawdeh told reporters.

Another pol at the presser was outgoing city Comptroller Brad Lander, who took issue with the NYPD, claiming they “facilitated ICE deportations.

“I really do want to ask the NYPD to remember who you’re sworn to protect and serve, and it’s the people of New York City,” Lander said.

“And yesterday, the people who were protecting and serving New Yorkers were the protesters who showed up.”

However, law enforcement sources told The Post that NYPD brass was less than pleased with New York’s Finest getting caught in the middle of the raucous riot — without a heads-up from the feds.

NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch allegedly gave the feds a tongue-lashing over the Saturday melee, which saw cops pelted with debris when they tried to step in to protect the ICE agents, sources said.

Tisch has agreed to stay on when Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a frequent critic of federal immigration policies under President Trump, takes office after his election victory earlier this month.

Federal authorities have also had to navigate New York’s status as a sanctuary city and policy of not working with ICE on civil arrests and deportations — which runs counter to the Trump administration’s campaign to launch immigration raids throughout the country since taking office.

Meanwhile, immigrant advocates said they’re not going to let up while the raids continue.

I hope everyone had a happy Thanksgiving, as well as a restful and enjoyable long weekend. We spent quality time with both my family and Zach’s family, across three states—Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York—and, of course, we ate too much.

Unfortunately—but unsurprisingly, given the time of year—various family members were under the weather at various points in time. They included our two-year-old son, Chase—who started “school” (read: day care) earlier this month, then came down with some bug three days later. Public service announcement (if you share my belief that vaccines are good): get your flu and Covid shots, if you haven’t already.

Now, on to the news.

Lawyer of the Week: Peter Skandalakis.

On Wednesday, Judge Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court dismissed the Georgia state prosecution of Donald Trump, which accused Trump and a slew of co-defendants of election interference and other offenses arising out of the 2020 presidential election. But credit or blame for the dismissal shouldn’t be given to Judge McAfee; he was merely granting the state’s motion to dismiss the case.

Who filed that motion? As I mentioned earlier this month, Peter Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, was responsible for finding a district attorney to take over the Georgia case from the disqualified Fani Willis. After asking (and getting turned down by) several other prosecutors, Skandalakis took on the case himself. And on Wednesday, Pete Skandalakis filed a motion to dismiss the Trump prosecution, which Judge McAfee promptly granted.

Here are some highlights from Skandalakis’s 22-page motion:

“It is not illegal to question or challenge election results. Our nation’s foundational principles of free speech and electoral scrutiny are rooted in this very freedom. The State of Georgia is no stranger to such challenges. In 2018, Ms. Stacy [sic] Abrams questioned the legitimacy of Brian Kemp’s victory in the gubernatorial race. Likewise, in 2020, many Republicans struggled to accept the reality that President Donald J. Trump did not win the popular vote in Georgia or in other key states and therefore lost the presidential race.”

“While the call [in which Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ‘find’ enough votes to change the election outcome] is concerning, reasonable minds could differ as to how to interpret the call. One interpretation is that Trump, without explicitly stating it, is instructing the Secretary of State to fictitiously or fraudulently produce enough votes to secure a victory in Georgia. An alternative interpretation is that Trump, genuinely believing fraud had occurred, is asking the Secretary of State to investigate and determine whether sufficient irregularities exist to change the election outcome. When multiple interpretations are equally plausible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and should not be presumed to have acted criminally.”

“Given the complexity of the legal issues at hand—ranging from constitutional questions and the Supremacy Clause to immunity, jurisdiction, venue, speedy-trial concerns, and access to federal records—and even assuming each of these issues were resolved in the State’s favor, bringing this case before a jury in 2029, 2030, or even 2031 [i.e., after Trump leaves office] would be nothing short of a remarkable feat.”

Not surprisingly, reactions to the dismissal were all over the map—and strongly tracked people’s political views. Readers, what do you think?

Other lawyers in the news:

FBI Director Kash Patel is facing scrutiny for reportedly using FBI SWAT teams to protect his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins.

Erez Reuveni—who worked at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for almost 15 years, before departing amid controversy and then becoming a whistleblower—joined Democracy Forward, the progressive legal advocacy group that’s “working to become the nerve center of the legal opposition to Trump,” in the words of Ankush Khardori of Politico.

One of Biglaw’s longest-tenured leaders, Jami McKeon—who has led Morgan Lewis since 2014—will step down as chair of the firm in September 2026, when her current term expires.

It’s not just Biglaw partners and federal judges: now state prosecutors in California are allegedly filing briefs filled with AI-generated errors, according to defense lawyers who claim to have received briefs with hallucinated citations.

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani added several lawyers to his transition team, including Legal Aid Society CEO Twyla Carter (my former podcast guest); Julissa Reynoso, former U.S. ambassador to Spain and current Winston & Strawn partner; and veteran election lawyer Jerry Goldfeder.

Judge of the Week: Judge Cameron Currie.

Judges have rejected the Trump administration’s attempts to install U.S. attorneys in multiple districts, including New Jersey, Nevada, and the Central District of California. But Judge Cameron McGowan Currie went a step further than these judges: in addition to holding that Interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan (E.D. Va.) was not validly appointed—i.e., “Ms. Halligan’s appointment violated 28 U.S.C. § 546 and the Appointments Clause” of the Constitution—Judge Currie dismissed two criminal cases as a result. And these weren’t run-of-the-mill cases: Judge Currie tossed the high-profile prosecutions of two Trump adversaries, former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia “Tish” James.

On whether Halligan was validly appointed, the reasoning of Judge Currie’s decisions in United States v. Comey and United States v. James was unsurprising—consistent with that of the other judges who have tackled this topic. On remedy—i.e., whether the cases could continue without Halligan’s involvement or had to be dismissed—Judge Currie held that they had to be dismissed. As folks familiar with the Supreme Court’s Appointments Clause jurisprudence will recall, the standard remedy in situations where an official hasn’t been validly appointed is to set aside the actions of said official (because they lacked the authority to act in the first place).

In other cases challenging the appointments of Trump U.S. attorneys, additional prosecutors with legitimate appointments were involved in the proceedings, and their involvement was able to protect the prosecutions from dismissal. But in Comey and James, Halligan “appeared alone in front of the grand juries that returned indictments and was the sole prosecutor to have formally signed the charging documents,” per The New York Times—and so this argument was unavailable to the government.

Judge Currie also rejected the administration’s claim that Attorney General Pam Bondi “ratified” Halligan’s actions after the fact. According to Currie, allowing such ratification “would mean the Government could send any private citizen off the street—attorney or not—into the grand jury room to secure an indictment, so long as the Attorney General gives her approval after the fact. That cannot be the law.”

Judge Currie dismissed the Comey and James cases without prejudice, which would allow the government to charge the defendants again. Comey’s lawyers argue that the case can’t be refiled, since the statute of limitations has run on his alleged offenses (he was indicted right before the statute was going to run). But this isn’t entirely clear: a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3288, might give the Trump administration a grace period for refiling (per Sarah Isgur and David French of Advisory Opinions).

What’s next? Attorney General Bondi declared that the DOJ would take “all available legal action, including an immediate appeal”—and I could see this issue eventually making its way to SCOTUS, given that district and circuit courts across the country are currently grappling with messy or questionable prosecutorial appointments.

In addition to attacking the ruling, the Trump administration criticized Judge Currie, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt condemning Currie as a “partisan” judge who was “clearly trying to shield” Comey and James. But Judge Currie, a 1994 Clinton appointee to the District of South Carolina, doesn’t have a partisan record. Even though she’s been on the bench for more than 30 years, this appears to be the most newsworthy and politically charged matter she’s ever handled.

By the way, why is a South Carolina judge ruling in a case out of the Eastern District of Virginia? Because the issue before the court was the validity of the appointment of the U.S. attorney for the E.D. Va., it was sent to a judge outside that district, to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest. According to Judge Currie’s opinion, if Halligan wasn’t validly appointed, the power to appoint an interim U.S. attorney would belong to the judges of the E.D. Va., under 28 U.S.C. § 546 (although the judges of that district haven’t moved since last week’s ruling to appoint anyone).

In other news about judges and the judiciary:

Chief Judge William Pryor (11th Cir.) has had a busy month. On November 14, he delivered the Rice-Hasson Distinguished Lecture at Notre Dame Law School, focusing his remarks on “The Judicial Oath and the Judgment of History.” And this past Wednesday, the noted conservative jurist issued a unanimous ruling against Donald Trump (discussed below under Ruling of the Week)—which he was willing to put his name on, instead of having it issued per curiam (as most circuit courts have done when ruling against Trump personally).

Could Judge Aileen Cannon (S.D. Fla.), who (in)famously handled major civil and criminal cases involving Donald Trump, end up overseeing yet another Trump-centric matter? The Trump administration might be angling for that, with U.S. Attorney Jason Reding Quiñones (S.D. Fla.) using a grand jury at the federal courthouse in Fort Pierce—where Judge Cannon is the only judge—to investigate aspects of the Russia investigation that targeted Trump.

Thanks, but no thanks: Chief Judge James “Jeb” Boasberg (D.D.C.) and Judge Deborah Boardman (D. Md.) declined invitations to appear at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing addressing the topic of impeaching “rogue” judges.

Speaking of jurists offering testimony, Judge Emil Bove (3d Cir.) might have to be a witness in Chief Judge Boasberg’s pending contempt inquiry, examining whether the DOJ defied an order of his in a high-profile immigration case.

Should decisions on the Supreme Court’s interim docket be treated as precedential? In an interesting article for the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, Judge Trevor McFadden (D.D.C.) and Associate Deputy Attorney General Vetan Kapoor argue that these rulings should be treated as binding, if they “grant emergency relief and include a majority opinion explaining the reasons for doing so.” (For discussion of the piece from Sarah Isgur and Adam White, check out Advisory Opinions.)

Judge William Ross Mitchell of Uvalde County, Texas, was suspended without pay, after he was indicted on a misdemeanor charge of “official oppression”—i.e., abuse of his authority as a public official—arising out of a dispute with a UPS driver trying to deliver packages at the courthouse.

Opinion. During last year’s Idaho election, a Republican state senator lost his composure when a candidate forum turned to the topic of racism.

Trish Carter-Goodheart, a Democratic candidate and citizen of the Nez Perce Tribe, spoke plainly: Racism and discrimination remain real and persistent in Idaho, pointing to the state’s history of white supremacist enclaves in northern Idaho.

The senator denied any racism existed. When the conversation hit a nerve, he abruptly stormed out, shouting to Carter-Goodheart, “Why don’t you go back to where you came from?”

It was a textbook case of mistaken identity. Carter-Goodheart's ancestors have called this land home for thousands of years.

I know this experience personally. Over the years, I’ve been mistaken for Hispanic. My late mother and several of my aunties shared similar stories — people assuming they spoke Spanish or belonged to another group.

For Native Americans, being questioned about who we are is nothing new. But today, that confusion has become dangerous. With U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operating as though anyone with darker skin is fair game for detention, mistaken identity has become a threat.

Native Americans — whose ancestors were the first inhabitants of this land — are being stopped by masked ICE agents across the country. Why? Because some agents see darker-skinned individuals as potential undocumented immigrants based solely on appearance.

It’s an assault on identity, on tribal sovereignty, and on basic human dignity.

Our most-read article on Native News Online this week involved Native American actress Elaine Miles, who was detained by four ICE agents while walking to a bus stop in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle.

Best known for her role as Marilyn Whirlwind in the television series Northern Exposure and in films such as Smoke Signals and The Business of Fancydancing, Miles is a card-carrying member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation.

According to what she shared with The Seattle Times, she did exactly what any citizen should do — she presented her federally recognized tribal ID when ICE agents demanded identification.

That should have been the end of it.

For those of us who are citizens of federally recognized tribes, a tribal ID is our primary form of identification. I have used mine to get past TSA agents at airports. Miles has used hers to cross international borders. Federal agencies accept it. Yet one of the agents told her the card was “fake.” Another said, “Anyone can make that.”

Miles said both her son and her uncle were previously detained by ICE agents who initially refused to accept their tribal IDs before eventually releasing them.

“What we’re talking about here is racial profiling,” Seattle-based Indigenous rights attorney Gabriel Galanda, who is not representing Miles, told The Seattle Times. “People are getting pulled over or detained on the street because of the dark color of their skin.”

In another story Native News Online earlier this month, Salt River Pima-Maricopa tribal citizen Leticia Jacobo was jailed in a small town in Iowa.

Jacobo was booked into the Polk County Jail in Des Moines in September on a charge of driving with a suspended license. She was set to walk free on Nov. 11, but what should have been a routine release was thrown into chaos — and delayed — after jail staff flagged her with an ICE detainer that never should have existed.

Jacobo’s sister questioned authorities: “How is she going to get deported if she’s a Native American?”

Both stories reveal a disturbing pattern. Separated by hundreds of miles and different circumstances, they share the same core problem: When federal or local authorities disregard tribal identification, they disregard tribal sovereignty. And when they dismiss our sovereignty, Native people pay the price — in fear, humiliation, and unjust detention.

Native Americans should not have to worry about deportation. We should not have to fear that our children or relatives will be taken into custody because an ICE agent or jail clerk does not recognize a tribal ID. Yet here we are.

These incidents raise a larger question: What training — if any — do ICE agents, local jail staff, and law enforcement officers receive regarding tribal sovereignty and Native citizenship? Tribal IDs are recognized by the federal government. Tribal nations are sovereign governments. That is not up for debate.

And yet, for far too many Native people, recognition seems to depend on whether the person looking at the card has ever been taught what it means.

The federal government cannot continue to preach government-to-government respect with tribes while allowing its own enforcement agencies to undermine that respect on the street or in county jails. Tribal nations should not have to lobby, plead, or litigate to ensure that their citizens are not wrongfully detained.

What happened to Elaine Miles and to Leticia Jacobo are not isolated incidents. In January, Navajo Nation officials reported that more than a dozen Indigenous citizens had been swept up in ICE operations.

Collectively, these incidents should serve as a warning to Native Americans to carry their tribal IDs and even passports, if they have one.

But the burden shouldn't fall on Native people to prove we belong here. The solution lies with federal agencies. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security must immediately:

Issue clear directives that tribal IDs are valid federal identification

Mandate training on tribal sovereignty for all ICE agents and Border Patrol officers

Establish a reporting system for wrongful detentions of tribal citizens

Publicly apologize to Miles, Jacobo and other Natives wrongfully detained

Until these steps are taken, every Native person in this country remains at risk of being told they don't belong in their own homeland.

Our ancestors did not need permission to be here. Neither do we.

Consequently, this court may not consider the contempt orders under Code § 17.1-405(A)(5) because the orders do not “involve” an equitable claim.

Background

These interlocutory appeals arise from extensive litigation between Eleni Napier’s children and grandchild following her death. In these two, Eleni’s son, Eleftherios Napier, challenges three orders that denied his motion for a nonsuit and that held him in contempt for violating an order requiring him to relinquish possession of real property to Margery Cannon, Sean Weaver and the Estate of Eleni Napier. The preliminary question before this court may address the assignments of error, however, is whether it has jurisdiction over these two appeals.

Analysis

On brief, Napier’s appeals challenge five distinct orders: (1) the Feb. 12, 2024, status quo order; (2) the March 19, 2024, order granting defendants’ motion to consolidate; (3) the March 19, 2024, order denying Napier’s nonsuit motion; (4) the March 19, 2024, contempt order that required Napier to vacate the property and held that defendants were “entitled to immediate possession” and (5) the May 13, 2024, contempt order finding that Napier “remains in contempt.”

Two of those five orders were not challenged by either notice of appeal to this court – the February status quo order and the March motion to consolidate. Further, none of the appealed orders is a final order, as the entire matter before the court, including Napier’s estate dispute that began this litigation, still has not been resolved. Thus, jurisdiction over these appeals, if it exists, must be grounded in this court’s limited interlocutory jurisdiction or in its jurisdiction over final civil contempt judgments.

The circuit court’s order denying Napier’s nonsuit motion does not fall within this court’s interlocutory jurisdiction. The order neither “(i) requires money to be paid or the possession or title of property to be changed [n]or (ii) adjudicates the principles of a cause,” so this court does not have jurisdiction under Code § 17.1-405(A)(5).

Napier maintains that this court may review the first and second contempt orders under Code § 17.1-405(A)(5) because they required “possession or title of property to be changed.” The challenged orders may indeed have required a change of possession of property from Napier to defendants. But they did not “involv[e] an equitable claim,” a statutory precursor to this court’s jurisdiction set forth in Code § 17.1-405(A)(5). Instead both the contempt orders were based on and involved defendants’ legal claim of ejectment. Consequently, this court may not consider the contempt orders under Code § 17.1-405(A)(5) because the orders do not “involve” an equitable claim.

Code § 19.2-318 grants jurisdiction to consider an appeal “[f]rom a judgment for any civil contempt of court.” “[A] contempt order is. . . appealable if it adjudicates all issues of guilt and imposes a sentence.” Here, the record demonstrates that both the contempt orders found Napier in civil contempt.

But those findings do not render the contempt orders appealable under Code § 19.2-318, as neither order imposes any sentence or penalty on Napier. Rather, they merely reiterate and clarify the actions Napier needed to take to comply with the court’s earlier status quo order. Thus, they are not appealable orders under Code § 19.2-318.

Appeal dismissed.

Experts across the refugee sector urge the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to use its visit to Australia, starting today, to investigate harmful immigration detention policies that breach human rights.

A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia’s immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group has previously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government’s failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

· offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

· the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

· the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

· the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

· specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

Madeline Gleeson, Senior Research Fellow, Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW Sydney, said:

“After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.”

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people’s liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.”

Fr. Brett O’Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said:

“JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group’s visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.”

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said:

“Australia’s mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government’s obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.”

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said:

“This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia’s immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.”

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said:

“Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.”

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said:

“Australia’s system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people – some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people.”

“While we know that this news might cause alarm, we have no sense that ICE is planning the kind of activity that we saw Border Patrol do,” said Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena in a Sunday call with reporters. “The report that we got is that 50 additional agents were going to be deployed to North Carolina for activity starting December 1st.”

The grassroots immigrants rights organization has also had reports that ICE has reserved the same charter flights between Charlotte and Florida’s Jacksonville International Airport as they did last week, scheduled from Dec. 2 to Dec. 6.

Marín Baena declined to talk further about the origin of the information, and NC Newsline was not able to independently confirm it.

Marín Baena noted said the arrests ICE has typically made throughout this year have made it nearly impossible to get to school and work safely. Siembra NC launched the website Ojo Obrero in November to give communities a better sense of where federal enforcement activity has taken place.

“Businesses are being disrupted, classrooms are being disrupted, even people who have become naturalized U.S. citizens are doubting whether they are safe or thinking about what they need to do in the case of these operations,” Marín Baena said.

Many naturalized U.S. citizens and green card holders have started to carry their passports just to go grocery shopping.

“My own parents are naturalized U.S. citizens, and we had to talk about what would happen, what they should do, were they stopped by a border patrol agent,” Marín Baena said.

She believes the anticipated ICE’s operation in Raleigh comes as the result of remarks made by North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall. Last week, Hall told The News & Observer that ICE and the border patrol were doing important work.

“It looks like they’re doing a pretty good job at it right now. And so, we don’t have much to ask, other than to come back,” Hall said.

Siembra is encouraging North Carolinians who have been impacted by the recent detentions to contact Hall’s office.

“We think that they listen to their own campaign contributors. And so, a few key contributors to Speaker Dustin Hall include political action committees with the N.C. Home Builders Association, Duke Energy and Lowe’s Home Improvement,” said Marín Baena. “We are inviting people to write letters and create illustrated cards to Speaker Hall’s top campaign contributors, specifically explaining why children and their parents should not have to live in fear.”

For business owners who have closed because employees are sheltering in place, Siembra NC is inviting people to post placards explaining that they’re closed “Courtesy of Speaker Destin Hall.”

The organization has also suggested that immigrant workers who miss work because they are sheltering in place can send a “Destin Hall Pass” to their employer.

Hall said on social media that he supports the enforcement action and that Gov. Joh Stein should be “more concerned about the safety of our citizens than protecting criminal illegal aliens.” Hall also faulted Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden for blocking previous ICE detainers and putting undocumented immigrants back onto the streets.

“They’re stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city,” Hall said in a Nov. 17 post on X expressing support for the Border Patrol.

Over the holiday weekend, Homeland Security officials pivoted to focus on the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump announced on Thanksgiving that he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”

The five-day crackdown by Border Patrol in North Carolina resulted in 370 arrests.

Marín Baena said Sunday that many of those detained could eventually see charges dismissed.

“And we actually don’t know, of those 370 people, how many they’ve already had to let go because they were actually U.S. citizens or green card holders and how many they will have to let go because we’ve documented that they were unconstitutional arrests,” she said.

Marín Baena said she hopes that ICE’s plans change and it does not resume indiscriminate arrests in North Carolina in December. But if they do return, she says immigrant advocates are prepared.

The lawmakers said they did not know whether last week's Washington Post report was true, and some Republicans were skeptical, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike poses serious legal concerns.

“This rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.

Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information that happened. He noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations.

“Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Sunday evening while flying back to Washington from Florida, where he celebrated Thanksgiving, confirmed that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump also is weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.

Trump declined to comment on details of the call, which was first reported by The New York Times.

“I wouldn’t say it went well or badly,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, when asked about the call.

The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the call with Trump.

Turner said there are concerns in Congress about the attacks on vessels that the Trump administration says are transporting drugs, but the allegation regarding the Sept. 2 attack “is completely outside anything that has been discussed with Congress and there is an ongoing investigation.”

The comments from lawmakers during news show appearances come as the administration escalates a campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. On Saturday, Trump said the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as “closed in its entirety,” an assertion that raised more questions about the U.S. pressure on Maduro. Maduro's government accused Trump of making a ”colonial threat” and seeking to undermine the South American country’s sovereignty.

After the Post's report, Hegseth said Friday on X that “fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.”

""Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,"" Hegseth wrote.

Trump said on Sunday the administration “will look into” the matter but added, “I wouldn’t have wanted that — not a second strike.” The president also defended Hegseth.

“Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said. He added, “And I believe him.”

Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late Friday that the committee “will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”

That was followed Saturday with the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, and the ranking Democratic member, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, issuing a joint statement saying the panel was committed to “providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean.”

“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” Rogers and Smith said, referring to U.S. Southern Command.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., asked about the Sept. 2 attack, said Hegseth deserves a chance to present his side.

“We should get to the truth. I don’t think he would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, kill everybody, kill the survivors because that’s a clear violation of the law of war,” Bacon said. “So, I’m very suspicious that he would’ve done something like that because it would go against common sense.”

Both Connolly and Gillhouse said the best thing immigrants can do while their rights are uncertain is make a plan.
Do you want to stay detained by your case or do you want to fight your case?” Connolly said.","University of Wisconsin-Madison’s chapter of Voices of Courage for Equity and Social Justice (VOCES) hosted a panel discussion with immigration attorneys to teach attendees about immigration rights and how students can support immigrants on campus.

Immigration attorneys and panelists Matthew Gillhouse and Alayna Connolly said immigration law has noticeably changed under the Trump Administration, mentioning a September federal court case which gave Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) the power to decide whether detainees can receive bond.

Gillhouse said there is “more corruption” in the immigration law system now.

The Trump Administration also removed Temporary Protective Status (TPS) status from several countries such as Venezuela, Afghanistan and Syria, despite the respective U.S. embassies deeming travel to these countries unsafe. TPS is meant for immigrants who cannot safely return back to their country due to issues such as political turmoil or weather disasters..

Connolly, who does a lot of work with unaccompanied minors, said the administration has also changed immigrants’ rights to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a U.S. immigration policy providing temporary protection from deportation and a work permit for two years at a time for children brought into the U.S. before their 16th birthday.

Previously, kids with Special Immigrant Juvenile status could get Deferred Action while waiting to apply for a green card if they were abused or neglected. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently ruled for DACA renewal applications to be processed, but not new ones.

“Right now, the wait [for Deferred Action] is like four or five years, so one of the major changes is that deferred action is no longer an option for those kids,” Connolly said. “It's also getting harder to terminate or defer cases for kids who are in removal proceedings or deportation proceedings since judges aren't as accepting of the fact that kids have Special Immigrant Juvenile status or have other applications pending in other offices.”

Karen Romo, president of the UW-Madison VOCES chapter, outlined what immigrants can do to stay safe in case of an ICE encounter. She warned immigrants to not open the door, remain silent, not to run or resist, not to sign any documents, not to lie and to film and take photos.

Ashley Hagen, another panelist and Associated Students of Madison vice chair, said they hope to team up with VOCES in the future to teach employees specifically how to support international students. The group is also working on a new task force for academic freedom and freedom of expression in response to the crackdown on protest policy with the Expressive Activity Policy.

Melanie Leyva, College Organizer for Voces de la Frontera, spoke about the Community Defense Network, which trains people to be “verifiers” — people who go to hotline ICE sightings to verify whether the call was real to stop misinformation and fearmongering.

Both Connolly and Gillhouse said the best thing immigrants can do while their rights are uncertain is make a plan.

“One thing that we talk a lot about with people who are coming in for intakes is, what are your goals out of this? Do you want to stay detained by your case or do you want to fight your case?” Connolly said. “Do you want to just try and go back to your home country? Or do you want to try and go somewhere else?”

Gillhouse said the whole process is disheartening.

The Trump administration is extending its anti-immigration agenda beyond US borders. This week, US embassies in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and several Western European nations were instructed to collect and transmit migrant-related crime data in these countries to Washington.

The administration’s stated purpose is to assist US allies in reforming their immigration systems and curbing what the US labels “ mass migration”. In a briefing to explain the action, a US State Department spokesperson called mass migration an “existential threat to Western civilisation and the safety of both the West and the world”.

This request is unprecedented and extremely harmful.

First, it is embedding the Trump administration’s criminalisation and mass deportation of migrants into its diplomatic relations with other countries.

Second, the Trump administration’s directive is perpetuating a false narrative that migrants are to blame for any perceived increase in crime rates.

Empirical research over decades in the US shows migrants do not offend at disproportionate rates, despite persistent political claims.

Nonetheless, the Trump administration continues to escalate its harsh crackdown on migrants under the justification that US cities are under siege. This has enabled the government to take actions that critics say violate international law and curtail domestic civil liberties, including deporting migrants without due process, detaining migrants with no criminal history for long periods, and separating families.

In addition, the US government has also taken lethal military action against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, alleging “narco-terrorists” are flooding the country with drugs.

Australia is described in the US State Department briefing as a “great ally”. The spokesperson explained the US government’s intent in collecting migrant crime data:

“To warn our friends that if you import a rapid number of individuals of any background, but particularly individuals of a culture that’s radically different than Australia’s without any sort of mechanism for diffusing the impact, that can lead to political unrest, that can lead to economic instability.”

In Australia, public inquiries and criminology research have consistently found claims of a link between migrants and crime to be exaggerated and harmful. These studies often call for stricter media regulations on inaccurate crime reporting to avoid scapegoating marginalised communities.

Yet, successive governments have continued to expand their powers to deport migrants under the guise of public safety. This approach is a form of “crimmigration” – when immigration enforcement is incorporated into crime control.

It creates harsher consequences for non-citizens who commit offences, compared to citizens. In addition, many people who have not been convicted of a violent crime – and sometimes no crime at all – have been caught up in these exclusionary processes.

In 2023, the High Court ruled in the NZYQ case that continuing to detain individuals who cannot be removed from Australia is unconstitutional. This resulted in the release of hundreds of non-citizens (some of whom had no convictions, or had convictions and had served their prison sentences) into the community on bridging visas.

The action ignited heated parliamentary debates about a supposed existential threat to Australian society. In many cases, the debates featured divisive language and unsupported claims that are characteristic of the current US administration.

Emergency laws were hastily passed to respond to the situation. These resulted in punitive measures, including a new visa regime with parole-like conditions, new criminal offences with mandatory minimum sentences, and preventative detention modelled on existing counter-terrorism provisions.

These developments show the potential for Trumpian-style immigration approaches to take hold in Australia. The recent anti-immigration rallies across Australia – in addition to the adoption of the “mass migration” terminology – suggest there would be fertile ground for this in parts of society.

But it is not clear to us how enhanced visa cancellations and deportation powers improve community safety.

Every day in Australia, people are processed by the criminal justice system and returned to the community. The government is not taking responsibility for effective crime prevention by targeting non-citizens for punishment and exclusion. This will not make Australia safer. It will only trigger safety concerns for multicultural communities.

A more rigorous and evidence-based approach is needed to address the social determinants that increase the risk of marginalised communities coming into contact with the criminal justice system. This includes systemic racism.

Migration is a feature of our globalising world and does not represent an existential threat to Western civilisation, as claimed in the US State Department.

Retreats into ultra-nationalist rhetoric and the scapegoating of migrants are never the answer.",https://johnmenadue.com/images/Large-group-of-people-forming-Australia-map-and-national-flag.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 23:56:37.863115

The Supreme Court in May allowed Trump’s transgender military service ban to take effect while litigation continues, after a district court had temporarily blocked it nationwide.

Trump administration lawyers have argued the ban on transgender troops is no different than other policies disqualifying people from military service over medical conditions that can affect military readiness, such as epilepsy or schizophrenia. The policy disqualifies people based on a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria as defined by psychiatric professionals.

An appeals court heard arguments over the ban in May. The three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit pressed the Trump administration on why the seven transgender servicemembers at the heart of the lawsuit, all of whom are actively serving in the military, should be discharged despite each one individually serving without a problem.

“When we talk about unit cohesion and good order and discipline, that affects everyone” in the military, said Abhishek Kambli, the DOJ lawyer defending the transgender military ban.

Kambli also pushed back on questions about whether the ban was hastily implemented at the start of Trump’s presidency, noting that the Pentagon had built its policy off a similar one put in place under then-Defense Secretary James Mattis during Trump’s first term.

In 2019, the Supreme Court upheld that transgender ban, which allowed transgender troops who were already serving to remain in the military but otherwise included similar reasoning for banning the enlistment of new ones.

Trump’s transgender passport policy rule upheld as ‘historical fact’

The president issued an executive order at the beginning of his term in January, reversing a Biden-era policy that allowed people to select their listed sex on passports, along with allowing an X designation, and reverting to the long-standing policy of listing the biological sex of the passport holder on the document.

The move was met with a lawsuit and a subsequent injunction in April, which blocked the new rule from taking effect, as ordered by U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick.

Kobick claimed in her ruling that the order was “part of a coordinated and rapid rollback of rights and protections previously afforded to transgender Americans” and said that “such targeting of a politically unpopular group runs afoul of our Nation’s constitutional commitment to equal protection.”

The Trump administration appealed the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which upheld the lower court’s ruling halting the policy, leading the Justice Department to submit the case to the Supreme Court’s emergency docket.

The people who sued the administration over the policy claim it violated the Equal Protection Clause and discriminated against transgender people, while the Justice Department has maintained it is about presenting factual information on government documents.

“Private citizens cannot force the government to use inaccurate sex designations on identification documents that fail to reflect the person’s biological sex—especially not on identification documents that are government property and an exercise of the President’s constitutional and statutory power to communicate with foreign governments,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in his petition to the Supreme Court’s emergency docket.

The justices sided with the administration 6-3, lifting the block on the passport rule while the case continues in lower federal courts. The unsigned majority opinion stated that the policy is not discriminatory, but instead requires the listing of a “historical fact” about the passport holder.

“Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth—in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment. And on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government’s choice to display biological sex ‘lack[s] any purpose other than a bare … desire to harm a politically unpopular group,’” the majority ruling in the Nov. 6 order said.

The ruling marked the second victory on transgender policy issues for the Trump administration this year on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket. It also continued the broader trend of higher courts largely reversing lower courts’ injunctions of Trump policies.

Trump-backed transgender sports laws under review at the Supreme Court in January

While the pair of lawsuits over transgender sports laws before the Supreme Court in January are not directly related to Trump orders, the two state laws at the center of the cases mirror Trump administration policies and have the administration’s backing.

On Jan. 13, 2026, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J., where laws in Idaho and West Virginia, respectively, limiting women’s sports to biological women will be under scrutiny. The laws are similar in substance to the president’s February executive order aiming to keep biological men out of women’s sports.

The pair of cases will examine whether the laws either violate the 14th Amendment, as in the Hecox case, or if they violate Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause, as in the B.P.J. case. In Hecox, both the federal district and appeals courts ruled that the law was unconstitutional, while in B.P.J., a federal district court sided with West Virginia in upholding the law, but a federal appeals court later struck down the law.

The Justice Department will receive time to argue in favor of both state laws during oral arguments in January, hoping to notch another legal win with transgender policies via a ruling that upholds the state laws.

“In short, the laws of West Virginia and Idaho place trans-identifying athletes on sports teams on the same valid, biology-based terms as everyone else. That is the definition of equal treatment. It is not gender-identity discrimination at all, much less sex discrimination,” the Justice Department said in a brief to the Supreme Court.

SUPREME COURT TO WEIGH WHETHER STATES CAN TARGET DONOR LISTS

“However else Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause may apply to trans-identifying individuals, they certainly do not require granting these men and boys a preferential exemption from biology-based rules, let alone when that would come at the expense of competitive fairness and safety for women and girls—the very people Title IX was enacted to protect,” the brief continued. “In holding the opposite, the courts below relied on a set of rationales that have no basis in law or fact.”

The Supreme Court has not offered any insight into how it will rule in the transgender sports cases, but it has not handed LGBT activists many wins in recent years. Earlier this year, the high court ruled 6-3, upholding a Tennessee law that banned transgender procedures for minors, a significant loss for LGBT activists.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP21127729510159.jpg?resize=1200,683",N,,2025-11-30 17:56:48.207749

By JACK BROOK, REBECCA SANTANA and SARA CLINE Associated Press/Report for America

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Around 250 federal border agents are expected to launch a monthslong immigration crackdown on Monday in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi dubbed “Swamp Sweep.”

The deployment, which aims to arrest 5,000 people, is centered in liberal New Orleans and is the latest federal immigration enforcement operation to target a Democratic-run city as President Donald Trump’s administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign.

Many in the greater New Orleans area, particularly in Latino communities, have been on edge since the planned operations were reported earlier this month, even as Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

Here’s what to know about “Swamp Sweep.”

Border Patrol accused of aggressive tactics in blue cities

Bovino has become the Trump administration’s go-to operative for leading large-scale, high-profile immigration enforcement campaigns. During his operation in Chicago, federal agents rappelled from a helicopter into a residential apartment complex and fired pepper balls and tear gas at protesters.

Federal agents arrested more than 3,200 immigrants during a surge in the Chicago area in recent months, but have not provided many details. Court documents on roughly 600 recent arrests showed that only a handful had criminal records representing a “high public safety risk,” according to federal government data.

Border Patrol, which does not typically operate in dense urban areas or in situations with protesters, has been accused of heavy-handed tactics, prompting several lawsuits. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Chicago accused Bovino of lying and rebuked him for deploying chemical irritants against protesters.

Bovino has doubled down on the efficacy of his agency’s operations.

“We’re finding and arresting illegal aliens, making these communities safer for the Americans who live there,” he said in a post on X.

Louisiana has strict immigration enforcement laws

The Department of Justice has accused New Orleans of undermining federal immigration enforcement and included it on a list of 18 so-called sanctuary cities. The city’s jail, which has been under longstanding oversight from a federal judge, does not cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under most circumstances, and its police department views immigration enforcement as a civil matter outside its jurisdiction.

However, Louisiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature has passed laws to compel New Orleans agencies to align with the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration stance.

One such law makes it a crime to “knowingly” do something intended to “hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart” federal immigration enforcement efforts. Anyone who violates the law could face fines and up to a year of jail time.

Additionally, lawmakers expanded the crime of malfeasance in office, which is punishable by up to 10 years in jail, for government officials who refuse to comply with requests from agencies like ICE. It also prohibits police and judges from releasing from their custody anyone who “illegally entered or unlawfully remained” in the U.S. without providing advance notice to ICE.

New Orleans awaits federal agents

In and around New Orleans, some immigration lawyers say they have been inundated with calls from people trying to prepare for the upcoming operation. One immigration lawyer, Miguel Elias, says his firm is conducting many consultations virtually or by telephone because people are too afraid to come in person.

He likens the steps many in the immigrant community are taking to what people do to prepare for a hurricane — hunker down or evacuate. Families are stocking up on groceries and making arrangements for friends to take their children to school to limit how frequently they leave the house, he said.

In the days leading up to Border Patrol’s planned operations, businesses have posted signs barring federal agents from entry and grassroots advocacy groups have offered rights-related trainings and workshops on documenting the planned crackdown.

While New Orleans is famous for its blend of cultures, only around 6.7% of its population of nearly 400,000 is foreign-born, though that rises to almost 10% in neighboring metro areas. That’s still well below the national average of 14.3%, according to U.S. census data.

The city’s Hispanic population ballooned during rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and now makes up around 14% of the population, according to census data compiled by New Orleans-based Data Center.

The Pew Research Center estimates 110,000 immigrants who lack permanent legal status were living in Louisiana as of 2023, comprising approximately 2.4% of the state’s population. Most of them are from Honduras.

Amanda Toups, who owns local restaurant Toups Meatery and runs a nonprofit to help feed neighbors in need, said she expects the federal operations to negatively impact the city’s tourism-dependent economy, which supports the rest of Louisiana.

“If you’re scaring off even 5% of tourism, that’s devastating,” she said. “You’re brown and walking around in town somewhere and you could get tackled by ICE and you’re an American citizen? Does that make you want to travel to New Orleans?”

A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia's immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group haspreviously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government's failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

Madeline Gleeson, Senior Research Fellow, Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW Sydney, said: 'After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.'

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre, said: 'Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people's liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.'

Fr. Brett O'Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said: 'JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group's visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.'

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said: 'Australia's mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government's obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.'

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said: 'This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia's immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.'

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said: 'Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.'

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said: 'Australia's system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people - some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people

Dorad’s operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 205.8 million.

Based on the information provided by Dorad, the demand for electricity by Dorad’s customers is seasonal and is affected by, inter alia, the climate prevailing in that season. The months of the year are split into three seasons as follows: summer – June-September; winter – December-February; and intermediate (spring and autumn) – March-May and October-November. There is a higher demand for electricity during the winter and summer seasons, and the average electricity consumption is higher in these seasons than in the intermediate seasons and is even characterized by peak demands due to extreme climate conditions of heat or cold. In addition, Dorad’s revenues are affected by the change in load and time tariffs – TAOZ (an electricity tariff that varies across seasons and across the day in accordance with demand hour clusters), as, on average, TAOZ tariffs are higher in the summer season than in the intermediate and winter seasons. Therefore, the results presented for the quarter ended September 30 , 202 5 , which include the summer month s of July-September , are not indicative of full year results. In addition, due to various reasons, including the effects of the increase in the Israeli CPI impacting interest payments by Dorad on its credit facility and regulatory changes , the results included herein may not be indicative of third quarter results in the future or comparable to third quarter results in the past .

A convenience translation of the financial results for Dorad as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and as of and for each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 is included at the end of this press release. Ellomay does not undertake to separately report Dorad’s financial results in a press release in the future. Neither Ellomay nor its independent public accountants have reviewed or consulted with the Luzon Group , Ellomay Luzon Energy or Dorad with respect to the financial results included in this press release.

,Agencies,2025-11-30 17:59:52+00:00,CNN,Multiple arrested as protesters block federal agents at Manhattan garage - CNN,"Emma Tucker, Mark Morales",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/us/manhattan-protesters-immigration-garage,"More than a dozen demonstrators were arrested in lower Manhattan on Saturday after their attempts to stop federal agents from conducting immigration and enforcement activities, according to a law enforcement official.
The group of protesters chanted “ICE out of New York” in footage that showed them locking arms to form a barrier blocking federal agents from exiting the garage in their car.
“We won’t let violent rioters slow us down and anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted,” the spokesperson said.
Tisch criticized the action for putting the public, federal agents and officers at risk, the officials said.
Federal officers at the scene were armed and many of them wore face coverings.","More than a dozen demonstrators were arrested in lower Manhattan on Saturday after their attempts to stop federal agents from conducting immigration and enforcement activities, according to a law enforcement official.

The group of protesters chanted “ICE out of New York” in footage that showed them locking arms to form a barrier blocking federal agents from exiting the garage in their car. Some grabbed planters from the roadway and hurled them at federal vehicles, the official said. The confrontations prompted some officers to deploy what appeared to be pepper spray to subdue demonstrators, the official added.

The incident is the latest in an array of protests that have taken place across the country between federal agents and demonstrators who are fighting against the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration.

Saturday’s protest took place just down the street from Foley Square, where there was a larger demonstration last month. October’s protest came the day after a chaotic ICE raid on Chinatown’s Canal Street – a popular and highly trafficked area well-known for its street vendors who sell counterfeit designer goods.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said individuals “dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles showed up and began to obstruct federal law enforcement officers” after social media posts called “agitators to ICE’s location” in the city.

Publicizing details about the location of ICE agents, DHS said, puts “a target” on their backs, citing an increase in assaults against officers. “We won’t let violent rioters slow us down and anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted,” the spokesperson said.

Ricky Patel, special agent in charge of New York’s Homeland Security Investigations office, apologized in a call with New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch on Saturday for how the enforcement action unfolded, two law enforcement officials briefed on the call said. Tisch criticized the action for putting the public, federal agents and officers at risk, the officials said.

Tisch warned Patel that the displays of force by federal agents intending to cause chaos and disorder on city streets need to stop because they will lead to someone getting hurt, one of the officials familiar with the conversation.

CNN has reached out to HSI for further information.

The incident unfolded just before noon when NYPD officers responded to a 911 call for a “disorderly group” near Chinatown and observed multiple people blocking the street and exits at different locations and “throwing debris,” the agency said.

“They were instructed multiple times to disperse, and they did not comply. As a result, multiple individuals were taken into custody,” the NYPD said in a statement.

The situation remained peaceful at first as the crowd of protesters gathered in front of a closed garage before moving to the corner of the street, chanting “ICE out of New York” and shouting at police officers who did not engage. Federal officers at the scene were armed and many of them wore face coverings.

At one point, the garage opened and a barrier of protesters continued chanting while blocking a vehicle from exiting. The group also created a blockade with piles of wood and cardboard from a construction dumpster and trash bins, according to videos from the scene.

As the car moved out of the garage, protesters chased and shouted at it while police officers tried to stop them and tackled at least one protester who was later released.

City Council member Julie Menin called federal immigration agents’ actions “utterly irresponsible” after the incident in a statement on X.

“Today, ICE threatened the public’s safety yet again — and this time, their actions created a dangerous situation for both the public and our NYPD officers,” she said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-11-29t202917z-1333124512-rc2g6iaq1y2i-rtrmadp-3-usa-migration-new-york.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-30 17:56:43.910805

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said Sunday the Trump administration is “harassing” Afghan migrants through its crackdown on those from the country.
As of September 2022, roughly 88,500 Afghan nationals entered the U.S. via the “Operation Allies Welcome” initiative, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
In total, 195,000 Afghan migrants were living in the U.S. as of 2022, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

“Going after a large group of people, most of which I think are just trying to live their lives, raise their families, go to work every day, the U.S. government harassing them years later does not make a lot of sense to me,” Kelly told host Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The Trump administration indefinitely paused immigration from Afghanistan on Wednesday, hours after two West Virginia National Guard members were shot in Washington, D.C. The suspected gunman, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the country in 2021 via a program for those who helped the U.S. during its two-decade war in Afghanistan.

As of September 2022, roughly 88,500 Afghan nationals entered the U.S. via the “Operation Allies Welcome” initiative, according to the Department of Homeland Security. In total, 195,000 Afghan migrants were living in the U.S. as of 2022, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

One Guard member, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her wounds on Thursday. Another, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition.

President Trump said Wednesday evening that his administration will review the case of every Afghan migrant who entered the country during the Biden administration.

The next day, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said his agency, at the direction of the president, will reexamine green cards held by individuals from 19 countries, including Afghanistan.

The State Department has also paused visas for Afghan nationals in the wake of the shooting.

Kelly said Sunday that while individuals entering the country “should be vetted,” those who assisted the U.S. during the war “provided a valuable service to the United States of America and deserve an opportunity to resettle in our country.”

“We’re a country of immigrants,” the Arizona senator added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/kelly_mark_01152025_AP25328637488669-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-30 12:57:30.113605

Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.)","A deadly shooting involving two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., earlier this week rattled officials across the nation, and has spurred an increased presence of federal law enforcement in the nation’s capital and an intensification of President Trump’s immigration crackdown.

West Virginia National Guard members U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe and U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom were both shot. Beckstrom died on Thursday, while Wolfe remained in critical condition on Saturday.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey (R) is expected to discuss the violent event and honor the two service members during an appearance on Fox News’s “The Sunday Briefing.”

In response to the shooting, which occurred blocks from the White House on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said 500 additional National Guard troops will join forces with members already deployed to Washington.

“This will only stiffen our resolve to ensure that we make Washington, D.C., safe and beautiful,” Hegseth told reporters on Wednesday during his trip to the Dominican Republic.

“The drop in crime has been historic. The increase in safety and security has been historic. But if criminals want to conduct things like this, violence against America’s best, we will never back down. President Trump will never back down. That’s why the American people elected him,” he added.

Hours after the shooting, the president said his administration would also place an indefinite pause on immigration from Afghanistan, the country of origin for the suspected shooter.

The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered the United States in September 2021 through the program “Operation Allies Welcome,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Wednesday night.

“The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States … under the Biden Administration,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a Wednesday statement on X.

“I will not utter this depraved individual’s name. He should be starved of the glory he so desperately wants,” she added.

Noem is slated to make appearances on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and ABC’s “This Week,” where she will likely discuss further protocols being implemented in the aftermath of the shooting.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Department of Justice will seek the death penalty against Lakanwal. Bondi is scheduled to make an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox News Sunday.”

Bondi will likely discuss the potential of capital punishment for the suspected shooter in addition to his charges, which include three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and one count of first-degree murder, according the office of U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro.

White Hose border czar Tom Homan, meanwhile, is set to appear on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” and could provide details on how the shooting is impacting the Trump administration’s moves to restrict immigration.

Amid a rabid political climate, Trump and Hegseth have tussled with Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and five other Democratic lawmakers over a video in which the group urged military members not to abide by “illegal orders.”

Trump described the clip as an act of “sedition” which could be “punishable by death,” sparking outrage from elected officials far and wide while Hegseth said the Pentagon would launch an investigation into Kelly for “serious allegations of misconduct.”

Kelly will likely share his response to the president’s remarks during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He’ll be joined by his colleagues, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who may also weigh in on Kelly’s feud with the president.

Besides, a group of human rights organisations have filed lawsuit against the administration demanding the employees to be reinstated.
The Guardian quoted one former watchdog saying: “They don’t care about civil rights concerns.
They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants.
“By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.""","The US Department of Homeland Security has cut its civil rights watchdog staff, sparking lawsuits and whistleblower complaints over unchecked abuses under Trump administration.

The federal watchdog system at US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) overseeing complaints regarding civil rights violations have been dismantled, which has led to the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity"", according to experts.

According to The Guardian, former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

During President Trump’s second term, hundreds of officials in federal oversight offices, known as watchdogs, have been fired. The main watchdog team overseeing civil rights, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) – one of three DHS oversight offices – has been cut from a staff of 150 to just nine, The Guardian reported.

A group of expelled watchdogs has filed a whistleblower complaint to Congress through the Government Accountability Project (GAP). Besides, a group of human rights organisations have filed lawsuit against the administration demanding the employees to be reinstated.

“They want to be able to abuse people with impunity,"" said Anthony Enriquez, vice-president of US advocacy and litigation at the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights advocacy group based in Washington, which is representing the group suing the government.

He added: “They want to be able to operate a system that doesn’t have any rules and that can be used to maximize brutality against people, in order to accomplish a mass deportation agenda.""

In response to reports and complaints of abuses, The Guardian quoted the DHS stating through assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin stating that there are “no sub-prime"" conditions in immigration custody in the US.

Last week, McLaughlin issued a statement saying: ““These claims are ridiculous. All of legally required functions of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) continue to be performed, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the department’s mission of securing the homeland.""

It went on to say: “As it existed in the past, the CRCL obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS’s mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.""

Meanwhile, senior director of GAP Dana Gold pointed out that without a proper oversight system “there’s just a blank check for impunity"".

The Guardian quoted one former watchdog saying: “They don’t care about civil rights concerns. That’s why they fired us all. They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants. Even when we were there, they didn’t want to hear what we had to say – they didn’t want to let us do our jobs.""

“When there was a fully-staffed, robust CRCL, there were regular inspections of ICE facilities. There were contracted experts who went on those on-site oversight visits to the facilities, who provided detailed recommendations and corrective action that had to be taken when conditions were poor or when staff was mistreating the detained individuals,"" the former official explained in a telephone interview with The Guardian. “By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.""

But now, “ I don’t think they’re happening – it certainly doesn’t seem CRCL has the staff to be doing those inspections"", the former official added.",https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-15-2025-08-42cf5b417d1b813c0ad39ebfb532e8fb-16x9.png,N,,2025-11-30 10:57:09.847187

said Murad Awawdeh, President and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition.","CHINATOWN, Manhattan (WABC) -- Immigration advocates, elected officials and community members will rally and speak out on Sunday after multiple people were arrested during an anti-ICE demonstration in Lower Manhattan.

A rally and press conference will be held at Howard Street and Centre Street at 1 p.m. in Chinatown following Saturday's demonstration and arrests.

It all started around noon on Saturday when protesters gathered outside of 209 Centre Street and blocked streets, building and exits.

The area has been a hotbed for Federal law enforcement activity over the last month or so, with ICE cracking down on Canal Street. On Saturday afternoon, protesters converged on a garage apparently used by authorities - and things got heated.

A total of 15 people were arrested. The NYPD says the anti-ICE demonstration quickly started after a social media post.

The demonstration is the latest in an array of protests that have taken place across the nation between federal agents and demonstrators who are fighting against the Trump's administration crackdown on immigration.

The goal was to stop federal immigration vehicles from leaving the parking garage, but instead, protesters ended up in a standoff with the NYPD. Police say when the demonstrators did not disperse, and some started throwing debris, officers began making the arrests.

The arrests are being condemned by the New York Immigration Coalition.

""There's a report right now that we're following up on of an older gentleman and his daughter who were arrested who had nothing to do with anything and were just walking. So, this is a moment for all of us to ask the question of 'does the NYPD protect New York City residents or is it going to continue to harm them through collaborating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement?'"" said Murad Awawdeh, President and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that protesters gathered after the social media post. The DHS released a statement following Saturday's protest, saying in part, ""When individuals broadcast the location of ICE, they are putting a target on the backs of officers... We are grateful for the NYPD officers that responded to these violent agitators.""

Sources tell Eyewitness News the special agent in charge of the New York Homeland Security Field Office Ricky Patel called NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch later in the afternoon to apologize for what happened.

Tisch told Patel it was 'unacceptable' and put Federal agents and police officers in harm's way -- and if this activity continues someone will get hurt.

Protesters at Saturday's demonstration said they were trying to prevent another large-scale ICE raid, at least two of which were conducted on Canal Street over the past month.

Caracas, which views a large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean as a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolas Maduro, slammed Trump's warning as a ""colonialist threat.""

""To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers,"" Trump wrote on social media, ""please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.""

He did not elaborate, but after months of deadly U.S. strikes on alleged drug-running boats, speculation is mounting that Washington may launch some sort of military operation on Venezuelan soil.

Trump's warning comes days after U.S. aviation regulators told airlines to use increased caution near Venezuela over the mounting tensions, prompting multiple major carriers to suspend flights.

Maduro's government then issued a ban on the airlines for ""joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government.""

A statement by the Venezuelan foreign ministry called the U.S. president's latest remarks a ""new extravagant, illegal, and unjustified aggression against the people of Venezuela.""

It warned that the airspace disruptions would also mean a halt to repatriation flights of Venezuelan migrants from the United States, a key Trump administration initiative.

Venezuela's military Saturday also conducted exercises along coastal areas, with video broadcast on state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being maneuvered.

'By land'

Though Trump has not publicly threatened to use force to remove Maduro, he said this week that efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking ""by land"" would begin ""very soon.""

Maduro's re-election last year was widely rejected by the international community as fraudulent, while Washington also claims the leftist leader heads an alleged terrorist-designated drug cartel.

A steady buildup of U.S. naval and air assets in the region has seen the world's largest aircraft carrier move to the Caribbean, while American fighter jets and bombers have repeatedly flown off the Venezuelan coast in recent days.

U.S. media reported that, despite the bellicose posturing, Trump and Maduro spoke last week.

The New York Times reported Friday that Trump and Maduro had discussed a possible meeting, while the Wall Street Journal on Saturday said the conversation also included conditions of amnesty if Maduro were to step down.

Amid fears that Trump may launch a major operation in Venezuela, members of U.S. Congress – both Democrats and the president's own Republican Party – have expressed anger that he has not sought legislative approval.

""President Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,"" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said Sunday on X.

""Under our Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war,"" he added.

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said similarly: ""Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.""

Congress

However, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham cheered on Trump, writing on X that the president's ""strong commitment to end this madness in Venezuela will save countless American lives.""

Trump is also facing congressional pressure over recent media reports that the U.S. military launched a second missile at survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat in September.

Leaders of both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have released separate statements saying they would be investigating the strike, which legal experts say could amount to a war crime.

With Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, the Trump administration has so far largely escaped probing of its controversial anti-trafficking campaign.

Since the operation began in September, at least 83 people have been killed in the Caribbean Sea and the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

Washington has yet to release evidence that the vessels it targeted were used to smuggle drugs or posed a threat to the United States, and experts say the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings even if they target known traffickers.",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2025/11/30/thumbs/800x531/414161.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:57:30.056205

How to participate in the Salem City Council meeting The meeting is at 6 p.m. Dec. 1.","Salem City Council will vote Dec. 1 on whether to pass an emergency declaration following community outcry over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests.

The vote comes one week after hundreds of people filled city council chambers to urge Salem leaders to take action against what they called unconstitutional and fearmongering ICE sweeps.

Communities across Oregon are reeling from mass immigration arrests.

After at least 35 people were arrested in Woodburn by ICE in late October, some residents in the 60% Hispanic city said they are afraid to leave their homes, hesitant to buy groceries and are questioning whether to go to work. Businesses reported as much as an 80% drop in customer traffic.

Woodburn City Council declared a state of emergency on Nov. 21 in response to the impact.

At least 24 people were arrested by ICE in Salem on Nov. 11, the highest one-day total in Salem in many years.

Dozens of people testified about racial profiling, violence and uncertainty wrought by ICE.

A vote brought forth by Councilor Linda Nishioka to reaffirm Salem as an inclusive city and its status as a sanctuary city passed in a 7-2 vote.

A separate motion from Councilor Vanessa Nordyke to have City Manager Krishna Namburi craft a declaration for a vote during the Dec. 1 meeting passed in a 6-3 vote, with Mayor Julie Hoy and Councilors Deanna Gwyn and Shane Matthews voting no.

The declaration condemns the unconstitutional use of ICE sweeps, especially when politically motivated and done without due process. It calls on Oregon's members of Congress to enact legislation to protect immigrant and vulnerable communities like mask bans and identification requirements.

The declaration would authorize the following actions:

Coordination with community partners, including immigrant rights advocates, legal services providers, educational institutions, local business owners, neighborhood leaders, and faith leaders, to support programs for communication and outreach for the emergency impacts of federal immigration enforcement.

Consider implementation of legally defensible programs, policies and resources that protect and support employees and the community.

Provide training to city employees on city and state sanctuary policies and laws, including protocols for employees to follow in the event federal immigration authorities appear at city facilities.

Regular review of programs and services to identify ways to further enhance the goals of this declaration and implement best practices and policies for communities impacted by immigration.

Provide periodic reports to the council regarding the implementation of this declaration.

Some requests from the public, including calls for ""sanctuary zones"" at schools and the suspension of Flock camera use that could go to federal officials, were not included in the resolution.

City officials said the city does not have authority over Salem-Keizer Public Schools to create sanctuary zones. Police officials said they do not use Flock systems and instead use an automated license plate recognition program that is not shared with federal immigration enforcement agencies.

Other Salem City Council agenda items

A vote on authorizing Namburi to execute a cooperative improvement agreement with the Oregon Department of Transportation for the Center Street Bridge project.

A presentation on updates to the Center Street Seismic Retrofit Project.

Roosevelt, backed by the Supreme Court, treated the Japanese Americans as national security threats because of their ethnicity.

On a recent evening, she was on patrol, part of a group of Japanese Americans who are keeping a watchful eye on the actions of immigration agents in Los Angeles.

“I definitely think about my family when we organize, when we go out on patrols, because that could have been my family in prison,” said Ms. Oba, 33. “It’s just a difference of what, like, 80 years?”

During World War II, Ms. Oba’s grandparents were among the more than 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry who were forced by the federal government to live for years in remote, hastily constructed internment camps across the West.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, backed by the Supreme Court, treated the Japanese Americans as national security threats because of their ethnicity. Families left behind communities, businesses, homes and even pets. Some of them never returned. It wasn’t until the Reagan administration that the government apologized and said it would pay compensation to families who were affected.

Now, as the Trump administration carries out its immigration crackdown, Japanese Americans see chilling similarities to what their families experienced.

The federal government’s current efforts have focused on arresting and deporting Latinos who don’t have legal status in the United States. That contrasts with the situation in the 1940s, when most of the Japanese Americans held in detention camps were U.S. citizens.

But to many Japanese Americans, the images of uniformed federal agents ushering people onto buses, the mass detentions and the dehumanizing language used by government officials stir collective memories of the trauma faced by their own parents and grandparents.

Lisa Doi, 34, a board member of the Japanese American Citizens League’s chapter in Chicago, said that people who showed up to a recent event to connect community members with local rapid response networks were already seeing the parallels.

Japanese Americans tend to support Democrats at the polls and did so in the 2024 election, according to AAPI Data, a research organization focused on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. But this year, some have taken more concrete action to oppose the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

Japanese American groups have filed an amicus brief contesting President Trump’s recent invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a law that was also used to justify the imprisonment of Japanese Americans. They have denounced as a disgrace the government’s mass detention of immigrants at Fort Bliss, a former internment camp for Japanese Americans in Texas.

As a surge of federal agents put immigrant communities on edge in Chicago, Japanese American organizers marched, documented arrests and lined streets around schools to help protect parents who were afraid to pick up their children.

In Dublin, Calif., near San Francisco, camp survivors and Japanese taiko drummers rallied in July to oppose the proposed reopening of a federal prison to hold immigrants.

The alliance between Americans of Japanese and Mexican descents has been particularly strong in Los Angeles. Both include people who came to the United States with very little, worked as landscapers, cooks and farmers, and settled in urban neighborhoods where they were confined by redlining.

Ms. Oba and her partner, Nicole Suzuki, are part of Nikkei Progressives, a group founded by Japanese American activists in 2016 to push for immigrant rights. The group has raised money for undocumented immigrants affected by Los Angeles’s devastating wildfires and has served as advocates for migrants held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Adelanto, a desert community about 80 miles outside Los Angeles.

And as the Trump administration stepped up immigration raids across Southern California this year, the group started patrolling.

Ms. Suzuki, 28, said it was important to make sure that agents know that residents are watching what they do. On their weekly drives, Ms. Oba and Ms. Suzuki look out for unmarked vans, trucks with dark tinted windows or agents gathering behind the federal detention center.

“I think a lot of people lose hope that they have the power, that they can do anything about what’s happening,” Ms. Suzuki said. “But no — they could drive around their neighborhood every now and then and keep an eye out.”

Japanese American groups have also rallied against what they say is the Trump administration’s attempt to erase their history.

To Latino immigrant rights leaders, Japanese Americans have been both allies and examples.

Angelica Salas, the executive director of CHIRLA, one of the leading immigrant rights groups in the state, cited stories of Mexican Californians watching over the property of their Japanese neighbors. There was also the case of Ralph Lazo, a Mexican American teenager who was the only known person who wasn’t of Japanese ancestry to report to the camps, in solidarity with his classmates.

Now, Ms. Salas said, Japanese American groups have been returning the support through rapid response networks and efforts to educate the public about their history.

“They remind everybody that we aren’t enemies. We are just people living our lives, running businesses,” she said.

That has held true, even when Little Tokyo was caught in the middle of clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers.

In June, when demonstrators were protesting immigration raids and Mr. Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, law enforcement officers pushed them into Little Tokyo, which is right next to City Hall and the federal detention center. While the vast majority of the protesters were peaceful, when night fell, vandals broke windows and ransacked stores.

“A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.
But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website.","The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

A group of fired watchdogs has filed a whistleblower complaint to Congress through the Government Accountability Project (GAP), and a coalition of human rights organizations sued the administration, demanding the employees be reinstated. There is deepening concern that a system of oversight that was already weak is now hanging by a thread, even as criticism surges over treatment of detainees in the ballooning immigration jail network.

“They want to be able to abuse people with impunity,” said Anthony Enriquez, vice-president of US advocacy and litigation at the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights advocacy group based in Washington, which is representing the group suing the government.

He added: “They want to be able to operate a system that doesn’t have any rules and that can be used to maximize brutality against people, in order to accomplish a mass deportation agenda.”

The DHS has repeatedly, through assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin, insisted when asked about reports and complaints of abuses that there are “no sub-prime” conditions in immigration custody in the US.

But Dana Gold, a senior director of the GAP, which is working with those behind the whistleblower complaint, echoed Enriquez’s warning.

Without a robust oversight system “there’s just a blank check for impunity”, she said.

The second Trump administration early on fired hundreds of officials in federal oversight offices, typically known as watchdogs.

This included at the DHS. The main watchdog team there overseeing civil rights, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) – one of three DHS oversight offices – has been cut from a staff of 150 to just nine. This despite there being about 550 investigations that were active and alleging serious civil rights violations by DHS officials and contractors, including inside immigration detention centers.

Cases that were active when Trump returned to office include civil rights officials then in post investigating allegations of civil and human rights abuses, according to CRCL documents that were previously public, original complaint records submitted to the CRCL and the whistleblower disclosure, reviewed by the Guardian. Among the cases, were the following allegations:

Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a CRCL document confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.

Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL document. This included an investigation into a 2024 incident during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original complaint, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.

In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL complaint submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.

Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower complaint.

This last one, into Khalil, who was arrested by ICE agents for his pro-Palestinian activism, was one of the final investigations launched before the mass firing of civil rights watchdog officials in March.

The status of these investigations, and hundreds more, is unknown. Enquiries by the Guardian to the DHS last week about the above specific cases and the many others previously understood to be active elicited no response.

However, in response to requests for comment by the Guardian, also submitted to DHS last week, McLaughlin issued a statement, saying: “These claims are ridiculous. All of legally required functions of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) continue to be performed, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the department’s mission of securing the homeland.”

It went on to say: “As it existed in the past, the CRCL obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS’s mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.

“CRCL and OIDO, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, regularly inspect detention facilities, document conditions in accord with facility standards, investigate detainee complaints, and issue recommendations to ICE and CBP [Customs and Border Protection] when appropriate.”

An investigation by the Guardian based on interviews with five recently dismissed DHS civil rights officials, hundreds of pages of documents, and interviews with immigration attorneys, has found that the already limited oversight practiced within the DHS prior to January 2025 now appears almost nonexistent.

Of the nine people now working at the CRCL, one is its acting officer, installed in May, Troup Hemenway, a former adviser to the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint for conservative government.

Congress originally tasked the three offices, including CRCL, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) and the Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS), with oversight at DHS. The watchdog bodies process complaints, initiate investigations and provide guidance to DHS agencies in various areas of interest.

Now, those operations have seemingly been halted, or at least significantly slowed.

In recent months, the former DHS officials who have filed the whistleblower complaint have watched as the Trump administration has targeted political adversaries, expelled immigrants to a foreign prison, allowed officials to arrest immigrants at court appearances, encouraged officers to wear face coverings during arrests and targeted people who have lived in the US for years and have no criminal record.

Few know much about what is happening behind closed doors inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers and at secretive holding facilities.

Former DHS employees the Guardian spoke with, who were dismissed from their positions at CRCL, spoke with the Guardian on condition of anonymity to discuss matters more freely and avoid retaliation.

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration. “That’s why they fired us all. They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants. Even when we were there, they didn’t want to hear what we had to say – they didn’t want to let us do our jobs.”

One morning in late March, top DHS officials emailed employees at the three oversight offices, ordering them to stop working. Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.

A coalition of immigrant rights organizations sued the administration in Washington, declaring the cuts illegal and demanding all oversight employees be reinstated.According to a declaration filed by a top DHS official, , nearly every single employee from the offices was fired, including 147 employees at the CRCL, 118 at the OIDO and 46 at CIS.

The Trump administration wants “no oversight into what they are doing,” said Enriquez from RFK Human Rights.

Following the lawsuit, the DHS walked back its claims that the offices were being abolished. Instead they told the federal judge they reduced the number of staff in order to “refocus” the offices and “create more efficient processes.” The internal oversight work was continuing, the DHS said, arguing the lawsuit should be tossed.

Throughout litigation, the administration has put out various staffing figures, most recently that only nine people total, including Hemenway, now worked at CRCL. Five of them are “contract” investigators, meaning that as of August, there were only two full-time CRCL investigators. Fifteen additional contractors are also reportedly at CRCL, according to the DHS court declaration, exclusively focusing on internal Equal Employment Opportunity cases for DHS employees.

“When there was a fully-staffed, robust CRCL, there were regular inspections of ICE facilities. There were contracted experts who went on those on-site oversight visits to the facilities, who provided detailed recommendations and corrective action that had to be taken when conditions were poor or when staff was mistreating the detained individuals,” the former official explained in a telephone interview with the Guardian.

“By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.”

But now, “ I don’t think they’re happening – it certainly doesn’t seem CRCL has the staff to be doing those inspections”, the former official added.

Gold, at the GAP, said of the whistleblowers she is working with: “The idea that getting rid of basically every employee with institutional knowledge and replacing them with just a few – in the wake of daily multiple examples of the kinds of things that CRCL would have dealt with – is just deeply disturbing to them.”

Oversight at the DHS “is a guardrail that has been deliberately decimated to make sure that sand is not put in the gears of executive branch priorities”, Gold added.

Many CRCL investigations focused on complaints inside ICE detention centers, including allegations of medical neglect, sexual abuse and deaths in custody, the whistleblower complaint said. Now, the Trump administration is further expanding its immigration detention network.

“ I don’t think they care about the conditions of these facilities. I think they’re just trying to round up as many people as they can and get rid of them without any due process and without any regard for conditions,” said the former official, who worked on CRCL investigations into allegations of abuse at several facilities.

A third former official, speaking to the Guardian, warned of dangers for immigrants targeted by ICE.

“If there isn’t oversight that keeps pace, the potential for real danger is great,” that former official said, adding: “You are left to ICE policing itself.”

In 2023, the CRCL’s compliance branch received 3,104 complaints and investigated 25% of them, according to a report to congress.

“I don’t know if they’re actually reading and investigating those complaints or doing anything with the complaints,” said the former CRCL official quoted first in this report.

Sophia Genovese, an immigration attorney and faculty member at Georgetown University Law Center, has submitted over 100 complaints to CRCL.

“Nine people can’t cover a detention center, much less an entire country – especially with so many new detention centers popping up left and right,” she said. “It’s laughable that they think that they can do anything with so few staff.”

As the Trump administration ramps up its enforcement operations, Genovese is seeing an increase of cases of ICE threatening physical violence on immigrants, pressuring them to self-deport – an allegation CRCL would have likely investigated.

“I’m getting referrals every day from people who have family members who are picked up, detained and are being coerced into signing deportation orders,” said Genovese.

Immigrant advocates for years were already frustrated with CRCL’s limited powers. Typically after an investigation, CRCL officials make recommendations to DHS agencies to improve their civil rights practices but can rarely mandate changes.

“Structurally speaking, the way congress set up the agency, there were some real weaknesses,” said Enriquez from RFK. But he argues that any oversight, no matter how limited, is significantly better than no oversight. “A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.

That appears highly unlikely in the current climate.

Gold said of CRCL: “Even with its weaknesses at some level, it did investigations, it could mitigate problems and it provided a really important oversight function – also in terms of just getting information to Congress to do [additional] oversight. And without that, there’s just a blank check for impunity.”

CRCL always used to publish memos about completed investigations and those they were initiating, which, Genovese said, journalists and attorneys found valuable in helping reveal conditions inside ICE detention centers and other problems within the DHS.

But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website. (The Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog, later published the majority of the CRCL public records after they were scrubbed by the DHS).

“It’s a real breakdown in the rule of law. It’s really concerning,” said one former CRCL official. “It’s very upsetting.”

For one thing, his governing strategy has been all but unprecedented. Most presidents who have just won an election are forced to choose whether they want to cash in their political chips to get big things done or build up political capital for future elections. Trump has chosen the first fork in the road with an audacious policy agenda and massive expansions of presidential power. But at the same time, he’s trying to make future elections more promising not by improving his lagging popularity but by rigging the landscape via aggressive gerrymandering and efforts to manipulate voting rules. Because nearly all his power grabs have drawn legal challenges, much of his legacy remains up in the air, slowly moving through the federal court system toward reckonings in a Supreme Court that Trump has done much to shape.

What’s made this situation especially hard to figure out is the Supreme Court’s new habit of relying heavily on its “shadow docket.” This involves temporary rulings on emergency petitions, sometimes from the administration as it seeks relief from lower-court judges who have thwarted Trump’s high-speed agenda, and sometimes from Trump opponents who are trying to slow down the locomotive of unparalleled executive actions. So the state of play on any given issue depends on the interplay of both temporary and regular Supreme Court decisions with the implications of “shadow docket” rulings often clouded by terse orders with no explanation of the legal reasoning. It’s quite a quagmire.

The most familiar set of issues facing the Supreme Court, mostly because litigation on them began early in 2025, involves assertions of presidential authority over matters normally consigned to Congress, the courts, or independent federal agencies. Typically, the administration has found some obscure emergency power intended for situations like wars or natural disasters and asserted the president’s exclusive right to determine when and to what it applies. Accordingly, in 2025 Trump has declared nine separate “emergencies” that give him and his hirelings extraordinary powers over tariffs, exclusion or deportation of refugees, and energy policy, among other things.

Reinforcing these claims of executive preeminence has been a general argument, to which Supreme Court conservatives are receptive, that the president deserves great deference to his actions in any area affecting foreign relations or national security. Trump’s lawyers, for example, claim tariffs are so entwined with diplomacy that restricting his ability to obtain leverage through “trade deals” would hamstring his ability to conduct foreign relations. Similarly, they argue that border control and the immigration policies necessary to maintain it are inherently national-security matters where Congress and the courts should give the chief executive maximum leeway.

Big upcoming Supreme Court decisions involving executive authority include (1) a batch of tariffs cases that will determine whether the centerpiece of Trump’s economic policy will stand or fall; (2) appeals from lower-court decisions restricting the president’s power to arbitrarily deploy military units in U.S. cities; (3) a welter of immigration cases testing the administration’s power to cancel refugee status for hundreds of thousands of migrants, deport “illegals” to countries other than their own, and cancel “birthright citizenship” for children of undocumented immigrants born in this country; and (4) a test of the outer limits of presidential power over executive agencies, especially those created to be independent, like the Federal Reserve Board, which Trump wants to control personally.

In a very real sense, the Supreme Court will determine in the coming weeks and months whether a president determined to act outside traditional executive boundaries can or cannot be meaningfully restrained by Congress or the judiciary. As Christian Farias put it in New York, if the Court acts quickly and decisively in Trump’s favor, it could in just three months effectively make him king.

Aside from the scope of Trump’s powers, the Supreme Court will also have a lot to say about their duration by granting or denying him the power to rig the midterms and perpetuate Republican trifecta control of the federal government. That could make the difference between the Trump 2.0 train roaring toward the end of his presidency at full throttle and a chastened lame-duck president facing obstacles to his reign from a Congress partially controlled by the opposition.

Most immediately, the Supreme Court will decide whether a lower-court decision scrapping his first and most audacious gerrymandering bid will stand. This summer, Trump abruptly ordered Texas to conduct a rare mid-decade remapping of U.S. House districts to help insulate the GOP majority from the midterm electorate. Texas complied, but its new map giving Republicans five new districts was based on a blatantly racial justification provided by Trump’s Justice Department, which led to the adverse judicial ruling on November 18. Now Trump’s lawyers are asking the Supreme Court to intervene and reimpose the gerrymandered map on grounds that the lower court acted too late in the election cycle. The Court will also review a Justice Department suit claiming that the retaliatory Democratic gerrymander approved by California voters on November 4 was unconstitutionally racial in its motivations. If it chose to rule for Trump in both cases, the Supreme Court could swing the midterm map by as much as ten net House seats, aside from its effect on other gerrymandering disputes that might arise. That could be enough to protect the GOP majority in the House.

But the biggest blow to the midterm electorate’s ability to restrain Trump could come from a different case involving Louisiana, in which the Supreme Court has been invited to invalidate the minority vote rights guarantees in Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That case has been argued and reargued before the Court, and a decision could arrive at almost any time. If the Supreme Court acts quickly and sweeps away what’s left of the VRA, it could produce a wave of instant gerrymanders in Republican-controlled states that would be free to dismantle House (and state legislative) districts designed to give Black and Latino citizens some minimal representation. In turn, that could tilt the national map far enough in the GOP’s direction that only a major Democratic wave could dislodge Trump’s total control of Washington.

It’s generally assumed that Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas will give Trump virtually everything he wants and that Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson will dissent powerfully. But three of the remaining Justices (Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) owe their lifetime appointments to Trump, and Chief Justice John Roberts is the jurist who placed this president above the law in last year’s big immunity case.

If the Supreme Court’s conservative majority does give the 47th president a helping hand in expanding and maintaining his power, Democrats might be forced to reconsider their current tendency to subordinate “threat to democracy” warnings to crass material considerations in their midterm messaging. Yes, Trump’s economic policies and broken promises on “affordability” are damaging his and his party’s popularity significantly. But if he’s given royal authority to run wild and the ability to overcome any popular backlash at the polls, then the bad times could continue to roll for at least three more years.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2dc/b98/061454f56aebc966ac4f7183043a362dcc-supremecourt-trump.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 08:01:21.536705

The noise came from 10 drones and three Black Hawk helicopters, Watson says, which dropped armed men on neighbouring rooftops in Chicago's South Shore neighbourhood. On the ground, Watson saw agents deploy out of unmarked cars and rental vans.

“It was bringing people outside because it was such a disturbance. You have people that was thinking UFOs and stuff was landing,” Watson, who livestreamed the situation, told CBC News.

But it wasn't an alien invasion. It was a federal immigration raid involving hundreds of agents.

Eleanor McMullen-Webster was among those arrested.

“When I opened that door, I tell you, I saw that little red light, and that gun was right in my face,” McMullen-Webster told CBC.

Federal agents handcuffed the 64-year-old retiree and her husband, she says, directing them into an apartment where Venezuelan migrants were lined up against a wall.

The raid on the South Shore apartment complex was part of a larger initiative by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to capture the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” in Illinois, according to a press release. Codenamed Operation Midway Blitz, the mission was to capture undocumented migrants allowed to “roam free on American streets” due to the state’s sanctuary policies.

That night, authorities arrested 37 immigrants, mostly Venezuelans, though none have been charged.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says two of them are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan transnational criminal group the U.S. designated a terrorist organization in February, but didn't release names. One of those men denied any association with the organization in an interview with ProPublica.

After being held for more than an hour, McMullen-Webster and her husband were released, without an explanation.

“I felt this small,” said the Chicago resident, still furious at the “disrespectful” way she was treated.

President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has faced sharp criticism, including from former president Barack Obama and Pope Leo, who is from Chicago. Both admonished the vilification of migrants.

But the idea of “saving” Chicago has been ongoing for years.

While running for president in 2016, Trump frequently invoked the city’s violent crime rate, calling Chicago a “war zone” and saying minorities in “inner cities” were “living in hell.”

Two weeks before his assassination, MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk — a Chicago native — spoke out in favour of Trump's efforts to apprehend ""illegal criminals” trying to “take over” the U.S. “from within.” At Kirk’s memorial, Trump said one of the last things Kirk said to him was, “Please, sir, save Chicago.”

“We're going to do that,” Trump told the crowd. “We're going to save Chicago from horrible crime.”

But in the wake of Operation Midway Blitz, Chicagoans themselves are divided over who the criminals are — and who is ultimately responsible for keeping their city safe.

Troops sent to ‘straighten out’ Chicago

The helicopter-assisted ICE raids took place three weeks after Trump threatened the city in a post on Truth Social. It included an image of him as a military commander with the caption, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning,” a reference to the 1979 war film Apocalypse Now.

Trump’s rocky relationship with Chicago goes back years. In 2014, he built a 20-foot-tall steel sign spelling out his name on the city’s Trump Tower. The move drew widespread backlash, including from then-mayor Rahm Emanuel.

As president, Trump blasted the city’s tolerance of illegal immigration, saying violence in Chicago was “worse than some of the places … where you have wars going on.” He frequently took aim at local officials on social media, threatening to “send in the Feds” in January 2017.

Crime in “sanctuary” cities has been a focal point for the second Trump administration. After deploying the National Guard in August to address the “complete and total lawlessness” in Washington, D.C., he again vowed to send federal troops to “straighten out” Chicago.

Robert Reich, a former U.S. secretary of labour, suggested it's all a concerted effort to suppress the vote in the 2026 mid-term elections.

“He is saying to himself and maybe others quietly, this is a way to intimidate [residents],” Reich said. “‘If they're just afraid to be very public in any way, then I win, because they're not going to vote.’”

‘Absolute betrayal’ of American people

The force used by federal agents in the South Shore apartment complex is far from isolated.

In Evanston, Ill., a car was following a vehicle of DHS officers when agents slammed on the brakes, resulting in a crash. While arresting the activists, one of whom was severely beaten by officers, an immigration agent threatened to shoot a civilian filming the arrests.

“I believe that they're acting with total authority, but without any sort of oversight at all, and they should be held accountable for their actions,” said local resident David Brooks, who had a pistol pointed at him.

Michael Rodriguez, a representative for Chicago’s Little Village neighbourhood, characterized the immigration raids as an “absolute betrayal” of the U.S. Constitution and the American people.

“This is a disgrace to our country, to our legacy,"" he said. ""It will live in infamy.”

Democratic Chicago committeeman Raymond Lopez says the violent nature of the raids have made his constituents — many of whom are long-term undocumented, mostly Mexican immigrants — fearful of going outside.

‘Black Americans vs. brown illegals’

Despite growing opposition, some Chicago residents have welcomed Trump’s aggressive actions as a way to keep the city safe.

“When you place unvetted gang members into our buildings amongst us with our kids, then you put us in danger. And that's what we have seen in our communities,” said Danielle Carter-Walters, vice-president of grassroots conservative movement Chicago Flips Red.

The current violent crime rate in Chicago is down about 40 per cent from 2023, which had the most reported incidents in the last decade, city data shows. Crime across Illinois has followed a similar downward trend, though rates of homicide and rape remain higher than the national average.

Ramona Paravola, operations manager of Chicago Flips Red, says poor, often Black neighbourhoods were forced to absorb newcomers under the Biden administration — including more than 30,000 from Texas.

“They are not spreading the load out,” said Paravola, who believes politicians knew that adding migrant shelters to an “affluent white neighbourhood” would face greater backlash.

Seeing migrants receive help that Black Chicagoans have been demanding for years is another source of resentment. In 2024, for example, city officials invested more than $300 million US to address the migrant crisis — money, they say, should have been invested into their communities first.

“How does that happen when they told us that they didn't have these [funds]?” said Carter-Walters.

“It's not Black and brown people. It's Black Americans versus brown illegals,” said Paravola.

Paravola, whose husband is a retired Chicago police officer, says she supports pathways to citizenship for “Dreamers” who come to America, including undocumented migrants without violent criminal records.

“We're not racist,” she said. “We're just intelligent enough to see people as individuals, or as individual communities, and not Black and brown as a big lump.”

ICE facility ‘gates of hell,’ says pastor

Presbyterian minister Rev. David Black has witnessed the violent methods used against immigrants employed against protesters at the ICE detention facility in nearby Broadview, Ill.

Black was praying for ICE agents and calling on them to “repent” on Sept. 19 when officers on the roof of the facility shot him in the face, head and body with pepper balls.

Immediately after, video shows Black shouting, “God is watching you — and you will pay for this!”

“It seems like they've been testing out how much they can get away with … as they suppress free speech and try to dismantle the civil society of a major American city,” Black told CBC News.

When Kat Abughazaleh, a congressional candidate, first visited the Broadview facility for a vigil in the summer, she said ICE “didn’t even board up the windows."" Since then, she has witnessed the “one-sided violence” by ICE agents escalate.

“People were dragged, beaten,” she said.

Abughazaleh, a journalist, was thrown to the ground herself at multiple rallies. In one video that went viral, Abughazaleh can be heard hitting the asphalt after being shoved by immigration officers.

“They shot pepper bullets at the sidewalk and said, ‘Your First Amendment rights are on the sidewalk,’” she said.

Meanwhile, Sister JoAnn Persch, who worked with migrants in the Chicago area for 40 years, was repeatedly denied access to provide spiritual care to detainees at the Broadview facility. Authorities cited “safety reasons.”

“All these years I've been right with immigrants, I've never felt they were going to attack me and surely I was not going to attack them,” said the 91-year-old nun, who was not allowed inside to visit migrants during a Nov. 1 mass.

Earlier this month, the spiritual coalition Persch was a part of sued the federal government for what they allege are violations of First Amendment rights to religious freedom.

Persch, a Sister of Mercy who got a state law passed in 2009 to allow pastoral workers into immigration facilities, said the situation made her “extremely sad.”

“There's just so many human rights being violated in that building. So we just have to keep working for human and religious rights,” said Persch, who died on Nov. 14.

Border Patrol commander ‘outright lying’

Two months since the beginning of Operation Midway Blitz, federal authorities and Chicago locals still find themselves at odds on whether the mission to “save” Chicago has succeeded.

At the end of October, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem boasted that agents “arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens including rapists, murderers and gang members” since September.

But a Chicago Tribune analysis of government records found that of 614 arrestees whose names were released by the Department of Justice, only 16 — or 2.6 per cent — had criminal histories.

U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has defended the agency’s tactics, asserting in an interview that their “operations are airtight — legal, ethical and moral.”

But the widespread use of force has led to judicial scrutiny of the government’s tactics in Chicago. Bovino was subpoenaed to appear in federal court about his agents’ use of force against protesters in the Chicago area, and in a 233-page ruling released Nov. 20, Judge Sara L. Ellis identified “inconsistencies” in his testimony.

Ellis said Bovino “appeared evasive” throughout his deposition, either providing “cute” responses to the plaintiffs’ questions or “outright lying.”

The judge wrote that videos contradicted Bovino’s claims that his agents’ use of force was justified.

Ellis’s ruling prevents federal agents from using tear gas against people who do not pose a threat. A federal appeals court paused the injunction on Nov. 19, calling it “overbroad” and “too prescriptive.”

DHS did not respond to multiple requests from CBC News to interview Bovino.

U.S. Border Patrol agents ultimately left Chicago in mid-November. Committeeman Rodriguez believes resistance efforts in the city were a large factor.

“It wasn't just the weather. I think [federal agents] knew they encountered people that weren't gonna take their BS,” he said. “We know what makes us safe. We keep us safe. Not Donald Trump.”

But Abughazaleh believes this fight won't be “over” for years.

“We're living in a horror movie,” she said. “A lot of our most important systems are being razed to the ground. But that does mean that we have an opportunity to build something better.”","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/b0caa8fa-b7f5-437a-ba4f-d364e5e0c314,1764351415388/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C310%2C5961%2C3353%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-30 06:56:26.935725

The Supreme Court of Ohio’s decision in State ex rel. Brown v. Columbiana County Jail, 2025-Ohio-5280, is a significant follow-up to its earlier 2024 opinion in the same matter. While the first decision granted a limited writ of mandamus compelling the Columbiana County Sheriff’s Office to obtain certain jail records from private contractors, this second opinion addresses two distinct issues:

whether the relator, an incarcerated requester, is entitled to statutory damages under Ohio’s Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43; and

whether the sheriff should be held in contempt and sanctioned for alleged noncompliance with the court’s limited writ.

Relator Terry Brown, an inmate at Belmont Correctional Institution, sought records relating to the Columbiana County Jail’s intake and booking policies, personnel, and records-retention policies. The jail is operated under contracts with private administrators—Correctional Solutions Group, L.L.C. (“CSG”) and Community Education Centers, Inc./GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”). Brown initially obtained a limited writ ordering the sheriff to obtain specified records from these private entities and to certify nonexistence if records could not be found.

After the sheriff filed a notice of compliance, Brown moved for contempt and sanctions and also sought statutory damages. The majority opinion (DeWine, J.) denies both statutory damages and contempt. Justice Brunner concurs in part and dissents in part, agreeing that contempt is unwarranted but arguing that Brown should receive statutory damages.

The decision clarifies:

the evidentiary burden for statutory damages, particularly when requests are transmitted by a third party or by non-qualifying means such as fax;

the unresolved status of non-attorney “agents” transmitting requests on behalf of others;

the standards governing contempt for noncompliance with a public-records writ where third-party contractors hold the records; and

the continuing role of the quasi-agency doctrine in accessing records in the hands of private contractors, even as the court expresses skepticism about suing only the public office rather than the contractor directly.

II. Summary of the Opinion

A. Procedural Posture

In Brown v. Columbiana Cty. Jail, 2024-Ohio-4969, the court granted a limited writ of mandamus ordering the Corrections Division of the Columbiana County Sheriff’s Office and Sheriff Brian McLaughlin (“the sheriff”) to:

produce specific requested records to Brown; or

certify that such records do not exist.

The court required the sheriff to seek and obtain records from CSG and GEO, the private jail operators, under a quasi-agency theory of public-records jurisdiction. It specifically deferred ruling on statutory damages until the sheriff complied with the writ.

After the sheriff filed a notice of compliance, Brown responded with:

a motion, later amended, for contempt and sanctions, alleging noncompliance; and

a request for statutory damages under R.C. 149.43(C).

B. Holding

The court holds:

Statutory damages denied. Brown failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that he transmitted his public-records requests in one of the statutorily qualifying ways (hand delivery, certified mail, or electronic submission) such that statutory damages are available.

Contempt and sanctions denied. Brown did not show that the sheriff disobeyed or resisted the court’s limited writ, as required for contempt under R.C. 2705.02(A).

C. Key Doctrinal Points

Transmission requirement for statutory damages: Even when a requester ultimately receives some records after litigation, statutory damages are not automatic. The requester bears the burden to prove proper transmission by a qualifying method.

Fax is not a qualifying method: Requests faxed to a public office do not support statutory damages.

Third-party email and agency: The court declines to decide whether a requester can obtain statutory damages when a non-attorney agent emails the request, but holds that Brown failed to prove that the friend who emailed his request was in fact his authorized agent.

Contempt standard: A public office is not in contempt where it has made good-faith efforts to comply with a limited writ ordering it to obtain records from private contractors, even if the contractors decline to produce certain categories of records or state that none exist.

III. Legal and Factual Background

A. The Underlying Public-Records Requests

Brown’s August 2023 requests to the sheriff concerned:

Policy records – policies on inmate intake and booking procedures, including specific policy-related “information” about:

lost, stolen, or misplaced inmate records;

drug testing and toxicity testing for impaired inmates; and

mental health and psychiatric evaluation processes at booking.

Personnel records – records about jail personnel for a specific historical period (January 1, 2017, to July 1, 2018).

Retention policies – records-retention schedules and related policies, including for jail activity logs.

He claims that:

he tried hand delivery but was refused;

he attempted certified mail, which was returned as undeliverable; and

he ultimately submitted the requests by fax.

Separately, a third party, Christine Serna, emailed the requests to the sheriff and averred in an affidavit that she acted with “Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’ for Terry Brown.”

B. The Private Jail Administrators

Columbiana County contracts with:

GEO, which operated the jail from 2014 to approximately 2019; and

CSG, which began operating the jail in January 2022.

In the earlier phase of the case, the sheriff had responded that many of the requested records were not in his possession but instead were maintained by CSG (or, for earlier years, GEO), and thus Brown should direct his requests to those companies. Brown instead filed a mandamus action against the sheriff and the “Columbiana County Jail.” The court dismissed the jail as a non-entity but granted a limited writ against the sheriff.

C. The Limited Writ (2024 Decision) and Quasi-Agency

In Brown, 2024-Ohio-4969, the court declined to treat CSG and GEO as defendants because Brown did not sue them and had not made direct public-records requests to them. The court also found that its functional-equivalency line of cases (making certain private entities directly subject to the Public Records Act) did not apply, because the private contractors were not parties.

Instead, the court invoked a quasi-agency doctrine derived from State ex rel. Mazzaro v. Ferguson, 49 Ohio St.3d 37 (1990), holding that:

Records held by a private entity can be within the “jurisdiction” of a public office when they are created and maintained to carry out the public office’s duties and where the public office can monitor performance and access the records.

On that basis, the court ordered the sheriff to:

request and obtain relevant records from CSG and GEO; or

certify that such records do not exist.

Importantly, the court did not require that the sheriff maintain control over CSG or GEO for quasi-agency to apply; it was enough that the entities were performing a “delegated public duty.”

IV. Precedents and Authorities Cited

A. Public Records Act and Private Entities

R.C. 149.43 (Ohio Public Records Act): establishes the right of any person to inspect and obtain copies of public records, defines “public record,” and sets forth procedures and remedies, including statutory damages.

State ex rel. Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, 2006-Ohio-4854:

Establishes a strong presumption that private entities are not “public offices” subject to the Act.

Creates an exception where a private entity is the functional equivalent of a public office.

State ex rel. Harm Reduction Ohio v. OneOhio Recovery Found., 2023-Ohio-1547:

Applies the functional-equivalency test to a private foundation, holding it subject to the Public Records Act.

Confirms that when a private entity is a functional equivalent of a public office, a requester may sue it directly in mandamus for access to records.

State ex rel. Mazzaro v. Ferguson, 49 Ohio St.3d 37 (1990):

Articulates the quasi-agency test used in the earlier phase of this case.

Holds that records in the possession of a private entity can be deemed public records if:

the private entity prepared the records to carry out the public office’s responsibilities;

the public office can monitor the private entity’s performance; and

the public office has access to the records for that purpose.

Also emphasizes, in construing R.C. 149.43(C), that a requester may sue either the public office or the person responsible for the records—a point later stressed in Justice Brunner’s opinion.

State ex rel. Armatas v. Plain Twp. Bd. of Trustees, 2021-Ohio-1176:

Confirms and applies the quasi-agency concept, requiring a public office to obtain records held by a private entity performing delegated public functions.

Forms the doctrinal backbone for the limited writ issued in the earlier Brown decision.

B. Statutory Damages and Methods of Transmission

R.C. 149.43(C)(2)–(3) (pre–April 9, 2025 version):

A requester may be entitled to statutory damages if a public office fails to comply with its obligations under the Public Records Act.

To be eligible, the request must be transmitted by:

hand delivery,

certified mail, or

electronic submission (e.g., email, and in some circumstances, web-based portals) as specified in the statute.

Effective April 9, 2025, R.C. 149.43 was amended (2024 Sub.H.B. No. 265) to bar statutory damages for persons committed to the custody of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, but the court applies the pre-amendment version to Brown’s case.

State ex rel. Grim v. New Holland, 2024-Ohio-4822:

Holds that the requester bears the burden to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, entitlement to statutory damages.

State ex rel. Sultaana v. Mansfield Corr. Inst., 2023-Ohio-1177:

Holds that faxed public-records requests do not qualify for statutory damages.

State ex rel. Brinkman v. Toledo City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., 2024-Ohio-5063:

Holds that a requester is eligible for statutory damages when his attorney submits public-records requests by email on his behalf.

Demonstrates that attorney-transmitted electronic requests are treated as requests by the client for statutory-damages purposes.

C. Scope of Requests: Information vs Records

State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, 2006-Ohio-6365:

Clarifies that the Public Records Act provides a right to records, not general “information.”

“Requests for information…are improper requests under R.C. 149.43.”

State ex rel. Lanham v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., 1997-Ohio-104:

Holds that a request framed only as a demand for “information” rather than specific records is not a proper public-records request.

D. Contempt Statute and Agency Law

R.C. 2705.02(A):

Defines contempt to include “[d]isobedience of, or resistance to, a lawful writ.”

Provides the statutory basis for sanctions such as fines or imprisonment for contempt of court orders.

Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (referenced by the majority):

Defines “disobedience” as refusal or negligence in obeying a command.

Guides the court’s analysis of whether the sheriff’s conduct qualifies as “disobedience.”

Turner v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 2020-Ohio-248 (10th Dist. App.) (cited by Justice Brunner):

Notes that an agency relationship can be implied; written documentation is not always required to establish agency authority.

Supports Brunner’s criticism of the majority’s apparent insistence on documentary proof of power of attorney or written authorization.

V. The Court’s Legal Reasoning

A. Statutory Damages: Transmission and Proof

1. Brown’s Methods of Transmission

Under R.C. 149.43(C)(2), to even be eligible for statutory damages, a requester must show that his request was transmitted by:

hand delivery to the public office; or

certified mail; or

electronic submission (e.g., email).

Brown relied on three methods:

Attempted hand delivery to the sheriff (allegedly refused).

Certified mail to the Columbiana County Jail, returned undeliverable.

Fax to the sheriff.

Email submitted by Serna, claiming to act as Brown’s agent.

2. Hand Delivery and Certified Mail: “Successful” Transmission

The majority holds that Brown did not carry his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, successful transmission by hand delivery or certified mail:

Brown’s affidavit asserts that he “attempted” hand delivery but was refused. He does not identify:

who refused the hand delivery; or

how, as an incarcerated person at Belmont Correctional Institution, he could have personally accomplished hand delivery to the sheriff in Columbiana County.

The certified-mail attempt was provably unsuccessful: the mailing was returned as “not deliverable as addressed.”

Because R.C. 149.43(C) contemplates actual delivery of the request by a specified method, not merely an attempt, the court concludes that Brown fails to prove successful transmission under either hand delivery or certified mail.

3. Faxed Requests: Categorical Exclusion

Brown faxed the requests to the sheriff, but under Sultaana, faxed requests do not qualify for statutory damages. The majority applies this rule directly: fax submission cannot serve as the predicate for statutory damages.

4. Email by a Non-Attorney “Agent”

Serna submitted the public-records requests to the sheriff by email, stating in her affidavit that she acted with “Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’ for Terry Brown.” Brown argued that this satisfied the electronic-submission requirement.

The majority’s analysis proceeds in two steps:

Unresolved legal question. The court notes it has never squarely addressed whether a requester can obtain statutory damages when his non-attorney agent (rather than the requester himself or his licensed attorney) transmits the email request. By contrast, Brinkman held that an attorney-sent email request qualifies the client for statutory damages.

No clear and convincing evidence of agency. The majority finds it unnecessary to answer that broader question because Brown did not sufficiently prove that Serna was in fact his agent:

Brown provided no documentation of any executed power of attorney.

Serna is not an attorney and does not claim to be licensed to practice law.

Her statement that she acted “with Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’” is characterized as a conclusory assertion, insufficient to meet the clear-and-convincing standard.

Accordingly, the court holds:

“Serna’s conclusory statement that she was acting ‘with Power of Attorney and “Agent Status” for Terry Brown’ is not clear and convincing evidence that Brown executed a power of attorney authorizing her as his agent.”

Because Brown fails to prove any qualifying transmission method, the court denies statutory damages altogether.

B. Contempt and Sanctions: Disobedience and Resistance

Brown sought to hold the sheriff in contempt under R.C. 2705.02(A) for:

alleged failures to produce policy records (requests 4, 5, 11, 12);

incomplete or missing personnel records (requests 1, 2, 6, 7); and

failure to provide a records-retention schedule specific to the jail.

The court’s contempt analysis emphasizes two key points:

The sheriff’s obligation is limited by the court’s writ. The writ required the sheriff to:

request records from CSG and GEO; and

provide Brown with the records obtained or certify nonexistence.

It did not empower the sheriff to compel CSG or GEO to maintain or create records, nor to override their determinations about nonexistence or overbreadth.

Contempt requires “disobedience” or “resistance.” Relying on dictionary definitions, the court distinguishes:

Disobedience – refusal or negligent failure to obey a command.

Resistance – active opposition to execution of a command.

The court finds that the sheriff:

complied with the writ by:

promptly requesting records from both CSG and GEO;

forwarding whatever records those companies provided; and

conveying their representations as to overbreadth or nonexistence.

did not obstruct or undermine Brown’s ability to narrow or clarify his requests; indeed, the sheriff:

transmitted CSG’s invitation to Brown to “be more specific” about the policy requests; and

affirmatively invited Brown to “discuss the outstanding records being sought” with the sheriff.

Any alleged gaps in the production stem, in the court’s view, from:

the vagueness or scope of Brown’s requests; or

the limitations asserted by CSG and GEO (e.g., that they had no statistical data, that they had no responsive personnel documents, or that no separate jail-specific retention schedule exists).

Because these are not actions of the sheriff in “disobedience” or “resistance” to the writ, the court finds no basis for contempt.

1. Policy-Records Requests (Nos. 4, 5, 11, 12)

Request No. 5 (“statistics on how often inmate case files or medical records are lost, stolen, or misplaced”):

CSG responded that it was “not in possession of any statistical data you have requested.”

The majority notes that even if individual incidents of lost or misplaced files occurred, this does not prove the existence of a statistical dataset; thus, the sheriff did not defy the writ by forwarding CSG’s statement of nonexistence.

Requests Nos. 4, 11, 12 (policy information on lost records; drug testing; mental-health evaluation):

CSG labeled these requests “overly broad” and invited Brown to specify more precisely the documents he sought.

CSG also stated that it was not required to “create information or documents that do not exist.”

The sheriff relayed this to Brown and further invited Brown to refine his requests.

Brown did not narrow or clarify, but instead moved for contempt.

The majority underscores that:

“True, CSG didn’t provide records that the sheriff asked it to provide. But any fault for that…lies with CSG, not the sheriff.”

Thus, the sheriff neither disobeyed nor resisted the writ as to policy records.

2. Personnel-Records Requests (Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7)

Requests Nos. 1, 6, 7:

GEO responded that it had no responsive records.

The sheriff forwarded GEO’s letter to Brown, thereby complying with the requirement to “obtain records or certify nonexistence” as communicated by the contractor.

Request No. 2:

GEO did provide some personnel records, which the sheriff transmitted to Brown.

Brown alleged that some temporary employee names and positions were omitted, suggesting incomplete production.

The majority notes:

Neither Brown nor the sheriff filed these documents in the Supreme Court record, making it impossible to assess the alleged omissions.

Any alleged omission is at best attributable to GEO, not the sheriff.

Again, the sheriff’s actions fit the court’s understanding of full compliance, not contemptuous resistance.

3. Records-Retention Schedule

Brown argued that he did not receive a “records-retention schedule for the Columbiana County Jail,” distinct from the sheriff’s office schedule.

The sheriff replied:

he has provided the only retention schedule he maintains, a seven-page document covering both sheriff’s office and jail records, including the daily jail activity log; and

no separate jail-only retention schedule exists.

Finding nothing in the record to contradict this, the court concludes that the sheriff complied with the writ. There is no contempt.

VI. Justice Brunner’s Concurrence in Part and Dissent in Part

A. Agreement on Contempt

Justice Brunner agrees that the sheriff complied with the limited writ and that contempt is unwarranted. She sees no basis to revisit the reasoning of the previous decision granting the writ under quasi-agency.

B. Critique of Majority’s Characterization of the Earlier Writ

Brunner resists the majority’s suggestion that Brown could or should have sued CSG and GEO directly:

She notes that private contractors in correctional settings often resist being characterized as public offices or as subject to the Public Records Act, citing recent litigation where private vendors have moved to dismiss on those grounds (e.g., Ware v. Pierce; pending motions by Aramark, Trinity Services Group, and Securus Technologies).

Under Mazzaro and R.C. 149.43(C), a mandamus action may be filed against either:

the public office (here, the sheriff’s office); or

the person responsible for public records (here, arguably CSG and GEO).

She stresses that Brown’s choice to sue only the sheriff’s office was lawful and effective; indeed, he prevailed in obtaining a limited writ.

In her view, it is ""unnecessary and overly critical"" for the majority to revisit and implicitly fault Brown’s litigation choices.

C. Statutory Damages: Agency and Evidence

Justice Brunner strongly disagrees with the majority’s denial of statutory damages. Her key points:

Delivery by email is established.

Brown’s affidavit states that, after other methods failed, the requests were submitted by fax and by email.

Serna’s affidavit confirms that she emailed two public-records requests on Brown’s behalf to the sheriff’s office.

These sworn statements, taken together, are sufficient to prove that the requests were delivered by email, satisfying the transmission requirement of R.C. 149.43(C)(3).

No dispute by the sheriff’s office.

The sheriff did not oppose damages on the ground that email transmission was defective or that Serna lacked authority; rather, the sheriff’s argument focused on a purported good-faith belief about not having to obtain records from private contractors.

In Brunner’s view, the majority raises an issue—non-attorney agency—that was never argued by the respondents, and then decides it against Brown without necessity.

Agency can be implied.

Citing Turner v. Univ. of Cincinnati, Brunner notes that an agency relationship does not always require written documentation.

Serna and Brown are both laypersons; Serna’s reference to “Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’” should be read as a lay description of her authority to send the email at Brown’s request.

Requiring formal, documentary proof of a power of attorney in this context is, in her view, an unwarranted evidentiary hurdle not supported by R.C. 149.43.

Good-faith reduction of damages rejected.

Under R.C. 149.43(C)(3)(a), statutory damages may be reduced if, based on existing law, a well-informed public office could reasonably believe its conduct complied with the statute.

The sheriff’s office claims that it in good faith believed it did not need to obtain records from the private jail administrators and could instead direct Brown to request them directly.

Brunner points out that Armatas (2021) had already held that a public office must obtain records from a private contractor in a quasi-agency relationship, and the court awarded damages there. Thus, the sheriff’s position was not “reasonable” under existing law.

On that basis, she would award Brown $1,000 in statutory damages, the maximum allowed, without reduction for good faith.

Brunner concludes that the majority’s denial of damages is premised on an “illusory and unnecessary inquiry” into Serna’s agency status and adds a requirement—documentary proof of power of attorney—that is not rooted in statute or precedent.

VII. Complex Concepts Simplified

A. Mandamus

A writ of mandamus is a court order compelling a government officer or agency to do something the law clearly requires it to do. In the public-records context, mandamus is the primary vehicle for forcing compliance with the Public Records Act when a public office fails to produce requested records.

B. Statutory Damages under the Public Records Act

Statutory damages are a set amount of money made available by statute, not based on actual monetary loss. Under R.C. 149.43(C):

They are designed to encourage compliance with the Public Records Act and compensate requesters for delay or wrongful denial of records.

However, they are only available if:

the request was delivered via a qualifying method (hand delivery, certified mail, electronic submission); and

the public office failed to comply with certain statutory obligations.

As of April 9, 2025, inmates in state custody are no longer eligible for statutory damages, though this change does not retroactively affect Brown’s case.

C. Clear and Convincing Evidence

“Clear and convincing evidence” is a standard of proof higher than “preponderance of the evidence” (more likely than not) but lower than “beyond a reasonable doubt.” It requires evidence that produces a firm belief or conviction in the factfinder’s mind about the facts to be proven.

Here, Brown had to present clear and convincing evidence that he transmitted the request by a qualifying method. The majority found his evidence (particularly regarding hand delivery, certified mail, and Serna’s agency) insufficient at that elevated standard.

D. Quasi-Agency vs. Functional Equivalency

Functional Equivalency:

Asks whether a nominally private entity functions so much like a public office (e.g., in governance, funding, purpose, and level of public control) that it should itself be treated as a “public office” directly subject to the Public Records Act.

If so, requesters can sue the private entity directly.

Quasi-Agency:

Does not make the private entity a public office.

Instead, treats certain records in the contractor’s possession as being within the “jurisdiction” of the public office for purposes of public-records disclosure when:

they were prepared to carry out the public office’s duties,

the public office can monitor performance, and

the public office has access to the records.

The public office remains the mandamus respondent, but must obtain and produce records from the contractor where these elements are met.

E. Contempt of Court

Contempt is a court’s power to punish conduct that disobeys or obstructs its orders. Under R.C. 2705.02(A), contempt includes:

Disobedience – a refusal or negligent failure to do what a court order requires (e.g., ignoring a court-ordered obligation).

Resistance – actively opposing or hindering enforcement of the order (e.g., undermining or obstructing compliance).

In this case, the sheriff promptly requested documents from CSG and GEO, forwarded what he received, and transmitted their explanations of nonexistence or overbreadth. The court found no evidence that he refused to comply or actively obstructed compliance with the writ.

F. Requests for “Information” vs. Requests for “Records”

The Public Records Act guarantees access to records, not to general “information.” A proper request should describe records—documents, files, emails, logs, policies—rather than ask generalized questions.

The court notes (in a footnote) that Brown's wording (“policy information” on various topics) might be viewed as an improper request for information rather than records, but it declines to decide the issue because the sheriff did not raise it.

VIII. Impact and Implications

A. For Incarcerated Requesters and Statutory Damages

This case is a transitional decision, important both for how it applies the pre-2025 statutory regime and for what it implies going forward:

It underscores that imprisoned requesters must strictly satisfy procedural prerequisites to preserve statutory-damages claims, including:

ensuring successful delivery by a qualifying method; and

maintaining documentary or testimonial proof sufficient to meet the clear-and-convincing standard.

However, after April 9, 2025, R.C. 149.43 bars statutory damages to persons committed to ODRC custody, making the transmission issues litigated here largely academic for future inmate-requesters (though they can still obtain records and possibly court costs or other relief).

B. For Use of Agents and Third-Party Intermediaries

The decision leaves unresolved but fraught questions about using non-attorney agents to submit requests:

The majority avoids deciding whether statutory damages are available when a non-attorney agent emails a request on a requester’s behalf.

It signals that conclusory statements in an affidavit about “Power of Attorney” or “agent status” will not, by themselves, suffice; more concrete evidence of authorization may be needed to meet the clear-and-convincing standard.

Justice Brunner’s dissent suggests a more flexible, pragmatic approach: testimony that a friend was authorized to send the email may be enough, especially if unchallenged by the public office.

For practitioners and requesters:

If possible, submit requests personally by email or certified mail, or through a licensed attorney.

If relying on a non-attorney intermediary, consider:

executing a short written authorization; and

keeping documentation showing that the intermediary acted at the requester’s direction.

C. For Public Offices Working with Private Contractors

The opinion reinforces and clarifies obligations of public offices that outsource operations:

Public offices must request records from private contractors when a quasi-agency relationship exists.

However, they will generally not be held in contempt for the contractor’s refusal or limitations, so long as they:

make timely requests to the contractor;

forward all responsive records received; and

communicate to the requester any statements from the contractor regarding overbreadth or nonexistence.

This creates a practical division of responsibility:

The public office must act diligently and transparently; and

The private contractor bears responsibility (doctrinally and practically) for any underproduction, although the contractor may not be directly before the court unless separately sued or deemed a functional equivalent of a public office.

D. Contempt as an Enforcement Tool in Public-Records Cases

The court’s rigorous definition of “disobedience” and “resistance” somewhat narrows the use of contempt as an enforcement mechanism against public offices that rely on private contractors:

Even where records remain missing or incomplete, contempt will not lie if the public office has:

taken reasonable steps to comply;

documented those efforts; and

not obstructed or delayed production.

Requesters facing nonresponsive contractors may need to:

directly sue the contractor (if it is or may be a functional equivalent of a public office); or

seek expansion of the writ to bring the contractor into the case where legally possible.

E. Internal Division on Statutory Damages Standards

The sharp disagreement between the majority and Justice Brunner highlights a doctrinal tension:

How strictly should courts enforce technical prerequisites (like documentary proof of agency) for statutory damages?

To what extent should courts infer agency or rely on uncontradicted affidavits from laypersons?

Future cases may need to address squarely:

whether non-attorney agents can trigger statutory damages when they email a request on another’s behalf; and

what type and quantum of evidence is necessary to show an agency relationship for this purpose.

IX. Conclusion

State ex rel. Brown v. Columbiana County Jail, 2025-Ohio-5280, consolidates and extends several important strands of Ohio public-records law:

It confirms that statutory damages are never automatic; requesters must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that their requests were delivered by one of the specified methods in R.C. 149.43(C).

It reiterates that faxed requests do not qualify for statutory damages and emphasizes the need for robust evidentiary support when requests are transmitted via intermediaries.

It clarifies that public offices that rely on private contractors may be obligated to seek records from those contractors under quasi-agency principles, but will not necessarily face contempt if the contractors do not comply, provided the public office has obeyed the court’s writ in good faith.

It underscores the ongoing complexity of public-records enforcement in a landscape increasingly populated by private vendors and jail/prison contractors, where lines of responsibility are often contested.

Justice Brunner’s separate opinion underscores a countervailing policy concern: that rigid, technical applications of statutory prerequisites and evidentiary standards may unduly limit the remedial force of the Public Records Act, especially for incarcerated and pro se requesters. She would have awarded Brown $1,000 in statutory damages, finding that existing quasi-agency caselaw gave the sheriff fair notice of his duties and that Brown’s affidavits sufficed to show valid email transmission.

Overall, Brown refines Ohio’s law on statutory damages and contempt in public-records litigation, particularly in the context of privatized correctional operations and third-party intermediaries. For public offices, it highlights the importance of prompt, documented efforts to obtain records from contractors and clear communication with requesters. For requesters and practitioners, it reinforces the need for careful attention to method of delivery, documentation of transmission and agency, and strategic consideration of whether and when to bring private entities directly into public-records litigation.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:58:05.288443

Call for Applications

Irish Yearbook of International Law: The editors of the Irish Yearbook of International Law welcome expressions of interest from persons interested in taking on the role of Editor(s) in Chief.

Since its foundation, the Yearbook has always had at least two Joint Editors-in-Chief, supported by an editorial board and advisory committee. The current Editors-in-Chief are James Gallen (DCU), Richard Collins (QUB) and Bríd Ní Ghráinne (Maynooth).

The primary responsibilities of the Editors-in-Chief are to liaise with the publisher (Hart Bloomsbury), generate and manage article submissions, oversee the commissioning and editing of correspondents’ reports, and to oversee generation and editing of book reviews. The Editors-in-Chief should have expertise in any area of Public or Private International Law and should have some connection with Ireland, for example, employment/ previous employment in Ireland and/or has received an educational qualification from an institution in Ireland. The IYIL is published once per year, and the new Editors-in-Chief should be in place to take the lead on the 2024 Yearbook (to be published in 2026). The outgoing Editors-in-Chief will provide transitional support.

Expressions of interest in the form of a cover letter and CV should be sent to the outgoing editors by 15 January 2026 (james.gallen@dcu.ie; rcollins@qub.ac.uk; brid.nighrainne@mu.ie). We welcome combined expressions of interest from persons proposing to act as Joint Editors-in-Chief, or expressions of interest from individuals. In the latter case, we may propose the role be shared between two or more persons who express an interest.

Calls for Papers

Human Rights and the Crises of Global Order: The Nordic Journal of Human Rights invites submissions of papers presenting innovative scholarship analysing the multiple challenges facing the international human rights project amid shifting global power relations in contemporary world politics and seeking to address issues such as:

How are international human rights institutions – and the actors within them – adapting to geopolitical and normative transformations?

How can we distinguish between the use and abuse of human rights claims in an increasingly plural global landscape?

How do human rights defenders and policymakers need to rethink strategies, concepts, and methodologies to confront the erosion of democracy, ongoing armed conflicts, or the evolving conditions for accountability and justice?

The journal takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights as legal, political, and social practice. We publish high-quality scholarship analysing the past, present and future of human rights from a variety of theoretical and methodological viewpoints. For more information, see here.

Climate Apartheid – Law, Economy, Culture: The “Climate Apartheid: Law, Economy, Culture” project at the Institute of Advanced Study, Durham University, invites papers for its conference on the same topic on 24-25 March 2026. The term ‘climate apartheid’ was first coined in 2007 by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to raise alarm about uneven patterns of climate change adaptation. In 2019, the concept gained more international attention when the Special Rapporteur Philip Alston warned the UN Human Rights Council that ‘climate apartheid’ was a ‘scenario’ in which the ‘wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict, while the rest of the world is left to suffer.’ Since then, ‘climate apartheid’ has been invoked or implied in a range of contexts from academic analyses to climate and racial justice activism and concerning border enforcement and immigration policy, infrastructural development, the law, the development of emergent technologies, climate colonialism, responsibilities for loss and damage, climate adaptation, and climate-resilient urbanism. Despite the proliferation of the concept’s use, however, it remains unclear how it is and ought to be precisely comprehended and utilized, for whom the concept is available, how it can be distinguishable from other concepts including ‘climate justice’, and what opportunities or barriers it creates. In this conference we aim to take an interdisciplinary approach understand how climate apartheid is, has been, and could be used. Abstracts of up to 500 words are due 16 January; more details and a submission form are available here.

His reluctance to declare himself a Democrat publicly is tied up with what he finds objectionable about the current administration.
Republicans used to be willing to discuss issues with the other side “to come up with solution(s),” he said.
Most participants in the vigil were middle aged at least, but it was heartening to see some younger ones, said Koller, who is 65.
It was a pretty good turnout for a Sunday evening, according to Carol Taylor, president of Invisible Blair County and vigil organizer.","About 50 people took part in Indivisible Blair County’s “Lights for Liberty Vigil” near the Blair County Courthouse on Sunday evening to call attention to “the inhumane treatment of refugees, immigrants and their families,” as stated in a flier for the event.

Participants carried battery-operated candles, wore small placards reading “No Kings; No ICE; No Fear” attached to lanyards around their necks and they processed quietly along the sidewalk from the courthouse to the

Diamond, then back again via the sidewalk across the street.

There were a few friendly beeps, but no counter-protesters and no negative interactions with the general public, as police in patrol cars passed by periodically.

“I’m just fed up with the (Trump) administration,” said Billie Conrad of Altoona, as she walked back toward the courthouse on one of several circuits. “There’s a right way and a wrong way (to handle immigration), and they’re doing it the wrong way.”

Raised as a non-denominational Christian, Caleb McCoy of Altoona is angry that supporters of the administration’s policies present themselves as Christian nationalists.

“It turns my stomach,” said McCoy, who no longer considers himself a Christian. It’s a “betrayal” of “what we as a nation purport to stand for,” he said.

Warrantless arrests based on the color of arrestees’ skin or their accents, “blatant intentional infliction of harm,” violation of due process, “disregard of basic human rights,” and lack of accountability are among the issues that upset him, McCoy said.

A former longtime Republican who’s now a Democrat asked that only his first name be used – then asked for even that to be withheld.

He was involved in Republican politics for years and retains many Republican friends and associates and is “not looking to burn any bridges,” he said.

His reluctance to declare himself a Democrat publicly is tied up with what he finds objectionable about the current administration.

Republicans used to be willing to discuss issues with the other side “to come up with solution(s),” he said.

“Now, it’s a war,” he said. “(And) I disagree with the Republican side.”

He cited unpleasant interactions with passing motorists experienced by individuals who’ve protested in front of the office of U.S. Rep. John Joyce as evidence that things could get unpleasant for him.

He knows other Republicans who share his feelings about the administration – and also his reluctance to express misgivings publicly.

Those friends say they’ll make their statements in private at the ballot box, he said.

“People are afraid to speak up because of the backlash,” he said.

His presence in Hollidaysburg on Sunday was an effort “to help in a small way,” he said.

“Another guy standing there with a light,” he said.

It’s critical for groups like Indivisible to gain adherents, including people like him, locally, statewide and nationally, he said.

That will send a message to the politicians, he said.

As for the politicians, those who have fallen “in line need to get a backbone and stand up for what is right,” he said.

He has hope for the 2026 midterms, he said.

“We need to try and start making corrections to this problem,” he said.

Ed Koller of Carson Valley feels like the Trump administration has “broken (his) spirit.”

“I don’t know how this reprehensible human being got elected,” Koller said. “I don’t understand how the whole half of the country accepted this.”

As a Navy Seabee from 1978-82, he also doesn’t understand “how a military man can serve him,” Koller said.

Most participants in the vigil were middle aged at least, but it was heartening to see some younger ones, said Koller, who is 65.

Detentions of immigrants followed by their disappearance into other countries – sometimes countries other than where they originated, are among the administration’s actions that upset Bill Kelley of Tyrone.

This country’s economy needs immigrants, said Dave Galbraith.

They’re needed especially in states like California, where he once lived, he said.

Businesses that depend on immigrants are hurting for workers, he said.

Immigrants are avoiding places they need to go, for fear of arrest, he said.

Those include health care providers and places where they can get food, he said.

It was a pretty good turnout for a Sunday evening, according to Carol Taylor, president of Invisible Blair County and vigil organizer.

People generally believe in Constitutional due process – and that violations are “anathema” in the U.S., Taylor said.

We also extend our heartfelt wishes for a full and speedy recovery to Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, who was critically injured in the same attack.

The attack is under investigation as a possible terrorist attack. Authorities have identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who previously worked as a member of an Afghan CIA partner force in Afghanistan until 2021.

AHRC unequivocally condemns this vile act of violence, regardless of the motive of the shooter. At the same time, we caution against collective blame and generalizations that unfairly target Afghan asylees, migrants, or any community based on race, faith, or national origin.

The Trump administration has pursued restrictive, harsh, and inhumane immigration policies, and the recent shooting in Washington, D.C., is being used to intensify and escalate this agenda and as ammunition in the war on immigration, both legal and illegal.

The Wall Street Journal of November 28 published an article entitled ‘After D.C. National Guard Shooting, Trump Steps Up Immigration Crackdown: White House pushes for ‘reverse migration’ and aims to expand restrictions on nations it deems high risk,’ an article that should raise alarm in the human rights community. The harsh and inhumane immigration policy started before the shooting. No criminal violent act makes a barely legal and inhumane policy acceptable.

We recognize the importance of effective security vetting, as emphasized by President Trump, but stress that broad crackdowns or sweeping labels against entire communities are extreme measures that foster fear, anxiety, and mistrust. They are also ineffective and counterproductive. The US already has high-level vetting process in place.

AHRC stands in solidarity with the families of the victims, expresses its deepest condolences for the loss of Sarah Beckstrom, and prays for the recovery of Andrew Wolfe.

Despite the horrors and harm involved, all three stories show how important discussing lawlessness is to making accountability possible — now or in the future.

The responses from senior officials in the Trump administration — from President Donald Trump on down — to the Wednesday shooting of two National Guard troops sent from West Virginia to Washington, D.C. over the summer was immediately to assess collective guilt and assign collective punishment once an Afghan national was named as the suspect.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed Trump’s racist, anti-immigrant speech in response to the shooting, quickly blaming the Biden administration. An hour later, action. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — under Noem’s jurisdiction — announced that “all” immigration requests involving Afghan nationals had been “stopped indefinitely.” This — as Trump’s speech made clear — was an angle to further restricting immigration from people the Trump administration wants to keep out of America.

This is the stuff of Stephen Miller’s dreams, and he spent Thanksgiving making that clear to anyone who would read to his hate — including lashing out at The Wall Street Journal editorial board for opposing the administration’s racist collective-guilt response.

The head of USCIS followed up on Thanksgiving, announcing that this would go further than the Wednesday statement — both to encompass people already in the U.S. and countries beyond Afghanistan.

After Sarah Beckstrom, one of the West Virginia National Guard troops who was shot, died from her injuries on Thanksgiving, the hate pouring out of the administration only became more aggressive, more lawless.

To end that day, Trump issued a triptych of late-night, racist, anti-immigrant diatribes — horrifyingly discussing unconstitutionally and illegally “denaturaliz[ing]” people who “undermine domestic tranquility“ and “deport[ing]” foreign nationals who are “non-compatible with Western Civilization.”

On Friday morning, DHS made clear that all of this was, yes, very fascist, indeed.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, apparently feeling left out, piped in on Friday evening to announce that he, too, was on board with the collective punishment plan.

As the collective-punishment campaign was building, however, the Trump administration was forced to address a second front in its lawlessness.

Around lunchtime on Friday, The Washington Post reported on the administration’s boat-strike murders. The report from Alex Horton and Ellen Nakashima about the first boat strike, on September 2, is alarming. Once analysts became “more confident“ that 11 people aboard the boat they were tracking were drug smugglers, the Post reported, this is what happened:

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken directive, according to two people with direct knowledge of the operation. “The order was to kill everybody,” one of them said.

A missile screamed off the Trinidad coast, striking the vessel and igniting a blaze from bow to stern. For minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck.

The Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions, two people familiar with the matter said. The two men were blown apart in the water.

While purportedly attacking their reporting as “fake news,” Hegseth on Friday evening did not deny the key claim in the report about the second strike, stating, “As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes.’ The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.“

That is not the end of it, not at all. The response to the Post’s report from Jack Goldsmith — the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel official during the George W. Bush administration who withdrew the administration’s earlier “torture memos” — was perhaps the most notable immediate response.

“[T]here can be no conceivable legal justification for what the Washington Post reported earlier today,” he wrote at Executive Functions. “In short, if the Post’s facts are correct, it appears that Special Operations Forces committed murder when the ‘two men were blown apart in the water,’ as the Post put it.”

Ryan Goodman from Just Security reported on Saturday that the Former JAGs Working Group — a group of former military lawyers — echoed Goldsmith, concluding a white paper response, “[S]ince orders to kill survivors of an attack at sea are ‘patently illegal,’ anyone who issues or follows such orders can and should be prosecuted for war crimes, murder, or both.“

By Saturday night, bipartisan leaders of both the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed Services Committee had issued strong statements.

The Senate leaders, Sens. Roger Wicker and Jack Reed, referencing “recent news reports — and the Department of Defense’s initial response — regarding alleged follow-on strikes on suspected narcotics vessels in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,“ stated that their committee had “directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”

The House leaders, Reps. Mike Rogers and Adam Smith, similarly stated that their committee is “committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean,” adding that they “take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.”

Finally, and as I reported Friday, Chief Judge James Boasberg’s contempt inquiry over the March 15 flights — with, as of this past week, its increased focus on Noem, in addition to the then-key Justice Department leadership — is also proceeding into its next phase next week:

This weekend, then, illustrates three points at which the administration’s lawlessness can become a part of the public discussion — when officials announce lawless actions, reporting that follows lawlessness, and when orders from federal courts are issued seeking to hold officials accountable for lawlessness.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPVj!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63172e3b-a943-4916-bb3d-eac4f352a923_1208x890.png",N,,2025-11-30 01:56:23.132173
