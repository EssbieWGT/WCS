As James mounted a lawsuit claiming that Trump's business persona was built partly on lies, he returned fire, calling her “grossly incompetent” and “an evil person.""

James, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have long been legal and political foes, tangling in dozens of lawsuits over the years.

On Thursday, Trump's Justice Department indicted James on mortgage fraud charges after he vowed revenge on his enemies, escalating a feud that has persisted since she campaigned for attorney general in 2018. She has denied wrongdoing.

Here's a look at some of James and Trump's legal tussles:

A lawsuit accusing Trump of lying about his wealth

James sued Trump after his first term, alleging in September 2022 that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars by misleading banks and insurers about the value of assets such as Trump Tower and the Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. She dubbed it “The art of the steal,” a twist on the title of Trump's memoir. After a trial, a judge ordered Trump last year to pay a massive monetary penalty. An appeals court later threw out the penalty, which had grown to more than $500 million with interest, but affirmed a lower-court finding that Trump committed fraud. James is now asking the state's highest court to reinstate the penalty, while Trump is seeking to have other non-monetary punishments lifted.

Face-to-face at a deposition, fireworks in a courtroom

Trump sparred with James at a deposition for her civil fraud lawsuit in April 2023. Answering questions for seven hours at her Manhattan office, he told her that “the whole case is crazy” and accused her staff of trying to trip him up like fictional TV lawyer Perry Mason did to witnesses. A few months later, they came face-to-face again as Trump testified at trial. Trump looked away from James and scowled as he walked past her on the way into court. On the witness stand, he accused her of pursuing him to advance her career. “She’s a political hack, and this is a disgrace that a case like this is going on,” he testified, adding that James “should be ashamed of herself.”

A leading role fighting Trump administration policies

Working with a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general, James sued Trump and his administration multiple times since he returned to the White House in January, challenging everything from cuts to funding for counterterrorism and public safety to plans to deploy National Guard troops in Oregon. Those efforts began the day after Trump took office with a lawsuit challenging his effort to overturn birthright citizenship. Other lawsuits have challenged the work of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, mass firings of federal workers and the revocation of temporary protected status for Venezuelans.

Dozens of lawsuits in Trump's first term

During his first term, James sued the administration at least 66 times in a two-year span, challenging policies on environmental, immigration and education policy, health care and other issues. She fought his plans to include a question about immigration status on the Census, winning in the U.S. Supreme Court, and sued the U.S. Postal Service over slowdowns before the 2020 election. Other major victories during the first term included restoring what’s known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, which allows people who came to the country unlawfully as children to remain, and a ruling that barred immigration authorities from arresting people at courthouses.

Helping build a criminal case against Trump's company

James teamed with then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. to bring tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, its chief financial officer. The company was convicted in 2022 of helping its executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. James assigned two lawyers to work with Vance’s office after uncovering evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing. James was not involved when Trump was prosecuted last year by Alvin Bragg, the current District Attorney, and convicted of falsifying business records.

Closing down Trump's charity over misspending

In 2019, James finalized an agreement brokered by her predecessor dissolving his charitable foundation and forcing him to pay $2 million to various nonprofits as a fine for misspending funds to further his political and business interests. The Trump Foundation’s $1.7 million in remaining funds were also given away. Trump acknowledged in a court filing that he allowed campaign staff to coordinate with the charity for a veterans fundraiser before the 2016 Iowa caucuses. He also admitted to arranging for it to pay $10,000 for a 6-foot (1.8-meter) portrait of him and the spending of $11,525 in foundation funds on sports memorabilia and Champagne at a charity gala.

Trump fights back, but judges reject his lawsuits

Trump sued James in 2021 in an attempt to block her from investigating him and his businesses. After a federal judge in New York quickly threw out the case, Trump sued her again in Florida. A judge there refused to block the probe, writing in December 2022: “This litigation has all the telltale signs of being both vexatious and frivolous.” Trump abandoned efforts to revive his first lawsuit against James after the Florida judge rejected a lawsuit he filed against his 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Rodham Clinton. In tossing that case, U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks ordered Trump and one of his lawyers — Alina Habba, currently acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey — to pay nearly $1 million for filing frivolous lawsuits for political purposes, which the judge said amounted to a “pattern of abuse of the courts.”

The 2007 U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement further empowered U.S. multinationals, devastated local agriculture, and weakened the power of workers.
Since the announcement of the trade deal in July, the U.S. and South Korea’s governments have been at odds over how South Korea’s investments will be decided.
Forces Korea’s mission that would permit U.S. troops and weapons in South Korea to be deployed throughout the region.
Forces Korea poses the gravest threat to South Korea.","Zip ties. Helicopters. Crowded cells. Guns trained on bewildered workers. Foul water. Forced vaccinations. An unconscious detainee left on the floor by negligent guards. A pregnant woman in handcuffs. A detainee being called “Rocket Man” (Donald Trump’s nickname for Kim Jong Un) by sneering federal agents. A menstruating woman forced to attend to her period with only toilet paper.

These are the details of 316 South Korean nationals’ experiences in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention that have flooded the country’s media in the weeks after the September 4 raid on a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. A wave of fury is now pouring forth from across South Korean society — and the political consequences are only just beginning.

There is far more at stake than a single factory in Georgia, which by itself represented 8,500 jobs and $4.3 billion in investment, and is just one of 23 plants being built across the U.S. by Korean conglomerates. Since the raid, the U.S. and South Korea have announced that Korean workers will be able to use B-1 visas and ESTA visa waivers to continue working in the U.S. A new bill in Congress, the Partner with Korea Act, also seeks to extend 15,000 professional E-4 visas to South Koreans for the first time.

But U.S. flexibility on immigration is not all that matters. Seoul and Washington have yet to finalize their trade deal instigated by Trump’s threat to impose a 25 percent blanket tariff on South Korean goods. At the current stage of negotiations, South Korea has agreed to accept a 15 percent tariff on its exports and provide tremendous investments and other financial agreements: $350 billion in state-backed short-term investment, $150 billion in private sector contracts with U.S. corporations, and a guarantee to purchase $100 billion in U.S. liquid natural gas. Despite so much on the table, a written agreement has yet to be produced, and negotiations are proving tense as the Trump administration presses for Seoul to provide the lion’s share of its $350 billion commitment in cash. While some of the shock over the ICE raid has died down, Washington’s conduct over the course of months of negotiations has also raised deeper questions in South Korea about the real nature of the alliance — and whether this is a relationship that can last.

The Art of the Steal

The anger unleashed by ICE’s abuse of Korean workers has been building for some time. Trump’s tariff threats, announced in March, hit South Korea at a difficult time, when the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol was unresolved, and the country was reeling from years of flagging economic performance.

The issue was not only a matter of timing. The Biden administration’s CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act also used similar (though less onerous) tariff threats to force South Korean conglomerates to transfer production and make large investments in the U.S. — which is how the Hyundai-LG plant made its way to Georgia in the first place. Having already complied with the previous administration, South Korea nevertheless now finds itself facing an even graver economic threat that could lead to recession: not just a 25 percent tariff on all exports (since reduced to 15 percent), but sector-based tariffs impacting most of South Korea’s key industries as well.

While much of the anger on either side of the Pacific has focused on the current administration in Washington, Trump’s tariffs are just the latest in a string of U.S. policies that have sought to deny South Korea its economic sovereignty, open its markets to foreign takeover, and degrade the rights and dignity of its working people.

The 1997 International Monetary Fund crisis is the most notorious of these, and led to the “irregularization” of nearly half the workforce as employers moved to subcontracting and other forms of indirect employment to dodge existing labor law and deny rights to their workers. The 2007 U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement further empowered U.S. multinationals, devastated local agriculture, and weakened the power of workers. With Joe Biden, and now Trump, the U.S. has moved to maintain its privileges under the agreement while subjecting South Korea to unequal burdens and penalties.

As with prior rounds of U.S. economic warfare, South Korea’s workers and other affected sectors of society responded to the tariffs with force. Farmers reacted with rancor to demands to open up the rice and beef markets to U.S. imports; civic groups staged protests at the U.S. embassy; peace groups highlighted the military demands attached to the tariff threats; and unions educated their workforces and, in some cases, moved to partial strike action — as with the case of General Motors Korea.

Like most governments, South Korea opted to appease the U.S. in exchange for a lower tariff rate of 15 percent, with no corresponding tariff on U.S. goods in the Korean market. So far, Seoul has offered to inject a cumulative $600 billion into the U.S. economy. This is a dizzying figure for any country, no less for South Korea with an annual GDP of roughly $1.7 trillion in 2023, and an annual budget of roughly $500 billion in 2024.

According to the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the $350 billion in short-term state-backed investments offered by South Korea is more than the total direct investments it made worldwide over the five-year period from 2020-2024. Beyond extracting such an enormous tribute, Washington has cast a covetous eye toward South Korea’s most valuable and strategic industries, seeking to either smother them through tariffs or transfer their most lucrative parts of the production chain to the U.S.: in shipbuilding, automobiles, steel, and more.

While South Korean President Lee Jae Myung attempted to spin the deal as a victory, the domestic labor movement and many progressives swiftly rejected this. The minority Progressive Party, which holds seats in the National Assembly, denounced Trump’s tariff maneuvers as “an act of plunder.” The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a massive umbrella union representing over a million workers, described the “unilateral” negotiations as “humiliating,” and criticized the government’s declaration of victory as an attempt to confuse the public, since the 15 percent tariff is still ultimately an increase that will burden Korean industry and workers.

Fraying Bonds?

At the outset of Trump’s tariff threats, labor, farmers, and progressive civil society organizations spearheaded vocal opposition. South Korea’s conglomerates (or chaebol) opted to hedge against further potential losses by adopting conciliatory rhetoric and offering handsome investment packages before the details of a deal were worked out at the state level. This was reflected in Lee’s first summit with Trump in August, which was noted for its convivial atmosphere and his lavish praise of Trump. Pressure to transfer production to the U.S. was no doubt uncomfortable for South Korea’s capitalists, but for a moment, an illusion endured that profits might be sustained in the long term. Then came the ICE raid in Georgia — not only raising questions about the safety of the workforce, but also raising questions about investments.

This precipitated a sharp change in tone among traditionally pro-U.S. elements in South Korea. Right-wing papers and business media outlets released a barrage of editorials in the wake of the raid. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s conservative paper of record, said the raid “raises fundamental questions about what the United States truly means by ‘alliance.’” Even the People Power Party, whose former leader, ex-President Yoon, now sits in jail, spoke out against the incident.

Some even went as far as to speculate whether the ICE raid might have had something to do with the unsettled tariff negotiations. The Korea Economic Daily, one of South Korea’s most important business papers, left little room for subtlety in its editorial: “If the US attempts to leverage this incident in trade negotiations, such as the $350 billion US investment fund and the further liberalization of agricultural and livestock products, it would be a betrayal of the trust of the alliance.” While this statement falls short of an outright accusation in print, one wonders what might have been said in more private settings among the elite.

Despite the pivot in South Korean public opinion, Washington has since only doubled down. Since the announcement of the trade deal in July, the U.S. and South Korea’s governments have been at odds over how South Korea’s investments will be decided. Trump has long claimed that he will personally determine the allocation of South Korea’s investments, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick previously tweeted that “90 percent” of the profits will go to “the American people” — a point that continues to rankle South Koreans.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Lutnick is also applying additional pressure to get Seoul to further raise its investments. Trump has no doubt taken confidence in his success in getting Japan to agree to similar terms, under which its $550 billion tariff tribute will be distributed according to the decisions of a U.S. committee — with Japanese input relegated to only a consultative position. If this all sounds bizarre and corrupt, that’s because it is. While Trump has touted his tariff deals as the prelude to a U.S. manufacturing renaissance, a better way to see them may be as just another handout for Wall Street — this time subsidized by taxpayers worldwide.

Now, the Trump administration is demanding that the majority of Seoul’s $350 billion investment be made “up front” in cash. Though an arrangement based on some credit is more likely, if handed over in full, the $350 billion would represent 83 percent of South Korea’s foreign reserves, threatening to trigger a currency crisis for the Korean won. Lee’s government has rejected this demand and countered with an offer for an unlimited currency swap to protect the value of his country’s currency, but the Trump administration has so far refused.

As negotiations drag on, Lee faces growing pressure to adopt a more assertive stance — including from within his own Democratic Party. For a moment, Lee put up more combative rhetoric, telling the Korean press he would not accept “any irrational or unfair negotiations,” and noted that, “We did not go to the US to gain anything, but to defend ourselves against the US’ unilateral tariff increases.” In a separate statement, Lee’s office indicated it would be willing to accept a 25 percent tariff to the U.S. market if the alternative were overly detrimental to South Korea. And in a much-circulated Facebook post, Lee called for a “self-reliant” South Korean military while castigating the “submissive mindset of some who think that self-defense is impossible without foreign troops” — a statement widely interpreted as made in reference to U.S. Forces Korea, which stations over 28,000 permanent U.S. troops in South Korea in more than 60 military bases.

Lee’s rhetoric is certainly sharpening, but his administration isn’t done with the U.S., or Trump, just yet. There are real obstacles preventing a sudden strategic shift from Washington. Lee’s economic program pegs South Korea’s future competitiveness to massive investments in AI and associated hardware, and recent deals with BlackRock and Open AI would provide the capital for the necessary data infrastructure and chip production.

More immediately, South Korea needs to diversify its trade partners to soften the blows of the U.S. tariff cudgel. Exports rallied to a new monthly record high in September, buoyed by a sharp rise in trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union, and more modest gains in trade with China. Beyond the economic dimension, the U.S. also holds operational wartime control of South Korea’s military — something Lee has vowed to recover more than 20 years since Washington first agreed to a process for transferring military control.

A disadvantageous deal for South Korea may yet be in the offing, but a victory on trade may prove pyrrhic for Washington. For its part, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions has unambiguously called for Seoul’s investment pledges to be withdrawn. Should a potential deal fail to spark public ire immediately, ample opportunities will remain. Trump’s demands go far beyond economic matters. The U.S. is also calling for South Korea to raise its defense spending to 3.5 percent of its GDP (Lee has already taken steps towards this, increasing defense spending by 8.2 percent in next year’s budget); raise its annual military “cost-sharing” payments to the U.S. to $10 billion a year; and consent to changes in U.S. Forces Korea’s mission that would permit U.S. troops and weapons in South Korea to be deployed throughout the region.

Out of all these demands, the proposed change in the mission of U.S. Forces Korea poses the gravest threat to South Korea. By redefining the mission of the U.S. occupation of Korea, South Korea would essentially lose any ability to avoid a U.S.-China war, since its territory would become part of a battlefield of Washington’s making. Lee has consistently maintained that South Korea should stay out of a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait, which Washington has not been shy about as its rationale for pursuing “strategic flexibility” in Korea. As U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Xavier Brunson put it, to the U.S. military in the New Cold War, South Korea is akin to a “fixed aircraft carrier” whose geographical position makes it indispensable to dominating the region.

The ICE raid and trade wars alone will not undo the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance, but they will likely persist as an open wound marring the relationship for years to come. As Washington presses on with its efforts to economically cannibalize Seoul and impose its military exigencies in preparation for wars few Koreans or Americans want, something will have to give. Whether that will be the alliance and the U.S. empire of bases, or whatever vestiges of democracy that remain in both countries, only time will tell.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2234317168-1536x985.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 01:56:43.363381

US district judge April Perry issued her decision from the bench after more than two hours of arguments from lawyers for the federal government and the state of Illinois, which sued the Trump administration over the deployment. The order took effect on Thursday and will remain in place for two weeks.

According to reporters present in the courtroom, Perry said she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”. On Thursday evening, around the time of Perry’s ruling, about half a dozen guard soldiers were milling around inside the gate at the Ice center in Broadview. A group of about 10 protesters were outside.

Illinois governor JB Pritzker said in a statement: “Donald Trump is not a king – and his administration is not above the law.”

Quoting the judge, he said: “Today, the court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago.”

Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, who attended the court hearing, called the decision a “win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law”. He vowed that the city would “continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to end the Trump administration’s war on Chicago”.

Lawyers for the state of Illinois had called the sending of national guard soldiers to the city – which was opposed by Chicago and state political leaders – a constitutional crisis.

The government “plowed ahead anyway”, attorney Christopher Wells said. “Now, troops are here.” Chicago and Illinois, run by Democratic elected leaders, say Trump has exceeded his authority and ignored their pleas to keep the national guard off the streets.

Eric Hamilton, a justice department lawyer, said the Chicago area was rife with “tragic lawlessness”.

“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton said. “They’re not protesters. There is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here, which there is.”

In handing down her order, Perry assailed the Department of Homeland Security for providing a version of events on the ground that was “simply unreliable”.

Lawyers for Illinois and local officials have said the government is exaggerating and misrepresenting the situation in Chicago, which Trump has referred to as a “war zone”.

Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said the president had “exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets” and “will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities”. She added that the president and his administration “expect to be vindicated by the court” upon appeal.

National guard members from Texas and Illinois arrived this week at a US army reserve center in Elwood, south-west of Chicago. All 500 national guard members are under the US northern command and have been activated for 60 days.

Earlier this week, Trump said Johnson and Pritzker should be jailed for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor have signed an appeals court filing in support of the legal challenge by California – and also one in the Portland, Oregon, where a similar troop deployment is also being challenged.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

In a separate ruling on Thursday, the US district judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction restricting agents’ use of force, including pepper balls, rubber bullets and physical force such as pulling, shoving or tackling against protesters and journalists who don’t pose a serious threat to law enforcement.

Ellis’s order covers all of northern Illinois and also requires federal agents to wear “visible identification” such as badges, the subject of heated debate as viral footage has surfaced of masked, plainclothes officers carrying out immigration enforcements in several US cities.

Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington DC. In Memphis, Tennessee, Paul Young, the city’s mayor, said national guard members would begin patrolling on Friday. Bill Lee, Tennessee’s Republican governor, supports using the troops.

The judge said the administration violated the 10th Amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th Amendment, which assures due process and equal protection.

It wasn’t clear what the troops will do now, including a small number outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview. Officials at U.S. Northern Command directed questions to the Department of Defense, which declined to comment citing a policy that the department doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.

Guard was already in Illinois

The lawsuit was filed Monday by Chicago and Illinois as Guard members from Texas and Illinois were on their way to a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago. All 500 are under the U.S. Northern Command and had been activated for 60 days.

Some slept in vans Wednesday night outside the Broadview building, near Chicago, and emerged Thursday morning on patrol behind portable fences. For weeks, the ICE site has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton said the Guard’s mission would be to protect federal properties and government law enforcers in the field, not “solving all of crime in Chicago.”

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. But Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton told the judge.

Perry, however, wasn’t swayed.

“I have seen no critical evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” she said hours later.

Order could be extended

The judge said the order would expire on Oct. 23 at 11:59 p.m. She set an Oct. 22 hearing by telephone to determine if the order should be extended for another 14 days.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in Trump’s ""animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” said Perry, who was appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson sat in a corner of the courtroom, which overflowed into a room with video of the hearing.

The city and state have called the deployments unnecessary and illegal.

“The president does not have the unfettered discretion to turn America’s military against its own citizens when they exercise their constitutional rights,"" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said.

Trump, meanwhile, has portrayed Chicago as a lawless “hellhole” of crime despite statistics that show a significant drop in crime. He said Pritzker and Johnson should be arrested for not protecting agents during immigration sweeps. Pritzker's response: “Come and get me.”

Court challenges elsewhere

Also Thursday, a federal appeals court heard arguments over whether Trump had the authority to take control of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. The president had planned to deploy them in Portland, where there have been mostly small nightly protests outside an ICE building.

A judge on Sunday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the move. Trump had mobilized California troops for Portland just hours after the judge first blocked him from using Oregon's Guard.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor signed a court filing in support of the legal challenge by California and Oregon. Twenty others, led by Iowa, backed the Trump administration.

Chicago’s federal court issued other decisions this week related to immigration enforcement. In one, a judge said immigration agents have repeatedly violated a 2022 consent decree outlining how ICE can make so-called warrantless arrests. That decree requires ICE to show documentation for each arrest it makes for people besides those being targeted.

Immigrant advocacy groups believe hundreds of people arrested around Chicago could qualify for reduced bond or have ankle monitors removed.

Guard expected on ground in Memphis

Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington. In Tennessee, Memphis Mayor Paul Young said troops would begin patrolling Friday. Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports the role.

Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said she hoped the Guard would direct traffic and have a presence in retail corridors, but not set up checkpoints or make the city “feel like there is this over-militarization in our communities.”

In a California case, a judge in September said the deployment was illegal. By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained and the judge did not order them to leave.

G.R.R., also going by a pseudonym, was detained by ICE during an April raid at a nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo.","The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado and migrant advocates filed a lawsuit against three Trump administration officials on Thursday, alleging that federal immigration officers are violating the law in arresting migrants in the state.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Colorado, lists Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons and ICE’s Denver field office Director Robert Guadian as defendants.

Citing the cases of four migrants who have been detained by ICE in Colorado this year, the ACLU suit attests that ICE officers are ignoring Title 8, Section 1357 of the U.S. Code. The statute requires that federal immigration officials have probable cause to believe an individual is in the country illegally and likely to escape before a warrant is obtained in order to arrest them.

When reached for comment, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told The Hill that the department “complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.”

According to the latest ICE data, officers from the Denver field office have arrested 15,756 individuals across their jurisdiction in Wyoming and Colorado. According to the complaint, ICE arrested nearly 2,000 individuals in Colorado in the first half of the year.

The ACLU and advocates filed the lawsuit on behalf of 43-year-old Refugio Ramirez Ovando, 19-year-old Caroline Dias Goncalves, 36-year-old J.S.T. and 32-year-old G.R.R. All four have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade and were detained by ICE officers earlier this year.

Ramirez was detained without a warrant in May and held at an ICE detention facility in Aurora, Colo. for more than three months, before an officer admitted to mistaking him for someone else. Dias Goncalves, a student at the University of Utah, was arrested by ICE officers while driving in June and spent 15 days at the Aurora facility.

J.S.T., going by a pseudonym, was arrested at his apartment complex in February and spent four weeks in the Aurora facility. G.R.R., also going by a pseudonym, was detained by ICE during an April raid at a nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. He later spent six weeks in Aurora.

The lawsuit claims that instead of following immigration law, ICE is “scrambling to fill arbitrary quotes set by the Administration, causing chaos and terror in neighborhoods throughout Colorado.” It adds that the roughly 169,000 immigrants without legal status and other Latinos in the state “now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices.”

In May, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said the administration’s goal is for ICE to arrest 3,000 individuals per day.

“ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities,” the suit added.

""If deputies encounter undocumented aliens during regular criminal enforcement, they may detain them for removal proceedings,"" said Sheriff Brian Kozak.

Earlier this month, Kozak and 25 deputies reaffirmed their pledge to obey and enforce the Constitution, prohibiting any type of profiling or discrimination.

""We will have zero tolerance on profiling or discrimination with enforcement,"" said Kozak.

Deputies may inquire about immigration status only after a lawful stop, detention or arrest based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.

""We're not going to be doing immigration sweeps. Our focus is if we contact someone criminally, then we may as a secondary investigation conduct an immigration investigation,"" said Kozak.

This allows deputies to detain the individual for removal proceedings.

Part of the policy is involving a direct ICE supervisor.

""They will validate everything that we're doing and actually give us the green light to proceed with the detention or not,"" said Kozak.

This is all authorized and funded under Title 8, Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, an agreement that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wyoming has been very outspoken about.

The ACLU said these agreements have a history of eroding public safety, imposing heavy financial burdens on localities and leading to civil rights violations.

""It’s not wise to divert local law enforcement resources to subsidize federal immigration enforcement,"" the ACLU told Wyoming News Now. ""Laramie County deputies belong in the neighborhoods of our communities providing crime prevention services to build trust and maintain order – not to be pulled out of neighborhoods to handle a federal responsibility.""

The ACLU continued, ""Deputizing so many local law enforcement officers to act as immigration agents diverts resources away from activities and investigations that actually keep our neighborhoods safe. By participating in 287(g) agreements, the Laramie County Sheriff’s Office is actually eroding trust in local law enforcement and deterring immigrant families from coming forward when they are the victims of crime or even asking for basic assistance.""

Sheriff Kozak said training for the authorized deputies included classes on cultural diversity, profiling, naturalization process, document identification, visas and constitutional standards.

The sheriff said his priority is to deploy deputies to stop human and drug trafficking on Interstates 25 and 80.

The agreement also allows deputies to help trafficking and domestic violence victims obtain visas, ensuring the remain in the U.S. to testify.

""Our number one focus is to help people, and that's what we're going to do,"" said Kozak.

The Laramie County Detention Center has been approved by ICE to hold detainees, and the jail expected to receive 10 from an overcrowded facility in Colorado.

As of Oct. 1, the jail was housing 11 detainees on ICE holds. It receives a daily fee of $120 per detainee.

The exact tasks and responsibilities of the FBI agents now working alongside Ice are unclear.","Nearly half of the FBI agents working in the US’s major field offices have been reassigned to aid immigration enforcement, according to newly released data, a stunning shift in law enforcement priorities that has raised public safety concerns.

Personnel data obtained by Mark Warner, a Democratic senator, and shared with the Guardian, suggests the Trump administration has moved 45% of FBI agents in the country’s 25 largest field offices to support the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration crackdown. Across all of the FBI’s offices, 23% of the roughly 13,000 total agents at the bureau are now working on immigration, according to Warner, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.

Warner’s office said the FBI agents now deployed alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent have been taken away from their work tackling cybercrimes, drug trafficking, terrorism, espionage, violent crimes, counterintelligence and other efforts that are part of the bureau’s mission – some areas that Trump has claimed are White House priorities.

The data, first reported by the Washington Post, suggests the FBI is dramatically shifting its objectives in an effort to back Trump’s increasingly aggressive immigration raids, with the administration targeting 3,000 daily arrests and seeking to expand its detention capacity to detain more than 100,000 immigrants.

The data is understating the scale of the reorganization, as the FBI only provided counts for agents who are now spending more than half of their job doing immigration enforcement, according to Warner. The senator’s office said it was likely that more than a quarter of FBI agents’ total hours were now dedicated to immigration, and that in some field offices, more than half of the agents had been redirected to DHS.

“When you pull a quarter of the FBI’s top agents off the front lines of fighting terrorists, spies, drug traffickers, and violent criminals, the consequences are clear: critical national security work gets sidelined, and our country is put at greater risk,” Warner said in a statement.

The transformation of the FBI has raised alarms about the potential consequences for communities targeted by immigration raids and the impact on the work the bureau is abandoning, experts said.

Mike German, a former FBI agent and civil liberties advocate, said it was unprecedented for the bureau to redirect this many agents to a mission that is not part of the FBI’s mandate. Some agents might be eager to support the president’s immigration agenda while others likely oppose the redirection, he said: “Part of the reason FBI leadership would be doing this at such scale is to separate those two – to identify who are the loyalists and who are potential impediments to the administration’s goals.”

The move is in line with FBI director Kash Patel’s efforts to purge the bureau of agents seen as disloyal to Trump, German said, noting reports of the termination of personnel involved in the January 6 investigation.

FBI agents, he said, are generally trained as investigators who may make targeted arrests, a job that significantly differs from those of many immigration enforcement officers, which could lead to problems in the field during immigration raids. “Just jumping in an SUV with a bunch of armed men and rolling around the streets until you see someone running away is inherently a more dangerous type of activity they are not very well trained for,” German said.

There has been extensive documentation of the violent and indiscriminate nature of the Ice raids, which have often been carried out by masked men and have at times led to the detention of US citizens, and adding FBI personnel to the mix could exacerbate the chaos and potential for abuses, the former agent said.

The exact tasks and responsibilities of the FBI agents now working alongside Ice are unclear. Spokespeople for DHS, Ice, the FBI and the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

German, an FBI whistleblower who has spoken out about the civil rights abuses of the bureau’s intelligence work, said he was most concerned about the agency shifting away from public corruption and white-collar crime, offenses state and local agencies don’t have capacity to tackle: “That’s where the real harm will come.”

Current and former FBI agents told the Washington Post there were growing concerns about low morale within the agency and that agents were stretched thin, which could hamper national security investigations and complex cases.

Kenneth Gray, a former FBI agent and professor of practice in the University of New Haven’s criminal justice department, said the shift in priorities resembled the post-9/11 reorganization at the FBI, when counterterrorism became the central focus.

“The bureau can withstand a temporary change in its priorities, but in the long-term, if agents are continuing to work immigration matters, as opposed to counterterrorism, foreign counterintelligence or cybercrimes, that may end up biting us big time,” said Gray, who worked at the bureau for 24 years, before leaving in 2012. “The next 9/11 might happen if agents who were working on counterterrorism have been diverted.”

Gray, however, said he was not concerned about a temporary shift while DHS engages in rapid recruitment of new Ice officers.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6bdfe7d049a29e516c57d4d6abdfc6a2001dca/1006_0_6849_5479/master/6849.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae2aa8b16716e571ff06ef6480cae497",N,,2025-10-09 19:56:47.696572

Dear Mr. Johnson:

Thank you for coordinating the visit to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in downtown Portland on September 25, 2025. The facility tour and meeting with ICE staff was very informative, and today we write to follow up on several items that we discussed during the visit. We received conflicting information from ICE staff, and we remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations occurring at the facility.

We are deeply concerned by the lack of oversight and accountability of ICE agents, including those operating out of the Macadam facility. There are multiple instances of agents breaking car windows and ripping people from their vehicles, holding knives to people’s necks, and shoving bystanders to the ground. In addition to this unnecessary violence and use of force, ICE agents hide their identities by wearing masks and do not have visible identification or badge numbers. This poses a serious safety concern and makes the entire community less safe. We also heard about changes being made to expeditiously hire new ICE agents at the facility, including compressing the training. In addition to unnecessary aggression perpetuated by ICE agents, we are concerned about how new agents with less training might further escalate tensions in the community.

Because of the scale of immigration enforcement operations in Oregon and the lack of transparency around DHS and ICE procedures under the current Trump administration, we demand answers to the following questions:

What is the current process to initiate an initial review of a bond request at Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO)? Who at ERO is responsible for initial reviews of requests for bond?

What criteria is used to determine which requests for bond will be sent forward or denied? Please provide any directives that outline these criteria.

Of the total number of detained noncitizens who have come through the facility since January 2025, how many bond requests have been approved and how many have been denied?

We have seen reports that individuals with legal status have been detained. What criteria have agents been given to determine who to detain?

There are several instances of immigrants with documented medical and health concerns or who were recovering from surgery who were summarily deported. What standards are used to determine medical clearance for deportation? Please provide a copy of those standards.

Masked ICE agents are unidentifiable in our communities and hide their identities. This raises significant safety concerns. How are you holding your staff accountable for negligence and unnecessary violence if ICE agents do not have identification or badge numbers visible?

We understand that hiring for the community relations position at the Macadam facility has been challenging. What plans are in place to hire a Community Relations staff for the Macadam facility?

There are multiple reports of ICE staff harassing volunteers outside of the facility. What training are staff receiving on carrying out community enforcement? What plans are in place to guarantee that newly hired staff are adequately trained on a condensed timeline?

How are you complying with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements and working to make sure people with mobility issues are able to access the facility for appointments?

Thank you for your attention to this letter and we look forward to your prompt response.

Dear Secretary Noem:

On September 25, 2025, members of the Oregon congressional delegation visited the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in downtown Portland on S. Macadam Avenue. The facility tour and meeting with ICE staff was very informative. Today we write to follow up on several items that were discussed during the visit. We remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations by Federal Protective Service (FPS) at the facility.

More than a dozen advocates outside the facility have reported unprovoked attacks by Homeland Security police and FPS officers, leaving people with large bruises, chemical burns, and lingering pain. The Portland Police Bureau reported that federal police shoved, hit, and used chemical spray on people outside the facility when, according to multiple witnesses, there was no physical threat to officers. Additionally, a Portland Police Bureau Assistant Chief said in a court filing that federal police are instigating some of the clashes. These allegations are unacceptable. It is the responsibility of FPS to protect federal persons and property.[1] In June, the President issued a Presidential Memoranda calling at least 2,000 members of the National Guard into Federal service under the false premise that they are needed to “temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel performing Federal functions.”[2]

Over the weekend, federal law enforcement escalated their tactics against demonstrators outside of Macadam facility, including firing tear gas and smoke canisters, pepper spraying peaceful protestors in the face, and deploying pepper bullets. These attacks initiated by FPS and other federal law enforcement are unacceptable.

We demand additional clarity about the response from your agents at the ICE Macadam facility:

What type of munitions are used against people collected outside of the Macadam facility? Please provide a detailed description.

What criteria is used to determine whether or not to use munitions against people outside the facility? How do you decide what tools to use at different times of day? Who makes those determinations?

There have been several reports of Federal Protective Services Agents instigating violent altercations with peaceful protesters outside the Macadam facility. How does FPS determine when to engage with protestors? What criteria is used to make these determinations? Are there protocols in place to hold FPS accountable when they use unnecessary force?

Neighbors and businesses near the Macadam facility have reported lingering substances in the air causing health concerns. How are you working with neighbors and businesses around the facility to reduce negative consequences of these substances?

Thank you for your attention to this letter. We look forward to hearing from you by October 22, 2025.

Dear Attorney General Bondi:

On September 25, 2025, members of the Oregon congressional delegation visited the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in downtown Portland on S. Macadam Avenue. The facility tour and meeting with ICE staff was very informative. Today we write to follow up on several items that were discussed during the visit. We remain extremely concerned about due process violations by ICE staff and attorneys.

The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to due process, regardless of immigration status, and the Immigration and Nationality Act outlines the right to counsel in any removal proceedings.[3] Due process is a cornerstone of American democracy that is currently being eroded. When a person’s rights are violated, the result can be wrongful deportations.

Community organizations are reporting that some immigrants are being denied access to counsel at the Macadam facility. During our meeting at the ICE facility, we repeatedly asked for clarification about why individuals in detention have been denied access to counsel and were not provided with an adequate response. Because of the scale of immigration enforcement operations in Oregon and the lack of transparency around DHS and ICE procedures under the current Trump administration, we demand answers to the following questions:

What pre-representation support is allowed at the Macadam facility?

Do you allow attorneys to enter the Macadam facility to conduct pre-representational interviews?

Do you ever deny attorneys access to the facility to conduct pre-representational interviews? If so, under what circumstances and what authority?

The U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to due process and the law allows the right to an attorney. On what grounds are you denying counsel to individuals in custody?

What is the protocol staff follow when someone in ICE custody at the Macadam facility requests a lawyer?

What options are available for individuals seeking virtual immigration hearings? Are these ever granted? If not, on what grounds are those requests denied?

How long do removal proceeding hearings typically last?

Which personnel are allowed into immigration hearings (ICE staff, DOJ staff, attorneys, etc.)?

Thank you for your attention to this letter and we look forward to your prompt response.

,Litigation,2025-10-09 22:21:25+00:00,Chicago Sun-Times,Judge grants a partial temporary restraining order on National Guard deployment in Illinois,"Jon Seidel, Tina Sfondeles",,,,,https://chicago.suntimes.com/live/2025/10/09/national-guard-lawsuit-judge-ruling-illinois-trump,"A federal judge said she is partially granting the state’s request to block the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard units in the Chicago area as part of an immigration enforcement action.
“I have seen no credible evidence that there is danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” the judge said.
Arguments have concluded in the hearing over the state’s lawsuit against the Trump administration that seeks to block the deployment of National Guard units over Gov.
No one from the Federal Protective Service requested any National Guard troops.” Perry also asked Hamilton what the troops would do.
“Where in Illinois are conditions so severe the president is unable to enforce federal law?”","A federal judge said she is partially granting the state’s request to block the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard units in the Chicago area as part of an immigration enforcement action.

After hearing arguments from lawyers representing the state and the Justice Department, U.S. District Judge April Perry said she will grant “in part” a state request for a temporary restraining order against troop deployment.

Perry said her decision comes down to a “credibility determination.”

“I simply cannot credit [the Trump administration’s] declarations to the extent they contradict state and local law enforcement,” Perry said. “[The Department of Homeland Security’s] perception of events [is] simply unreliable.”

Perry pointed to other federal prosecutions or lawsuits in Chicago and said “in the last 48 hours, in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ credibility and assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago.”

The Trump administration mobilized hundreds of National Guard members to protect federal agents and property over objections from Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who sued on behalf of the state and city to block the move.

“I have seen no credible evidence that there is danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” the judge said.

Perry is still ruling and the details of her order are not yet known.

Arguments have concluded in the hearing over the state’s lawsuit against the Trump administration that seeks to block the deployment of National Guard units over Gov. JB Pritzker’s objections.

U.S. District Judge April Perry intends to reconvene in her courtroom at 4:30 p.m. with lawyers representing the state, which is seeking a temporary restraining order against the deployment, and Justice Department lawyers fighting that effort.

Before the court went into recess, Christopher Wells, the lead lawyer representing Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Pritzker administration, summarized the state’s position that President Trump was acting maliciously with his push for National Guard troops in Illinois despite the governor’s objections.

“This case is replete with evidence of bad faith, of an abandonment of public virtue, of a lack of honest devotion to the public interest and of a grave risk of usurpation or wanton tyranny,” Wells said.

The Justice Department lawyer representing Trump, Eric Hamilton, reiterated that Trump’s judgment in this case is “unreviewable” and argued there’s “no possible irreparable injury from 500 members of the guard protecting federal property and personnel in a state of 13 million people.”

It’s unclear whether Perry will issue a decision from the bench later this afternoon.

U.S. District Judge April Perry asked Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton whether the president’s perceived inability to execute the law – a justification needed for Trump to mobilize the National Guard under federal law – was something “caused by the federal agents.”

Hamilton responded, “No, your honor.”

The judge then observed that the Broadview immigration enforcement processing facility had been the site of “nothing but peaceful prayer vigils” for 19 years. “And then,” Perry said, “CBP shows up and then suddenly things take a turn for the worse.”

Perry asked Hamilton whether the feds’ provoking protesters to the point federal law is unenforceable is something to be weighed under the National Guard mobilization law.

“No,” Hamilton said. “If that were true, the fact still remains that we are seeing sustained violence against federal personnel and property in Illinois.”

Singling out examples of violence the feds provided – claims of “slashed tires” and “keyed cars” – the judge said, “Some of this frankly sounds like a Carrie Underwood song.”

Hamilton shot back: “This is no Carrie Underwood song.”

He pointed to more serious incidents, including the claim of a bomb.

Perry asked what was in that alleged device, and Hamilton responded, “I don’t know.”

U.S. District Judge April Perry turned her questioning of a Justice Department lawyer toward statements President Trump has made about deploying National Guard troops to Illinois and asked whether he is relying on “completely invalid evidence.”

Perry said there appeared to be a “very large disconnect” between what Trump said on social media and in press conferences and what conditions are actually like on the ground in Illinois.

The judge zeroed in on the case of Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo, protesters at the Broadview ICE facility who were arrested while each was legally carrying a gun. In an unusual move, a federal grand jury refused to indict the couple.

The couple’s arrest was used, in part, as a justification by the Trump administration for National Guard units to help protect federal agents on the ground in the Chicago area.

But Perry noted how carrying a gun is a constitutionally protected right and that a grand jury didn’t support criminal charges against the couple.

“This indicates to me a certain lack of credibility,” Perry told the Justice Department lawyer.

With opening arguments over, U.S. District Judge April Perry pressed the Justice Department lawyer on whether the National Guard deployment that appears now to exceed 500 troops could increase and exactly what their duties would be.

Eric Hamilton, the lawyer representing the federal government, called plans for headcount and the troops’ use a “dynamic situation that could change.”

Hamilton went on to say that troops expected to be assigned at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse would be there at the request of the Federal Protective Services, a contention the judge said is “untrue. No one from the Federal Protective Service requested any National Guard troops.”

Perry also asked Hamilton what the troops would do.

He said they would “provide protection” but in a way that’s “distinct from law enforcement.” They would not be authorized to make arrests, he said.

Perry pressed Hamilton on whether troops would be “solving crime in Chicago,” and he answered, “Certainly, to an extent.”

The lead federal government lawyer justified President Trump’s deployment of National Guard units to Illinois because Chicago is experiencing what he called a “brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement.”

Department of Justice attorney Eric Hamilton told Judge April Perry that those objecting to the actions of federal immigration enforcement agents are “not protesters. They are the violent resistance to duly enacted immigration laws.”

Hamilton pointed to different examples of alleged violence against federal agents and said that was the basis for the mobilization of Guard units. Federal law allows that, he said, if there is “either a rebellion or a danger of a rebellion.”

Hamilton called the president’s decision to send in troops “unreviewable” and denied Illinois’ claim that the deployment is in retaliation to the sanctuary status of Illinois and Chicago.

“This federalization happened to respond to an urgent and serious ongoing threat to officer safety and to the protection of property,” he said.

With Attorney General Kwame Raoul sitting in the front row, a lawyer representing the state of Illinois argued that the Trump administration’s mobilization of National Guard units over Gov. JB Pritzker’s objections upsets the “careful balance of our constitutional system” and must be stopped.

Christopher Wells opened his arguments for a temporary restraining order against Trump with a look back to the country’s founders.

“Rebellion. Invasion. Insurrection. War. These are heavy words,” Wells told U.S. District Judge April Perry. “The people who wrote our Constitution understood the weight of these words. The people who wrote our constitution had lived these words.”

The federal immigration enforcement action known as Operation Midway Blitz has boasted of 1,000 arrests, but Wells said there is no justification to warrant Trump’s deployment of National Guard units to help with that task.

“Where exactly is the problem?” he asked. “Where in Illinois are conditions so severe the president is unable to enforce federal law?”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/12efe0c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5913x3375+0+284/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6f%2Fd5%2F3cc1192d4e8385186bcda69721aa%2Ftexastroops-101025-06.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 18:58:13.337621

CT lawmakers are considering it - Hartford Courant,Livi Stanford,,,,,https://www.courant.com/2025/10/09/more-legal-protections-for-immigrants-ct-lawmakers-are-considering-it/,"With ICE arrests continuing in Connecticut and immigrant advocates calling for state officials to act, lawmakers are in discussions about increasing legal protections during an upcoming special session.
Undocumented immigrants in the state have contributed about “one billion (dollars) in federal, state and local taxes each year,” according to DataHaven.
The state civil rights law would expressly protect federal constitutional rights in state law, according to Lesser.
“The only way to expand the Trust Act from its current form is by adding more crimes that undocumented immigrants can be convicted of and still be protected under the Trust Act,” he said.
“Never in the conversation about the Trust Act has anyone who is an advocate of the Trust Act said, ‘you know what, we are working to make sure more crimes don’t fall under this,'” he said.","With ICE arrests continuing in Connecticut and immigrant advocates calling for state officials to act, lawmakers are in discussions about increasing legal protections during an upcoming special session.

State Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, said there are significant conversations among his colleagues and the executive branch about potential legislation during a special session but there are key differences internally among parties to the discussion.

He said nothing has been finalized.

“I think we should do everything we legally can to protect these people,” Winfield said. “Others are concerned about what those decisions mean for the federal government interfacing with the state,” the senator said. “I think that is where the differences come in. We are trying to negotiate between those different sets of thoughts and concerns and we just have not come to a place where we have done that.”

In the state there have been increased arrests and detentions of immigrants by ICE agents wearing masks showing up at court, at the offices where people go to make child support payments and at people’s workplaces and their homes, immigration advocates said.

Immigration advocates and faith leaders called on legislators Monday to pass legislation during the special session to protect immigrants.

“It is extremely important to protect the courthouses and make sure that people are not in danger of being picked up by ICE when they are reporting for other issues,” Constanza Segovia, cofounder of the Hartford Deportation Defense and organizing director for Connecticut For All Coalition said. “It ends up impacting the justice system as a whole if people don’t feel safe going to court for a speeding ticket or to report domestic violence. It is a matter of public safety to access the courts.”

Protecting personal data of immigrants and citizens is also crucial, Segovia added, explaining that people should feel safe paying taxes in the state and not fear that they will be picked up as a result.

Undocumented immigrants in the state have contributed about “one billion (dollars) in federal, state and local taxes each year,” according to DataHaven.

On Sept. 19, Gov. Ned Lamont and the state Supreme Court Justice Raheem Mullins issued a new policy that states that ICE cannot make arrests without a warrant inside the state courthouses. Further, the policy states that immigration agents cannot wear masks.

Ninety-two organizations committed to immigrant rights, civil rights, human rights, gender rights, worker rights and racial justice, sent a letter to the lawmakers outlining specific priorities for immigration protections including protecting immigrants at courthouses; preserving Husky Medicaid for undocumented children and pregnant individuals; protecting the personal information of the immigrant community and all Connecticut residents; and making communities safer by prohibiting the use of state and local resources to assist in immigration enforcement, according to the letter.

Local immigration attorneys said that ICE is targeting those with deportation orders and those enrolled in former President Joe Biden’s parole program. But some are just being profiled as ICE agents pass by.

This past June Lamont signed legislation strengthening the controversial Connecticut Trust Act, the current law maintaining the independence of state and municipal police.

The Trust Act blocks local police from making an arrest that is based only on a request by federal agents in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.

Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, said with over a $100 billion of federal funding allocated for ICE starting this fiscal year, the state has to respond in some way.

“I want to make sure the constitutional rights of everyone in Connecticut including U.S. citizens are protected,” he said. “The federal government has a responsibility to enforce immigration laws. I respect that. I am concerned about overreach and infringement of constitutional rights.”

He added that the legislature should pass the state civil rights law and ensure protections are in place to tighten rules upon state data.

The state civil rights law would expressly protect federal constitutional rights in state law, according to Lesser.

“The state has the ability to protect federal constitutional rights at the state level and to say that we are going to ensure that they are not violated,” Lesser said.

“We need to tighten up the rules on data sharing,” he said.

State Sen. Saud Anwar, co-chair of the state’s Public Health Committee, also called for legislation to protect immigrants.

“We need a comprehensive strategy going forward because the federal government is on a different trajectory,” he said. “We must make this a priority. No immigrant in the community should live in fear of masked individuals kidnapping them.”

Senate Republican leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield said he has hesitation anytime any advocate wants to expand the Trust Act because in his view all it does is expand protections to criminals.

“The only way to expand the Trust Act from its current form is by adding more crimes that undocumented immigrants can be convicted of and still be protected under the Trust Act,” he said. “I am all for having a discussion for those who may be here illegally but otherwise abiding by the law and positively contributing to society. I am not willing to have any discussion about helping individuals that are being convicted of violent, heinous crimes and protecting those from deportation.”

Harding added that “we go down a very slippery slope when we start dictating to federal authorities what they can and cannot do in the state of Connecticut.”

Winfield said it is a red herring for Republicans to talk about the issue of crime related to the Trust Act.

“Never in the conversation about the Trust Act has anyone who is an advocate of the Trust Act said, ‘you know what, we are working to make sure more crimes don’t fall under this,'” he said. “The only thing that has happened with the Trust Act is we’ve said, ‘let’s put more crimes so more crimes are covered as exceptions.’

“The stuff we are talking about is what happens in our courts. The stuff we are talking about is whether ICE can run throughout the state of Connecticut unidentified. The stuff we are talking about is whether they follow the laws of the state. It is a distraction. They know better,” Winfield said.

The law strengthening the Trust Act also expands situations in which officials can comply with federal immigration detainers and not be subject to litigation, according to the Connecticut Mirror. The Mirror reported the bill added 13 crimes including sexual assault, injury or risk of injury to a child, strangulation and others for which state and local law enforcement can comply with a federal detainer request.

Winfield said at the core what we “are trying to do is offer people protections that we can and from my perspective you can call it the expansion of the Trust Act, you can call it something new — I don’t care what you call it. What I care about at the end of the day is what is the state of Connecticut’s policy toward immigrants who largely have been good neighbors to us.”

Berchie alleges that ICE agents put his name on a travel document that was already used for a different ICE detainee who had already been deported.
Ghanaian immigration authorities then “had no other choice” but to process Berchie into Ghana, according to the legal filing.
Ratkowski disputed this argument in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit, arguing that the difficulty of obtaining a travel document from Ghana had not changed since 2022.","A Ghanaian national who lived in Minnesota is alleging U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement illegally deported him earlier this week.

Martin Berchie, who had been detained by ICE in Sherburne County Jail since August, alleges that ICE forged his name on the travel document used to deport him to Ghana on Tuesday.

Travel documents are official paperwork needed that authorize the removal of a non-U.S. citizen to another country.

Berchie, 31, made the allegation in a legal filing Wednesday afternoon in U.S. District Court. The legal filing asks for an evidentiary hearing to present the allegations to a judge.

“The deportation was performed in an illegal manner through the use of forged documents,” Berchie’s attorney, Nico Ratkowski, wrote in the Wednesday legal filing.

Sahan Journal reached out to ICE for comment but did not receive a response.

Berchie alleges that ICE agents put his name on a travel document that was already used for a different ICE detainee who had already been deported. They then “abandoned” Berchie in pre-customs in Ghana “instead of presenting him to Ghana immigration authorities.”

“Ghana rejected [Berchie] and went to look for the immigration officers that brought him, but was unable to locate those officers,” Berchie’s legal filing reads.

Ghanaian immigration authorities then “had no other choice” but to process Berchie into Ghana, according to the legal filing.

“This is akin to pushing Berchie out of a helicopter with a parachute because a travel document could not be produced,” Ratkowski wrote in the legal filing. “If [Berchie]’s claims are true, [ICE]’s actions were extraordinarily illegal and are a seminal and extremely concerning example of bad faith by the agency.”

In August shortly after his arrest, Ratkowski filed a habeas corpus lawsuit in court asking ICE to release Berchie because previous attempts to deport him had been unsuccessful. Habeas corpus lawsuits are requests to the court to be released from jail while an immigration case is pending.

Berchie came to the United States from Ghana in 2018 on an F1 visa to attend college. His visa expired the following year, according to a legal filing by Assistant U.S. Attorney Trevor Brown opposing his habeas motion.

In 2020, he was charged with two counts of criminal sexual conduct after a woman accused him of sexual assault. Berchie ultimately pleaded guilty in September 2021 to fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. Court documents say he was credited for time already served at the time of his sentencing.

ICE detained him in November 2020, and held Berchie in the Freeborn County Jail. In March 2021, an immigration judge ordered Berchie to be removed from the country and deported to Ghana. But ICE had trouble deporting Berchie and released him from jail in February 2022 because “Ghana was not timely issuing a travel document at that point,” according to the legal filing by Brown.

ICE instead placed him on an order of supervision, which required him to check in with the agency on a monthly basis.

Berchie complied with the supervision order through August of this year, according to his habeas lawsuit. In fact, ICE detained Berchie during a check-in required under the supervision order.

“[Berchie] is now detained because there is a significant likelihood of his removal to Ghana in the foreseeable future,” Brown wrote.

Brown wrote that Ghana had, so far this year, issued 70 travel documents to ICE detainees and that ICE officials applied for a travel document for Berchie on Aug. 12.

“Berchie will be removed from the United States in the foreseeable future,” Brown wrote.

Ratkowski disputed this argument in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit, arguing that the difficulty of obtaining a travel document from Ghana had not changed since 2022.

“The government is not in possession of any credible or persuasive documents or evidence that Berchie’s removal is likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future,” Ratkowski wrote in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit.

He characterized Berchie’s detention as “punitive” and serving “no legitimate purpose.”

“The redetention of Berchie is designed to send a message to other individuals with final orders of removal that they need to leave the United States or they will be jailed indefinitely and without any process,” Ratkowski wrote in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit.",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhippleBuilding-9314.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 18:58:31.460929

Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., led Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Rep. Maxine Dexter in sending letters this week to top federal officials following a Sept. 25 visit to the ICE facility on Southwest Macadam Avenue, which has been the site of frequent clashes between protestors and federal officers. The lawmakers said agency officials failed to adequately answer their questions during the visit, prompting a formal inquiry to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.

“We received conflicting information from ICE staff, and we remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations occurring at the facility,” the lawmakers wrote in a shared letter to Erik Johnson, the deputy field office director of enforcement and removal operations at ICE’s Seattle field office. “We are deeply concerned by the lack of oversight and accountability of ICE agents, including those operating out of the Macadam facility.”

The delegation cited reports of ICE agents breaking car windows, forcibly removing people from vehicles and concealing their identities with masks. They also raised concerns about shortened training for new hires and possible violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

In a separate letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers accused the Federal Protective Service of using unnecessary force against demonstrators and advocates outside the Portland facility. The letter described accounts of unprovoked shoving, pepper-spraying and firing tear gas and pepper bullets into crowds, causing health concerns for nearby residents and businesses.

“These attacks initiated by FPS and other federal law enforcement are unacceptable,” the lawmakers wrote, demanding details on when and how agents are authorized to use such munitions.

A third letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi raised questions about due process and access to attorneys for immigrants detained at the facility. The lawmakers said some detainees have been denied legal counsel, potentially leading to wrongful deportations.

He also blames local liberal leaders for goading agitators into the violence seen over the weekend.

Raymond Lopez — alderman for Chicago’s 15th Ward — fears rhetoric from leaders like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson is pushing the city and the country to a dangerous place that there may be no coming back from.

“The politics of this city and of hyper progressive liberalism is bringing us closer to the brink with an escalation that I don’t think any of us truly wants to see,” Lopez told The Post.

“The governor, the mayor, with a wink and a nod, told everyone to protest peacefully. And we’ve seen the exact opposite unfold,” he added.

“They’re continuing to play a game of chicken with other people’s lives.”

Lopez is one of Chicago’s only Democratic leaders to openly support President Trump’s plan to use the National Guard to fight local crime since it was first proposed over the summer.

He said his position hasn’t changed since the White House confirmed over the weekend that 300 troops would be dispatched to protect ICE agents conducting immigration-enforcement raids in the city.

Those ICE operations were targeted by violent harassment, with some protesters even following federal agents and boxing them in on Saturday, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Chicago police were reportedly ordered not to answer federal agents calls for back-up.

The Chicago Police Department has since disputed those reports.

Lopez feels that such behavior — encouraged “directly or indirectly” by local leadership — made Trump’s decision to send in federal troops “a fore-drawn conclusion.”

“If we’re not going to allow law enforcement to protect [ICE] and keep the peace with our residents, then the president of the United States most definitely is going to take that action,” he said. “We cannot have our our citizenry thinking that they can take up arms against the federal government and suffer no consequences.”

And none of the current chaos had to happen if leaders simply followed a “common sense” approach to apprehending Chicago’s worst criminal element by just coordinating with the federal government to “surgically” remove them months ago, Lopez said.

“Instead, what we got were politicians — from the governor to the mayor on down — challenging the Trump administration to go into our communities and find those targets themselves,” he said. “They almost joked about it, as if they as if that would never have been a possibility or a reality. And yet here we are today.”

“We are making the case as to why we need the National Guard now more than ever, with people choosing to try to attack federal law enforcement agents here in the city of Chicago,” Lopez added.

Tensions have continued to boil as National Guard troops began arriving in the Chicago area Tuesday — with Trump raging on Truth Social that Pritzker and Johnson both should be “in jail,” while the governor and mayor returned fire by calling the president a “wannabe dictator.”

Alderman Lopez maintains that both sides are so busy playing politics they’ve forgotten about the Chicagoans they claim to be protecting — and that the longer they squabble, the greater the stakes become.

“We have nearly three and a half years left with Donald Trump. We better figure it out because we cannot exist in this fashion,” he said, adding that federal agents are “going to do what they’re trained to do, which is to de-escalate by any means necessary in order to protect life and property.”

“This is what you get when you are acting in this manner with people who are trained in a very different level,” he added.

“I don’t think they’re prepared for what’s going to happen next.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/democratic-alderman-raymond-lopez-chicago-113016739.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-10-09 18:57:17.094017

Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa pushed back slightly about preemption between federal and state policies by bringing up marijuana.
“Under the Florida law, my understanding is that entry is a continuous offense and you can be prosecuted anywhere you’re found,” Jordan, a Barack Obama appointee, said.
We otherwise would not be engaged in that practice, because we don’t actually exercise any control under Florida law over law enforcement.” Lagoa agreed.","ATLANTA (CN) — A coalition of immigrant advocacy organizations asked an 11th Circuit panel Thursday to keep a new Florida law targeting people in the U.S. illegally and enter the Sunshine State blocked

“The dominant federal interest here is that, for 150 years, the Supreme Court has made clear that there is an exclusive federal authority over entry into the United States,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Cody Wolsy told the three-judge panel. “This is a scheme that has been addressed in a bunch of different ways, all the different values and policies and interests that the federal government might have in a particular case of a person entering without inspection. And it gives the federal government a lot of different tools. Some of them are much more punitive, like the criminal provisions that are duplicated here.”

In February, the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature passed Senate Bill 4-C, which created two new criminal statutes for immigrants who enter the state after “eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers” at the U.S. border. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis immediately signed the legislation.

Immigration advocates, including the Florida Immigrant Coalition and Farmworker Association of Florida, responded with a federal lawsuit in April claiming SB 4-C unconstitutionally encroaches on the duties of federal officials to implement immigration law. The lawsuit names Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and state attorneys across Florida.

Within days, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida issued a restraining order barring any enforcement of the law and directing Uthmeier to inform local law enforcement of her decree. After news of continuing arrests, the judge extended the restraining order.

Uthmeier previously asked the 11th Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the injunction so arrests could continue while the litigation proceeded, but both courts declined.

During Thursday’s hearing, Wolsy of the ACLU reiterated that the federal government’s control over immigration preempts laws like SB 4-C.

“Congress in this very unique federal realm has given the president a bunch of tools and then left them at the president’s discretion,” he said. “The state can’t come in and say, ‘Well, we’re now going to take that discretion for ourselves and make the decisions for ourselves.’”

Wolsy said the law picks “winners and losers among immigrants and immigrant communities,” pointing to statutes allowing Cuban refugees, asylum seekers and victims of human trafficking to stay in the country, at least temporarily, after entering illegally.

Wolsy also argued that SB 4-C in some cases is more punitive than federal law, including withholding bail and more lengthy mandatory sentences.

“It’s another example of the state here making its own immigration policy,” he said.

U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa pushed back slightly about preemption between federal and state policies by bringing up marijuana.

“So let me ask you a question about, let’s say marijuana, because that’s sort of a drug choice where the states are allowing legalization of marijuana and the federal government still has that as an illegal substance, but it’s choosing not to, in most cases now, prosecute for marijuana possession,” said Lagoa, a Donald Trump appointee. “I mean, it sort of goes to the issue of the federal government is choosing not to prosecute for illegal entry, but the state of Florida decides, well, we’re going to prosecute for illegal entry of someone who’s illegally in the country, but also in Florida.”

Wolsy said the two can’t be compared.

“I think that this statutory scheme is very different from just saying possession of marijuana,” Wolsy said. “Here we’re saying there is a complex problem at the border that we’re dealing with, which is there are people who are coming in between ports. We both want to deter that, but we also want to acknowledge foreign policy considerations, humanitarian considerations, connections with U.S. citizens. How do we figure that out? We have one sovereign make the decision about which tools are going to be deployed, and that’s the federal government.”

Jeffrey DeSousa, the attorney representing Uthmeier and state prosecutors, argued SB 4-C is not preempted by federal law.

“It’s very particular,” he told the judges. “It says that if the federal government has granted lawful presence or discretionary relief, either temporarily or permanently, that is enough to absolve a person of liability under our statute.”

Lagoa interrupted.

“So you could be picked up,"" Lagoa said. “And then the way I read the statute, I think it’s a mandatory hold. So it’s sort of like a stand your ground immunity argument. You have to then move to dismiss the information and assert a defense.”

“I think that could happen,” DeSousa explained. “That would be one route. I mean, again, we’re in the pre-enforcement posture.”

Lagoa expressed skepticism. “It seems like a strange way to handle it,” she said. “It causes me some concern.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Adalberto Jordan took issue with how SB 4-C would be prosecuted.

“Under the Florida law, my understanding is that entry is a continuous offense and you can be prosecuted anywhere you’re found,” Jordan, a Barack Obama appointee, said. “It doesn’t say, neither provision says where you can be prosecuted, right?

“That’s correct,” DeSousa responded. “I want to emphasize that because this is a pre-enforcement challenge, we don’t yet have a great sense of how Florida state courts are going to interpret the term ‘entry’ here.”

DeSousa also took issue with the overly broad nature of the injunction that requires the attorney general to monitor arrests made by state law enforcement agencies to ensure they are complying with the restraining order. DeSousa said those agencies are not part of the litigation and thus “we have monitoring and oversight obligations that we should not have.”

“So that’s a diversion of our resources as an agency, where our lawyers spend time having to consult with those non-party law enforcement officers to ensure their compliance,” DeSousa said. “The situation only exists because of the overbroad nature of the injunction. We otherwise would not be engaged in that practice, because we don’t actually exercise any control under Florida law over law enforcement.”

Lagoa agreed.

“I’m speaking for myself only, I think the district court erred,” she said. “I don’t think that you have the ability to order someone who is not a party to you, where the person you’re ordering someone who does not have control over that individual to have them do something. I mean, I don’t have to affirm legal error.”

Wolsy of the ACLU said the injunction only required the attorney general to give notice of the lower court’s order.

“He didn’t have to agree with it,” Wolsy said. “He didn’t have to command them to do anything.”

Uthmeier initially complied with the order, notifying state agencies of the judge’s order. But five days later, he sent a letter to police agencies across the state, telling them “there remains no judicial order that properly restrains you from doing so,” according to court documents.

The lower court then held the attorney general in contempt for defying the order.

U.S. Circuit Judge Charles Wilson jumped on that point.

“It’s not a situation where the attorney general just didn’t do what he was ordered to do, which was provide notice of the ruling,” Wilson, a Bill Clinton appointee, said. “He went beyond not complying and suggested, and I’m using the word kindly, suggested to law enforcement officers that there was no valid order and they could go about their business enforcing these statutes.”

The panel did not indicate when or how it will rule.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/05/we-love-migrants-sign.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-09 17:58:49.604612

“The defendant seeks a new trial based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
The defendant’s first argument regarding immigration consequences fails, as this case is controlled by Commonwealth v. Marinho, 464 Mass.
… “The defendant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective by not discussing an appeal with him and by not filing a notice of appeal after the defendant’s convictions.
… “If counsel never discussed the possibility of an appeal with his client, that may constitute ineffective assistance.","Where (1) a defendant was convicted of breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony and (2) his subsequent motion for a new trial was denied, the defendant’s argument that trial counsel did not advise him of the immigration consequences of a conviction is foreclosed by Commonwealth v. Marinho, 464 Mass. 115, 128-130 (2013), but a remand is necessary for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant received ineffective assistance regarding his right to appeal.

“The defendant seeks a new trial based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. In 1999, the defendant, an undocumented immigrant, was charged with assault 2 and battery, breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, and malicious destruction of property over $250. Of these offenses, the latter two are considered ‘crimes of moral turpitude’ under the immigration laws. Following a bench trial in District Court in 2000, the defendant was convicted of the breaking and entering charge, and the lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property under $250.

“Many years later, the defendant learned that his conviction of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony foreclosed a path to permanent residency. This path had otherwise become available when the defendant’s mother became a naturalized citizen, which occurred after his trial. In 2021 the defendant moved for a new trial, arguing (1) that trial counsel did not advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of a conviction, and in particular, that a conviction after trial could foreclose a specific path to permanent residency; and (2) that trial counsel did not advise the defendant of his right to appeal or file a notice of appeal.

“A District Court judge denied the motion for a new trial, as well as a motion for reconsideration. The defendant presses his arguments again on appeal. The defendant’s first argument regarding immigration consequences fails, as this case is controlled by Commonwealth v. Marinho, 464 Mass. 115, 128-130 (2013), in which the Supreme Judicial Court ruled, under similar circumstances, that the defendant in that case had not shown prejudice because he had not demonstrated a reasonable probability that he could have achieved the plea bargain he posited in his motion for a new trial. As to the failure to file a notice of appeal, we must remand the matter as to this issue to the District Court, which under the circumstances needed to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant received ineffective assistance regarding the appeal and if so, whether the defendant otherwise would have timely appealed from his convictions. …

“The sole difference between this case and Marinho is that here the defendant has identified one immigration consequence that a favorable plea allegedly could have avoided — namely, that conviction of a crime of moral turpitude rendered the defendant ineligible for a form of discretionary relief from inadmissibility known as an unlawful presence waiver, available to the children of United States citizens. …

“However, even if we assume that counsel’s failure to advise of this potential consequence and to structure a possible plea bargain could constitute ineffective assistance under the circumstances, the defendant has not shown prejudice here. …

“The defendant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective by not discussing an appeal with him and by not filing a notice of appeal after the defendant’s convictions. As to this issue, we are constrained to remand this matter for an evidentiary hearing. …

“If counsel never discussed the possibility of an appeal with his client, that may constitute ineffective assistance. …

“So much of the order denying the motion for a new trial and order denying the motion for reconsideration that were entered as to trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness regarding the defendant’s right to an appeal and counsel’s failing to file a notice of appeal are vacated. The orders are otherwise affirmed. The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.”

Dissenting judge’s comments

Smyth, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. “I concur with the court that the case should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing and further findings as to whether trial counsel ever discussed the possibility of appeal with the defendant. However, I dissent from the court’s conclusion that the judge properly denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial as it pertained to trial counsel’s failure to provide adequate immigration warnings to the defendant.

“Instead, I conclude that the defendant demonstrated that his trial counsel’s performance was deficient under the protections of both the United States Constitution and Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because trial counsel failed to advise the defendant that a conviction on two of the charged offenses would adversely impact the defendant’s ability to lawfully remain in the United States. As such, the defendant satisfied the first, or performance, prong of Commonwealth v. Saferian, 366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).

“Concerning Saferian‘s prejudice prong, trial counsel’s failure to correctly warn the defendant of the clear immigration consequences of a conviction caused the defendant to forgo seeking an immigration-safe plea. The defendant instead proceeded to trial unaware of the immigration consequences that a conviction would have on him and his family. The defendant’s submissions established the existence of a substantial issue as to prejudice, requiring an evidentiary hearing. Specifically, the defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which he would bear the burden to prove a reasonable probability that he would have successfully negotiated a plea bargain had he known of the adverse immigration consequences, and further, that the result of the plea would have been more favorable to him, as to adverse immigration consequences, than the outcome of his trial. … Thus, I would remand for that additional purpose.”

At the same time, state lawmakers have introduced nearly 10 times more bills than last year targeting local immigration policies, the report found.
Cities and towns that are found in violation of state law could have state funding withheld should they not address it.
In the meantime, opponents of state preemption have had to get strategic about how to push back.","This week, President Donald Trump escalated his plans to send National Guard troops into blue cities — fighting in court to deploy them to Portland and sending others to Chicago ostensibly to fight crime and support federal immigration agents. He has repeatedly threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act if courts rule against him. While images of soldiers on city streets offer a visible show of federal power, a quieter takeover is simultaneously emerging: state preemption.

On March 17, the Fort Myers City Council declined to approve an agreement that would have entered the Florida city’s police department into a partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Those who voted ‘no’ could not have foreseen what came next.

The following morning, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis rebuked the council members who opposed the agreement, posting on X: “The days of inaction are over. Govern yourselves accordingly.” Hours later, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier sent a letter to the council threatening to remove the lawmakers from office, which he shared on X, adding: “Fix this problem or face the consequences.”

This was no empty threat. In February, the Florida legislature passed a pair of immigration bills, SB 2-C and SB 4-C, that targeted “sanctuary” policies in the state. The new laws not only required municipalities to cooperate with ICE, but also gave the governor the authority to remove local officials that got in the way.

Three days after the removal threats, the council held an emergency meeting and voted unanimously in favor of the immigration agreement.

What happened in Fort Myers could happen anywhere in the U.S., experts warn. Florida’s bill represents one of hundreds of GOP-sponsored preemption bills that threaten the ability of cities and towns to govern independently. So far this year, lawmakers in 48 states have pushed more than 800 bills seeking to wrestle control from local jurisdictions — nearly double the number from the previous year — according to a recent report from the Local Solutions Support Center (LSSC), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on local democracy. This uptick reflects a troubling trend, experts say, with the Trump administration signaling to states to consolidate power to help advance its agenda.

“Trump needs the states because they have the authority to implement many of his actions, particularly around immigration,” said Katie Belanger, the lead consultant at LSSC.

Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has made immigration raids in cities and towns across the country a defining priority of his administration. At the same time, state lawmakers have introduced nearly 10 times more bills than last year targeting local immigration policies, the report found. But preemption efforts in conservative states have not been limited to any single issue. Rather, state lawmakers this year have targeted an array of local laws concerning civil liberties and protections, including LGBTQ rights, housing, elections, workers’ rights, and education.

Take Oklahoma. In May, lawmakers passed a bill — HB 1217 — in an attempt to ban drag shows. The law carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. While on the books, the state’s governor and attorney general are at odds on how to enforce the statute.

In Missouri, HB 595 effectively legalized a form of housing discrimination against low-income families. The new law overrides local regulations that prevent landlords from rejecting rental applications from people who receive federal housing subsidies.

Five states — Arkansas, Kansas, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming — passed bans on ranked-choice voting. Two states — Utah and Florida — prohibited local governments from adding fluoride to drinking water. Montana barred vaccine mandates for shots under emergency authorization.

“Some of the stuff that was shocking even five years ago is now so commonplace that we’re numb,” said Lori Riverstone, a prominent researcher of state preemption at Illinois State University.

Riverstone, who in 2017 published an article documenting conservatives’ increased use of preemption as a tool for blocking progressive policies in their states, worries that what researchers initially saw as a short-term strategy has now become the norm.

“It’s just blown up,” Riverstone said, adding, “We’re being boiled by degrees.”

Since January, hundreds of preemption bills have been introduced across the country, though only a fraction — about 11 percent — have been signed into law, according to the LSSC report. Many others that became law have faced legal challenges, such as a Tennessee law that created criminal penalties for local officials who adopt sanctuary immigration policies, and a Louisiana law that required public schools to post the Ten Commandments inside of classrooms. Similarly, a controversial section of Florida’s new immigration law, which makes it a felony for some undocumented immigrants to enter the state, is under a court injunction.

But while many bills fail to become law, and others get tied up in legal battles, experts say that may not be the point. Leslie Zellers, a public policy attorney who co-leads LSSC’s legal team, described the Republicans’ strategy as “laying the groundwork and really kind of shifting the argument to incorporate ideas like this, which were not mainstream a year ago.” Another goal, she says, is to appease President Trump.

“Some of those are definitely Republican lawmakers, maybe in a blue state or a purple state, and they are introducing the bill to show that they support the Trump agenda,” said Zellers.

Lawmakers in Florida did not shy away from their support for the president when they named an early version of their immigration bill the “TRUMP Act.” Legislative leaders in Florida reportedly consulted with the Trump administration while working on the bill. Governor DeSantis, promoting a version of the bill on X, called the legislation “necessary to ensure that Florida leads on fulfilling the Trump Administration’s mandate to enforce immigration law and deport illegal aliens.”

As the GOP’s willingness to use preemption as a political tool grows, so does the scope of the bills aiming to centralize power. Increasingly, conservatives have explored blanket preemption policies, known as “Death Star” bills, which give states the authority to impose their will on local governments with progressive policies. In 2023, Texas lawmakers passed a bill that effectively nullified local laws that conflict with state laws in a number of areas, including agriculture, finance, labor, and natural resources. The Texas “Death Star” bill survived a court challenge in July.

This year, Tennessee enacted a “Death Star” preemption, giving state lawmakers the ability to challenge local laws they object to by requesting an investigation by the state attorney general. Cities and towns that are found in violation of state law could have state funding withheld should they not address it.

“[State legislators] are largely using preemption to punish cities for doing things that they don’t like,” said Luke Fowler, a professor of public policy and administration in the School of Public Service at Boise State University.

When the Fort Myers City Council reconvened for its emergency meeting on March 21, city officials heard from anxious residents during a public input session. Kathy James, a Fort Myers resident and veteran, told lawmakers that she felt like her vote was meaningless after Governor DeSantis threatened to remove council members from office.

“I haven’t seen anything like this since what was reported in Germany in the 1930s,” James said. “People need to wake up.”

Examples like Fort Myers have experts worried that Republicans are trying to send a message to other officials who may disagree with their agenda.

“It is a very chilling effort to really silence duly elected local leaders who are doing what their constituents voted them into office to do,” said Belanger.

In the meantime, opponents of state preemption have had to get strategic about how to push back. Lawsuits in Texas, Tennessee, and Florida have had mixed success. Local officials and activists have successfully blocked or mitigated preemption efforts through organizing efforts in recent years, according to a January report that Zellers co-authored. The wins, however, come at a cost.

“It’s a huge time-suck for advocates to try to counter these negative bills and put in the effort to try to get them stopped,” said Zellers.

Another approach, Fowler says, may be laying low.

“[Democrats] are figuring out how to operate in an environment where they don’t have to call attention to the things they’re doing,” Fowler said. “If they do the exact same things, and they just do it quietly behind closed doors, don’t really invite attention, they can normally get away with it,” adding that, “in bureaucracy, where there’s a will, there’s a way.”

For many Latino members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is an ambivalent sense of the Church’s stance on immigrants.
Shutting the center down added another chilling effect for church members.
“I don’t think the Mormon Church should be responsible for us.
“BYU is a part of the Church and is a university that stands to help promote the Church’s ecclesiastical mission.","On a recent Sunday morning in Provo, Utah, a small congregation of about two dozen people gathered in a church hall for ward services. At the front of the room stood the bishop, who blessed the bread and water in Spanish before passing the trays around for the congregation. The melodic sounds of the piano reverberated across the room as members sang “Welcome Home” — a new hymn for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Ward services like this have brought a consistent comfort and sense of community for Izzy, who came to Provo to study at Brigham Young University a few years ago. But lately, the increased possibility of ICE raids across the country has made him nervous.

“I just couldn’t focus. Just instant anxiety and fear. I worried about my family, and how I was gonna get through this year or the next four or three,” Izzy said. The prospect of an ICE recruitment fair nearby also disturbed him.

When he was just a toddler, Izzy and his parents came from Venezuela to the United States in search of a better life. Then one Christmas, Mormon missionaries brought gifts to their home in West Valley. He and his family were sealed in Utah. He was accepted into the DACA program, Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, years ago.

For many Latino members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is an ambivalent sense of the Church’s stance on immigrants. There is growing discontent about the Church’s silence regarding the ongoing ICE raids, compared to Catholic leaders like Pope Leo XIV, while others have focused on providing individual help to those in need.

The church has previously issued statements regarding immigration in 2011 and 2018 about the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border. But its most recent statement published in January listed three points in order. While it reads similarly to past statements on loving thy neighbor and concern about keeping families together, the first point this time notably focused on “obeying the law.”

When The Times reached out to ask about why the new statement was numbered and in this order, the Church declined to comment.

Dr. David-James Gonzales, a ward leader and history professor at BYU who studies Latino civil rights and migration, notes that the political climate has shifted on immigration in 2025.

“This issue is one of the most polarizing issues nationally and it has split the Church,” he said, adding that it’s fair to question the way the statement is written. “If I’m analyzing it as a historian, it’s speaking to this moment that the Church needs to make clear to this administration that it’s not a sanctuary church.”

The Church does not release publicly any demographic data, but according to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, 86% of the Church’s membership is white. Latinos are some of the fastest growing members worldwide, thanks to missionary work in countries like Mexico, Brazil and Peru.

Yet despite the growth in Spanish-speaking wards and a more diverse Mormon community, many interviewed for this story still feel they face challenges of racism and belonging.

This January, Brigham Young University shut down its “Dreamers” resource hub for undocumented students, after facing backlash from state leaders who complained that their tithings — or 10% obligated donations to the Church — were being used for illegal immigrants. Nori Gomez, the founding member of the Dreamer resource center, said the program’s offices started receiving threatening phone calls. The university eventually removed the resource page.

“It was the highlight of my BYU experience,” she said. “But with how much universities are being attacked right now, I don’t agree with it, but I see why.”

Students like Izzy had found a sense of community among other DACA recipients through these online resources. Shutting the center down added another chilling effect for church members.

For former LDS leaders like Dr. Ignacio Garcia, a retired Latino studies professor and former bishop at a local Spanish-speaking ward, the Church’s silence has been disappointing.

“The Church’s struggle has a lot to do with some of its members, some of its very conservative white members,” Garcia said. “[These congregants] will love you as an individual member in your ward, but then go out and condemn all immigrants.”

In July, following hours of public comment from more than 100 community members opposing ICE’s presence in Utah, the Utah County Commission voted unanimously to enter a cooperative agreement with ICE to share data and work on a joint task force with local police. The county sheriff argued that a collaboration would allow more leeway for local officials to inject “Utah County values” into enforcement and public safety rather than allowing complete federal oversight.

Evelyn R. has worked as a trainer in Provo for young Mormons who are about to embark on their 18 to 24-month missions domestically and abroad. As a DACA recipient herself who previously served a Spanish-speaking mission in Georgia, she has overheard mixed feelings from attendees at the center about how undocumented people can even be baptized.

“[One girl said] you’re not really going to get anywhere with these people because they can’t get baptized. Because in order to be a member of the Church, you need to be abiding by the laws of the land, which is Article 12 of the faith,” Evelyn said.

Article 12 refers to a revelation written by Joseph Smith, stating, “we believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.” The article has guided members to be good citizens in their communities.

Evelyn said she had to ask her mission president if this was true. He reassured her that being undocumented did not gatekeep someone from belonging. It’s a stance that the First Presidency, the Church’s highest officials, also affirmed, saying that being undocumented should not itself prevent “an otherwise worthy Church member” from entering the temple or being ordained to priesthood, and calling upon congregation members to avoid being judgmental. As a convert to the Church and someone who comes from a diverse background, she said mixed responses like this were really hard to hear.

“God doesn’t care about our status or who we are, where we came from in order to be a member of the Church,” she said. Some days, she feels that she can identify as a member of the Church, but not necessarily as part of larger “Mormon culture” — one that might be predominantly white and more conservative on politics in Utah.

“We’re teaching principles and the doctrine of Christ,” she said. “I don’t think we’re necessarily learning how to apply those things.”

Luna Alvarez-Sproul, 25, works as a school teacher in Draper, Utah, where she often translates documents into Spanish for parents. She spent 18 months serving a Spanish-speaking mission in Salmon, Idaho, where many ranch hands were seasonal employees from Latin America.

“As a missionary, we didn’t have to receive special permission from somebody in order to baptize an undocumented individual,” she recalled. “But there [are] so many members of our church that don’t believe that they should be here with their families, which I feel is contradictory in and of itself.”

When guidance can vary so much, some church leaders have taken a more locally-focused ward approach — such as delivering food aid to members, helping out with rent or even sharing personal contacts with immigration lawyers. But addressing topics like the ICE raids during a service is likely taboo.

“Leaders are trained and asked to be very careful about how they address it. And I think that puts them in a really hard situation, especially when they have members of their congregation that are affected by this,” Izzy said.

The frustration may also have to do with reconciling religious principles with the views that are held by many people in the Church.

Other members disagree about an institution-wide response. Julia, who asked to use a pseudonym due to her undocumented status, has seen firsthand the ways that individual actions have been kind to her.

“I don’t think the Mormon Church should be responsible for us. The gospel teaches us to be independent,” she said.

Utah also has infrastructure for many undocumented people to succeed in their daily life, she noted; it was the first state in 2005 to implement the “driver’s privilege card,” a driver’s license specifically for those who were undocumented, allowing them to commute to work and obtain insurance.

Just a few miles away in Orem, conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot at Utah Valley University during a debate less than a week before I conducted these interviews. Hundreds of students and local community members attended vigils, laying bouquets of fresh flowers and American flags alongside crosses and the Book of Mormon on university lawns. “If you want unity, say his name UV,” one poster said. Others were adorned with Bible verses as the air echoed with different Mormon hymns.

The LDS Church released a statement condemning the violence and lawless behavior.

Isa Benjamin Garcia spent some time reflecting on the week’s tragic events after the Sunday ward service. As a daughter of a Mexican immigrant, she became more worried when President Trump rescinded a Biden-era policy that excluded churches and schools from immigration raids.

“There’s a lot of rhetoric around violence, but it’s not acknowledged all the other violence that has been and is,” she said, referring to ICE raids, including an incident where a day laborer died after running away from ICE in California.

Other members echoed this sentiment. “Something I’ve been wrestling with over the last few months is why the Church doesn’t say, ‘This is wrong.’ Like this isn’t what Christ would have us do,” said Benjamin Garcia.

In August, BYU’s Office of Belonging launched an immigration-focused eight-week course to help people gain a “basic understanding of complex immigration policies.” The goal is to equip more nonprofit workers to become partially accredited to represent clients in front of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Gonzales, the ward leader and professor at BYU, believes this step speaks volumes about the Church’s efforts, despite challenges earlier this year with the takedown of its Dreamer center.

“My heart was warmed seeing that,” he said. “BYU is a part of the Church and is a university that stands to help promote the Church’s ecclesiastical mission. I think that’s a form of messaging through one of its institutions.”

Ultimately, when facing these hurdles and different interpretations of what the Book of Mormon or the Church says, members focus on their relationship to the gospel.

“We also believe that we are the Church, and we believe that it is our responsibility to make it better. And that is what God is asking of us, and that’s what Christ is asking of us,” Benjamin Garcia said. She then paused.

“Despite feelings of frustration or questions, what keeps a lot of us here, despite any of that, is that we have a conviction.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f1e23ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1080x567+0+392/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F28%2Fb8%2Fadcf55ed4d6290a180ca634208ff%2Fmormonlatinos-1.png,N,,2025-10-09 16:57:02.939659

A reminder of what we can do, and who we can be, when we defend our communities against abuses of power.","In his first 10 months back in office, President Donald Trump has abused his power to attack our neighbors and communities, suppress free speech, and create a climate of fear. The president has deployed military troops and federal agents into our cities. He has threatened nonprofit organizations, universities, and political opponents who don’t conform to his dangerous agenda. He has targeted journalists, entertainers, and talk show hosts to quell criticism. These actions are designed to intimidate and silence opposition so he can expand his power by any means necessary.

With such a constant deluge of attacks on our rights —and on our communities—it can feel difficult to stay hopeful and engaged. But our history shows that when people organize, protest, and demand justice, we can disrupt abuses of power, and build collective power in response.

​​So how exactly do we show up at this moment to defend our freedoms? Below, you’ll find answers to five of the most pressing questions we’ve received about how to push back against the Trump administration’s abuses of power. This is the third in our ongoing series, “Your Questions Answered,” where we bring your questions directly to ACLU experts.

With all these attacks on our fundamental rights, where do we even start? What actions can make a real difference?

It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and wonder where to even start, but I’ve seen firsthand how powerful it is when millions take action together. The first “No Kings” mobilization proved that. From my vantage point on the core organizing team, I watched in awe as millions filled the streets in one of the largest demonstrations in modern memory. More than 2,000 events—from major cities to small towns where half the community turned out—sent one clear message: we, the people, reject abuses of power and will defend our communities. Being part of the team that helped support that day was one of the proudest moments of my life. But the real power came from everyone who marched, proudly asserted their free speech rights even in the face of intimidation, and showed that our communities are strongest when we stand together.

That’s why I’m so excited for the next “No Kings” rally on October 18. “No Kings” isn’t just another protest— it’s a bold and joyful assertion of our rights. A reminder of what we can do, and who we can be, when we defend our communities against abuses of power.

Whether you rally with your community, contact members of Congress, or display a sign in your front yard championing the principles of a free America, every action—big or small—contributes to the movement.

Does contacting members of Congress actually work? How do we get them to pay attention to the issues we care about?

Contacting members of Congress works. I’ve seen it firsthand. I used to work in Congressional offices and was once the one helping organize in-district town halls, answering calls, and reading emails from constituents. In the offices I worked in, every message was logged and, when enough people reached out about an issue, it was noticed and noticed fast. In fact, it’s not uncommon for a point made in a constituent’s email or call to be used as part of a member’s argument for or against a policy. Many times I have seen personal stories shared by constituents end up in floor speech, mentioned in press conferences, or even featured in newsletters.

Lawmakers rely on constituent stories and perspectives, which shape the narrative and help ground policy in real impacts. There are so many ways you can reach out to your members:

Sending an email or using a digital action tool like aclu.org/action

Calling offices through the Capitol switchboard at (202) 224-3121 to be connected to your representatives/senators

Attending town halls or events

Requesting meetings with staff

Your outreach matters and is so important—not just to inform and persuade, but also to hold elected officials accountable for the choices they make and votes they take.

—Elvia Montoya, senior advisor, Policy & Government Affairs

Beyond Congress, who should we be pressuring? Are local actions impactful? And if so, what are some ways I can get more involved in my local community?

Time and time again, it is the leadership of local and state leaders who uphold our civil rights and liberties. That’s why we have the mandate to meet this moment by standing with them and by partnering with them to pass responsive policies that protect all of our communities. It’s also why I’m so proud to be here at the ACLU, one of the few organizations designed to meet this moment, because of the incredible work of our 54 affiliates across the country. The Firewall for Freedom campaign has already led to dozens of actions being taken across this country. That includes mayors, city councils, state attorneys general, governors and state legislators. Each of us should join our affiliates in calling on officials to pass these Firewall measures to advance and protect our rights, especially in cases of federal overreach.

—Nahal Zamani, director of State Campaigns

It’s alarming to see the government censoring journalists, silencing talk show hosts, and deporting activists. How do we defend free speech when it’s under attack at every level?

The government’s actions are designed to instill fear in all of us because they know that the power of the people is stronger than the people in power. So, they want to silence us. But as we have seen again and again when we raise our voices, we create change. We have seen communities come together to speak up against the separation of families and the tearing apart of community members resulting in the release of mothers, children and students from immigration detention. We have seen how Jimmy Kimmel’s show returned to the air just hours after over 475 artists and 40,000 ACLU supporters signed a letter condemning the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel due to pressure from the administration.

I am proud to lead the ACLU’s Know Your Rights work to ensure that people know how the Constitution protects all of us regardless of immigration status. Just this year, we have empowered thousands of people with the information they need to protect themselves, their neighbors and their communities.

Sticking together works. Raising our voices works. Holding the government accountable works. This moment calls for all of us to do everything we can to protect each other, protect our democracy, and protect our rights.

—Maribel Hernández Rivera, national director of Immigrant Community Strategies

What gives the ACLU hope in this moment — hope that we can defend our neighbors, communities, and the future of democracy?

I remember hearing someone at the ACLU of Georgia say that “we’re not new to this— we’re true to this.” That really stuck with me: the fact that we’ve been here before. The ACLU has been in this fight for more than 100 years. That’s more than 100 years of resistance, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of justice. Our communities have faced attacks on civil liberties before, and we’ve never backed down. If we’ve made it this far, how can we give up now?

I draw strength from those who came before: the ancestors and organizers who dedicated their lives to move us forward. Their sacrifices remind me that this fight is not new, and it’s not any one person’s burden to bear alone. On our organizing team, we’re grounded in the truth that it takes all of us. Thousands of us are in this struggle, standing shoulder to shoulder and refusing to be silenced.

As the child of immigrants, I carry a profound belief in hope—the same hope that led my parents to this country, dreaming of a better life for their children. To give up now would betray that belief. So I won't. That’s what gives me hope: our history, our people, and the power of refusing to give up.

Looking ahead, CAC has also already filed several amicus briefs in cases the Supreme Court will be hearing in November.
CAC filed a brief in support of the plaintiffs, urging the court to deny the pending motion to dismiss.
“Election Law Blog: “The Supreme Court Is Being Tested on History Once Again”” October 7: The New Civil Rights Movement quoted CAC in their article covering oral arguments in Chiles v. Salazar at the Supreme Court.
He also worked as an associate in the Supreme Court and appellate practice of Hogan Lovells.","This week, the Supreme Court’s new Term began, and the Court isn’t wasting any time before digging into incredibly important issues. CAC has filed in many of the big cases the Court will be hearing at the beginning of this Term.

On Monday, in Villarreal v. Texas, the Court considered whether a defendant’s right to counsel was violated when he was prohibited from discussing his own testimony with his attorney at a critical point in his trial. Our amicus brief explained why his Sixth Amendment rights were violated. As CAC Appellate Counsel Ana Builes explained after listening to oral argument in the case, “By prohibiting Mr. Villarreal from consulting with his counsel about important aspects of his case at a critical stage of his trial, the Texas trial court denied him his counsel’s assistance when he needed it the most and denied him the fair trial that the Sixth Amendment guarantees.”

And on Tuesday, in Chiles v. Salazar, the Court considered whether Colorado can prohibit licensed mental health professionals from practicing “conversion therapy” on young people, given the consensus in the medical community that this practice is deeply harmful. Our amicus brief explained that it does not violate the First Amendment for states to protect their residents from such dangerous practices. As CAC’s Vice President Praveen Fernandes wrote after oral argument, “The Court has long acknowledged states’ power to shield their residents from ineffectual or harmful practices by state-licensed professionals.”

Next week, the Court will hear Ellingburg v. United States. Though the Constitution’s Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits Congress from retroactively making a punishment more severe, Holsey Ellingburg was told he must pay nearly double the amount of restitution he was assigned at his sentencing, solely due to changes in the law after his crime occurred. Our brief explains why the Ex Post Facto Clause applies to the restitution law Congress passed after Mr. Ellingburg’s crime.

And on October 15, the Court is hearing Louisiana v. Callais, a case with high stakes for the future of the Voting Rights Act. Our amicus brief explains that the Constitution gives Congress broad enforcement power to prevent impairment of the right to vote, including through the protections of the Voting Rights Act. As CAC’s David H. Gans explained in Slate magazine, drawing on his exciting new research on Black advocacy for voting rights in the aftermath of the Civil War, this ought to be an “open-and-shut” case if the Roberts court is faithful to constitutional text and history. Also on October 15, the Court is considering whether police may enter homes without warrants based on less than probable cause that an emergency is occurring. Our amicus brief details why allowing such entries would be at odds with the Fourth Amendment’s text and history.

Looking ahead, CAC has also already filed several amicus briefs in cases the Supreme Court will be hearing in November. When Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian who wore his hair in dreadlocks in accordance with his religion, showed prison officials a printout of a court decision holding that the law protected his right to keep his dreadlocks in prison, the officials threw the decision into the trash, held him down, and shaved his head. When he sued the prison employees for violating his rights, the lower courts held that the law protecting the religious freedom of incarcerated people does not provide for damages against individual state officials. Our amicus brief explains that the law protected Landor’s ability to vindicate his rights.

On November 12, the Court will consider two cases about the scope of a sentencing judge’s discretion to grant compassionate release under the Sentencing Reform Act. In Rutherford v. United States and Carter v. United States, the Court is considering whether a judge can grant reductions in a petitioner’s sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act because of a significant difference between the sentence they are serving and the sentence that they would have received if they were sentenced for those same offenses today. Our amicus brief explains that judges should be allowed to consider major changes in the law that result in sentencing disparities solely based on when a person was sentenced. And in Fernandez v. United States, our amicus brief explains that a judge should be allowed to consider his “disquiet” about the validity of the jury’s verdict in granting compassionate release.

Needless to say, things have been very busy here at CAC. Even as we continue to support legal challenges to unlawful actions taken by the Trump administration, we’re also still fighting for our Constitution’s progressive promise at the Supreme Court.

San Francisco v. Trump— The District Court for the Northern District of California is considering whether the Trump administration can unilaterally withhold federal funds from jurisdictions that decline to implement his immigration agenda. CAC filed a brief in support of the plaintiffs, urging the court to deny the pending motion to dismiss. Our brief explains why the administration’s actions are a violation of separation-of-powers principles, and that Supreme Court precedent allows the constitutional claims at issue to be reviewed by the courts. Northern California District Court, brief filed October 7.

National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission — The Supreme Court is considering whether to strike down a law that limits the amount of money a national political party committee may spend in coordination with federal candidates for elected office. CAC filed an amicus brief asking the court to uphold the law’s coordinated party expenditure limits, explaining that the law is narrowly tailored to target corruption concerns dating back to the Founders, and that Supreme Court precedent permits contributions limits such as those considered here. Supreme Court, brief filed October 6.

National Treasury Employees Union v. Vought — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether to rehear en banc the case regarding the Trump administration’s efforts to unilaterally shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Our amicus brief explains why the administration’s actions violate the Constitution’s separation of powers, and why the constitutional claim at issue is judicially reviewable under Supreme Court precedent. C. Circuit, brief filed September 30.

PFLAG v. Trump — The Fourth Circuit is considering whether President Trump can legally cut off federal funding for institutions that provide gender-affirming medical care for people under the age of nineteen. CAC filed a brief explaining why constitutional history, centuries of executive practice and court precedent, and separation-of-powers principles prohibit the President from usurping Congress’s power of the purse in an attempt to achieve his own policy initiatives. Fourth Circuit, brief filed September 26.

RAICES v. Noem — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether the Trump administration’s efforts to prohibit certain people in the country from seeking asylum is lawful. CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that the law does not allow the government to “repatriate” asylum-seekers that are already within the country, and that the administration’s actions would upend the asylum system Congress established. C. Circuit, brief filed September 19.

Novartis v. Secretary United States Department of Health and Human Services — WIN — The Third Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the Medicare prescription drug price negotiation program at issue in this case, rejecting Novartis’s constitutional arguments, including its Takings Clause argument. Echoing our brief and citing the court’s earlier ruling in Bristol Myers Squibb v. Becerra, the court emphasized the voluntary nature of the government’s program and concluded that there is no physical taking. Third Circuit, decision rendered September 11.

Parada v. United States — The Supreme Court is being asked to consider whether the Sixth Amendment requires a 12-person jury for a felony conviction. After being convicted by a jury of only eleven people, the petitioners are asking the Court to hear their case and reconsider precedent that allows such a conviction. CAC filed a brief in support of the petitioners, explaining that at the Founding and throughout common law, juries were understood to consist of twelve people. We argue that the prior case that allowed such small juries improperly dismissed the history of the Sixth Amendment. Supreme Court, brief filed September 11.

Properties of the Villages, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission — After the change in presidential administrations, the FTC moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal, acceding to the vacatur of the noncompete rule at issue in the case. Eleventh Circuit, case dismissed September 10.

C. v. Metropolitan School District of Martinsville — The Seventh Circuit is considering whether the Supreme Court’s recent decision in United States v. Skrmetti requires it to overrule previous decisions recognizing that schools that prohibit students from using bathrooms consistent with their gender identity are discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX. CAC filed a brief in support of a transgender boy whose school had such a policy, explaining that the Court’s decision in Skrmetti­—a case involving gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors—should have no effect on precedent regarding gender-aligned bathroom use. Seventh Circuit, brief filed September 10.

Newsom v. Trump — The Ninth Circuit is considering the legality of Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles in response to mostly peaceful protests. CAC filed a brief explaining that, contrary to the Trump administration’s arguments, Supreme Court precedent does not prohibit courts from reviewing presidential decisions to federalize the National Guard, and that founding-era history demonstrates that judges may appropriately evaluate whether the necessary factual conditions exist to justify such action. Ninth Circuit, brief filed September 9.

Ortega v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — WIN — The Fifth Circuit denied the petition for review and dismissed the Seventh Amendment claim against the OCC. Echoing our brief, the court detailed the history of the national banking system and explained that “such a serious and unbroken historical pedigree” proves that “the public-rights exception applies to federal banking enforcement actions, and that petitioners had no right to a jury trial in this matter.” Fifth Circuit, decision rendered September 8.

That's just one of the many legal battles playing out.

A small group of protestors gathered outside the ICE processing facility, with their chants energized following a federal judge's extension of a nationwide consent decree. The 52-page ruling outlines who ICE agents can and can not arrest.

Since ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" concerns have been raised about the random way federal agents have come into the Chicagoland area, detaining people. Hundreds of people have since been taken into custody without warrants or probable cause.

""We now have potentially 200 on our list of potential violations. The vast majority being in the last several weeks,"" Attorney Mark Fleming said.

The National Immigration Justice Center is one of many that filed suit. The agency said it's also going to court about the violations they said took place when federal agents raided a South Shore apartment building, detaining both immigrants and Chicago residents in the middle of the night.

Back in Broadview, police are enforcing protest times after an executive order was signed by the village's mayor this week. Police were seen giving a warning shortly after 6 p.m. to disperse, or people would face citations or be arrested.

While many rally against the deportations, the biggest fight will play out in the federal courthouse.

""It's a glimpse of hope that the courts will still, at times, bear witness and will attempt to limit the harms being conducted by DHS in our communities,"" Said Xanat Sobrevilla, Organized Communities Against Deportations.

On Thursday morning, the city of Chicago and Illinois' attorney general will head to court. It's their attempt to stop the more than 200 National Guard members brought in from Texas from hitting the streets. The guards are currently stationed about 55 miles southwest of Chicago in Elwood. City, county, and state leaders are hoping the legal move will deter any movement.

""The judge didn't explicitly state they couldn't come into the city, but I think if you read between the lines as to what she was saying, that it probably would be a good idea if everybody waited til she made the decision on Thursday to decide what they're going to do,"" legal analyst Irv Miller said.

Thursday determines if the guards move in and what happens in court, including whether the fence placed outside this facility will stay or go.

According to a previous lawsuit against ICE filed by the Colorado Attorney General's Office, she was detained at the ICE Detention Center in Aurora for two weeks.
""The true illegality here is ICE's flagrant disregard of federal law,"" said Hans Meyer, immigration attorney for the plaintiffs and owner of the Meyer Law Office.
The suit goes on to say that ICE explicitly changed its policies to comply with those decades-old requirements in 2022.
It also says that former ICE director and current ""Border czar"" for the Trump Administration, Tom Homan, has ""repeatedly"" said ICE would rely on ""indiscriminate warrantless arrests.""","The ACLU of Colorado and several law firms are suing the Trump Administration, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a new federal lawsuit filed on Thursday. They allege ICE is arresting people across Colorado without warrants and without determining if the people they're arresting are citizens or not.

The groups, which also include the Meyer Law Office and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray, LLC, filed the suit on behalf of Refugio Ramirez Ovando, Caroline Dias Goncalves, two other plaintiffs who are only identified by their initials, and ""all those similarly situated.""

""People are terrified that masked agents will snatch their loved ones or neighbors from the street because an ICE agent believes they look different or speak with an accent. This is unacceptable,"" Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, said in a statement. ""The courts must see ICE's actions for what they are: an unlawful abuse of power that must be stopped.""

The ICE Denver field office responded Thursday that it does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation. After publication of this story, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email to CBS News Colorado through a department spokesperson, ""DHS complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.""

The suit names Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE acting director Todd Lyons, and ICE Denver Field Office director Robert Guadian as defendants. It alleges ""militarized"" ICE agents, ""often with masks, body armor, and long guns,"" are ""indiscriminately stopping and arresting people with brown skin in their mission to meet the Administration's ramped-up enforcement demands.""

The organizations that filed the suit are asking a judge to make this a class-action lawsuit, determine whether these arrests violated federal law, and, if deemed illegal, order ICE to stop future warrantless arrests.

One of the plaintiffs, Dias Goncalves, is a 19-year-old nursing student living in Utah who was stopped by a Mesa County sheriff's deputy in May and then reported to ICE, which state officials and the ACLU say violated state law. According to a previous lawsuit against ICE filed by the Colorado Attorney General's Office, she was detained at the ICE Detention Center in Aurora for two weeks. She has lived in the U.S. since she was brought here from Brazil as a Dreamer at 7.

Ramirez Ovando is a 43-year-old father who's lived in Colorado for 20 years, according to the lawsuit, which claims that ICE mistakenly arrested him in May without a warrant and while looking for someone else. Ovando says he was held at the Aurora ICE facility for three months, the suit alleges.

One plaintiff, identified by his initials, J.S.T., is a 36-year-old asylum seeker who was arrested without a warrant during a large operation across Denver and Aurora in February, according to the lawsuit. He was held at the detention center for four weeks.

And the other plaintiff, identified by the initials ""G.R.R.,"" alleges he was arrested without a warrant during a large federal operation in Colorado Springs in April. The lawsuit says the 32-year-old father and business owner was held at the detention center for over six weeks.

The four plaintiffs named in the suit serve as representatives of an unknown number of people arrested in Colorado, as well as those who may be arrested in the future. They include ""All persons since January 20, 2025, who have been arrested or will be arrested in this District by ICE without a warrant and without a pre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause that the person poses a flight risk,"" according to the suit.

""The true illegality here is ICE's flagrant disregard of federal law,"" said Hans Meyer, immigration attorney for the plaintiffs and owner of the Meyer Law Office. ""The courts must act to halt this widespread and egregious ICE practice of arresting people without warrants based on how they look, how they speak, or simply because of who they are with. This practice is a frontal assault on our communities to advance Trump's mass deportation agenda.""

The suit says ICE is violating certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which prohibits warrantless arrests unless agents have ""reason to believe"" that a person is both unlawfully in the U.S. and that the person ""is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest."" The suit goes on to say that ICE explicitly changed its policies to comply with those decades-old requirements in 2022.

It also says that former ICE director and current ""Border czar"" for the Trump Administration, Tom Homan, has ""repeatedly"" said ICE would rely on ""indiscriminate warrantless arrests.""

Bloomberg first reported that DHS had sent reassignments to “hundreds” of personnel, including CISA staff.
One DHS employee, who spoke to Federal News Network on condition of anonymity, said a wave of management-directed reassignments began going out to some DHS staff in September, while another wave began last week.
They speculated DHS may not have funding immediately available to cover the moves for employees who accept the reassignments.
The reassignments come as the vast majority of DHS staff work through the government shutdown.","The Department of Homeland Security has been sending out “management directed reassignments” to dozens of employees, forcing staff in some cases to choose whether to move hundreds of miles to a new job or face termination.

DHS has sent the reassignments out to employees across the department, including at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to multiple people familiar with the directives. They were granted anonymity to discuss the matter.

Employees have been handed reassignments to different DHS components, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Protective Service.

Bloomberg first reported that DHS had sent reassignments to “hundreds” of personnel, including CISA staff.

The latest shifts come after DHS transferred more than 100 employees to ICE in August, including 50 staff from FEMA’s human resources department, according to the Washington Post.

“DHS routinely aligns personnel to meet mission priorities while ensuring continuity across all core mission areas,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Any notion that DHS is unprepared to handle threats to our nation because of these realignments is ludicrous, especially given the abject failure at the hands of CISA in the last administration.”

One reassignment notice viewed by Federal News Network gave an employee seven days to decide on a reassignment hundreds of miles from their current duty station. If accepted, the “goal” would be to complete the reassignment within 60 days, according to the letter.

Declining the reassignment, or accepting but failing to report for duty, would subject the employee to removal from federal service, the letter added.

One DHS employee, who spoke to Federal News Network on condition of anonymity, said a wave of management-directed reassignments began going out to some DHS staff in September, while another wave began last week.

So far, the DHS employee said most staff who have responded – either to accept the reassignment or reject the move – have yet to hear back.

They speculated DHS may not have funding immediately available to cover the moves for employees who accept the reassignments. Employees who accept management-directed reassignments can be reimbursed for relocation expenses. Last month, the Office of Personnel Management paused the relocation of some OPM staff after facing significant costs.

Federal News Network has reached out to DHS for comment.

The reassignments come as the vast majority of DHS staff work through the government shutdown.

“The health care fight is the right fight for us to be in,” said Senator Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont.
Now Republicans are demanding Democratic votes to fund the government and blaming their colleagues for the mounting damage in the shutdown.
“They don’t want to give the president a victory on anything.” Democrats say their apprehension about the Trump administration is well-founded, given what they have witnessed and experienced so far.
But they say a spending agreement is possible despite their ominous view of the Trump administration.","Democrats in Congress have been relentless about casting the government shutdown clash as a fight over helping Americans pay for health insurance.

But there is another, far deeper issue driving the impasse: their outrage about what is happening across the country under a president they regard as lawless and unchecked.

While Democrats believe they have a winning political argument in demanding the extension of Obamacare subsidies, they are also motivated by Mr. Trump’s extreme policies and tactics, and his penchant for running roughshod over the legislative branch with scant pushback from congressional Republicans. That is one reason that the shutdown impasse has dragged on, with no immediate move toward resolution and little sign that Democrats’ resolve is flagging.

Democrats have watched with increasing alarm as the administration has ignored congressional spending directives, dispatched the military to American cities, ordered government retribution against Mr. Trump’s perceived adversaries and mounted an aggressive immigration roundup that has prompted fierce fights in the courts.

“The issue that we are debating,” Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, said on the Senate floor on Tuesday, “is not just health care, as enormously important as that is. What we are talking about is whether we are going to allow our country to move toward an authoritarian society, run by a president who is a megalomaniac, who wants more and more power in his hands, who does not respect the rule of law or the Constitution of the United States of America.’’

Democrats have good reasons to center the shutdown fight around the extension of pandemic-era Obamacare health insurance subsidies. They fear that millions of Americans could see their coverage costs soar or become unaffordable without quick action by Congress. It is a unifying subject and has strong political resonance. The impact of not intervening would be felt by both Democratic and Republican voters, providing an opening to reach across the aisle for a solution.

“The health care fight is the right fight for us to be in,” said Senator Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. “And one of the reasons I think the health care fight is the right fight is that the folks who are going to be hurt are folks who voted for Trump, and folks who didn’t.”

Democrats employ language in describing the Trump administration that would be considered extraordinary in the past, but is becoming almost commonplace now, illustrating the depth of their apprehension about the administration and their dark view of its capabilities.

Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and one of the lawmakers central to ending the spending impasse, described the Trump administration this week as “run by crooks and cowards.”

Others were equally disparaging.

“We have a government that has been hijacked at the highest levels by people who act like mob bosses,” Senator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat who was elected just last year, said in a floor speech. “I’m from Jersey. We know a thing or two about mob bosses.”

Senator Richard J. Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat and one of those who broke with the majority of his party last March by voting to fund the government, has this time seen Mr. Trump dispatch Texas National Guard troops to his home state over objections from Illinois leaders, a move unlikely to win Mr. Durbin’s support on spending.

“Instead of working to find a bipartisan way to reopen the government and lower the cost of health care, President Trump is solely focused on scoring points against his perceived enemies,” Mr. Durbin said.

A secondary goal of the Democrats in the standoff is to win guarantees against the administration overriding congressionally approved spending plans in the future, though Democrats have chosen not to emphasize that aspect. They see it as inside baseball and do not want to distract from their focus on health insurance, which has more relevance to the general public.

Democrats also worry about the willingness of their Republican congressional colleagues to enforce any agreement, even though they say their G.O.P. colleagues assure them privately that they intend to resist more attempts by the White House to counter spending approved by Congress.

But so far, congressional Republicans have stood by complacently as Mr. Trump has usurped congressional authority in numerous ways, including his widespread imposition of tariffs without congressional action, and his instigation of military actions, such as deadly attacks on boats that the administration said were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea. A Democratic attempt to block those strikes won just two Republican supporters Wednesday night as the measure failed in the Senate.

Senate Republicans have also found ways to sidestep Democrats this year by stretching the rules covering what legislation is subject to the filibuster, and changing the rules to overcome Democratic opposition to Trump nominees. Now Republicans are demanding Democratic votes to fund the government and blaming their colleagues for the mounting damage in the shutdown.

“They just can’t fathom having to deal with us,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. “They haven’t needed our votes. And so this is the first time that they’re confronted with the idea that we are not irrelevant, and it is making them angry.”

Republicans attribute the Democratic refusal to reopen the government without concessions on health insurance to their desire to placate elements of the party that have insisted on blanket resistance to Mr. Trump at any cost.

“It is sort of this blind Trump derangement syndrome if you will,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said on Fox News. “They don’t want to give the president a victory on anything.”

Democrats say their apprehension about the Trump administration is well-founded, given what they have witnessed and experienced so far. But they say a spending agreement is possible despite their ominous view of the Trump administration.

“We’ve got to have faith we can get through this,” said Mr. Welch. “We’ve got to maintain as much as we can.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09dc-assess-TOP-new-zhcq/09dc-assess-TOP-new-zhcq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:58:22.134449

Trump Administration Fires Immigration Judges

The Trump Administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement, with ICE agents and National Guard troops deployed to cities across the country. And federal efforts to crack down are not solely focused on detainment, but also removing the judges that oversee immigration cases. Last month the administration fired dozens of immigration judges across the country, including three in Sacramento. These removals have raised alarms, and some within the judicial community are warning of a potential “chilling effect” for years to come. CapRadio Statehouse Politics Reporter Gerardo Zavala breaks down some of the reactions to these firings, and what the impacts are on local immigrants that need their legal services.

Don Craven, who had led the IPA since 2021, added the organization to the lawsuit Sunday alongside other Illinois news outlets and advocacy groups. The IPA board disagreed with the decision and told him “to do whatever necessary to dismiss the IPA as a Plaintiff in that litigation,” which Craven did before submitting his resignation, according to an email Craven wrote to an organization of other press associations Wednesday.

Craven wrote that his decision as the IPA’s President, CEO and legal counsel was based on the lawsuit’s aim “to preserve and protect the First Amendment rights of journalists.” Attempts to reach Craven for additional comment were not immediately returned.

The plaintiffs, which include digital news site Block Club Chicago and the Chicago News Guild among others, specifically cite violent actions from ICE agents toward reporters covering protests at a facility in Broadview, Illinois.

“Journalists reported being singled out for detention, being shot by rubber bullets, and being exposed to gas pellets, all because they were doing their jobs,” Craven wrote in his email. “A minister, in clerical garb, was shot at and gassed, while praying in front of the facility.”

The IPA board did not respond to a request for comment. It released a statement to the association’s members Wednesday afternoon, which read that a six-person executive team will oversee operations as the board begins recruiting candidates.

The IPA aims to provide “legislative, business, advertising, educational and legal services” for the 375 daily and weekly newspapers in its membership, according to its website. It is one of the largest newspaper associations in the country.

The IPA is a part of the Newspaper Association Managers, a fraternal organization of press associations across the country which organizes discussions among members on relevant industry issues. Layne Bruce, the executive director of the Mississippi Press Association who serves as the volunteer clerk for NAM, said this news will “without a doubt” be on the agenda for NAM’s next meeting in December.

“As far as I’m aware, this is the most significant development in a press association in the current political climate,” he said.

A mix of news organizations and independent protesters filed the lawsuit Monday, listing ICE officials, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Donald Trump among the defendants.

Jonathan Manes, senior counsel for the MacArthur Justice Center and professor at Pritzker School of Law on press freedom and freedom of information, said this is an “incredibly important lawsuit.”

Ron DeSantis announced FHP would enforce immigration laws alongside federal agencies like ICE.

The apparent raid occurred at Outerspaces Landscapes at 500 E. Cross St. in the morning hours of Oct. 9.

Several workers appeared to have been arrested. Video posted on social media shows ICE officers, some wearing masks and some not, alongside FHP officers at the business. The streets in a one-block area around the business were blocked by FHP during the raid.

Detained workers were placed in a bus labeled ""Escambia County Corrections.""

The News Journal has requested information about the raid from the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, FHP, and Escambia County. So far, Escambia County is the only agency to respond to the News Journal's request.

Escambia County spokesperson Davis Wood told the News Journal that ICE requested transportation assistance from the county, but any further information about the operation would have to be released by ICE.

""Escambia County Corrections periodically provides resources by request for inter-agency operations where multiple arrests are possible, whether it’s a federal, state or local agency,"" Wood said.

Video posted to social media also showed an Escambia County ambulance near the site, but Wood said that ambulance was responding to an unrelated call for service.

Pensacola Police Department spokesperson Mike Wood told the News Journal that PPD was not involved in the raid, but one detective was on scene solely as an observer because it was occurring within the city limits.

Grace Resendez McCaffery, publisher of the Spanish-language newspaper La Costa Latina and founder of the Hispanic Resource Center of Northwest Florida and South Alabama, told the News Journal that several workers were likely arrested at the site, including workers who had legal authorization to work in the United States.

Resendez McCaffery said a woman called her from the bus where the detained workers had been placed. She said the woman was told by one ICE agent she wouldn't be arrested after showing her documentation, but another said to ""take her anyway.""

""They’re not even distinguishing between documented and undocumented,"" Resendez McCaffery said.

Resendez McCaffery said it's unclear how many workers were arrested as she's had several families reach out to her. One report she received said it could be as many as 30, though she is not confident in that number. She said those detained were told they were being transported to the Escambia County jail.

Through her work with the Hispanic Resource Center of Northwest Florida and South Alabama, Resendez McCaffery has monitored the stepped-up immigration under the Trump administration. She noted that, although there have been other raids in Northwest Florida and many in Baldwin County, Alabama, this was the first large-scale raid to occur in Pensacola.

U.S. District Judge April Perry was hearing arguments in a packed downtown Chicago courtroom from attorneys for the state of Illinois and the Justice Department.

Perry pressed Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton on whether National Guard troops would only be stationed around federal buildings or also in neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. Hamilton responded that troops also could be used to “protect ICE agents” in the field.

Perry called the Trump administration's claims of a so-called rebellion ""audacious"" and questioned the information being used to deploy the guard.

""What if the DHS folks are not tethered to reality? Does that matter?"" she said, asking ""who are the rebels"" and ""are they well armed?""

Thursday's hearing before Perry was over a request to block the deployment of Illinois and Texas Guard members in Illinois.

Chicago and Illinois filed a lawsuit on Monday to stop the deployments, calling them unnecessary and illegal. In a court filing in the lawsuit, the city and state say protests at a temporary ICE detention facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview have “never come close to stopping federal immigration enforcement.”

Local

Christopher Wells, a lawyer with the Illinois attorney general’s office, began Thursday's hearing by urging Perry to stop the National Guard deployment that “threatens the careful balance of our Constitutional system.”

Hamilton characterized Chicago as beset by what he called “tragic lawlessness,” noting a recent confrontation in which two residents were accused of using their vehicles to ram into and box in a Border Patrol vehicle. One person was shot and wounded by a Border Patrol agent.

Some Guard members ordered to Illinois by President Donald Trump now are protecting federal property near Chicago.

New video showed uniformed troops appearing to arrive at the Immigration Customs and Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview early Thursday morning, with soldiers seen behind a fenced area carrying shields, duffle bags and other equipment in and out of the building.

In a statement sent to NBC Chicago, the Village of Broadview confirmed that three vans carrying 45 members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the federal building late Wednesday night.

""During their patrols, Broadview police officers observed the vans parked in the rear of 2000 25th Ave. and all of the guards were sleeping,"" the statement said. ""We let them sleep undisturbed. We hope that they will extend the same courtesy in the coming days to Broadview residents who deserve a good night’s sleep, too.""

The Broadview facility has been the site of numerous protests and tensions between activists and masked, armed federal agents, with rubber bullets and chemical agents like tear gas deployed and barricades erected.

The new images come after the U.S Northern Command confirmed that approximately 500 soldiers from various units of the Texas and Illinois National Guards were activated in the Chicago area on a 60-day mission to protect federal agents and facilities.

""These soldiers are employed to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" the U.S. Northern Command said in mission update.

City officials in Joliet told NBC Chicago they were notified Tuesday that the Texas National Guard would be stationed at the Army Reserve in Elwood, about 50 miles outside Chicago. Footage captured by NBC 5 and Telemundo Tuesday and Wednesday showed uniformed troops on the ground at the facility, along with dozens of trucks and what appeared to be fencing and mobile housing.

Court filings said there are approximately 200 federalized National Guardsmen in the State of Illinois, and that the Illinois Army National Guard has been authorized to ""mobilize 300 members of the Army National Guard, who are currently mustering to ensure readiness.""

Wednesday, federal Judge Sara Ellis said sufficient evidence exists to suggest that protesters and the press are ""at risk of injury"" because government agents had acted indiscriminately in the past. Ellis issued a temporary restraining order Thursday with guidelines for how agents can interact with protesters and the press.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Donald Trump both defended the decision to federalize the National Guard during a press availability Wednesday.

Elias’ lawsuit states Ambridge Sgt.","Two protesters arrested in late July during an ICE-involved patrol in Ambridge are suing the borough and several local officers on claims they were unlawfully detained for exercising their rights.

Separate lawsuits, filed Oct. 8 in federal court, allege Isaac Elias and Katherine Melson were arrested without probable cause and without being read their Miranda rights, subjected to excessive force and denied legal counsel before being arraigned. The lawsuits also claim the arrests, made as Elias and Melson protested police activity, violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful assembly.

Joe Askar, solicitor for the borough, said he is reviewing the filings and declined to comment.

Aftermath of an ‘intense’ operation

Interviewed over the summer, Ambridge Police Chief John DeLuca referred to the operation as a “saturation patrol,” involving multiple local and federal forces, and “not an ICE detention roundup.” He said the department would work with ICE when asked, though it doesn’t have a formal contractual agreement.

ICE agents, aided by Ambridge police, the Beaver County Sheriff’s office and at least one Pennsylvania State Police officer, arrested individuals across town over the course of several hours the night of July 31. Observers and response volunteers crowded outside the police station.

Elias witnessed 12 arrests targeting suspected immigrants and, according to the complaint, began marching the perimeter of the Ambridge police station holding a homemade sign that read “No Justice, No Peace” and chanting “Shame!”

The Ambridge operation followed protests across the country as immigrant communities and advocates denounced ICE’s increasingly forceful tactics under President Donald Trump. In the Pittsburgh area, immigration-related arrests soared in the first six months of his administration

Observers in Ambridge said the arrests disrupted the Beaver County river town that’s home to a growing Latino community. Some suspected racial profiling, pointing to a traffic stop of a young Latino couple earlier in the night.

Jaime Martinez, community defense organizer at Casa San José, said at the time, “This is the most intense thing we have ever seen.” Martinez leads a network of volunteers trained to respond in real time to ICE sightings, arrests and raids in an effort to document federal agents and deter a reported increase in civil rights violations under the Trump administration.

Melson and Elias told Public Source that their lawsuits help give voice to those arrested by ICE and draw attention to how a national issue is affecting the local community.

“The people who were taken that night aren’t afforded the ability to hold police and elected officials accountable,” Melson said.

Forceful arrests alleged

Elias was arrested around 10:40 p.m. and later charged with disorderly conduct, unreasonable noise and resisting arrest. A magisterial judge dismissed the charges for both Elias and Melson after they completed 25 hours of community service.

Melson and her wife joined observers outside the police department shortly before Elias’ arrest. The complaint states, after arresting Elias, officers directed Melson and others to step back another 10 to 15 feet because officers were taking someone into custody.

Less than a minute later, officers Michael Longo and John Chickos arrested her, according to the filing. She claims no other bystanders around her were arrested, despite also not stepping back after police orders.

While in custody, the filing states, Chickos used repeated force by “throwing her around” and pinching under her arms, leaving bruises. Another unidentified officer kicked her, according to the suit, and she was strip-searched at the Beaver County Jail.

She claims she repeatedly asked for legal counsel, but was not permitted to contact a lawyer. Later, according to the lawsuit, an attorney representing Melson called the police department, and was told by an officer she could not speak with her client. He said Melson’s charges were “not just disorderly,” though he refused to tell her what the charges were, according to the lawsuit.

Melson was ultimately charged with obstruction of administrative law, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and harassment.

Elias’ lawsuit states Ambridge Sgt. Sokheng Seng pulled Elias’ arm outside the normal range of motion, causing an “involuntary jerking” during the arrest. Elias claims he suffered physical injury, pain and emotional distress, according to the lawsuit.

Protecting the right to protest

Especially in a small town, Elias said, people should be able to trust that police will protect them.

“It’s important that somebody helps to keep the law enforcement folks within the law,” he said. “People that do [go to protests] should be able to exercise their rights.”

According to the lawsuit, Elias was also not given a reason for his arrest and was told by jail officials he was not “permitted” to have an attorney present at the arraignment per “jail policy.”

The lawsuit also states that Elias’ sign was confiscated and that he was arrested for the “purpose of chilling his First Amendment rights and in retaliation for his exercise of those rights.”

Christine Elzer, the attorney representing Melson and Elias, said peaceful protest is one of the most “fundamental” rights in the United States and that arrests like theirs are a “threat to free speech everywhere.”

Elias and Melson demanded a jury trial and are seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

Update (10/8/2025): This story was updated after the borough solicitor confirmed the defendants would not comment on the lawsuits.

The White House says the crackdown is aimed at catching ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants. Local officials say it’s a power grab. Residents feeling the brunt of the crackdown say immigration agents are making life untenable.

Scenes from the blitz include a Mexican man fatally shot by immigration agents in the northwest suburbs who said the man drove his car into an officer; federal officials deploying chemical agents on protesters and journalists outside the local immigration enforcement facility; and agents rappelling from Black Hawk helicopters to raid a South Side apartment building in the middle of the night.

Department of Homeland Security officials said on Oct. 8 that they had ""arrested more than 1,500 illegal aliens − including criminal pedophiles, murderers, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers"" in connection with the blitz. USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify Homeland Security’s arrests.

Most recently, Trump said he would jail Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson for resisting the administration's crime-fighting goals in the city. National Guard troops are now deploying to the area.

Here’s a look at how the blitz is affecting people in the Chicago area, from near the Wisconsin border to Indiana.

South Side parking lot stakeout

In the predawn hours Oct. 7, dozens of Chicagoans gathered near an empty parking lot off a busy thoroughfare on the South Side.

The early hour, they told reporters at the scene, was in response to the schedule they noticed immigration enforcement agents were keeping. They said they hoped to be able to document agents carrying out their duties.

Federal agents arrived at the parking lot in the Back of the Yards neighborhood and set up a staging point for operations. The Yards Plaza lot is off the major thoroughfare of 47th Street near schools and a Home Depot.

Residents say masked men carrying guns take people off the streets in the surrounding area and bring them to the lot to move them into a van to be taken elsewhere.

""We went from being this community that walks our kids to school or goes out to parks. ... . Now the streets are empty,"" said Pedraza, adding she worries about students in the area witnessing agents at work. ""Imagine being a first grader and seeing agents with military weapons, masked men. No child should have to pass through that.""

'Agents have created a war zone in our community,' local alderwoman says

Among the people on hand was local alderwoman Julia Ramirez. The City Council member said she came to fight back for residents she sees as caught in a ""war zone.""

""People can't live their lives the way they did before,"" Ramirez said. ""Agents have created a war zone in our community.""

Many of the people there were members of what’s known as the Southwest Side Rapid Response team, a group of volunteers that aims to document immigration enforcement actions and confirm sightings of immigration agents.

Pedraza, a team member, said neighborhood residents looking to leave the house will give her a call first to see about the latest confirmed immigration agent sightings.

After assembling in the morning, team members were seen standing on corners throughout the neighborhood, notably at sites where immigration agents have been reported before, including the Home Depot.

The Southwest Side team is one of many active throughout the Chicago area. Many regularly broadcast confirmed immigration agent sightings.

DHS officials have criticized those efforts, saying activists tracking federal immigration agents are endangering law enforcement officers who are doing their jobs.

On Oct. 8, the Southwest Side team reported sightings of immigration agents in the area that included the make, model and license plate number of immigration agents’ vehicles.

Across town, on the Northwest Side, another team reported seeing eight immigration agents' vehicles, including a white SUV with a Mexican flag on the hood. Locals believe agents are adding Mexican flags to cars to act as a decoy.

Teams in the suburbs also reported immigration agent sightings on Oct. 8, saying that in Oak Park, Berwyn and Cicero, volunteers ""were able to confirm that ICE was active in our communities and abducted at least two of our neighbors.""

Rapid-response teams respond to calls to a hotline organized by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Spokesperson Brandon Lee said their role consists of documenting federal law enforcement, not interfering with their work.

Friendly Confines still full of 'joy'

Amid the increasingly aggressive crackdown, many in Chicago are trying to maintain a sense of normalcy and big events help eclipse the national spotlight that comes from immigration agents clashing with residents or Trump calling for the governor’s arrest.

""It’s sometimes hard living your own life knowing all this is happening,"" said Jeanne Uehling, a Chicagoan of more than 20 years attending the Cubs game Oct. 8. ""It’s surreal that at work I have to care about someone turning something in when there are helicopters landing and raiding people.""

The downtown office worker spoke with USA TODAY outside Wrigley Field with longtime friend Julie Murphy. They said that they were going to the game despite the president calling Chicago a hellhole.

""We have to still feel joy, and this city has so much joy,"" said Murphy, who originally moved to the city from the suburbs. ""People outside the city, they don’t know what's going on. They think we're being rescued somehow.""

The game and crowds teeming up and down Clark Street outside the stadium are just the latest example of the city letting loose to enjoy itself. During a break in the first inning, fans stopped to sing ""Y.M.C.A.,"" a notable Trump anthem that has also been a Wrigley Field staple for years.

Hundreds of swimmers recently competed in races in the city’s river for the first time in nearly a century. The inaugural Chicago River Swim comes after decades spent cleaning the former industrial waterway.

For Sunday, Oct. 12, the city was preparing for its annual marathon, in which more than 53,000 runners were expected to compete. The race showcases the city’s iconic downtown Loop neighborhood.

'Closed due to the situation'

Unpredictable immigration raids and the deployment of National Guard troops have the region on edge.

""Over the past few weeks we’ve all felt it: families afraid to leave their homes and go to school, parents kissing their kids goodbye not knowing they’ll make it home. That’s something nobody should have to live with,"" said Edwin Lagunas of Toluca’s Restaurant in Waukegan.

Lagunas, who was born and raised in the Chicago suburb, spoke at a news conference Oct. 7 held in response to at least seven people being detained by agents in the area the day before.

The crackdown has had a severe impact on life in the area, locals say. Toluca’s and other neighborhood spots had signs posted saying that they were ""closed due to the situation"" until at least Oct. 9, when a federal judge in Chicago was expected to rule on the question of whether National Guard troops may remain in the area.

Sandra Fajardo, owner of a popular indoor soccer complex, said that suddenly teams had begun showing up with players missing, or canceling games outright.

""What’s happening in our city right now is heartbreaking,"" the Waukegan native said. ""Immigration agents are keeping people from enjoying the basic things of life.""

TALLAHASSEE — An appeals-court panel on Thursday grilled attorneys about a new state law making it a crime for undocumented immigrants to enter Florida, questioning whether enforcement and oversight of such issues should be left to the federal government.

The Republican-controlled Legislature passed the law during a February special session aimed at helping President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.

The law (SB 4-C) makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter or re-enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”

Attorneys for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida and two individual plaintiffs filed a challenge in federal court in South Florida, alleging the law is unconstitutional.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in April issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law, saying it was likely preempted by federal immigration-enforcement authority. In part, she pointed to part of the law requiring that violators go to jail and indicated that could conflict with federal authority.

A three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday heard arguments in the state’s appeal of Williams’ order. The legal battle over the law has been highly contentious, with Williams taking the unusual step of finding Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier in civil contempt because of a letter he sent to law enforcement agencies indicating he could not prevent police from enforcing the law after Williams ordered a halt.

Thursday’s arguments touched on the contempt order but focused on the underlying dispute about Florida’s authority to make it a crime for people who are in the country without authorization to enter the state.

Judge Adalberto Jordan, who was joined on the panel by judges Charles Wilson and Barbara Lagoa, pressed Jeffrey DeSousa, the state’s acting solicitor general, about the preemption issue.

“The federal government has created a scheme where only certain illegal entry or re-entry offenses are prosecuted, others are taken care of civilly through the removal process, but you think that’s not field preempted?” Jordan asked.

DeSousa pointed to previous court rulings establishing that “states could have precisely the kinds of regulations that Florida has adopted” and saying that “states aren’t powerless to deter the influx of immigrants into the United States illegally, and that’s all that Florida has done here.”

DeSousa also argued that federal immigration law “is primarily concerned with admissibility regulations” about who can enter the country.

Lagoa, a former Florida Supreme Court justice, asked DeSousa about part of the law that says people who are arrested pose a flight risk and must be held without bond.

“It seems like a strange way to handle it. It causes me some concern,” she said.

The panel’s review of Williams’ preliminary injunction “is governed by the abuse of discretion standards,” Jordan told DeSousa, noting that other courts that have considered similar state laws have found that they were preempted by federal authority.

“The general default principle is you don’t do merits review in a preliminary injunction appeal because the judge is weighing probabilities, and that’s a quintessential discretionary call unless there’s a clear error of judgment,” Jordan said.

But DeSousa argued that preliminary injunctions “have proliferated over the last decade.”

“This is a huge rule-of-law problem for states because a district court that wrongfully imposes a PI (preliminary injunction), as we think happened here, can effectively pause a state’s law for potentially years through the pendency of the litigation. It can take years and the state is irreparably harmed by that,” DeSousa said.

Cody Wofsy, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the plaintiffs, argued that the U.S. Supreme Court for over 150 years has said that immigration law should be regulated by the federal government.

“The interest here is an … inherent, central area of federal control and interest,” Wofsy, who is deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, told the panel.

Florida’s law is “even more punitive” than federal immigration law, requiring mandatory pretrial detention and longer mandatory sentences, according to Wofsy.

Lagoa noted that states can impose tougher penalties for drug crimes. But Wofsy said that immigration is different.

“Here, we’re saying there is a complex problem at the border that we’re dealing with, which is there are people who are coming in between ports. We both want to deter that, but we also want to acknowledge foreign policy considerations, humanitarian considerations, connections with US citizens. …. How do we figure that out? We have one sovereign make the decision about which tools are going to be deployed, and that’s the federal government,” Wofsy said.

The judges also wrangled over Williams’ contempt order.

Uthmeier has argued that a temporary restraining order — and a longer-lasting preliminary injunction issued later — should only apply to him and local state attorneys because they were the named defendants in the underlying lawsuit.

In an April 23 letter to police agencies, Uthmeier reiterated that position and said he could not prevent police from enforcing the law “where there remains no judicial order that properly restrains you from doing so,” according to Williams’ June 17 contempt ruling.

Lagoa said she thought Williams “erred” when issuing the contempt ruling because Uthmeier’s office doesn’t have direct oversight of sheriffs.

“So how is it appropriate for the district court judge to order the attorney general of Florida to, in essence, supervise these law-enforcement officers?” she asked Wofsy.

But Wofsy said he disagreed with Lagoa’s representation of Williams’ order.

“What the attorney general and every defendant was ordered to do was to give notice of the court’s order. He didn’t have to agree with it. He didn’t have to command them to do anything,” Wofsy said, adding that the contempt issue is the subject of a separate appeal. “The problem with what the attorney general did here is not that he refused to command law enforcement officers, it’s that he told them that there was no lawful legitimate order binding them.”",https://cdn.wmnf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-citizenship-immigration-services-by-Evgenia-Parajanian-via-iStock-1251559190.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 14:57:36.150342

The immediate aftermath of the shooting was marked by panic and fear in the immigrant community.
The ever-expanding relationship between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is a key detail in how one of the victims of the September 24 shooting, Guzman-Fuentes, a 37-year-old from El Salvador, ended up at the Dallas ICE Field Office that day.
Shortly after Guzman-Fuentes was booked at the Dallas County Jail, ICE “encountered him” and filed an immigration detainer.
At a vigil held at Dallas City Hall on October 3, organizers gathered to “center the victims of the shooting” and to condemn the “dehumanization” of migrants by the Trump administration.","On September 24, a gunman shot at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, killing two immigrants, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes and Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, and seriously injuring another, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, who were being detained at the site.

The federal government was quick to blame the attack on the “far left” and the “dehumanization” of ICE agents “who are simply enforcing the law.” Around four hours after the shooting, FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo of bullets with the message “anti-ICE” written on them allegedly found at the scene, citing this as evidence of the suspected shooter’s “idealogical [sic] motive.”

But for the immigrant community in Dallas, the shooting is yet another instance of the violence and fear they have endured under President Donald Trump’s nearly $30 billion “deportation-industrial complex” and a continuation of the lack of transparency and accountability from the local and federal governments alike.

The immediate aftermath of the shooting was marked by panic and fear in the immigrant community. At a vigil two days after the shooting, at Parkland Hospital where victims were being treated, Noemi Rios, an organizer with the Chicana-led community initiative Vecinos Unidos DFW, said that local organizations were being flooded with requests seeking more information about the identity of the victims. Rios told reporters that family members who “knew their loved ones had been detained” at the Dallas ICE field office “couldn’t get confirmation of life or death.”

Flaka Martinez, another organizer with Vecinos Unidos, said that this panic was the result of ICE’s detainee locator system, which has been criticized by families of detainees and their lawyers for not providing up-to-date information regarding the whereabouts of detainees. Martinez urged that anyone detained by ICE must have their unique identification numbers (known as an “A-Number”) put into the system within 12 hours of detention. She also pointed to the fact that the facility where the shooting happened was not a detention center but rather an administrative office where people frequently visit for check-ins with ICE. “It’s not sustainable, nor safe to detain people at that facility,” Martinez said.

Well before the shooting, family members with loved ones detained at that Dallas field office reported inhumane conditions in the facility, including overcrowding, medical neglect, and individuals being detained for more than a week without access to running water and air conditioning. Over 600 people were held at the field office in June and July for longer than ICE’s own 12-hour limit on detention in so-called “hold rooms,” according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by El Movimiento DFW, a local group advocating for immigrant rights. Protests and public pressure led in part by Vecinos Unidos and El Movimiento led Democratic Congressmembers Julie Johnson, Marc Veasey, and Jasmine Crockett—who all represent parts of Dallas—to send a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, on July 28 demanding “immediate answers” to reports about the field office. As of October 6, the U.S. representatives have not received a response.

For the immigrant community in Dallas, this lack of transparency around what advocates claim are unlawful and unjust detentions has become an expected response not just from federal law enforcement but local police as well. While the Dallas Police Department (DPD) maintains no official 287(g) agreement with ICE, it has stated that the department “regularly” interacts with federal agencies and will “assist these agencies upon request.”

Tony Rodriguez, the regional commander of the Brown Berets of North Texas, a community defense group that runs an “ICE Watch” in the area, said that the DPD’s public comments are “political double speak.” Rodriguez pointed to a recent multi-agency operation led by Homeland Security Investigations, an arm of ICE, on the Chicas Bonitas Strip Club in Dallas for suspected “human trafficking and unlawful employment.” Rodriguez said that as soon as the Brown Berets’ ICE Watch was alerted of a possible raid, members of the organization were on the scene, collecting testimonials and documenting the arrests.

Corbin Rubinson, spokesperson for DPD, wrote in an email to the Observer that the department was “requested to provide perimeter security during the outside agency’s operation.” According to an ICE press release, federal agents arrested 41 undocumented immigrants; just five had criminal records in the United States.

With suspicion from community organizations already high, Senate Bill 8 could dramatically change how immigration enforcement is conducted in the state. SB 8 will force county sheriffs to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE by next December, which could give deputies the authority to arrest and detain people off the street on the basis of immigration status depending on the 287(g) model a sheriff selects. As the Texas Observer has previously reported, around 30 local county sheriffs and police departments have already voluntarily inked “task force model” agreements, which effectively deputize local officers as ICE agents.

The ever-expanding relationship between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is a key detail in how one of the victims of the September 24 shooting, Guzman-Fuentes, a 37-year-old from El Salvador, ended up at the Dallas ICE Field Office that day. According to a press release from ICE, DPD arrested Guzman-Fuentes on August 25 on an aggravated assault charge—which ICE said was later dropped—and an outstanding warrant for a DUI. Shortly after Guzman-Fuentes was booked at the Dallas County Jail, ICE “encountered him” and filed an immigration detainer. The press release states that he was being transferred into the office that morning when the shooter opened fire, killing him and García-Hernández, a 32-year-old immigrant from Mexico who passed away due to his injuries five days later.

As previously reported by the San Antonio Express-News, ICE is increasingly using county jails to detain undocumented immigrants before they are taken into federal custody and ultimately deported. While all Texas county jails have been sharing biometric data with ICE since 2010, since January of this year, the number of immigration detainers filed on immigrants booked at the Dallas County Jail has increased by 71 percent. When SB 8 goes into effect, those rates could further increase.

At a vigil held at Dallas City Hall on October 3, organizers gathered to “center the victims of the shooting” and to condemn the “dehumanization” of migrants by the Trump administration.

Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch, an Austin immigration attorney who has been in contact with the families of the victims, told the Observer that for families, the loss of their loved ones has been compounded by the “way that the government has responded, by not giving them information quickly.” CBS reported that Guzman-Fuentes’ wife only found out that her husband had been killed after contacting the Salvadoran consulate. Organizers also read a statement from his sister, who said she wants people to remember her brother as “the greatest brother, tío, and friend.” The statement also noted that officials told her that she wouldn’t be able to see her brother’s body and would only be offered two hours for a funeral.

Eric Cedillo, an attorney representing García-Hernández’s wife, told the crowd that he must be remembered for his “heroism.” Cedillo said that when “bullets crashed through the window and hit Miguel,” he turned to the 18 year-old boy sitting next to him in the van and said, “I don’t think I’m going to make it, get underneath me. Let me shield you.”

Looking ahead, Martinez, the community organizer, said that in spite of the Trump administration using the shooting as a pretext to vilify resistance to ICE, her community is determined to continue to fight against Trump’s deportation machine and “serve justice for [the victims’] families.”",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4535-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 14:57:45.865426

Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the resettlement organization Global Refuge, told the AP this would be “a monumental shift in U.S. refugee policy.”

“Not just in terms of reducing admissions, but also in terms of disproportionately privileging one group over every other,” he said. “Our concern is that this could turn what has long been a globally responsive humanitarian system into one that overwhelmingly favors a single group.”

While it was a part of the DOJ’s Civil Division, the CPB oversaw both criminal and affirmative civil enforcement cases and provided expertise to various government-wide working groups, in addition to engaging with consumers, industry, and law enforcement around the world. The CPB also defended certain consumer protection and public health agencies, including the FDA, FTC, and CPSC, in federal district courts.

The Announced Mission of the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch

The EALB will focus on (i) bringing affirmative litigation to enforce federal laws and regulations, (ii) enjoining actions that conflict with or violate federal law, (iii) obtaining declaratory judgments, and (iv) seeking monetary penalties where appropriate. The DOJ’s Civil Division is consolidating its affirmative litigation work into one Branch to “hold powerful actors accountable, protect public health and safety, and enforce critical national policies.” The EALB’s announced goals largely overlap with those of its predecessor, but will have an increased focus on advancing the “interests of the United States.”

As stated in the DOJ’s press release, the EALB will (1) prioritize cases that protect women and children from alleged false or misleading medical claims related to gender transition procedures, as well as (2) matters involving “sanctuary” laws and policies that impede federal immigration enforcement. This new focus is consistent with Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate’s memo on Civil Division enforcement and underscores changes in priorities between the current DOJ under the Trump Administration and DOJ under the Biden Administration. Assistant Attorney General Shumate will also be in charge of the newly formed EALB. Since False Claims Act litigation remains a priority, the creation of the EALB should have minimal impact on these matters.

The DOJ’s stated approach aligns with the Civil Division’s recent lawsuits filed against Minnesota, the City of Minneapolis, the City of St. Paul, and others challenging their sanctuary city policies as violating federal immigration enforcement mandates. As alleged in the complaint, the Minnesota officials’ refusal to cooperate with federal immigration authorities results in the release of dangerous criminals otherwise subject to removal. This lawsuit is the latest in a series of lawsuits targeting sanctuary city policies across the country, including in Boston, New York City, Rochester, New York, New Jersey, Colorado, and Los Angeles.

Responsibilities of The EALB’s Two Sections

There are two sections of the EALB:

Enforcement Section. This section will handle civil enforcement actions and affirmative litigation overseen by the now-dissolved CPB, including enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, and the Restore Online Shopper’s Confidence Act. Its mission is to protect consumers from harm ranging from deceptive practices by major technology companies, defective goods imported from abroad, false or misleading claims by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Affirmative Litigation Section. This section will bring lawsuits against states, municipalities, and private entities that obstruct or conflict with federal policies, ensuring compliance with the U.S. Constitution and federal law nationwide. It is anticipated that the Affirmative Litigation section will actively seek declaratory judgments in matters where there is an active controversy between the EALB’s enforcement priorities that conflict with state and local laws.

Key Takeaways

Increased Potential for Disparate Outcomes: The dispersal of CPB personnel and the division of its authority may lead to different outcomes than had the CPB had remained in place.

Review Compliance Programs: Now that the Consumer Protection Branch has been dissolved, company policies and procedures should be reviewed to ensure compliance with the announced focus by the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch.

Be Knowledgeable: Information about the new EALB currently is relatively limited due to the recent announcement of its creation coinciding with an ongoing government shutdown. As more information about its priorities, structure, and authority is revealed, clients should keep an eye out for any new developments.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.5055_3837.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:58:34.117231

At the same time, Mayor Keith Wilson signaled that he won't capitulate to the administration's demands that the city block off a wide buffer area around the facility or create mandated ""free speech zones"" for protesters.

""You have requested that federal officers be able to ingress and egress from the (ICE) facility without hindrance,"" Wilson's office said in a letter to James Percival, DHS general counsel. ""The Mayor and our local public safety professionals will continue to evaluate the situation on the ground, and they will continue to make public order decisions based on what they believe will be in the best interest of Portland and our community.

""In response to your request for 'Free Speech Zones,' the city of Portland commits to peacefully facilitating free speech throughout the City of Portland.""

In an appearance on FOX News on Tuesday, Noem threatened to flood the city with even more federal law enforcement officers if Wilson didn't meet her demands for ""security measures.""

According to Wilson's office, administration officials required a response to their demands by noon Wednesday. His public statement and letter of response were critical of the administration's demands, but there were still signs Wednesday of the city making course adjustments.

During Noem's visit, Portland police officers had cordoned off the block in front of the ICE facility to keep protesters back. As of Wednesday morning, they were maintaining that cordoned-off area, but all roads have since reopened late Wednesday evening.

PPB, in an email to KGW, said, in part, ""We have removed the area closure and people are free to move through that space again. As always, PPB has the authority to restrict access to certain areas whenever a threat to the public health or safety is created by any emergency. We continue to evaluate the situation and consult with city leadership.""

The city also brought in crews from Rapid Response Bio-Clean, its contractor for clearing homeless camps, to remove a small protest encampment that's persisted across from the ICE facility for weeks. They were done clearing the camp by noon Wednesday.

A Portland police spokesman said that the agency was keeping the cordon up for the camp removal and because they are ""still providing a presence in the area,"" but that the police tape should come down later in the day; it did come down around 4:30 p.m.

""Ultimately, the encampment near the ICE facility was cleared due to ongoing public safety concerns. Criminal activity has been associated with the site, and the encampment was obstructing public right-of-ways,"" said Mike Benner, a spokesperson for the Portland Police Bureau. ""In addition, the camp has negatively impacted quality of life and economic activity in the area.

""This action was taken to restore public safety, access, and order while balancing the rights of all individuals. PPB remains committed to supporting peaceful protest and the right to free expression, but unlawful behavior and conditions that jeopardize health and safety cannot be allowed to continue. We appreciate the community’s understanding and cooperation.""

Benner said that PPB had requested the camp removal and was there to provide security.

""It’s important to note this camp has moved, been posted, and cleaned numerous times,"" he added.

PPB will continue to monitor events outside the ICE facility, Benner said.

Meanwhile, the Portland Bureau of Transportation was Wednesday morning ""temporarily"" changing South Bond Avenue, which runs north to south through the South Waterfront just east of the ICE facility, from a one-way to a two-way street. PBOT workers were seen drilling yellow line markers over the white lines, which divide the two lanes on the street.

""One-block stretch of South Bond Avenue is now open to two-way traffic between Lowell and Bancroft streets,"" the city said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ""Making it easier for people to get to homes and businesses. Initial public input has been very positive in response to this change.""

In his statement Wednesday, Mayor Wilson said that one Trump administration official had raised the possibility of Portland taking over the ICE facility lease, something Wilson said he'd be open to discussing.

The federal government has leased the building from a private owner since 2011, Wilson's office said, when the city issued a conditional land use approval. In September, Portland issued a violation notice due to reports that detainees had been kept at the facility for more than 12 hours, which is not allowed under the terms of that land use approval.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/283f763c-16f7-494d-af61-d60789694b53/20251009T064853/283f763c-16f7-494d-af61-d60789694b53_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:58:18.151045

“So, it's just an unsafe environment to have an ICE officer in a hospital, especially [a hospital] that's serving mostly immigrants.”","Doctors at Adventist Health White Memorial hospital in Boyle Heights told LAist that hospital administrators are allowing federal immigration agents to interfere in medical decisions and block doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care.

Administrators at White Memorial have told doctors not to call a detained patient’s family members, even to find out what type of medication they’re on or what conditions they have, doctors told LAist. Hospital leaders also have told doctors to allow immigration agents to remain by a detained patient’s side, even during consultations, inhibiting frank discussions between doctors and their patients and potentially violating patient privacy laws. Doctors say this is not typical protocol for any patients, including those brought in by local police or sheriff’s deputies.

These doctors are equally concerned about their inability to ensure follow-up care for patients released to the ICE processing facility known as B-18 in downtown L.A., where critics say some detainees have been held for days on end with no proper beds or medical care.

Why this matters

White Memorial is part of a network of private, nonprofit hospitals affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with $7 billion in annual revenue. The hospital has been operating for more than 110 years. Its calling is to “help improve the lives of our friends and neighbors in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights,” according to its website.

Five physicians at White Memorial shared the details with LAist about ICE’s presence at the hospital and hospital administrators’ response on the condition that they not be named for fear of retaliation from their employer or from immigration authorities. LAist reviewed internal emails supporting their claims.

“We have an ethical and moral duty to provide excellent medical care and to serve the patient’s interest,” one doctor at White Memorial told LAist. But the doctor said the frequent presence of masked, armed immigration agents in the hospital makes it “very difficult to do that.”

The physicians told LAist they believe the directives from their bosses conflict with the responsibilities all doctors have to their patients and with guidance from the California attorney general.

White Memorial did not respond to a request for an interview from LAist or to our emailed list of questions.

In a statement, a White Memorial spokesperson said the hospital’s staff “are passionately committed to providing the highest standard of medical care to all who come through our doors, regardless of their circumstances” and that the hospital has “protocols in place that are designed to help support the lawful respect of patient rights.”

“We are doing everything in our power to provide safe and compassionate care to our community during this time of unrest,” the statement reads. It also urged people not to ""delay the medical care you need.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, did not respond to specific questions from LAist or agree to an interview.

In a statement, she wrote that “ICE is not denying any illegal alien access to proper medical care or medications.” McLaughlin said it was “longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.”

She added that she hoped LAist “would consider NOT writing this garbage” in the wake of the recent shooting outside an ICE detention center in Texas, where one detainee was killed and two injured.

“These types of smears are contributing to our officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them,” she wrote.

An analysis of federal court filings for assault on a federal officer by Colorado Public Radio shows a sharp increase in charges in recent months. The data is far short of the scale suggested by officials.

The bigger picture

A version of the conflicts described at White Memorial is happening across the state and the country as hospitals are forced to contend with fallout from the Trump administration’s mass deportation program. Caught in the middle are doctors and other medical professionals who have a legal duty to provide medical care to patients and ethical concerns about policies they feel affect the traditional standards of care.

The five doctors who spoke with LAist say the conflicts are especially acute at White Memorial, a hospital whose patient and surrounding population is mostly Latino and where several doctors told LAist they’re seeing two to three detained patients per shift.

The situation also raises questions about medical privacy at a time when the federal government is seeking access to sensitive personal information, including medical information from both immigrants and U.S.-born citizens.

Lorenzo Antonio González is a physician who volunteers with Unión del Barrio, which patrols Boyle Heights and other neighborhoods to warn people about ICE raids. He does not work at White Memorial but is aware of the doctors’ concerns. He said he fears ICE’s frequent presence at the hospital will further the chilling effect already causing many Boyle Heights neighbors — where more than 80% of households speak Spanish and a quarter of residents are noncitizens — to forgo medical care and avoid leaving their homes. González called White Memorial’s alleged behavior “an erosion of trust within this pillar of a community.”

How we got here

As immigration raids ramped up in Los Angeles this year, some detainees have needed urgent medical care, either because they were injured while being detained, had a pre-existing illness, or because they became ill while being held at the downtown immigration facility.

Some of these incidents became headlines. In July, a Salvadoran woman was brought to Glendale Memorial Hospital with injuries suffered during a raid. In that case, camera crews descended on the hospital as activists protested the presence of ICE agents in the public lobby.

Meanwhile, White Memorial stayed out of the news. In June, a hospital leader sent an email to colleagues, flagging several incidents involving immigration detainees, including one in which agents remained in the room with a detained patient during the patient’s entire stay at the hospital. The email also noted that agents told doctors they could not call the patient’s family members when the patient couldn’t remember her medications, according to the email and doctors who spoke with LAist.

Doctors at White Memorial and other hospitals told LAist it’s not typical for law enforcement officers to remain in the room during patient care, even with criminal detainees, unless there’s a serious security risk. People in ICE custody are civil, not criminal detainees. Doctors also told LAist it’s common practice to call family members, with a patient’s permission, to inquire about their medical history and current medications.

So the doctors at White Memorial pressed hospital administrators for a clear policy and legal guidance on how to balance ICE agent demands with the hospital’s responsibilities for patient care.

The answer that came back from hospital administrators: defer to the agents.

Hospital leaders told doctors — both verbally, doctors say, and in writing in several emails reviewed by LAist — that immigration agents are allowed to be present at all times, even during discussions about a patient’s sensitive medical information. Doctors also were told they could not call a detained patient’s family member without an agent’s permission. In one email to subordinates, a hospital leader told White Memorial staff that doing so could be a “security risk.”

“That’s like encouraging medical negligence,” one White Memorial doctor told LAist in response to this guidance.

At least one doctor told LAist they are defying hospital leaders’ guidance, deferring instead to their medical duty to the patient and to follow medical privacy laws.

“There’s no way you can get me to not call a patient’s family if they’re hurt and need support,” the doctor said.

The bigger picture

The concerns about White Memorial come at a time when the care of people in ICE custody is under scrutiny. In August, a man was severely injured while being detained at a car wash in Carson. Agents brought him to Harbor-UCLA medical center for treatment and remained by his bed, to which the man was cuffed, for over a month, according to a recent court ruling. He was never charged with violating any immigration laws, and in October, a federal judge ordered the agents monitoring him to leave the man’s hospital room and remove restrictions on the man’s “ability to make telephone calls to family and friends and to confer confidentially with counsel outside the presence of ICE agents.”

Concerns about the medical care of detainees also extends to formal ICE detention centers. In September, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a Westminster man who was being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, became the 17th person to die in ICE custody this year. Last year, 12 people died in ICE custody, according to agency statistics.

Ayala-Uribe, 39, was a former DACA recipient who supporters say had lived in the country since he was 4 years old. He was picked up in an ICE raid in Fountain Valley in August and sent to Adelanto. From there, a medical provider at the detention facility sent Ayala-Uribe to a nearby hospital, where he was evaluated for an abscess, scheduled for surgery and sent back to the facility. He died in custody the following day.

Earlier this year, as immigration raids ramped up, the advocacy group Disability Rights California interviewed 18 people detained at the Adelanto ICE facility. In a subsequent report, the group concluded that ""due to the surging numbers of people at Adelanto, conditions appear to have quickly deteriorated.” The report claimed detainees faced ""inadequate access to medical treatment, such as life-saving medication and wound care and exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses.""

In response to LAist’s emailed questions about medical care for ICE detainees, McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, said detainees received “medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare … many aliens have received in their entire lives,"" she wrote.

McLaughlin did not respond to LAist’s follow-up email asking her to specifically respond to questions about hospital care for detainees outside of detention centers or to questions about the availability of health care at the B-18 processing center, which unlike the Adelanto facility, is not an official detention center.

In a recent, ongoing lawsuit over the L.A. immigration raids, the ACLU and other groups called out alleged unsanitary conditions and a lack of medical care at B-18.

“Individuals with conditions that require consistent medications and treatment are not given any medical attention, even when that information is brought to the attention of the officers on duty,” reads the initial complaint, filed in July.

One doctor at White Memorial told LAist she had called ICE supervisors at the holding center on several occasions to inquire about follow-up care for patients and was told there were no doctors at the facility and there was no way to obtain medication.

What this all means for detainees — and doctors

Other groups have tried to bring attention to the problems associated with immigration agents in hospital settings. The Committee of Interns and Residents, which is is part of the Service Employees International Union, publicly denounced the presence of ICE agents at University of California hospitals in July, saying it creates “an unsafe environment that … directly contradicts our mission to provide safe, effective and quality healthcare to every member of our community.”

Mahima Iyengar, a doctor at L.A. General hospital and secretary-treasurer of the committee, told LAist that having a law enforcement officer present during doctor-patient conversations can compromise care.

“There's that level of trust that people have with their doctor that they don't necessarily have when somebody else is listening,” Iyengar told LAist. “Your doctor is then not getting as much information as they need, and that information … very well could be what helps them come up with a diagnosis or what helps them decide what treatment [the patient] is going to be on.”

Iyengar said doctors also are unlikely to feel comfortable asking a patient important non-medical questions when an ICE agent is present.

“A lot of what determines our patients' health are all of these social determinants, like where they're living, how they're getting to the hospital, if they have money, if they have kids that need childcare right now while they're hospitalized,” she said. “All of those questions are important questions to ask that I would not personally feel comfortable asking if an officer was standing right there.”

McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, did not respond to LAist’s specific questions about whether the agency recognizes detained patients’ privacy rights at hospitals.

What do legal experts say?

Last December, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued “guidance and model policies” for health care facilities in responding to the anticipated increase in immigration enforcement. The guidance is not mandatory for private hospitals, like White Memorial, but all health care facilities were “encouraged to adopt” model policies. Doctors who spoke with LAist said they had read the guidance and felt beholden to it.

The document states that:

State and federal medical privacy laws apply to all patients “regardless of immigration status.”

Health care facility staff “should identify circumstances in which granting immigration enforcement officers access to patients may interfere with physicians’ duty to provide competent medical care, to safeguard patient confidences and privacy, and to otherwise prioritize their obligations to their patients”; and

Facilities “should educate patients about their privacy rights and reassure them that their healthcare information is protected by federal and state laws.”

A spokesperson for Bonta told LAist the attorney general could not comment on whether the office had received complaints about ICE privacy breaches in health care settings because they are confidential.

“We continue to monitor compliance with all state and federal laws,” the spokesperson said in an email.

LAist also asked two health care legal experts about White Memorial’s direction to staff to allow ICE agents to be present during patient exams and bar calls to detained patients’ family members. Both said the guidance could violate medical privacy laws and ethical standards.

“From a patient safety perspective, it certainly raises red flags,” said Paul Schmeltzer, an L.A.-based health care and data privacy lawyer, referring especially to the prohibition on calling a detained patient’s family member. Schmeltzer also said letting an ICE agent remain next to a patient throughout their hospital stay without the patient’s consent is likely illegal. Patient privacy is protected under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. Both generally prohibit doctors and hospitals from disclosing a patient’s medical information without their permission or a search warrant or other court order.

Schmeltzer said he saw “no permissible situation” under these laws for “disclosing” a detained patient’s hospital treatment to an ICE agent.

“The fact that an ICE agent is present in the room while this patient is receiving treatment, that's a disclosure,” he said.

Deven McGraw, chief regulatory and privacy officer for the company Citizen Health, a patient data platform, agreed.

“ You're basically saying, ‘Yeah, patient, you don't have a choice but to disclose your medical information to this law enforcement official,'” she said.

McGraw was in charge of enforcing HIPAA at the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights from 2015 to 2017. She said there are personal and public health reasons for shielding a patient’s medical information from law enforcement. For example, a patient might hide that they have a communicable disease out of fear they’ll be targeted or isolated.

“ We're supposed to treat people,” McGraw said. “The failure to treat them has potential consequences for their own health, plus the health of others.”

Schmeltzer and McGraw both said the administration at White Memorial might be making a calculated decision when weighing the hospital’s potential liability for violating the privacy rights of immigration detainees versus angering the Trump administration. Only the federal government and state attorneys general can prosecute a hospital for violating HIPAA, Schmeltzer and McGraw noted.

Some of the behavior described by doctors could be prohibited under a new state law, enacted in September as an “urgency” measure. The law requires health care facilities to ban immigration agents from entering non-public areas without a valid warrant and to advise staff on how to respond to agents’ requests for entry.

Even before the law, groups like the Committee of Interns and Residents had begun to train colleagues on the privacy rights of detained patients and how to handle ICE agents. Iyengar said doctors at L.A. General, for example, distribute “Know Your Rights” cards to immigrant patients and hospital employees are instructed to immediately call hospital directors if immigration agents appear.

“ Even just if there is an ICE officer in the hospital, that will put people off from visiting a loved one, or if word gets out, the community finds out, and they don't want come to that hospital,” she said. “So, it's just an unsafe environment to have an ICE officer in a hospital, especially [a hospital] that's serving mostly immigrants.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce867b2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2Fb2%2Fae9782c44aaa88d6fa904dcfd8ac%2Fwhite-memorial-hospital-6-d25a7003.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 13:57:54.866296

""That's a publicity stunt, man!"" Harvey, who lives in the south side, said.

This summer Chicago's homicide rate was the lowest since the 1960s. So, Harvey can't believe hundreds of troops have arrived in Illinois to make the city any safer. President Trump has called Chicago a ""war zone"" and has claimed the city's crime rate is unsustainable.

Under Trump's orders, National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas are tasked with protecting federal government employees such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and federal property.

Harvey said Trump is doing this to appear like he's keeping the city safe from undocumented immigrants. This hits close to home. Harvey lives in a neighborhood that recently had a big ICE raid in a residential building.

""You snatching kids and people that get up and go to work every day — that's who you grab, you not grabbing no criminals,"" Harvey said.

Trump's pressure is met with resistance

Last month, the Trump administration ramped up its immigration enforcement operations in Chicago. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the mission dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz"" has led to more than 1,000 arrests of migrants without legal status.

Chicago residents have taken to the streets to push back. They have recorded — and published — the ICE arrests, and have created ICE watch groups.

On Wednesday night, hundreds of people marched in downtown Chicago to protest the deployment of the troops and the presence of ICE.

Jessica Urbina, 26, came to march by herself because she felt it was important to join her community to repudiate Trump's actions.

""I feel empowered,"" she said. ""I don't know these people, but we all have a lot in common and we all have the same motive to help each other, lean on each other.""

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told NPR Wednesday his office will do whatever it takes to resist Trump's attacks on his city. He says Congress and the Supreme Court are complicit.

""They're aiding and abetting the dismantling of our democracy and our Constitution,"" Johnson said. ""We'll use every single tool that's available to me. This is going to play out in the courts. It's going to play out on the streets.""

A federal judge in Chicago will hear arguments Thursday afternoon on whether the deployment is legal or not.

It's unclear what exactly Johnson will do. So far, he's used executive orders to make it harder for ICE to operate in the city — including a ban on the use of city-owned or operated space by federal agents.

He said it's the first time a mayor has had to fight off what he calls a federal invasion.

Johnson's defiance has irked Trump, who has called for the arrests of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Johnson for ""failing to protect ICE officers.""

""This is not the first time Trump has accused or insisted on a Black man being arrested,"" Johnson said. ""A president that is threatening to jail his political opponents is clear — yet another example of authoritarianism.""

All of this has caused a lot of fear in the Chicago neighborhoods where many immigrants live. Census data shows about one in five residents in Chicago are foreign born.

Jackson, a Venezuelan immigrant who is only using his first name because of his immigration status, said he's terrified of walking the streets of Chicago with so much federal law enforcement presence.

""And now with the National Guard things will be even more complicated,"" Jackson said in Spanish, his eyes filled with tears. ""It's super scary to even go grocery shopping.""

He has three kids and a wife. 39-year-old Jackson says they have had conversations about what to do if he gets picked up by ICE.

Jackson works in construction, but recently he has not been going to work.

He talked to NPR reporters while waiting at a bus stop right across the street ICE raided last week in a military-style operation. He was en route to meet an attorney to file for asylum.

""I'm trying to show that I'm working, that I have not committed any crimes,"" Jackson said. ""Maybe I'll be given a chance.""

Agents arrested some 475 people—including more than 300 South Korean contractors—and led them away in shackles and handcuffs.
Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans.
Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.
“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says.","When I visited Hyundai Motor’s “Metaplant” in May to drive the new Ioniq9 electric SUV, the facility was a symbol of everything right about U.S. auto manufacturing. It’s a US $7.6 billion showpiece of automation staffed by gung-ho and highly skilled workers, capable of churning out 500,000 EVs a year at full crank. The biggest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history, the Metaplant is the linchpin of Republican Governor Brian Kemp’s bid to make the state the “electric mobility capital of the country.”

Then it all went wrong. On 4 September, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided the supersized facility in Ellabell, Ga., about a half hour from Savannah. Agents arrested some 475 people—including more than 300 South Korean contractors—and led them away in shackles and handcuffs. Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans. Following a week of detention, and tense negotiations between the South Korean and U.S. governments, the workers were ejected from the U.S. and sent home on a plane chartered by South Korea. Outraged Korean officials opened an investigation into potential human rights abuses during the workers’ incarceration.

“America is not a safe place to work,” one of the workers told The New York Times, after his return home.

Production of the Ioniq 9 and smaller Ioniq 5 has proceeded apace. [Look for my fuller account of the plant, with photos from acclaimed photographer Christopher Payne, in the coming weeks.] But the opening of the battery plant, jointly owned by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, has been pushed back by at least two months. And the episode laid bare some messy contradictions, as America seeks to stand up an EV-and-battery business that can compete against China.

The Trump Administration’s Mixed Messages Confuse Investors

President Trump has demanded that foreign companies build products in the U.S., using tariffs and other strongarm tactics to secure investment pledges. That contrasts with President Biden’s carrot-and-stick approach, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which offered generous incentives to manufacturers and consumers. The Trump administration has also been nakedly hostile toward EVs and most green initiatives, seeking to reverse Biden’s ambitious pollution and fuel-economy agenda, and deny the ability of California and other states to set their own greenhouse-gas standards. At the administration’s behest, the GOP-led Congress eliminated a $7,500 clean-car tax credit that ended Sept. 30. That tax break had spurred Hyundai to accelerate the Metaplant’s construction to make their EVs eligible for credits, and, over the years, had helped make EVs more affordable for hundreds of thousands of Americans. In the wary dalliance between Trump and manufacturers, there are enough mixed messages to keep a hundred dating apps buzzing.

“The Trump administration was raving about the plant, but then raided it less than two weeks later,” says Betony Jones, who served as senior advisor on labor to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Michigan’s former governor, and directed the Department of Energy’s office of energy jobs in the Biden administration. “It’s a confusing situation, and confusing for foreign investors,” she adds.

Trump insisted he did not want to “frighten off” foreign companies or their workers, including presumably the South Koreans—some of whom had helped build car, battery or semiconductor factories around the world, including in Michigan, Texas, Poland, Indonesia and the Middle East.

“We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime into the not too distant future!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Responding to a question from IEEE Spectrum, Kush Desai, a White House deputy press secretary, said the President will support any company investing in the U.S. by slashing regulations and enabling them to bring in technical experts to set up facilities and train American workers. “Industry leaders in sectors ranging from autos to pharmaceuticals to technology have committed to investing trillions in the United States because they know they have a friend and ally in the White House,” Desai said.

Yet South Korean president Lee Jae Myung said the ICE raid might make companies hesitant to build in the U.S. Hyundai had pledged in March to boost its total investment in the U.S. to $21 billion through 2028, a pledge that was further increased to $26 billion in August. The controversial raid comes at a fraught moment for EVs, amid slowing consumer demand and steep tariffs on raw materials and import cars, which have led many automakers to scale back electric plans and lean back into petrol-powered cars and hybrids.

The raid, Jones says, also exposed familiar fault lines in labor and manufacturing. These included ones related to workplace safety and the proper role of foreign workers, and the tendency of foreign manufacturers to locate factories in the southern U.S., where they can operate free of union labor, often at lower wages. A TV station near the Hyundai complex, WTOC, had aired investigative reports about poor safety conditions and unauthorized labor at the plant. At least three workers have died there, according to law enforcement. Hyundai has sought to distance itself from the battery portion of the Metaplant, saying none of the foreign contractors were directly employed by the automaker. Both Hyundai and LG Energy Solution have begun their own inquiries into the raid, and have vowed to follow all laws and rules, including those for workplace safety.

Deportations Renew Attention to Visa Policy

In Georgia, many contract workers had arrived on six-month B-1 visas issued for business travel, or through a visa-waiver program that allows stays of up to 90 days. Some companies, experts say, have played fast-and-loose with visa rules, in part because H-1B visas, which allow six-year stays for employees, are expensive and in short supply. Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.

“Previous U.S. administrations had largely turned a blind eye to” the visa abuses, according to The Guardian.

The Trump administration now faces criticism for its new policy to charge $100,000 for those coveted H-1B visas, which some companies say would be counterproductive, unaffordable and potentially illegal. In Georgia, some local union workers said they had been unfairly bypassed for work in the battery plant.

“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says. “So what does that knowledge-transfer need to look like? How do we pivot from foreign workers and train up a U.S. workforce that has enough specialized skills to do those jobs?”

As General Motors pivoted to EVs, it struggled to scale up battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee, in a joint venture with LG Energy to manufacture a new line of batteries called Ultium Cells. The automaker’s “Factory Zero” in Detroit — where President Biden lauded GM CEO Mary Barra in 2021, and test-drove a GMC Hummer EV in a parking lot — also suffered glitches as GM sought to rush its batteries and EVs into production. That included an incident in which a forklift pierced a stack of robotically-assembled batteries at Factory Zero, starting a fire that shut down production for a day.

The Detroit factory was the American industry’s first attempt to scale up a fully automated assembly line to make pouch-style batteries (which have since been partially supplanted by prismatic cells). GM raced to bring in outside battery consultants and executives to fix battery and assembly issues, finally hiring former Tesla battery chief Kurt Kelty to run its battery operations. It paid off: after those frustrating growing pains, GM began cranking out Ultium batteries, and is now America’s leading producer of lithium-ion cells among automakers.

Jones says that manufacturers, foreign or domestic, are simply crying out for certainty and clear policy directions. “That’s what will attract investment, and that’s where the Trump administration has done irreparable harm,” she says. “The ICE raid is just the cherry on top. How is anybody going to trust us going forward?”",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61673725&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C204%2C0%2C205,N,,2025-10-09 13:57:59.220571

Videos of the Sept. 19 incident, which circulated widely Wednesday on social media, showed the Rev. David Black of the First Presbyterian Church being struck in the head by an officer outside an ICE processing facility in a Chicago suburb. It stoked anger toward federal officers who have been deployed to the city by President Trump.

“What this clipped video doesn’t show is that these agitators were blocking an ICE vehicle from leaving the federal facility—impeding operations,” McLaughlin wrote in a lengthy statement on social platform X.

“Over and over again, law enforcement ordered these agitators to move off of federal property so the vehicle could move. Law enforcement verbally warned these agitators that they would use force if they did not move and stop impeding operations. They did not comply,” she added.

McLaughlin accused demonstrators of throwing rocks, bottles and launching fireworks at the law enforcement agents on the roof. However, in the recorded clip, Black could be seen gazing at officers with open hands prior to being shot by a pepper ball.

“I invited them to repentance,” Black told Religion News Service in an interview. “I basically offered an altar call. I invited them to come and receive that salvation, and be part of the kingdom that is coming.”

“He was praying to them and they just ended up shooting him. It was like casual to them,” bystander Amanda Tovar told CNN.

“They [demonstrators] weren’t scaling a fence. They weren’t throwing any items. They weren’t even saying anything in the least that would be threatening. And that’s when they [ICE officers] just started opening fire at them,” she added.

Later in the evening, Black was again shoved and sprayed with pepper spray outside the ICE facility in Broadview, a village outside Chicago.

His treatment has been decried by residents and journalists alike who say federal officials have been threatening citizens’ safety and First Amendment rights.

The Chicago News Guild and other news organizations sued DHS and ICE on Monday in connection with allegations of excessive force used on journalists at recent protests in the area.

“Never in modern times has the federal government undermined bedrock constitutional protections on this scale, or usurped states’ police power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the people for the government’s own benefit,” the complaint states.

Broadview officials have also sued the Trump administration for erecting an 8-foot fence around an ICE processing facility, alleging that the barrier blocks emergency services and patrons from accessing the site and surrounding businesses.

The president has only ramped up the federal presence in the area this week, sending 200 members of the Texas National Guard to patrol the city’s surrounding neighborhoods with the help of 300 federalized members the Illinois National Guard.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/AP25262760764151-e1758390436498.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-09 12:00:39.450796

In a statement sent to NBC Chicago, the Village of Broadview confirmed that three vans carrying 45 members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the federal building late Wednesday night.

""During their patrols, Broadview police officers observed the vans parked in the rear of 2000 25th Ave. and all of the guards were sleeping,"" the statement said. ""We let them sleep undisturbed. We hope that they will extend the same courtesy in the coming days to Broadview residents who deserve a good night’s sleep, too.""

The new images come after the U.S Northern Command confirmed that approximately 500 soldiers from various units of the Texas and Illinois National Guards were activated in the Chicago area on a 60-day mission to protect federal agents and facilities.

""These soldiers are employed to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" the U.S. Northern Command said in mission update.

Later Thursday morning, photos and video captured by NBC Chicago photographer George Mycyk captured Texas National Guard member on the roof of the facility, identified by a patch on the uniform's right arm.

City officials in Joliet told NBC Chicago they were notified Tuesday that the Texas National Guard would be stationed at the Army Reserve in Elwood, about 50 miles outside Chicago. Footage captured by NBC 5 and Telemundo Tuesday and Wednesday showed uniformed troops on the ground at the facility, along with dozens of trucks and what appeared to be fencing and mobile housing.

Local

Court filings said there are approximately 200 federalized National Guardsmen in the State of Illinois, and that the Illinois Army National Guard has been authorized to ""mobilize 300 members of the Army National Guard, who are currently mustering to ensure readiness.""

The filings, which cited a declaration signed by Deputy Commanding General for Operations for the United States Army North Command (ARNORTH), Major General Niave Knel, went on to say that Federal Protective Services requested National Guard members to support the protection of federal property in Broadview, and the Dirksen Federal Building in Chicago ""due to two high profile cases"" involving Department of Homeland Security activities.

The Broadview facility has been the site of numerous protests and tensions between activists and masked, armed federal agents, with rubber bullets and chemical agents like tear gas deployed and barricades erected.

Wednesday, federal Judge Sara Ellis said sufficient evidence exists to suggest that protesters and the press are ""at risk of injury"" because government agents had acted indiscriminately in the past.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Donald Trump both defended the decision to federalize the National Guard during a press availability Wednesday.

“(We’re doing this to) keep our federal officers safe, to keep our federal buildings safe, (and) we’re not gonna have it any more from these thugs,” Bondi said.

Could courts block National Guard deployment in Chicago? Where things stand

Monday, Illinois filed a lawsuit hoping to block the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Chicago. The lawsuit asks a federal judge to declare the Trump administration's federalization and deployment ""unconstitutional and/or unlawful"" saying it violated the Administrative Procedures Act, a law governing how federal agencies develop and issue regulations, and ""is contrary to the Constitution of the United States.""

A similar deployment was halted by a federal judge in Oregon, as the Trump administration sought to put National Guard members on the ground in Portland.

A hearing is set for 11 a.m. Thursday Central Time.

“We’re looking for the courts to do the right thing,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Wednesday.

In a statement, a White House spokesperson said President Donald Trump ""has exercised his lawful authority.""

The White House has maintained that Trump is trying to keep American cities and federal personnel safe. Trump said this week that if the courts wind up derailing his efforts to use the National Guard, he could invoke the Insurrection Act, which would empower him to use the U.S. military domestically, NBC News reported.

This week, a judge ordered ICE to dial back arrest tactics in Chicago, coming on the heels of a grand jury refusing to indict a Chicago couple arrested by ICE agents. In a blistering ruling Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings said ICE has been repeatedly violating a court agreement made in 2022 in which the agency agreed to not make warrantless arrests without probable cause.

The court order in which ICE agreed to warrantless arrests with no probable cause was skirted, according to Cummings, by agents carrying blank warrant forms and filling them in on the spot. That practice was also ordered stopped on Tuesday, with Cummings extending “the agreement until February 2, 2026, which corresponds to the number of days between the date that ice unequivocally ceased its compliance.”

But some doubt ICE will follow their own agreed rules.

“Unfortunately, the Trump administration and its agencies have a record of defying court orders. We can't take anything for granted,” Sen. Dick Durbin said. “I think that clearly the President has overstepped his authority, and he is creating a chaotic and dangerous situation in Chicago and in my home state of Illinois. I hope the courts will try to stop him.""

In State of Texas, et al. v. CMS, Case No. 6:23-cv-161-JDK, Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle granted summary judgment in part for Texas, concluding that CMS’s Final Rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it exceeded CMS’s delegated authority under the Social Security Act.

Background

Medicaid is a joint federal-state program in which the federal government matches state contributions for medical care provided to low-income individuals. While states may impose health-care provider taxes to raise their share of Medicaid funding, those taxes cannot include a “hold harmless” provision that guarantees providers a reimbursement equal to their tax burden. This safeguard was enacted by Congress in 1991 after states developed financing mechanisms that maximized federal matching funds without additional state contributions.

Texas operates a Medicaid financing mechanism through Local Provider Participation Funds (LPPFs), which collect mandatory payments from hospitals to help finance the non-federal share of Medicaid supplemental payments. In 2023, CMS issued a Bulletin that sought to expand the interpretation of what constitutes a prohibited “hold harmless” arrangement under the Social Security Act to also include guarantees by private parties in private agreements (2023 Bulletin). In Texas v. Brooks-LaSure, 680 F. Supp. 3d 791 (E.D. Tex. 2023), Texas challenged that 2023 Bulletin, and the Eastern District of Texas issued a preliminary injunction, holding that the 2023 Bulletin violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding CMS’s statutory authority under the Social Security Act.

Despite that ruling, CMS proceeded in 2024 to publish a Final Rule and new Bulletin (2024 Final Rule and Bulletin) that largely adopted the same interpretation as the 2023 Bulletin previously rejected by the Court. The 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin implemented changes to 42 C.F.R. § 433.6, including expanding the “hold harmless” definition to cover private arrangements, and 42 C.F.R. § 430.3, requiring appeals of CMS disapprovals for State directed payments to be filed with the Departmental Appeals Board. Texas amended its complaint to challenge the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin on the same grounds raised in Texas’s challenge to 2023 Bulletin, arguing that CMS’s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding its statutory authority under the Social Security Act. Texas requested the Court convert its preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction to preclude CMS’s enforcement of the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin.

The Court’s Decision

Similar to the Court’s previous decision regarding the 2023 Bulletin, the Court concluded that the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin are unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court held that “the Final Rule and the 2023 and 2024 Bulletins exceed CMS’s statutory authority by expanding the meaning of ‘hold-harmless provision’ to include guarantees by private parties in private agreements and by attempting to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over certain disputes.” The Court explained that the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin attempted to broaden the definition of “hold harmless” in a manner inconsistent with the statutory text.

The Court also distinguished CMS’s current interpretation from prior regulations, concluding that the agency had attempted to impose new obligations without proper statutory basis. In doing so, the Court reaffirmed its prior 2023 injunction analysis, again citing Fifth Circuit precedent that CMS may not “rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.”

As a result, the Court vacated 42 C.F.R §§ 438.6(c)(2)(ii)(G), 42 C.F.R § 438.6(c)(2)(ii)(H), and 42 C.F.R § 430.3(e), along with the 2023 and 2024 Bulletins, and enjoined CMS from enforcing the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin. By striking down CMS’s expanded interpretation of the “hold harmless” provision, the Court preserves Texas’s current Medicaid financing structure through LPPFs.

Following the Iran-Israel conflict, forced returns of Afghan nationals have escalated, including those with valid documentation.
Gross human rights violations became a common occurrence yet again with atrocity crimes against ethnic and religious minorities, gender persecution and gender apartheid, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, attacks on journalists and human rights defenders, and much more.
The Taliban have been resorting to inhumane punishments, including capital and corporal punishments, often enforced in public to terrorize Afghan population.
No government should ignore these very real dangers in Afghanistan – doing so would constitute an abandonment of their moral and legal responsibility.” The forced returns may violate the principle of non-refoulement.","On July 18, 2025, several United Nations experts, including Richard Bennett, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, Mai Sato, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Gehad Madi, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, and Paula Gaviria Betancur, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, published a statement condemning ongoing deportations and mass forced returns of Afghan nationals from Iran and Pakistan, and other countries. As the statement indicated, “More than 1.9 million Afghans have returned or been forced to return to Afghanistan from Iran and Pakistan so far in 2025. More than 300,000 people have returned from Pakistan and over a 1.5 million from Iran, including 410,000 who have been deported from Iran since June 24. Thousands of the returnees are unaccompanied children. Following the Iran-Israel conflict, forced returns of Afghan nationals have escalated, including those with valid documentation. Security-related discourse has intensified anti-Afghan sentiment.” As the statement added, “Returns must be halted immediately. Afghanistan is not a safe country for returnees, given the constantly deteriorating human rights situation since the Taliban seized control, nearly four years ago.”

In August 2025, it will be four years since the Taliban took over power (on August 15, 2021). What followed the takeover can only be described as a total reversal of the progress made in the country during the twenty years of the Afghan Republic, and the return of terror. Gross human rights violations became a common occurrence yet again with atrocity crimes against ethnic and religious minorities, gender persecution and gender apartheid, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, attacks on journalists and human rights defenders, and much more. Women and girls are systematically deprived of their fundamental rights to the point that they are effectively confined to the four walls of their homes. Former security and government officials, including judges and prosecutors, those critical of Taliban policies, such as human rights defenders and journalists, as well as religious and ethnic minorities are at particular risk of reprisals and serious harms in the country, and even more so - if they are returned.

With every decision taken so far, the de facto authorities in Afghanistan ensure that there is no human rights and no viable opposition to the Taliban - so that their reign could continue without even the slightest criticism. The Taliban have been resorting to inhumane punishments, including capital and corporal punishments, often enforced in public to terrorize Afghan population. Among others, in April 2025, four men had been publicly executed as part of the Taliban’s Qisas (retribution in kind –in reference to religious law) - bringing the total number of reported public executions carried out since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021 to at least 10. Furthermore, the Taliban has been using corporal punishment, mostly lashings, often for such acts as sodomy, running away from home, and “illicit relationships.” The U.N. reported at least 213 such punishments (169 males and 44 females) since the beginning of 2025.

Afghanistan is not a safe country, and Russia formally recognizing the Taliban as Afghanistan’s government will not change this. As the U.N. experts emphasized, “Those forced to return have genuine fears for their safety and security and face very real risks of persecution, threats, and violent reprisals. No government should ignore these very real dangers in Afghanistan – doing so would constitute an abandonment of their moral and legal responsibility.”

The forced returns may violate the principle of non-refoulement. Furthermore, as the U.N. experts warned, “States, due to the sheer quantity and forceful nature of returns, cannot ensure that Afghan nationals have access to fair procedures where their individual protection needs are fully assessed. Many Afghans have experienced discrimination, mistreatment, arbitrary arrest and detention, raising serious concerns under international refugee and human rights law.”

The dire situation in Afghanistan calls for an increased humanitarian response for Afghanistan and host countries to address the international protection needs - not the opposite as recently seen. As the world is dealing with one of the worst refugee crisis in years, as exacerbated with every new conflict and situation of concerns, we cannot abandon the rules-based order designed to ensure humane responses to such situations.

The office space moves come as federal immigration enforcement operations become more visible across the state.","More than three weeks after the federal government sought offers for office space for immigration enforcement staff in Milwaukee and 18 other cities, there continues to be little information on whether a lease has been signed here and what the office's purpose would be.

The expansion comes as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement begins to make use of an unprecedented infusion of funds from Congress to carry out President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement agenda. ICE's annual budget is now nearly $30 billion, and the administration plans to hire 10,000 more agents.

An online post on a federal government contracting website Sept. 16 indicated it was accepting offers for a brief time period for furnished office spaces with about 70 desks ""in support of administrative operations for law enforcement."" National Public Radio and the Washington Post reported the spaces would be used by ICE.

Spokespeople from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration, which handles real estate for the federal government, have been tight-lipped on what's happening in Milwaukee.

They did not answer questions about whether a lease has been signed, where the office would be, what the office space would be used for, or a projected timeline for opening. Local real estate brokers said it's their understanding that ICE attorneys would work in the office, although government spokespeople did not answer questions seeking to confirm that detail.

“GSA is committed to working with all of our partner agencies to meet their workspace needs. GSA remains focused on supporting this administration’s goal of optimizing the federal footprint, and providing the best workplaces for our federal agencies to meet their mission,"" a General Services Administration spokesperson said in a statement.

A Homeland Security official responded to a reporter's questions with the following statement, and did not answer follow-up questions:

“Is it really news that when a federal agency hires more personnel that they need more space? Thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, ICE will be adding 10,000 new law enforcement professionals to our ranks, thus the need for more infrastructure to continue to Make America Safe Again.”

It is not clear whether the new office space would hold detainees, although the government's list of requirements asked for ""as-is, fully-finished and furnished office space."" It did not include any specifications that would indicate people could be held on the premises, such as secure jail cells or a secure entryway to transport detainees.

Operating hours would be 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, with possible extensions until 8 p.m., according to the online post, indicating if detainees were to be on the premises, they would not be held overnight.

The request also calls for at least one conference room, a server room and a minimum of 11,500 square feet of office space.

Milwaukee's main ICE office, at 310 E. Knapp St. downtown, also does not commonly hold people overnight. In general in Wisconsin, ICE detainees are held at Dodge County Detention Center. Some local sheriff's offices agree to hold inmates in their jails for a handful of days while they wait for ICE agents to pick up the inmates.

ICE office on northwest side nearly ready to open

Meanwhile, a new ICE office on Milwaukee's northwest side appears nearly ready to open. Renovations had been underway for several months at the office park site at 11925 W. Lake Park Dr., which was the subject of protests in January. It had been meant to replace its Knapp Street office building, which is owned by the Milwaukee School of Engineering. Developers filed an occupancy permit application with the city, a step that means the building could be cleared to open ICE's occupancy after a city inspection.

It has not been clear whether ICE intends to operate out of both the downtown and northwest side buildings at the same time. But an MSOE spokeswoman previously said that ICE signed a one-year extension to the current downtown office lease in April 2025 as opposed to a long-term lease contract.

The office space moves come as federal immigration enforcement operations become more visible across the state. Immigrant advocates called attention to arrests of seven people Oct. 2 at one house in northeast Madison. Those arrested were construction workers, said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera. Her understanding was that ICE was targeting one person and the others in the house were picked up too.

And much remains unclear about 24 people arrested by ICE and the FBI Sept. 26 in Manitowoc. Immigrants rights advocates said some agreed to be deported after they were detained. Of the six people named in a news release by the Department of Homeland Security, three were still listed online as being in custody as of midday Oct. 8.

Their connection to what the Trump administration called a ""transnational human trafficking and drug trafficking ring"" remains unclear. Advocates have said many of those arrested were dairy workers on their way to work. Most have not been charged with sexual assault or human trafficking.

One person listed as being arrested in the news release, Jose Hilario Moreno Portillo, apparently was already in jail at the time of the ICE operation, according to online court records.

The other five named individuals were listed as having convictions including identity theft, hit-and-run, disorderly conduct, driving under the influence and possession of narcotic equipment, as well as traffic offenses and a failure to appear charge. The Journal Sentinel is not naming them because they have not been charged with sexual assault or human trafficking.

Although one man is listed as having an identity theft conviction, court records in Wisconsin and Iowa do not reflect that and only list a ticket for driving without insurance in 2009, according to Wisconsin Watch.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/30/PMJS/83949157007-250530-local-mjsdeporthearingp-11.jpg?crop=5966,3357,x0,y700&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-09 11:59:29.984986

Several farmers listening to Van Orden affirmed that they supported Trump’s goal of securing the border, but added that they thought that mission had been accomplished.
Farmers across the country seem inclined to give the Trump administration the benefit of the doubt.","President Donald Trump’s tariffs are becoming a major drain on Wisconsin’s agricultural economy. China stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans amid a new trade war this spring, triggering a price collapse and leaving farmers wondering what to do with the bumper crop they are now harvesting. Cranberry growers say they’re facing low prices and market uncertainty, too, as other countries turn away their products because of tariffs.

Small wonder the latest ag economy barometer published by Purdue University on Oct. 7 found that nationwide farmers say their economic condition is weakening. Despite expected record-high corn and soybean yields, farmers report they expect weaker financial performance in 2025 than in 2024 and have a weaker capital investment outlook.

Yet even as optimism about the farm economy is fading, support for Trump among farmers remains strong.

Back in March, 70% of farmers who answered the Purdue survey said they believed tariffs would strengthen the agricultural economy in the long run. That number dropped steeply to 51% by September. Still a large majority — 71% – continue to believe the country as a whole is moving in the right direction, and 80% believe the Trump administration is likely or very likely to give them an aid package to compensate for the damage done by tariffs and trade wars.

U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany (R-Wisconsin) reinforced this hope on the WRDN radio podcast from the World Dairy Expo in Madison last week. Tiffany, who is running for governor, was asked what he says to farmers who are “fed up” with Trump’s tariffs. He replied that Trump tariffs are not going away, but, he said of the administration, “they’re gonna use some of that tariff revenue, which is significant, to help farmers out. Because they know, I mean, President Trump has no better friends than the farmers of America.”

Trump has suggested he will unveil another farm bailout as he did during his first administration, when China responded to steep tariffs by scaling back purchases of U.S. agricultural products.

The problem with the bailout solution, says Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former senior adviser for rural development at USDA, is that the revenue generated by tariffs that Trump proposes to convert into handouts to farmers comes directly from the farmers themselves.

“It’s not even like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It’s like robbing Peter to pay Peter,” Ajilore said in a phone interview Wednesday. “What’s happening is that there are tariffs on a lot of goods — looking at steel, aluminum, looking at fertilizers. So farmers are paying more for their inputs. We’re seeing this impacting these companies like Caterpillar, John Deere. And so you can say there’s a lot of revenue, but it’s coming out of the pockets of consumers, businesses and farmers.”

If farmers are not already feeling seasick as the Trump administration spins the ag economy around on a cycle of tariffs and bailouts, the administration’s immigration crackdown is also making them queasy.

A panel discussion at last week’s World Dairy Expo focused on a labor shortage made worse by a Trump administration that seems hell-bent on deporting the agricultural workforce.

The recent ICE action that scooped up 24 dairy workers in Manitowoc, most of whom had no criminal records, and deportations of entire crews of legally present H2A workers in Texas had farmers who attended the discussion worried.

“Taking hard-working employees off farms does not make communities safer,” said Brain Rexing, a dairy farmer from Indiana. He described the Hispanic workers on his farm as “way more than employees. — they work together with me and my family side to side.”

Like other farmers, he said, he goes to bed at night worrying about his workers and wakes up in the morning worrying about them. Instead of threatening farmworkers with deportation, Rexing and other farmers at the Expo said, Congress should finally get around to creating a year-round visa that recognizes their essential contributions to the U.S. economy.

U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wisconsin) spoke to the group and assured them that the Trump administration has their back. He had personally spoken with Elon Musk he said. “I was like, hey, Elon, there’s two groups of people in the United States that we need to really watch out for. One of them are service members and veterans, because they gave us our freedom and keep us free. And the second one are our farmers, because they feed us. .. So he really zoned in on that and grasped it,” Van Orden said.

Another “incredibly, incredibly strong proponent of the dairy industry,” he added, “is Tom Homan.” Homan is Trump’s border czar and the architect of the family separation policy during the first Trump administration. “He was raised on a dairy farm,” Van Orden said. “So keep that in mind. There are some people in D.C. that understand what’s going on. We’re trying our best to help you. So I would just ask that you stay in the business and that God will bless you.”

It was not the most reassuring speech. But Van Orden also asked the dairy farmers in the room to support his proposal for a new system to make their workforce legal, which would impose a fine on employers and dairy workers and then require the workers to self-deport before returning to the country under a new federal program that would allow them to do their jobs legally. He introduced the bill in July and it was referred to the House Agriculture Committee, of which he is a member.

The farmers, understandably, had a lot of questions.

What was their workers’ incentive to participate? How long would it take the government to process their paperwork, remove them from the country and let them back in again? How do they know they won’t be deported as soon as they come back?

These are reasonable fears, given the terrifying scenes of ICE grabbing people off the street, busting down doors and zip-tying parents and children, sweeping up people with and without legal authorization to be in the country, whether or not they have committed any crime.

Recently, even the Trump administration’s Labor Department declared that the nation’s food system faces an emergency due to the administration’s aggressive mass deportation program, warning in a federal filing uncovered by the American Prospect that the immigration crackdown on agricultural workers has created a significant “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”

“The Department does not believe American workers currently unemployed or marginally employed will make themselves readily available in sufficient numbers to replace large numbers of aliens,” the filing states, contradicting Trump administration rhetoric about immigrants stealing American jobs.

The solution proposed by Trump’s labor department is to pay H2A seasonal agricultural workers even less — offsetting the cost to employers of a terrified workforce that is disinclined to show up to work after ICE raids.

It seems like a weird solution, as David Dayen of the American Prospect observed, “since cutting wages across the sector will likely drive existing workers to look elsewhere for jobs.”

But there is a dark logic behind the move to slash wages for agricultural workers in the midst of the moral panic over immigration. Dayen quotes Antonio De Loera-Brust of the United Farm Workers, who sees a government threatening mass deportations working hand in glove with employers who benefit from a powerless immigrant workforce.

“We call it the ‘Deport and Replace’ strategy,” De Loera-Brust said, “which is defined above all to make it easier for corporate agribusiness to exploit its workers, whether terrified undocumented residents or an unlimited pool of cheap foreign guest workers … The Trump administration would rather expand the abusive H-2A program than do right by the workers who are already here, feeding America for decades.”

This situation does not directly apply to Wisconsin dairy farms, since dairy workers are not eligible for H2A visas. But it was not at all clear from Van Orden’s remarks at the World Dairy Expo that he understands that fact.

“The H2A program is broken and it sucks. There you go. That’s the whole press conference,” he said after he was introduced. Later, he referred to “all this garbage you’ve been dealing with, these H2As and H2Bs” insisting his own proposal for a new visa system would work better. In fact, dairy farmers are not dealing with the H2A (seasonal) or H2B (non-agricultural) visa systems at all.

Van Orden did acknowledge the difficult situation for the dairy industry, which depends on a labor force 60% to 90% of which is made up of immigrants who lack any sort of legal authorization to be in the country, since there is no such thing as a year-round visa for low-skilled work.

“Rocks are heavy. Trees are made of wood. Gravity is real. If we deport every single person that is working in the agriculture industry, the hospitality industry and the construction industry, all of those industries will shutter in a moment’s notice,” Van Orden declared.

But it’s unclear if his plan, the Agricultural Workforce Reform Act of 2025, will help.

One farmer asked if his workers would be barred from returning to the U.S. if they committed a traffic violation (a common concern in Wisconsin, where immigrants without legal papers cannot get a driver’s license). Van Orden fobbed him off, saying that would be a question for the executive branch to resolve through its rule-making process.

Several farmers listening to Van Orden affirmed that they supported Trump’s goal of securing the border, but added that they thought that mission had been accomplished. Now they hoped the administration would turn its attention to a new public safety issue — the threat mass deportations pose to the U.S. food supply.

Farmers across the country seem inclined to give the Trump administration the benefit of the doubt. But the doubt is growing.

“Farmers are getting it in so many ways; their exports are down, their costs are up, and they’re losing their workforce,” said Ajilore, the former USDA economist. Given all that, farmer sentiment “actually hasn’t really moved as much as you would expect, given what’s happening,” he said. He attributes it to a wait-and-see attitude among farmers who have faithfully supported Trump for years. But now, he added, “the impact is starting to really hit home.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8884-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-10-09 11:59:36.245021

Leo Cruz-Silva, 34, originally from Mexico, was being detained by Festus police after his Sept. 30 arrest for public intoxication, according to a statement released late Wednesday by the federal agency. He was transferred to ICE custody on Oct. 1 and sent to the Ste. Genevieve Detention Center two days later.

After one day in the jail, Cruz-Silva was dead.

He was found unresponsive in his cell on Oct. 4 in what ICE said appeared to be a suicide. Jail staff attempted CPR until paramedics arrived, but neither group was able to revive him. The Missouri State Highway Patrol is investigating the death. The Ste. Genevieve County Sheriff’s Office, which operates the jail, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Cruz-Silva’s death marks the second reported suicide in ICE custody in Missouri in recent months — and is at least the 15th detainee death nationwide so far in 2025, according to data on the agency’s website.

In April, Brayan Garzón-Rayo, a 27-year-old Colombian man living in St. Louis, was found unresponsive in his Phelps County Jail cell. His mother said it appeared to be a suicide. Records later showed ICE had not followed its own medical protocols before Garzón-Rayo attempted to take his own life.

Like Garzón-Rayo, Cruz-Silva did not have legal status in the United States and had already been deported twice — in 2010 and 2020.

“I'm very disappointed that we weren't able to assist him,” said Susie Johnson, a board member with Abide in Love-Ste. Genevieve. The volunteer group helps ICE detainees contact family members and obtain basic toiletries. The group noticed Cruz-Silva’s name in the jail’s online communication system but hadn’t yet been in contact with him.

“We have to do a lot of work to identify who was in our jail as an ICE detainee, and sometimes that takes a couple days,” Johnson said. ”It’s just a tragedy for our community.”

Abide in Love-Ste. Genevieve will hold a vigil for Cruz-Silva at 7 p.m. Sunday in front of the Ste. Genevieve County Detention Center.

Heightened enforcement

Johnson said she is concerned about the growing number of ICE detainees being held in Ste. Genevieve under a contract as part of the Trump administration’s intensified immigration enforcement efforts. She estimates the number of detainees in ICE custody at the facility has risen from about 60 in July to more than 100 as of Wednesday.

Trump’s immigration crackdown has drawn widespread attention for the federal government’s forceful actions in Democratic-led cities such as Chicago and Portland. On Wednesday, the president called for the jailing of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for “failing to protect ICE.” Speaking to reporters, Pritzker responded, “Come and get me.”

In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe activated the state’s National Guard late last month to assist ICE agents with administrative, clerical and logistical support through September 2026 after weeks of speculation. Fifteen volunteers signed up for the mission, but hours after Kehoe’s announcement, the federal government shut down.

The Missouri National Guard volunteers will continue working with ICE facilities across the state without pay.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deployed armed agents supported by Blackhawk helicopters and several unmarked trucks to raid an apartment building in the South Shore area of Chicago last week.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that ICE agents collaborated with several other law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). A total of 37 individuals were arrested. DHS accused them of being involved in drug trafficking, armed crimes, and immigration violations.

Separate lawsuits, filed Oct. 8 in federal court, allege Isaac Elias and Katherine Melson were arrested without probable cause and without being read their Miranda rights, subjected to excessive force and denied legal counsel before being arraigned. The lawsuits also claim the arrests, made as Elias and Melson protested police activity, violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful assembly.

Joe Askar, solicitor for the borough, said he is reviewing the filings and declined to comment.

Aftermath of an ‘intense’ operation

Interviewed over the summer, Ambridge Police Chief John DeLuca referred to the operation as a “saturation patrol,” involving multiple local and federal forces, and “not an ICE detention roundup.” He said the department would work with ICE when asked, though it doesn’t have a formal contractual agreement.

ICE agents, aided by Ambridge police, the Beaver County Sheriff’s office and at least one Pennsylvania State Police officer, arrested individuals across town over the course of several hours the night of July 31. Observers and response volunteers crowded outside the police station.

Elias witnessed 12 arrests targeting suspected immigrants and, according to the complaint, began marching the perimeter of the Ambridge police station holding a homemade sign that read “No Justice, No Peace” and chanting “Shame!”

The Ambridge operation followed protests across the country as immigrant communities and advocates denounced ICE’s increasingly forceful tactics under President Donald Trump. In the Pittsburgh area, immigration-related arrests soared in the first six months of his administration

Observers in Ambridge said the arrests disrupted the Beaver County river town that’s home to a growing Latino community. Some suspected racial profiling, pointing to a traffic stop of a young Latino couple earlier in the night.

Jaime Martinez, community defense organizer at Casa San José, said at the time, “This is the most intense thing we have ever seen.” Martinez leads a network of volunteers trained to respond in real time to ICE sightings, arrests and raids in an effort to document federal agents and deter a reported increase in civil rights violations under the Trump administration.

Melson and Elias told Public Source that their lawsuits help give voice to those arrested by ICE and draw attention to how a national issue is affecting the local community.

“The people who were taken that night aren’t afforded the ability to hold police and elected officials accountable,” Melson said.

Forceful arrests alleged

Elias was arrested around 10:40 p.m. and later charged with disorderly conduct, unreasonable noise and resisting arrest. A magisterial judge dismissed the charges for both Elias and Melson after they completed 25 hours of community service.

Melson and her wife joined observers outside the police department shortly before Elias’ arrest. The complaint states, after arresting Elias, officers directed Melson and others to step back another 10 to 15 feet because officers were taking someone into custody.

Less than a minute later, officers Michael Longo and John Chickos arrested her, according to the filing. She claims no other bystanders around her were arrested, despite also not stepping back after police orders.

While in custody, the filing states, Chickos used repeated force by “throwing her around” and pinching under her arms, leaving bruises. Another unidentified officer kicked her, according to the suit, and she was strip-searched at the Beaver County Jail.

She claims she repeatedly asked for legal counsel, but was not permitted to contact a lawyer. Later, according to the lawsuit, an attorney representing Melson called the police department, and was told by an officer she could not speak with her client. He said Melson’s charges were “not just disorderly,” though he refused to tell her what the charges were, according to the lawsuit.

Melson was ultimately charged with obstruction of administrative law, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and harassment.

Elias’ lawsuit states Ambridge Sgt. Sokheng Seng pulled Elias’ arm outside the normal range of motion, causing an “involuntary jerking” during the arrest. Elias claims he suffered physical injury, pain and emotional distress, according to the lawsuit.

Protecting the right to protest

Especially in a small town, Elias said, people should be able to trust that police will protect them.

“It’s important that somebody helps to keep the law enforcement folks within the law,” he said. “People that do [go to protests] should be able to exercise their rights.”

According to the lawsuit, Elias was also not given a reason for his arrest and was told by jail officials he was not “permitted” to have an attorney present at the arraignment per “jail policy.”

The lawsuit also states that Elias’ sign was confiscated and that he was arrested for the “purpose of chilling his First Amendment rights and in retaliation for his exercise of those rights.”

Christine Elzer, the attorney representing Melson and Elias, said peaceful protest is one of the most “fundamental” rights in the United States and that arrests like theirs are a “threat to free speech everywhere.”

Conclusion As we have seen, various legal challenges could arise against a Reform UK government’s immigration plans in the context of devolution.","Reform UK’s announcements on immigration and asylum have generated a lot of attention of late. While challenges and objections are expected, little has yet been written on what these challenges might be. This post considers some hypothetical scenarios in the context of devolution, reflecting on some recent examples. A point central to this analysis is that while immigration law and policy is fast-moving and complex, so too is devolution. And the two are intertwined.

Reform UK recently revealed their plans in a series of press conferences, building on their 2024 manifesto. On 26 August 2025, the party unveiled ‘Operation Restoring Justice’. Their plans were reiterated at The Next Step conference on 5 September and on 22 September, the party announced their latest policy, ‘Prioritising UK Citizens’. Among other plans, Reform UK proposed abolishing the right to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (‘ILR’) under the current system. The system is made up of numerous sources, including a ‘labyrinthine’ set of Immigration Rules (which there has been a call to simplify), numerous statutes, as well as a large volume of secondary legislation and case law. Indefinite Leave to Remain is a status within the system laid out in section 33(1) of the Immigration Act 1971. The routes to, and qualifying period for, ILR can vary. Simply put, where someone is granted ILR, they have a permanent right to reside in the UK after 5 years of residency (though Labour has recently proposed changes to this timeframe). This right is generally without restriction as to the time on a person’s stay or employment in the UK, and a person has access to the same welfare benefits as UK citizens, such as access to the NHS. Revoking ILR would represent a significant change to current immigration law and policy across the UK.

During the Conference on 22 September, Nigel Farage MP (Leader of Reform UK), responded to a question about the possible legal challenges which might emerge from this. He said:

Will we be free from legal challenges, well, of course, having cut out the HRA and the European Court in Strasbourg, British Courts will be free to make judgments that are the right judgments, which they are not at the moment. We are not for a minute pretending that going back through the backlog is an easy thing to do. It will be complex, it’ll come in many forms, but we do intend to address it.

Nigel Farage stressed the scale and complexity of the plans being proposed. Zia Yusuf (Head of Policy at Reform UK) addressed the same question, but his response appeared to have a somewhat different emphasis. Acknowledging the likelihood of legal challenges, he said “Completely agree. I mean, look, will we get legal challenges to Nigel’s entire agenda. Yes…”.

But what are likely to be the location or nature of potential challenges, both legal and political?

Scenario 1

A devolved government could request a transfer from a Reform UK government of powers relating to immigration, which is a reserved or (as the devolution settlement applies in Northern Ireland) excepted matter. In the Scottish example, Devolution Guidance Note 14 states this could be achieved via primary legislation or a Section 30 Order.

The Devolution (Immigration) (Scotland) Bill 2024 – 2025 provides a recent precedent for such a challenge. This was a Private Members Bill introduced by a member of the SNP in April 2025 into the UK Parliament. The Bill proposes to amend the Scotland Act 1998 to grant legislative competence to the Scottish Parliament regarding immigration. Indeed, in July 2025, the Scottish Government signalled its desire that immigration be devolved in response to the UK Immigration White Paper 2025: “…the only way for Scotland and other devolved governments to ensure that the immigration system is reflective of their needs would ultimately be through the devolution of those powers.”

However, the current UK government does not appear likely to consent to such a position. It has also very recently been reported the Scottish Government’s position has changed (see this release following a Freedom of Information Request). The Bill might, therefore, be ‘dropped’ unless it’s carried over to the next Parliamentary session. While the most significant and long term changes to the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament have been made through primary legislation, it must be remembered only a minority of Private Members Bills become law in any case. Far fewer still do so without the support of the government.

There have also been a number of requests for, and examples of, Section 30 Orders being granted by the UK Government/Parliament which change whether a matter is reserved. However, this process does not reserve specific functions, but instead describes subjects in broad terms, where legislative competence has been reserved by the UK Parliament. The transfer of responsibility for the entire immigration system therefore seems unlikely in practice (as recently debated in Parliament). The procedure is also uncertain, requiring collaboration between the devolved and UK governments and, ultimately, political will. A Reform UK government would be under no legal obligation to grant a Section 30 Order. Whilst modifications via primary legislation only require approval from both Houses of the UK Parliament, a Section 30 Order would additionally require the consent of the Scottish Parliament, with either having a ‘veto’.

For these reasons, this scenario seems unlikely to materialise if a Reform UK government were to gain power.

Scenario 2

We could see a devolution and immigration issue being tested at the Supreme Court if Reform UK were to gain power. A ‘Bill Reference’ could be made to the Court under its devolution jurisdiction by either the UK or one of the devolved government’s law officers under sections 32A and 33 of the Scotland Act 1998. A recent example of this phenomenon was Reference by the Lord Advocate [2022] UKSC 31. In this case the Scottish government in effect asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the Scottish Parliament could legislate for another independence referendum independently of Westminster. The Court ultimately ruled it could not. Consequently, a similar reference could be made if any legislation proposed by a Reform UK or devolved government fell within either the competence of a devolved legislature or was related to a reserved matter. As the Devolution (Immigration) (Scotland) Bill 2024 – 2025 is in its early stages, a Bill Reference is currently precluded as a Bill must have passed all stages short of royal assent. However, this is an example of the kind of Bill we might see challenged. Indeed, any kind of Bill from any one of the devolved governments seeking control or influence over immigration policy might be subject to a challenge. Perhaps, more feasibly, devolved governments politically opposed to a Reform UK government at Westminster might seek to extend the legislative competence of a legislature or clarify the scope of a reserved power of the UK Parliament around the edges of immigration policy with regard to human rights. In this case, we might well expect challenges through the courts to ensue.

Scenario 3

According to the Sewel Convention, the UK Parliament will not normally legislate on a devolved matter without the consent of the devolved legislature. Here, it is important to keep in mind what areas are reserved and devolved. If a Reform UK government introduced draft legislation which made provision for devolved purposes, the consent of a devolved legislature is required. It is unclear, though, whether consent would be required if draft legislation put forward by a Reform UK government related to a reserved matter (immigration) that applied to the whole of the UK (the geographical extent of a Bill), but that also had major practical effects on areas which the devolved parliaments are responsible for (its territorial application).

If a devolved government objected to such a Bill, it would be expected to lodge a legislative consent memorandum declining consent. This can be seen in examples of legislative consent motions from Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland in the context of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill 2025 proposed by the UK Government.

However, even assuming any ambiguities around devolved and reserved matters are resolved, the Sewel Convention is only a political convention (R v Miller [2017]). A Reform UK Government could therefore, in the absence of consent, fall back on the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty if it were to attempt to, for example, repeal the Human Rights Act 1998. Indeed, when responding to a question during annual party conference this year on the legal basis for Reform UK’s plans, Zia Yusuf stressed, “Parliament is sovereign…and with primary legislation that will be the legal basis”.

While the Sewell Convention appears to be on a stronger footing now than it was under previous governments, it seems unlikely the Convention alone would be enough to hold back Reform UK’s immigration plans as they might apply to devolved areas.

Conclusion

As we have seen, various legal challenges could arise against a Reform UK government’s immigration plans in the context of devolution. Legally speaking, the position seems clear – the balance of power in the UK’s constitutional arrangements means any such challenges are ultimately likely to be unsuccessful. However, despite claims to the contrary by party leaders at Reform UK, implementing their immigration plans in the face of opposition from devolved governments is likely to prove anything but straightforward.

Trump is now staffing the agency with armed law enforcement agents to make arrests.

by Kate Voigt, she/her/hers, Senior Policy Counsel, ACLU

(Originally published by the ACLU)

In an effort to weaponize an agency that provides pathways to legal immigration, the Trump administration is arming the United States Citizenship Immigration Services (USCIS) for the first time since the agency was created.

Under new regulations published in September, USCIS special agents will be allowed to make arrests, carry firearms, and execute search and arrest warrants. This is the latest effort in Donald Trump’s agenda to systematically restrict legal immigration and strip people of their legal status. The administration’s goal is to redeploy as many parts of the federal government as possible to serve a mass deportation system that will detain and remove as many people as possible.

USCIS Is Not an Immigration Enforcement Agency

USCIS is a federal agency that oversees lawful immigration. It decides whether to grant immigration applications and petitions, including applications for green cards, work authorization, asylum, citizenship, and more.

Before USCIS was created, one agency was responsible for most aspects of U.S. immigration law, including carrying out immigration enforcement and deciding immigration benefits. When Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, it separated these duties into three separate agencies: USCIS was created to focus exclusively on deciding immigration benefits, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were charged with law enforcement duties. Congress deliberately separated these functions to allow USCIS to more efficiently and effectively adjudicate immigration benefits, stating that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could not recombine these functions in one agency.

Keeping USCIS separate from ICE and CBP also helped to ensure that people felt comfortable coming forward and applying for immigration benefits. By blurring these lines, the Trump administration is hoping to make it harder and more intimidating for people to apply for and obtain benefits that they are eligible for under U.S. law. This move will also redirect USCIS resources away from deciding whether to grant immigration benefits, and towards supporting ICE. Applications and petitions will languish and processing times will increase. All of this is by design—this administration intentionally keeps immigrants in more vulnerable immigration statuses to limit their rights and make it easier to deport them.

Trump Weaponizes Federal Agencies for Mass Deportations

The Trump administration is using this new rule to bypass Congress and turn USCIS into another arm of ICE. It goes hand-in-hand with other recently announced USCIS policies that seek to restrict access to immigration benefits and undermine legal immigration. For example, USCIS has announced several new policies that, if implemented, will make it harder for qualified immigrants to access citizenship and may stall naturalizations on a large scale. The agency has also instituted hurdles for naturalized citizens seeking to register to vote. Under another new policy, USCIS will deny benefits to people it decides may support “anti-American” ideologies or activities.

Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has weaponized agency after agency to carry out his mass deportation agenda. For example, the Department of Justice stated it would prioritize stripping citizenship from naturalized Americans. The administration has co-opted the military: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has deployed members of the military and used Department of Defense resources for immigration enforcement. ICE has aggressively recruited local police and sheriffs, convincing over one thousand department leaders to forgo local safety priorities and become an arm of its deportation machine. DHS has even deputized Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officers to help immigration enforcement, and attempted to force the IRS as well as Medicare and Medicaid to share information with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes.

USCIS Policy Changes Undermines Citizenship and Silences Immigrants

Turning USCIS into an enforcement agency is another blatant attempt to stigmatize and harm people who are immigrants—including long-time residents who are American, in every way but on paper. USCIS’s recent policy changes undermine the very bedrock of our democracy by keeping people from seeking legal status and citizenship. If immigrants cannot access citizenship and other immigration benefits, we risk having an underclass of people subject to the whims of this administration’s loyalty tests and able to be exploited. Just look at Miller’s plans to deprive noncitizen children of education and deny citizenship to American-born children.

The Trump administration is erasing our history as a nation of immigrants and attempting to rewrite what it means to be an American by intimidating immigrants, pushing them into the shadows, and silencing dissenters.

These attacks are a reminder that our undocumented neighbors and loved ones deserve a path to citizenship. They are raising families, paying taxes, and working to make our nation thrive. They should not have to live in fear of deportation.

Since taking office on January 20, 2025, the Trump administration has pursued an unprecedented mass deportation agenda. U.S. officials have adopted a range of new tactics to achieve this objective, including expanding the use of expedited removal, sending people from the United States to offshore detention facilities in the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo, terminating protected legal statuses, disappearing people without due process – including to a high security prison in El Salvador, and forcibly transferring individuals to other countries of which they are not citizens. These actions, many of which have been determined to be unlawful by federal courts, have been carried out with little to no transparency, while thousands of peoples’ lives are uprooted from communities across the country, families separated, and their rights are systematically violated.

ICE Flight Monitor responds to this lawlessness and lack of information by using publicly available aviation data to monitor and document flights conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including deportation flights and domestic transfers between U.S. detention centers and deportation staging facilities. The methodology is grounded in Tom Cartwright’s nearly six years of independent work that tracked tens of thousands of ICE flights. To ensure the accuracy and integrity of the findings, ICE Flight Monitor cross-references flight data with public records, media reports, and observations from trusted partner organizations. The project also tracks other relevant air operations—such as military planes involved in immigration enforcement and Mexican and Panamanian government deportation flights. ICE routinely carries out a small number of additional removals on commercial flights, which ICE Flight Monitor is unable to track.

ICE Flight Monitor reports the following top findings for September 2025:

Record Number of Total U.S. Immigration Enforcement Flights Under the Trump Administration Amid Increased Number of ICE Air Planes. U.S. immigration enforcement flights continue to increase significantly under the second Trump administration. From January 20 to September 30, 2025, the administration conducted at least 8,877 total U.S. immigration enforcement flights. These include removal flights, removal-related flights, and domestic transfer (“shuffle”) flights. The majority of these flights are carried out by ICE Air charter planes, but a small number are carried out on Air Force cargo planes, Coast Guard aircraft, or airline carriers operated by other countries. The 8,877 total is the largest number of immigration enforcement flights for the period of January 20 – September 30 since tracking began in 2020, and constitutes a 62 percent increase over the same time period in 2024 (see Figure 1).

In September 2025 alone, ICE Flight Monitor recorded at least 1,464 U.S. immigration enforcement flights—the highest monthly total to date, averaging 49 flights per day. As Trump escalates his deportation campaign, the number of these related enforcement flights continues to surge, raising significant due process concerns regarding the underlying legality of these mass enforcement actions. During the first three months of his administration (January 20 to April 20), there was a monthly average of 723 flights. This contrasts sharply with the recent average of 1,371 flights per month between July and September 2025. On U.S. immigration enforcement flights, individuals are nearly always restrained by handcuffs, waist chains and leg irons, including during any layovers and fuel stops. The harsh conditions during enforcement flights raise serious human rights concerns.

As ICE Air Continues to Expand Its Operations, Domestic Transfer Flights Hit Record in September, Alongside Heightened Interior Enforcement and Detention Rates. A significant portion of U.S. immigration enforcement flights include domestic transfer (or “shuffle”) flights, which move individuals between detention centers and deportation staging facilities across the United States. The Trump administration has sharply increased domestic transfer flights as part of ramped-up interior enforcement—a shift from the Biden administration’s focus on removing individuals who recently crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. From January 20 to September 30, 2025, the administration has carried out 5,322 shuffle flights—a 53 percent increase from the same period in 2024—including a record 969 flights in September. Notably, there was a monthly average of 851 domestic “shuffle” flights between July and September 2025, compared to a monthly average of 437 flights during the first three months of the Trump administration (January 20 to April 20)—an increase of 95 percent. The rise in flights in September is enabled by ICE Air expanding its operations by adding a new subcontracted charter carrier and beginning to use new planes through existing carriers– such as Avelo Airlines and Eastern– starting in mid-September.

September Marks Monthly Record Number of Removal Destination Countries. In September, removal flights remained high, with at least 223 flights to 48 countries—the highest number of destination countries recorded in a single month (See Figure 2). Flights to Mexico dropped sharply to just nine in September, down from a record high of 72 in August, an outlier month when flights to Mexico accounted for 30 percent of the 240 total removal flights for the month. Removal flights to countries other than Mexico reached a record 214 in September—up from 168 in August—reflecting a 27 percent surge in flights. This had to do with an increase in multi-country routes, where a single flight carries out removals to various countries. Within Latin America, this included 55 flights to Guatemala, 55 flights to Honduras (a record high), and 10 to Nicaragua (another record high). In addition, there were an unprecedented high number of flights to Sub-Saharan Africa (18 flights) and East, Central, and South Asian countries (11 flights). In contrast, military removal flights dropped significantly from 17 in August to just three in September, indicating greater reliance on ICE Air aircraft for removals.

First Removal Flight to Iran Via Transfer in Qatar Marks Expansion of Effort to Carry Out “Layover Transfer” Removal Flights to Countries with Strained Diplomatic Ties. On September 30, ICE Flight Monitor tracked an ICE Air removal flight reportedly carrying 55 Iranians to Qatar, where they were transferred by authorities to the custody of Iranian authorities. They were then put on a chartered Qatar Air flight—also monitored by ICE Flight Monitor—and subsequently deported to Iran. The flight is said to be part of a broader U.S.-Iran agreement to deport up to 400 Iranian nationals in the coming months. The agreement reflects a growing effort by the Trump administration to facilitate removal flights to countries where the United States lacks diplomatic relations and where serious human rights concerns persist. The group of individuals on this deportation flight was reported to include political dissidents, a Christian convert, and others who had sought and been either denied or prevented from seeking asylum in the United States due to the range of asylum restrictions implemented by the Trump administration.

ICE Flight Monitor also tracked two flights in June and August 2025 that involved the transfer of detained Russian nationals from the U.S. government to Egyptian government custody in Cairo, Egypt. Recent reports indicate that Russian nationals aboard those two flights were subsequently forcibly returned by Egyptian authorities to Russia, including individuals who had been detained in the United States for over a year after seeking asylum. In addition, from February to August, ICE Flight Monitor has also tracked 20 U.S. removal flights to Venezuela that included a transfer to a Venezuelan carrier in Honduras, which accounted for 40 percent of total removal flights to Venezuela in that period.

Forced Third-Country Transfers Continue with First Flight Carrying non-Ghanaians to Ghana. On September 5, ICE Flight Monitor tracked the first third-country removal flight to Ghana–which took place on a C-17 military cargo plane. This flight occurred due to a bilateral agreement in which Ghana agreed to accept third-country nationals—primarily West Africans—removed from the United States. This is part of the Trump administration’s effort to pursue agreements with countries to facilitate forced third-country transfers—which send individuals to countries of which they are not citizens and often have no ties. In previous months, third-country removal flights were carried out to Rwanda, Eswatini, South Sudan, Uzbekistan, El Salvador, Panama, and Costa Rica. The legality of these transfers—particularly without notice or an opportunity to contest the transfer based on fear of persecution—is currently being challenged in U.S. federal courts.

As of October 1st, No Migrants or Asylum Seekers Remain Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base Offshore Detention Facilities. Notably, as of October 1, 2025, no migrants and asylum seekers remain at the offshore detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (GTMO), where the Trump administration first began to transfer individuals from detention centers in U.S. territory in February 2025. Since then, there have been a total of 89 flights to GTMO, a number of the flights continued on to removal destinations while other flights transferred individuals to and from U.S. territory. In the past two months, there has been a decreasing number of migrants and asylum seekers detained at the base, which is reflected in the flight patterns. Only six flights took place in August and five flights in September, a significant decrease from the record high of 19 flights that occurred in July, which all carried individuals from U.S. territory-based detention centers to be detained at GTMO. A flight on October 1 returned the final remaining 18 individuals to the Alexandria, Louisiana ICE hub.

These findings make clear that the Trump administration’s current deportation campaign is unprecedented and dangerous—not only to the rights of those it targets, but also to our democracy.

The United States Department of Justice sued both cities in June and September 2025, arguing that local limits on cooperation with civil immigration enforcement obstruct federal power.

As of September 2025, over 60,000 people were in ICE custody, with roughly 70% having no criminal convictions.","The ground is shifting quickly beneath the feet of immigrants, their families, and the lawyers who represent them. Since Jan. 20, 2025, immigrants in Los Angeles, Boston, and other major United States cities have faced a sharply altered law enforcement landscape as the Trump administration and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement expand interior operations and detention. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court’s emergency orders have narrowed relief timelines and expanded the powers of the executive branch.

Immigration attorneys and immigrant families reported to the Harvard Independent that ICE’s presence has become invasive, with families fearing separation from their children, unfair arrest, and even leaving the house as federal lawsuits against “sanctuary” policies and a broader detention footprint reshape daily life.

“There’s a sense of panic right now,” a Harvard Law student who works at the Harvard Law School Immigration & Refugee Clinic said. “It’s causing so much downstream distress.”

Due to new orders from the Supreme Court, immigration lawyers have been forced to change their practices since the start of Trump’s second term. Under the revised practice, the Court dictates whether individuals can remain with their families during their proceedings. Recent emergency orders have shortened windows and broadened enforcement discretion. This has made litigation feel like a race against the clock, especially for clinics juggling dozens of clients across multiple courts.

“Our work has been defined by uncertainty and fear,” an immigration attorney from Massachusetts who requested anonymity due to sensitive client information said. “It’s very difficult for folks to wrap their heads around what’s happening when everything is moving so quickly, and it kind of seems like there’s a new policy to grapple with every week, if not every day.”

The American Immigration Council explains how state and city sanctuary policies are rooted in “the idea that the federal government cannot force jurisdictions to take part in immigration enforcement.” On the ground in Los Angeles and Boston, legal battles are increasingly over how much power sanctuary policies hold. The United States Department of Justice sued both cities in June and September 2025, arguing that local limits on cooperation with civil immigration enforcement obstruct federal power.

California went through this same legal battle in 2018.

“The Trump administration has sued California already for its sanctuary policies in the first Trump administration,” Professor Jean Reisz, the Co-Director of the University of Southern California Immigration Clinic and Clinical Associate Professor of Law, said. Eventually, these policies were “held by the court of appeals to not be in violation of federal law,” she continued.

While legally these cases have shown that Washington D.C. can’t force local officers into federal programs, they also reflect how local governments cannot obstruct ICE.

“Sanctuary is a bit of a misnomer, because you can’t really protect somebody in your community who you know is subject to arrest by ICE,” Reisz explained. “ICE has the ability to go into places and arrest people and you can’t obstruct it, but you don’t have to help, and you can make it difficult.”

These policies have directly impacted Massachusetts. “ICE raids have definitely picked up in Boston a lot,” the student at the HLS Clinic said.

“Massachusetts is one of the places that’s been most heavily targeted for enforcement, and that’s been happening since at least May of this year,” the immigration attorney added.

The effects of these operations are reflected in an increase in arrests throughout the country. As of September 2025, over 60,000 people were in ICE custody, with roughly 70% having no criminal convictions. ICE’s recent annual report put the average stay at 46.9 days. Yet clinics routinely report clients held for months, some for even more than a year. These timelines impact everything from keeping separated parents from their children to halting a detained immigrant’s necessary medical care while their bond request sits unheard.

“In the beginning, when the raids started happening in Los Angeles, I think that a lot of the detention facilities weren’t prepared for the influx of people, and there were issues with getting medication, food, water,” Reisz said.

Conditions in custody are not uniform, and that variability has become a central point of contention. Watchdog reports, lawsuits, and medical workers have described serious gaps in some facilities, such as delays in medication, shortages of clean water, sleep deprivation, and limited access to counsel.

“[Detention facilities] aren’t prisons that have programming and other kinds of opportunities for inmates—which I know that sounds crazy. It’s like the prisons might have better conditions than the detention facilities,” Reisz said.

The picture that emerges is uneven and hard to verify, especially as people are moved among facilities or out of state with little notice to families.

“Something that’s become more and more common in recent months is that when someone gets detained, often their family doesn’t have any information about where they are or if they’re okay for days, because the ICE online locator doesn’t get updated and the person isn’t given a phone call at the ICE field office,” the immigration lawyer from Massachusetts explained.

“You’ll hear about people going out to work in the morning and just not coming home at the end of the day. Maybe their family finds someone who saw or heard what happened, or maybe they find the person’s car on the side of the road, but apart from that, they have no information,” the lawyer continued.

“It’s like their loved one has just disappeared. Then, after a few days, the person pops up in the system, and they’re in a detention center halfway across the country. Can you imagine that happening to your dad or your brother, or your partner? You can’t put into words the devastation families are facing every day in Massachusetts.”

Meanwhile, the geography of custody has stretched internationally. On Oct. 2, ICE transferred the last migrants out of a detention center in the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo Bay. The administration initially intended to hold tens of thousands of detainees at the site, drawing scrutiny from rights groups that reported abusive conditions during short-term holds before deportation. It totaled 700 migrants before they were relocated to other sites.

Venezuelan men described being sexually assaulted and forced into sexual acts after the administration sent them to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, telling NBC News they experienced physical and psychological torture. Clinic lawyers now prepare clients for a wider range of possibilities and brace families for the unexpected.

“They’re often classified foreign relations information that isn’t publicly available. So I can’t say much about whether or not I would even call CECOT an international detention facility,” Reisz said.

New policies are also changing how families engage with healthcare. In a nationally representative Urban Institute survey, 38% of mixed-status families reported taking “protective steps” like seeking legal advice or making a detention plan because of anticipated enforcement.

Doctors are finding that people who have been assaulted, or who have serious conditions like diabetes or a high-risk pregnancy, are skipping or delaying care out of fear of ICE. In the KFF/LA Times “Survey of Immigrants,” 22% of immigrant adults reported skipping or postponing care in the prior year. A parent who hears of a potential ICE raid must weigh symptoms against the possibility of being detained for weeks if something goes wrong.

For now, clinics in Los Angeles, Boston, and beyond will keep doing what they have always done under pressure. Policy debates will continue in Washington and in federal courts from California to Massachusetts. But the stakes are in the lives these lawmakers touch.

“It’s really important not to look away [from] what is happening. This is something that is happening every single day,” the immigration attorney said.",https://i0.wp.com/harvardindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ICE-scaled-e1759987068660.png?fit=1267%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-09 10:57:31.488254

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Israel and Hamas overnight agreed on the initial terms of a deal to exchange the Israeli hostages and around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 Gazans detained by Israeli forces in the coming days. Hamas has confirmed the deal, but a Palestinian source told BBC News that they have yet to receive a list of Palestinian prisoners Israel would free in the exchange. An Israeli official said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening his cabinet today to sign the agreement, which would then mark the start of the formal ceasefire. Alice Cuddy, Yolande Knell, and Hugo Bachega report.

Israeli tanks opened fire along the coastal road of Al-Rashid Street near Gaza City today following the announcement of the deal and before the Israeli cabinet have formally signed off on it, according to a live video feed. The IDF told CNN that the tanks were firing “smoke bombs to keep people away from our forces.” The Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry in Gaza urged people “to exercise caution in the final hours before the ceasefire goes into effect in order to ensure their safety.” Ibrahim Dahman and Eyad Kourdi report.

A “formal declaration” ending the war in Gaza must be made in order for the hostage exchange to take place in the coming days, a senior Hamas official said today. “This is what the Israelis have signed up to,” he said. “This is not a ceasefire. It is a declaration to end the war.” Mostafa Salem, Abbas Al Lawati, and Eyad Kourdi report for CNN.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

Shortly after announcing the Israel-Hamas deal, President Trump told Axios that he is “likely going to Israel in the coming days,” to speak to the Knesset. Trump said he had a “great” call with Netanyahu yesterday, adding “[Netanyahu] is so happy. He should be. It is a great achievement.” Trump also said that under the deal, the hostages would “likely” be released on Monday, and that his administration is “forming a council of peace” to maintain a lasting end to the conflict. Barak Ravid reports; Kaanita Iyer report for CNN.

The U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, today called for the immediate delivery of 170,000 tonnes of food, medicine, shelter, and other supplies to Gaza. “Let’s get the hostages out and surge aid in – fast,” Fletcher said. Nick Cumming-Bruce reports for the New York Times.

More than 54,600 children under the age of 5 in Gaza may be acutely malnourished, according to an UNRWA-funded study published in The Lancet yesterday. “Tens of thousands of preschool aged children in the Gaza strip are now suffering from preventable acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of mortality,” Dr Masako Harino, the study’s lead scientist, said. Jonel Aleccia and Sarah El Deeb report for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister within the next 48 hours, the Élysée presidential office said this morning. “A majority of deputies oppose dissolution [of parliament]; a platform of stability exists; a path is possible to adopt a budget by December 31,” Macron’s office said, citing the outgoing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu’s findings. Dominique Vidalon, Michel Rose, and Ingrid Melander report for Reuters.

China’s Commerce Ministry announced today that foreign suppliers must obtain approval from Beijing to export products with certain Chinese rare-earth materials if they account for more than 0.1% of the good’s value. Export applications for products with military use will generally be refused and licenses related to semiconductors or AI development will be granted on a case-by-case basis, the ministry said. Hannah Miao reports for the Wall Street Journal.

China is honing its military ability to stage a surprise attack on Taiwan and seeking to undermine trust in the Taiwanese government with online warfare tactics, Taiwan’s defense ministry announced today in their bi-yearly report. The report said China is using a “professional cyber army” to manipulate social media accounts and flood Taiwan with misinformation. Lee and Ben Blanchard report for Reuters.

680,000 children in Haiti have been displaced by violence, according to a UNICEF report released yesterday. The report says that around 6 million Haitians need humanitarian support, adding that “without decisive action, the future of an entire generation is at stake.” Dánica Coto and Evens Sanon report for AP News.

The United Nations will cut a quarter of peacekeepers in nine operations worldwide in the upcoming months due to a current lack of funding and concerns about future funding from the United States, U.N. senior officials said yesterday. An official said that the United States’ total outstanding bill to the U.N. is more than $2.8 billion. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

Over 200 health facilities in east Congo are experiencing shortages of medicine due to a lack of humanitarian funding and fighting in the region, the International Committee of the Red Cross said yesterday. “The lives of thousands of people are at stake” due to shortages of medicine against HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis, according to the head of the ICRC delegation in Congo, FrançoisMoreillon. Jean-Yves Kamale reports for AP News.

The Taliban administration has placed restrictions on content on some social media platforms in Afghanistan, sources at the Afghan Ministry of Communications and Information Technology told BBC News. It is not clear what sort of posts are subject to filtering. Hafizullah Maroof and Doug Faulkner report.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

A bipartisan War Powers Act measure to stop Trump’s strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean failed 48-51 in the Senate yesterday, despite Republican Sens. Rand Paul (KY) and Lisa Murkowski (AK) joining Democrats in supporting the measure. “The U.S. should not be blowing up boats without even knowing who’s on them. There’s no due process in that – no names, no evidence, no oversight,” Paul said yesterday on social media. Stephen Neukam and Stef W. Kight report for Axios.

“Indications show that the last boat bombed” by the United States in the Caribbean sea “was Colombian with Colombian citizens inside of it,” Colombian President Gustavo Petro said yesterday on social media. He did not provide evidence backing the claim. A White House official told Reuters that “the United States looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement.” Nelson Bocanegra and Alexander Villegas reports.

Qatar is trying to act as a mediator in the conflict between the United States and Venezuela, according to three sources. The sources said that Qatar’s efforts have been welcomed by the Venezuelan government, but that the Trump administration is more focussed on military operations than diplomacy. The Pentagon has deployed 10,000 U.S. troops to the region, mostly to bases in Puerto Rico, according to a U.S. military official. Edward Wong, Eric Schmitt, and Julie Turkewitz report for the New York Times.

The United States has sanctioned Serbia’s main oil supplier, which is majority-owned by Russia’s state oil monopoly Gazprom Neft, , the company said today. “The special license from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which enabled unhindered operational business, has not been extended,” Petroleum Industry of Serbia (Nis) said. U.S. officials have yet to comment. AP News reports.

FEDERALIZATION OF DOMESTIC POLICING

White House officials have held meetings this week that increasingly seriously considered whether Trump should invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops inside the United States, five sources told NBC News. A senior official said that a decision to invoke the act is not imminent and that the broad consensus among Trump’s aides is to exhaust all other options first. Two other sources said the debate has shifted from whether to invoke the act to when and how to invoke it. Courtney Kube, Katherine Doyle, Carol E. Lee, and Garrett Haake report.

Trump yesterday called for Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) to be imprisoned for failing to protect ICE agents. “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a black man unjustly arrested,” Johnson responded on social media. “I’m not going anywhere.” Pritzker said in an interview, “If you come for my people, you come through me. So come and get me.” Joseph De Avilia, Mariah Timms, and Bob Tita report for the Wall Street Journal.

Texas National Guard Troops started “actively protecting federal personnel and property,” in the Chicago area yesterday evening, according to a U.S. Northern Command spokesperson. Several hundred people marched in Chicago yesterday protesting the deployment of the troops. Mitch Smith reports for the New York Times; Emily Schmall, Susan Heavey, and Daniel Trotta report for Reuters.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Internal Revenue Service said yesterday in an internal memo that federal workers are required by law to be paid for the furlough period during a government shutdown. The letter from Acting IRS Human Capital Officer David Traynor to IRS employees confirms that they will be paid on “the earliest date possible.” Avery Lotz reports for Axios.

FBI Director Kash Patel this week fired two agents who were identified as having worked with Jack Smith, the special counsel who led the federal investigation into Trump, according to two sources. The sources said that the two agents had not been formally accused of misconduct, nor were they subject to investigation. Patel cited Article II of the Constitution and his right to fire anyone without cause. Gleen Thrush and Alan Feuer report for the New York Times.

The Defense Department plans to enforce new policies that “appear designed to stifle a free press,” the Pentagon Press Association said in a statement yesterday. “The policy conveys an unprecedented message of intimidation to everyone” within the DoD, “even suggesting it’s criminal to speak without express permission,” the press association said. Julianna Bragg reports for Axios.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Pope Leo XIV yesterday told U.S. bishops that they should firmly address how immigrants are being treated as a result of the Trump administration’s policies, according to attendees at the meeting in the Vatican. Pope Leo “expressed his desire that the U.S. Bishops’ Conference would speak strongly on this issue,” El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz told Reuters. Joshua McElwee reports.

A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that ICE’s use of blank warrants for making arrests can only be used as a basis to arrest someone who has already been given notice to appear before an immigration judge. The ruling, which stems from a consent decree struck by the Biden administration in 2022, is confined to Chicago and will expire in February. Matthias Schwartz reports for the New York Times.

A federal grand jury yesterday elected not to indict two individuals charged with assaulting federal law enforcement officers at a protest outside an immigration facility in Chicago last month. “Obviously they didn’t have enough for a ham sandwich here,” said a lawyer representing one of the protestors, adding that the failure to secure an indictment was “highly unusual.” Ernesto Londoño reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Former FBI Director James Comey yesterday pleaded not guilty to charges that he lied to Congress. Comey’s lawyer said he would move to dismiss the case, calling the prosecution “vindictive” and “selective.” Glenn Thrush, Karoun Demirjian, and Minho Kim report for the New York Times.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Microsoft will release an update of its Copilot AI chatbot that responds to queries about healthcare, developed in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, as soon as this month, sources told the Wall Street Journal. Sources said that the move is part of an urgency in Microsoft to build up technological independence from OpenAI. Sebastian Herrera reports.

Flush with about $170 billion in new funding from a Republican-written budget law, the Department of Homeland Security has set a goal of deporting 1 million immigrants annually.

From Jan. 21, the administration’s first full day in power, through July, ICE agents have arrested 137,944 people, according to data from the Immigration Enforcement Dashboard, an independent research project.

Of that national total, 3,201 people were arrested during that period in New Jersey. ICE arrests peaked in June at 802 before slowing to 727 in July.

In all of 2024, ICE arrested 2,959 people in New Jersey.

These figures, obtained by a separate group called the Deportation Data Project, provide a glimpse into day-to-day operations at DHS, which does not provide updated arrest statistics.

Asked for comment Wednesday, Chrissy Cuttita, a spokesperson for ICE’s Newark field office, referred to a webpage of arrest data that had not been updated since last year.

The Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers, obtains immigration data, often through the Freedom of Information Act, a federal law that allows the public to request government files and sue for them, too.

Texas, where the administration has expanded its immigration detention footprint, is the state with the most ICE arrests to date, 28,214, as of July.

Two populous states, Florida and California, follow with 12,877 and 10,120 ICE arrests respectively.

New York and Pennsylvania also rank in the top 10 states for ICE arrests from Trump’s first full day in office until July: 4,576 and 2,951.

Nationally, arrests peaked at 30,390 in June, before dropping to 23,617.

The majority of people ICE has arrested nationwide do not possess criminal convictions, according to Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University.

As of Sept. 21, about a third — 34% — of people ICE had arrested and detained had been convicted for criminal charges.

“For the first time since the start of the current Trump administration, immigrants with no criminal convictions make up the objectively largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE,” Kocher said in an analysis of immigration statistics.

“According to the latest data, 16,523 immigrants in detention have no criminal charges or convictions, now the largest of these groups—a significant increase since the previous data points, while those with charges and convictions remained static,” Kocher said. “By contrast, the number of people in detention with criminal charges and convictions is actually down over the past month.

The ongoing federal government shutdown has not halted arrests by ICE or other DHS agents. The overall department has roughly $170 billion it can access, thanks to a new federal law that cut domestic health, food and climate programs and increased spending on the military and hardline immigration policy.

In writing that law, Republicans in Congress also capped the number of judges who can hear immigration cases at a given time at 800, who already face a mountainous backlog of about 4 million cases.

The Pentagon is targeting Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in Burlington County for immigration agents to hold then deport, by airplane, a minimum of 1,000 to as many as 3,000 undocumented immigrants.

Yet, its provisions do not alter the established legal principle against retroactive application of international law in matters of State responsibility.

The state Supreme Court will now decide what happens next.
But it’s not a wrong committed against MIRC, giving rise to independent cause of action for MIRC,” Fish told Supreme Court justices.
That would likely come up if MIRC wins at the Supreme Court on Wednesday’s arguments over timing.","An immigrant workers’ compensation lawsuit against the governor went before the Michigan Supreme Court Wednesday.

The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center claims the state is creating more work for it by wrongly denying workers’ comp claims for people without legal status. The nonprofit says that’s because private-practice firms will no longer take on those cases, and so they filter to MIRC.

“We receive call after call from injured undocumented workers who are tremendously suffering, struggling to make ends meet to feed themselves and their families because they can’t access this basic assistance for wage loss after they’ve been severely injured at work,” MIRC attorney Anna Hill Galendez said.

The group claims the burden caused it to hire another employee in 2019. MIRC sued over the matter in 2021.

Rather than the merits of the case, Wednesday’s Supreme Court arguments focused on whether that lawsuit was filed in time. State law provides a one-year period to sue the state in most cases.

Speaking before the court, Assistant Attorney General Gallant Fish said even though the denial policy continues, the lawsuit is too late since the harm happened in 2019.

“MIRC has not alleged ongoing series of wrongs committed against MIRC, giving rise to independent causes of action for MIRC,” Fish said.

MIRC rejected that argument, its lawyers claiming instead that the harm is ongoing since the workers’ comp denials continue to increase the group’s call volume.

Speaking in the lobby outside the court after oral arguments, attorney David Muraskin, representing the immigrant rights center, said the governor is avoiding the substance of the case.

“She has delayed for years … by claiming immunity. And what she has done before this court is try to skirt that issue and say, ‘Well this is really an issue of procedure,’ and dodge the implications of all her arguments"" in lower courts,” Muraskin said.

The trial court that first heard the case decided it could go forward. The state Court of Appeals decided it should have been dismissed.

The state Supreme Court will now decide what happens next. If MIRC prevails, the case would go back to the lower court for further proceedings.

“Our hope is that we immediately go from the Court of Appeals to the trial court, the Court of Claims, to get the merits decided and then can, hopefully, vindicate the rights of undocumented workers which then would have to proceed back up. But with those rights protected,” Muraskin said.

The merits of the case that still need to be worked out in court include whether the state is properly using the 2003 state Supreme Court decision Sanchez v. Eagle Alloy, Inc., to deny claims.

MIRC argues the state is not because of federal and state decisions that have come later. It likens the situation to the state attempting to enforce defunct anti-sodomy laws even though the U.S. Supreme Court has declared them unconstitutional.

The state, however, argues MIRC doesn’t have standing to sue.

“There might be wrongs in the general sense that MIRC has alleged. If Sanchez was wrongly decided, then that’d mean denial of benefits under Sanchez would be, in some sense, a wrong. But it’s not a wrong committed against MIRC, giving rise to independent cause of action for MIRC,” Fish told Supreme Court justices.

The Court of Appeals never addressed the standing question in its opinion. That would likely come up if MIRC wins at the Supreme Court on Wednesday’s arguments over timing.

Summary

This week’s Parsing Immigration Policy podcast examines the Trump administration’s initiative to temporarily detail military lawyers -- Judge Advocates General (JAGs) -- to serve as temporary immigration judges, with the first group beginning training this week.

Host Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, is joined by Andrew Arthur, the Center’s fellow in law and policy and a former immigration judge, to discuss the legal, practical, and political implications of the move.

Key points include:

The U.S. immigration court system currently has about 650 permanent judges; the addition of 100 JAGs as temporary judges could significantly expand capacity, with the administration aiming to add hundreds more.

The Department of Justice has had mechanisms since 2014 to appoint temporary immigration judges.

Most JAGs lack immigration law experience, but Arthur notes that immigration courts often focus on determinations of removability and eligibility for relief -- areas where experienced litigators can adapt quickly.

New judges receive a week of formal training and two weeks of supervised hearings, similar to what Arthur himself received.

The episode also addresses the multiple due process safeguards, the backlog impact, and whether the move raises concerns under the Posse Comitatus Act.

In his closing commentary, Krikorian discusses the government shutdown and the debate over healthcare for illegal immigrants, referencing a recent CIS blog post by Jason Richwine, “Of Course Illegal Immigrants Access Public Health Benefits”. He notes that the budget dispute is real but distracts from a broader truth: Illegal immigrants access public health programs through multiple channels, benefits that will continue regardless of how the shutdown is resolved.

As bipartisan frustration with the strikes mounts, the Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday voted down a war powers resolution that would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes on the cartels.

The military has carried out at least four strikes on boats that the White House said were carrying drugs, including three it said originated from Venezuela. It said 21 people were killed in the strikes.

The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly about the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the administration has only pointed to unclassified video clips of the strikes posted on social media by President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and has yet to produce “hard evidence” that the vessels were carrying drugs.

The administration has not explained why it has blown up vessels in some cases, while carrying out the typical practice of stopping boats and seizing drugs at other times, one of the officials said.

The Republican administration, in a retroactive memo justifying one of the strikes last month, declared drug cartels to be “unlawful combatants” and said the United States is now in an “armed conflict” with them.

The declaration has raised stark questions about how Trump intends to use his war powers. It also has been perceived by several senators as pursuing a new legal framework to carry out lethal action and has raised questions about the role of Congress in authorizing any such action.

Trump administration points to videos as proof

Asked about the lack of underlying evidence provided to Congress, the Pentagon on Wednesday pointed to videos of the strikes, which do not confirm the presence of drugs.

The Pentagon also noted public statements by Hegseth, including a social media post following the latest fatal strike in which he said, “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”

Lawmakers have expressed frustration that the administration is offering little detail about how it came to decide the U.S. is in armed conflict with cartels or even detailing which criminal organizations it claims as “unlawful combatants.”

Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said Wednesday that he and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a classified briefing this week, were denied access to the Pentagon’s legal opinion about whether the boat strikes adhered to U.S. law.

His comments came at a confirmation hearing for Joshua Simmons, a top legal adviser to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to be the CIA’s next general counsel. At the hearing, Simmons refused to say whether he had partaken in any deliberations over the targeting of cartels in the Caribbean, saying any legal advice he gave Rubio or other U.S. officials would’ve been confidential.

Attorney General Pam Bondi was pressed at a Senate hearing Tuesday about what advice she's provided Trump to legally justify the strikes. She said, “I’m not going to discuss any legal advice that my department may or may not have given or issued at the direction of the president.”

A White House official suggested that lawmakers were being disingenuous with their criticism and that the Trump administration has been “much more forthcoming” with the legal rationale than Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration was when it carried out strikes targeting militants in the Middle East.

The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Pentagon officials have held six separate classified briefings to Congress on the operations.

Trump administration officials have argued that the strikes are necessary acts of self-defense as cartels funnel drugs into the United States that they say are leading to thousands of U.S. deaths. While Venezuela produces cocaine, the bulk of it is sent to Europe.

A few in the administration are said to be driving the push for strikes

Trump has largely bypassed traditional interagency processes in formulating his strategy to carry out strikes against drug cartels, according to the U.S. officials and a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.

A small group of top administration officials — including Rubio, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Trump aide Stephen Miller — has driven the push to carry out the fatal strikes, officials said.

Rubio, dating back to his days in the Senate, has advocated for taking a harder line on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted on U.S. federal drug charges, including narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. This year, the Justice Department doubled a reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million, accusing him of being “one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.”

Trump has focused attention on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which he claims is serving as “front” for Maduro, and said members of the gang were in the first boat targeted last month. No details on alleged affiliations have been released in the three other strikes.

Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term in January despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro’s claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, won by more than a two-to-one margin.

A pause in diplomacy

Early in his term, however, Trump dispatched special envoy Richard Grenell to Caracas to meet with Maduro. Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were freed by Maduro's government during Grenell's visit.

But diplomatic efforts with Caracas have been largely paused in recent months, with Grenell mostly sidelined, said the person familiar with the matter and a congressional aide, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Maduro says the boat strikes are an attempt to undercut his authority and try to foment unrest that would lead to his ouster from power.

The State Department pushed back against the notion that the administration had been involved in anything other than an operation targeting drug traffickers.

“Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela; he’s a fugitive of American justice who undermines regional security and poisons Americans and we want to see him brought to justice,” said Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman. “The U.S. is engaged in a counter-drug cartel operation and any claim that we are coordinating with anyone on anything other than this targeted effort is completely false.”

Just blocks away, Portlanders who spoke with KGW on Tuesday were completely unfazed.

Streets around the ICE facility remained taped off Wednesday morning following the visit of U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. Alongside Portland police, city contractors removed the camp where protesters like Lillian had been staying for weeks, keeping up their presence outside.

""This is not fair,"" Lillian said. ""Now they took all our stuff, and all our stuff is missing.""

The encampment was cleared due to ongoing public safety concerns in the area, according to a spokesperson for Portland police. They said that criminal activity has been associated with the site, and it was blocking the public right-of-way.

""We take really good care of this place; we pick up our garbage,"" Lillian countered.

Just around the corner, the Portland Bureau of Transportation spent Wednesday morning turning South Bond Avenue into a two-way street, allowing drivers a way to skirt the ICE building.

""The hardest thing we've dealt with is the fact that people are having a hard time getting to the Spaghetti Factory to come enjoy a meal,"" said Gary Sheperd, senior general manager at the Old Spaghetti Factory, just down the street from the ICE facility.

Between the protests and the police blocking off streets around the ICE building, Sheperd said it's been hard for the longtime Portland restaurant to do business.

""It made it very difficult to serve lunch; we were very slow for our lunch business — ended up yesterday for dinner closing early because of it,"" Sheperd said.

Some who work at businesses near the ICE building said they didn't want to go on camera for fear of retaliation but said they've experienced repeat vandalism since the protest begin.

In the windows of an apartment building just across the street from the ICE building, signs declare that they aren't associated with ICE and plead against vandalism.

""It's just tragic that the whole thing is happening,"" said David Vala, who lives across from the ICE facility, in that same affordable housing complex.

With the protest camp cleared and Portland police cordoning off the block immediately in front of the ICE building, protesters have been pushed right underneath Vala's balcony, he said.

""Before Kristi Noem showed up, all the protestors were right at the ICE building,"" he said.

""Yeah, we're just going to post up over here, and we're going to spread like wildfire,"" said Lillian. ""We're going to try and get more people over here because we're mad.""

The situation here has made life difficult for people like Vala in the day-to-day.

""The sound, the anger, the people with the bullhorns, they just shout profanities,"" said Vala. ""Sleep, rest, pretty much anything — I'm impacted day and night. ... It's just kind of a sadness, what our country has fallen into.""

REACH Community Development, which operates the apartment building with the signs in the windows, responded to KGW's inquiry with a statement.

""Law-abiding residents of Gray's Landing are directly in harm's way and are suffering the consequences of tactics used by federal agents around the ICE building,"" a spokesperson said, in part. ""Recent events, including tear gas and late-night altercations, have been deeply stressful for our community, and the signage reflects our efforts to maintain calm, prevent harm, and preserve a sense of security.""

Mayor Rory Hoskins told the Review that the village’s Oct. 8 statement reporting the update comes at a time when the number and intensity of incidents at the Broadview ICE detention facility are increasing.

“There’s a lot of confusion about what’s happening,” Hoskins said. “We wanted to show the residents that were cognizant of their concerns and that we’re closely monitoring the situation.”

Hoskins said there may have been a recent incident involving ICE at Rush Oak Park Hospital and local officials are trying to confirm if federal agents detained a worker at Concordia Cemetery on Oct. 7.

In the village statement, Forest Park officials said that, under the Illinois TRUST Act, village police are prohibited from helping with federal immigration enforcement. Police are trained in the requirements of the act.

“Our officers are here to protect and serve the community, not to enforce federal immigration laws,” officials said in the Oct. 8 statement. They added that, when residents call 911, village police respond without ICE involvement and will not ask about immigration status or detain a resident because of that.

According to the statement, village officials are collaborating with neighboring communities to ensure that their communities are informed about the nearby presence of ICE.

Hoskins said that, though he hasn’t yet been to the Broadview ICE facility, he recently stood at a press conference with Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson. He said he’s a part of an active group chat with other local mayors, where they discuss reports of ICE activity and their veracity.

Hoskins said Forest Park police officers have, on about four occasions over the past couple weeks, responded to Broadview mutual aid requests to provide help with traffic or crowd control measures around the nearby ICE facility.

Though there was activity at the long vacant, former Armed Forces Reserve Center building at 7402 Roosevelt Rd. last month, the property is just undergoing construction before the Illinois National Guard moves in, likely next year.

Hoskins said the village has reached out to the Illinois National Guard to see whether the building will be used as the National Guard is reportedly deployed to the Chicagoland area.

“They tell us that, as of now, there are no plans to use that for the current National Guard call-up, but those things can change in a heartbeat,” Hoskins said. “We’re closely monitoring what happens there and we have a plan in case there’s activity in Forest Park.”

Hoskins added that the village’s emergency operations team is in the loop about the locations of federal agents and has close contact with local law enforcement agencies and the Cook County Office of Emergency Management and Regional Security.

U.S. District Judge April Perry will hear arguments over a request to block the deployment of Illinois and Texas Guard members. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and local officials strongly oppose use of the Guard.

An “element” of the 200 Texas Guard troops sent to Illinois started working in the Chicago area on Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. Northern Command, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity in order to discuss operational details not been made public. The spokesperson did not say where specifically the troops were sent.

The troops, along with about 300 from Illinois, arrived this week at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago. All 500 troops are under the Northern Command and have been activated for 60 days.

The Guard members are in the city to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings and other federal facilities and law enforcement personnel, according to Northern Command. Trump earlier sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington, and a small number this week started assisting law enforcement in Memphis.

Those troops are part of the Memphis Safe Task Force, a collection of about a dozen federal law enforcement agencies ordered by Trump to fight crime in the city. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports using the Guard.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

Chicago and Illinois have filed a lawsuit to stop the deployments, calling them unnecessary and illegal. Trump, meanwhile, has portrayed Chicago as a lawless “hellhole” of crime, though statistics show a significant recent drop in crime.

The Republican president said Wednesday that Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Pritzker, both Democrats, should be jailed for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.

In a court filing in the lawsuit, the city and state say protests at a temporary ICE detention facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview have “never come close to stopping federal immigration enforcement.”

“The President is using the Broadview protests as a pretext,” they wrote. “The impending federal troop deployment in Illinois is the latest episode in a broader campaign by the President’s administration to target jurisdictions the President dislikes.”

Also Thursday, a panel of judges in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was scheduled to hear arguments over whether Trump had the authority to take control of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. The president had planned to deploy them in Portland, where there have been mostly small nightly protests outside an ICE building. State and city leaders insist troops are neither wanted nor needed there.

U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut on Sunday granted Oregon and California a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment of Guard troops to Portland. Trump had mobilized California troops for Portland just hours after Immergut first blocked him from using Oregon's Guard.

The administration has yet to appeal that order to the 9th Circuit.

Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, rejected the president's assertions that troops were needed to protect Portland and immigration facilities, saying ""it had been months since there was any sustained level of violent or disruptive protest activity in the city.”

Protesters gathered at Congress Plaza, 520 S. Michigan Ave., on Wednesday before marching north on Michigan Avenue and eventually turning back toward the Loop at Trump Tower, 401 N. Wabash Ave. Elected officials and activists spoke to a crowd frustrated with how federal officials have — against the wishes of local elected officials and many residents — increased immigration enforcement activity in the area and worked to deploy National Guard troops.

Ald. Jesse Fuentes (26th), who a federal agent handcuffed Friday at a hospital, spoke at the rally to cheers.

“As your alderperson, not just of the 26th Ward because every Chicagoan matters, I will make sure that we utilize every legislative tool at our disposal to slow ICE down to protect our neighbors,” Fuentes told the crowd.

Jason, a teacher in a predominantly Latin-American community who declined to share his last name for safety reasons, turned out for Wednesday’s march and said he personally knows U.S. citizens who ICE agents have detained.

“In my community where I teach, there’s kids not coming to school for a month at a time because they’re scared of what can happen to them,” he said. “I’m overwhelmed with blinding anger and depression for the people who are being affected.”

Jason said he also attended a protest at the ICE facility in suburban Broadview and knows several people who federal agents brutalized there.

“They shot my friend in the face,” he said, referring to the non-lethal rounds and chemical agents that have regularly been used by immigration authorities in Broadview. “Luckily, they were wearing goggles — but I can’t imagine what would’ve happened if they weren’t. I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Protesters chanted, “Donald Trump, you stupid clown; ICE ain’t welcome in this town.”

Bicycle convoys of police officers accompanied the crowd as protesters marched.

The march was organized by a broad alliance of progressive organizations under the Coalition Against the Trump Agenda, including the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, the Chicago Teachers Union and United Working Families.

The protest was the latest way Chicagoans have rallied against the immigration enforcement operations.

In September, ICE and Border Patrol launched operations Midway Blitz and At Large, which are supposed to focus on arresting and removing undocumented immigrants with serious criminal histories.

But over the past month, federal agents have shot at least two people, killing one; repeatedly tear-gassed protesters and first responders; shot rubber bullets at protesters; detained U.S. citizens, including children; handcuffed a Chicago alderperson in a hospital; smoke bombed and tear-gassed a Chicago street; fired a chemical weapon at a TV reporter and detained a journalist, among other incidents.

Many local protests have been centered around the Broadview facility. Trump’s administration has said National Guard troops are needed to protect ICE officials and facilities.

But officials have expressed concerns about the Trump administration taking control of the National Guard — deployments are typically only done at the request of a state’s governor — and forcing federal troops into Illinois against the wishes of elected leaders and residents.

Chris Purdy is an Army National Guard veteran who now heads up the Chamberlain Network, which organizes veterans around issues of democracy and human rights. He said it’s “incredibly uncommon is for guards to be federalized over the objections of a state governor.”

“These are school teachers, mechanics, firefighters,” Purdy said of the guardsmen. “They are not federal law enforcement. If they wanted to do that, they would have.”

And without any meaningful guidance, how is anyone on either side of the immigration process supposed to identify it?
Because if they have it vague, then they can say that somebody can be disqualified for any reason they want,” said Pittsburgh-based immigration lawyer Adam S. Greenberg.
“The anti-Americanism policy really kind of flows from the antisemitism policy.” Mehta said he’d attended multiple naturalization interviews since the announcement and had not seen it come up.

Among other things, it noted vaguely that the agency would scrutinize applicants who “support or promote anti-American ideologies or activities” and “enforce all relevant immigration laws to the maximum degree, including the use of discretion, to deny the benefit request.” Effectively, it instructed evaluators to deny people engaged in anti-Americanism, which it did not define there or elsewhere.

What is anti-Americanism? What are those “ideologies or activities,” exactly? And without any meaningful guidance, how is anyone on either side of the immigration process supposed to identify it? Maybe the imprecision is the point. Three weeks on, practitioners tell The Verge that it is almost impossible to figure out how to advise clients on this standard or properly prepare for it. “The problem that I have been stating is that it’s entirely pretextual anyway, that having something be this vague is not a bug, it’s not a problem, it’s exactly what they’re going for. Because if they have it vague, then they can say that somebody can be disqualified for any reason they want,” said Pittsburgh-based immigration lawyer Adam S. Greenberg.

In one potential indication of where the administration could draw the line, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that people “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Charlie Kirk’s assassination could be denied visas or stripped of status without pointing to any specific authority. The uncertainty “creates an environment of self-censorship where people delete their accounts or delete their posts or simply do not post things because they’re worried that they will have to report them to the government and that the government may read them and it might influence their immigration status in the future,” said Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

“Fear about whether this would impact applications has been around for a while, since March or even earlier, with the administration’s antisemitism policy,” said New York-based immigration attorney and scholar Cyrus Mehta, referencing the administration’s earlier announcement that it would screen applicants’ social media for supposedly antisemitic content. “The anti-Americanism policy really kind of flows from the antisemitism policy.”

Mehta said he’d attended multiple naturalization interviews since the announcement and had not seen it come up. Still, clients remain on edge and lawyers bewildered. “I don’t know how it’s going to be applied. It might be applied more vigorously, and I think it’s far more insidious than the antisemitism … It’s really vague, it’s really broad.” He said that his and many other attorneys’ belief in free speech “is totally antithetical to the advice that one may have to give to clients.”

Keeping immigration policies broad and discretionary to confuse applicants has been a penchant of Donald Trump’s going back to his first term. The public charge rule, for example, threatened immigrants with status denial over extraordinarily subjective analyses of their risk of becoming dependent on public assistance, which could take into account not just existing but hypothetical future use of benefits like food stamps. Ultimately, I’ve never heard of anyone denied status specifically on the basis of the expanded public charge analysis, at least in part because it was only briefly in effect before it was blocked by a federal judge during covid. Nonetheless, a 2024 report by the Urban Institute found widespread reluctance among immigrant and mixed-status families to use safety net benefits they were entitled to, including some that were state and local and would not have been part of the public charge calculus.

The idea at least in part was for people to overcorrect, and overcorrect they did. Now, Trump officials are doing the same but for speech. This is not the first immigration effort targeting what very much seems like protected speech, following the now-notorious detention of former Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil and others involved in campus protest and activism, which shocked observers earlier this year. This does, however, seem far more expansive, and comes on the heels of Homeland Security and the State Department announcing that visa adjudications would require applicants to both share all their social media handles and set their accounts to be publicly visible, which together suggest that online criticism of the administration could now effectively be an obstacle to status. “It has clearly altered behavior. A lot of people say, ‘Well, I make sure that I don’t post anything.’ I’ve never really had that reaction before,” said Mehta.

The guidance does not specify how exactly government adjudicators would assess applicants for “anti-American” sentiment, though there are some concerning clues in other recent immigration actions. In April, the administration abruptly began mass-terminating thousands of student visas across the country before just as abruptly reversing course as it faced dozens of lawsuits and court losses. It soon emerged in court that administration officials had simply run international student information data through a federal crime information database and then directed the terminations without ever confirming if the data was accurate or if identified students had actually committed offenses that could trigger loss of status. Activists and lawyers worry that a similar approach could be used to identify supposed anti-American ideology.

“We can make guesses based on the half-assed technical implementations that the Trump administration has made since February. Especially the behavior of DOGE is usually to essentially create enormous troves of data and merge them all together in a deeply undifferentiated way,” said Galperin. “You get a lot of extremely inaccurate or useless data, and then either just do a search for incendiary keywords — which is how you end up getting funding pulled for talking about transitions or transgenic mice — and then there’s just feeding the entire thing into AI and having AI make the determination, or have AI write a summary, which, again, you are feeding garbage into a garbage machine that will then spit out more garbage.”

USCIS did not respond to a list of detailed questions, including how it defined anti-Americanism, what criteria it was giving its adjudicators, and if it would use any automated tools to evaluate applicants.

At least the students with canceled visas were able to pursue legal action on the basis that the government obviously lacked any real rationale to attempt to terminate their status. When it comes to the initial issuance of benefits like work and student visas or even permanent residency, the government under the law gets quite a fair bit of leeway, and doesn’t always have to explicitly lay out the reason for a denial. That opens up the possibility that applicants could be denied on this anti-American basis and not even know it.

“Adjustment [to permanent residency] is discretionary. Extensions of status are discretionary. Waivers are discretionary. They don’t have to provide their reasoning,” said Greenberg. While a federal court could in theory point out that a denial violates the First Amendment, there are limited avenues for people to actually appeal these decisions or get clarity on why they were denied, especially at consulates abroad.

“I think, for example, students applying for the visa to study in the US are particularly vulnerable,” said Mehta. “It would be very difficult for everybody to bring lawsuits. So a lot of people are trying to conform. A lot of people are basically avoiding, you know, posting.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/257941_anti-americanism_CVirginia2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-10-09 02:57:49.185148

She was immediately detained and transferred from New Jersey to Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas, far from her family.

Ms. Kordia was in the process of obtaining legal permanent residency in the USA. She came to the attention of immigration authorities after her arrest at a protest in 2024 outside of Columbia University against Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip. The charges were later dismissed in the interests of justice.

Ms. Kordia’s arrest and ongoing arbitrary detention are a part of the continued attacks on human rights by the Trump administration. Targeting peaceful protesters and threatening their immigration status for the content of their protest, such as advocating for the human rights of Palestinians, is a violation of the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. This targeting sends a chilling message to people across the country that anyone exercising their human rights will be subject to repression, detention, and possible deportation. For immigrant communities already living in fear throughout the U.S., they are now only further pushed into the shadows with fear that they could be deported for speaking out.

Cummings also imposed reporting requirements for ICE to share how many people are being arrested in the Chicago area without a warrant.
The Castañon Nava consent decree or settlement applies to ICE arrests in Illinois and five neighboring states.
The ICE agents' warrant was not for Abel Orozco, it was for his oldest son, the report notes.
All those arrests are examples of what Cummings ruled is an ongoing pattern of ICE violating the terms of the consent decree.","CHICAGO (WLS) -- A U.S. District Judge has ruled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents violated a previously agreed-upon consent decree over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area and unlawfully detained more than two dozen people in the first months of President Donald Trump's second administration.

""Collateral arrests"" or people arrested while ICE agents are patrolling the street, often without a previously signed warrant, have been a major tactic deployed during the local immigration enforcement crackdown branded ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

Now, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings has imposed limits on when agents can make those kinds of arrests as part of an extended consent decree that will last until Feb. 2, 2026.

Cummings also imposed reporting requirements for ICE to share how many people are being arrested in the Chicago area without a warrant.

In an emailed statement, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, ""DHS complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.""

The ABC7 I-Team has been following this case closely after attorneys with the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) and the ACLU of Illinois accused DHS and ICE in March of violating the 2022 Castañon Nava settlement after the warrantless arrest of 26 individuals during the first weeks of President Donald Trump's second administration.

Those kinds of arrests have ramped up significantly in the last month, said NIJC attorney Mark Fleming.

""What we have seen now to a much larger scale is federal agents indiscriminately stopping and arresting people without warrants and without probable cause required by federal immigration laws,"" Fleming said on Wednesday.

The Castañon Nava consent decree or settlement applies to ICE arrests in Illinois and five neighboring states. It was named after the original plaintiff in the 2022 lawsuit, Margarito Castañon Nava.

While the remedies ordered by Cummings apply only to the six-state region of the Chicago Field Office, the NIJC said the consent decree's policy applies nationwide.

According to the Castañon Nava settlement, ICE agreed to certain conditions for arresting someone in the Chicago area without a warrant, including pre-determining whether there is probable cause to believe the person is in the country illegally, and whether they are also a flight risk; two requirements that immigrant advocates say have been flouted in at least 200 documented cases, according to Fleming.

Among the plaintiffs arrested unlawfully by ICE this year and cited in the NIJC's case is 47-year-old Abel Orozco-Ortega, a father who was arrested on Jan. 26 after living in the U.S. for nearly 30 years, his family previously shared with the I-Team.

Orozco-Ortega has no criminal history, his attorneys told the I-Team, only a removal order from 2004 after he visited his father in Mexico and returned to the country without applying for asylum or citizenship.

""He was the main provider,"" said Eduardo Orozco, Abel's son, earlier this year. ""He was the one who paid all of the bills and bought all of the food and everything. So having him gone, it's hard.""

As the I-Team previously reported, according to ICE's arrest report for Orozco, which was provided to the I-Team by his attorney, agents did not have a warrant for him at the time he was detained.

In fact, after pulling Orozco over and detaining him, agents eventually realized they had the wrong person.

Agents ""reviewed the [ original ] target's case and observed that the date of birth was not consistent with the [ driver's license Orozco ] provided,"" the report states.

The ICE agents' warrant was not for Abel Orozco, it was for his oldest son, the report notes. But after checking DHS systems and finding a decades-old removal order for the father, agents prepared a new warrant on the spot after carrying blank warrant forms for such an occasion.

ICE agents were taught how to do this at the ICE Academy, according to attorneys for the NIJC and as seen in training materials shared with the I-Team.

An attorney representing DHS had previously argued this training was lawful, and that even though agents carried blank warrants, an agent supervisor was required to sign it.

In his order, Judge Cummings noted ICE's legal arguments for carrying blank warrant forms for collateral arrests are ""meritless,"" and in the case of Orozco's arrest, the warrant issued after he was detained was ""invalid.""

ICE records show Orozco remains in federal custody at a detention facility in Kentucky.

The NIJC says it will seek the release of hundreds of people they claim were unlawfully arrested, including men arrested during a raid in Elgin where Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was present, and a family detained in Millennium Park last month.

All those arrests are examples of what Cummings ruled is an ongoing pattern of ICE violating the terms of the consent decree.

""If they [ ICE ] made a warrantless arrest, they need to justify and document the specific information justifying that warrantless arrest,"" Fleming said during a Wednesday news conference.

ABC7 Chief Legal Analyst Gil Soffer says the government is likely to appeal the ruling.

""We'll see if it changes operations on the ground. [ Cummings ] is certainly sending a shot across the bow,"" Soffer said. ""If it's going to be abided by... that's going to slow things down and really impose rigor around the process.""

The order requires all immigration officers who violated the consent decree to be retrained, and for DHS to share with the court the ""names, A-numbers, and arrest documents for all individuals arrested without warrants since June in the Northern District of Illinois, and to provide that same reporting monthly going forward,"" the NIJC said.

During a Wednesday news conference on the order, immigrant advocates were intensely emotional over the ruling win.

Fighting back tears, Xanat Sobrevilla with Organized Communities Against Deportation said the ruling has raised spirits.

""To our Black and Brown people and immigrants, it does not always seem like this Earth wants us,"" Sobrevilla said. ""But we want us, and that can be enough.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17967178_100825-wls-rivera-iteam-ice-arrests-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-09 00:56:46.474962

Hegseth issued a memo over the weekend federalizing hundreds of Texas National Guard troops for deployment in Chicago over the repeated objections of Illinois Gov.
Hundreds of Illinois Guard troops were also called up in Hegseth’s memo.","A three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday unanimously lifted a lower court order that blocked President Donald Trump’s attempt to federalize 200 Oregon National Guard troops for deployment in Portland.

For now, the Ninth Circuit’s decision to lift U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut’s order from over the weekend is unlikely to allow the Trump administration to deploy soldiers to Portland.

Immergut issued a second order earlier this week flatly barring the government from sending federalized Guard troops to the state.

In its four-page order, the panel noted that since the Trump administration did not appeal Immergut’s second order, it remains in effect.

“Thus, the effect of granting an administrative stay preserves the status quo in which National Guard members have been federalized but not deployed,” the panel wrote. “Defendants have not appealed or challenged the second temporary restraining order, and it is not before us.”

The panel was composed of two judges appointed by Trump and a third appointed by former President Bill Clinton.

The panel is set to hear formal arguments Thursday on the Trump administration’s appeal of Immergut’s first order. The hearing could include arguments against Immergut’s second ruling if the Trump administration appeals that, too.

Late last month, Trump claimed to deploy troops to Portland, asserting that “domestic terrorists” had an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in the “War ravaged” city “under siege.” He also authorized troops to use “Full Force, if necessary.”

Local and state law enforcement officials through court declarations refuted Trump’s account of conditions in Portland.

In response to Trump’s social media posts, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a memo federalizing the Oregon Guard for at least 60 days to protect federal personnel and property in Portland.

The state quickly sued, arguing that Trump’s assertions were false and that the federalization undermined its sovereignty.

In her first order, Immergut, who Trump appointed in his first term, found that Trump did not have the authority to call up Oregon troops based on false claims.

The Trump administration responded to Immergut’s initial order by redirecting California Guard troops who were federalized earlier this year to Portland. California joined Oregon’s lawsuit and both states asked Immergut for a second order halting outside troops being deployed to Oregon.

The judge granted the second order and warned Department of Justice attorneys that the government’s attempt to use California troops in Oregon was “in direct contravention” of her earlier decision.

Immergut’s second order headed off the severe state sovereignty issues stemming from the president using one state’s militia against a nonconsenting state, but it was only temporary.

Hegseth issued a memo over the weekend federalizing hundreds of Texas National Guard troops for deployment in Chicago over the repeated objections of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D). Hundreds of Illinois Guard troops were also called up in Hegseth’s memo.

Chicago and Illinois filed their own lawsuit, and a federal judge is set to hear arguments Thursday on their request for a temporary injunction halting the Windy City deployment.

That day changed everything. Hernan was on his way to work. He's a roofer. He's typically up before the sun. He was two minutes from our apartment complex when he was stopped by ICE agents in masks and an unmarked vehicle. He called me in a panic. It was 5:27 a.m. I heard shouting, glass shattering.

And then I heard him say: ""Ow, you're hurting me.""

When I arrived on the scene, there were multiple officers there. The ICE agents had smashed his window and had attempted to forcibly remove him from his car. The first thing I was asked when I got there was my cooperation in de-escalating the situation. I pointed out that there was a Taser in his face. They lowered the Taser.

And I went immediately to him to try to reassure him and let him know everything was going to be OK. But, of course, it was not. I remember standing there holding my phone just not understanding how this could have happened. My husband, he's a man with no criminal record. He's married to a U.S. citizen. He's doing everything right.

I was completely at a loss.

William Brangham:

So you have no idea why he was targeted that morning?

Leslie Gonzalez:

I do not. All I know is that he's not the only person in the situation that has no criminal record that is being detained.

William Brangham:

We asked DHS for a statement about his arrest, and they said that your husband — quote — ""refused to comply with officer commands to roll down his window. The officers took appropriate action and followed their training to use the minimum amount to force necessary to resolve the situation.""

Can you give me a response to that? What — they're saying basically that he didn't comply with their instructions.

Leslie Gonzalez:

I can only speak from my perspective. I was on the scene almost immediately, and I heard what was happening as I was on my way there.

I was on the phone with Hernan as he was being detained. He called me immediately. And I remember hearing him plead with the officers: ""Please just wait for my wife. Please just wait for my wife.""

He had rolled down his window enough to be able to give them his identification, his dress license. He told me that they didn't even look at his license. He was asking them to identify themselves because they were masked. They did not have typical police gear on. They were in a gray vehicle with New York license plates, and my husband did not know what was going on.

He did not know why he was being stopped and especially why he had been hit by the other vehicle. When I arrived, I immediately went to his side. He opened the door. He complied with every request that the ICE officers made of him, and he was taken away on a stretcher.

William Brangham:

What do you know about the conditions that he's in?

Leslie Gonzalez:

My husband is being held in Plymouth County. I know that initially he was in a different patio. He said the conditions were terrible. He has since been transferred to another patio, where he sleeps in a cell with four other people.

It is extremely noisy. He's not able to sleep much at night. He is limited in terms of when he can use the bathroom. Hernan is not one to complain in general, but he is also extremely protective of me. I know he is being strong for me. Whenever I speak with him, he tries to keep it light. When I saw him, he was cracking jokes left and right, telling me he had been working out every day, showing me his muscles.

He is an extremely positive person, and he is the light in my life.

William Brangham:

I know that you're in the middle of this big legal fight, but there are still many people, supporters of the administration, who argue that, if you came to the country illegally, that you don't have a right to be here.

And I wonder, even in the midst of this fraught period that you're in, how you would respond to people like that.

Leslie Gonzalez:

I would just ask that they look beyond the paperwork to the person to consider the family.

My husband is not a threat. He is a hard worker. He is a son. He is a future father, I hope. And I'm an attorney myself. I know what accountability looks like. I just don't think that this is what justice looks like. My husband deserves compassion, not cruelty.

William Brangham:

All right, Leslie Gonzalez, wife of Hernan Escobar, thank you so much for talking with us.

Leslie Gonzalez:

Thank you. I very much appreciate you giving Hernan a voice.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/10/detained-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 00:56:51.676641

She was there with her husband, Richard Eckman, a veteran of the Vietnam War. Both are 84.

The two were part of a peaceful crowd that had walked from a park in the Eckmans’ neighborhood to the nearby ICE facility to stand in protest, according to a text message sent by Eckman to her sister, Marjorie Sanders, who posted that message on Facebook.

In it, Eckman said that about an hour after the group began standing in protest, federal officers rushed out “in a phalanx” and knocked people to the ground, including the two of them. She also was hit in the head by a projectile. “Bleeding all over,” she told her sister, sending photos of a wound on her temple and a blood-stained blouse. The officials also sprayed the group with some kind of chemical, and because of the fog it created, she temporarily lost sight of her husband, who uses a walker.

Bystanders, including a medical professional, rushed to their aid, Eckman told Sanders.

According to an interview Eckman gave to OregonLive, after the couple walked home, they were approached by four Portland police officers who expressed their concern for her. They also said they had orders not to verbally engage with federal officers and to stay a block away from the facility.

The couple later went to a local emergency room to have her injuries checked, and while there she was told she had a concussion.

Her text message to her sister ended with these words: “This was so unprovoked. SO UNPROVOKED.”

Eckman told OregonLive that the couple had stayed away from previous protests at the ICE facility, which they knew from walking their dog past it every day. But they decided to join this one because the group “looked so benign, so peaceful.”

She also said she wanted people to know how unjustified the officers’ actions were. “I never thought federal officers could behave this way. I really didn’t,” she said. “I always thought people must be provoking them or something, that they would never do this unprovoked. Obviously, I was wrong.”

She also said it was important for people to know that people who are protesting in Portland are not Antifa, a term that stands for anti-fascist and is often misapplied to include all protesters against government actions, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

“We’re just regular Portlanders who love our city, and my husband, being a Vietnam veteran, is incensed that we’re talking about war within our own country. This is outrageous, really.”

The TRO is being sought by the Chicago Headline Club, the NABET broadcast union and a number of independent journalists in the wake of a series of reported attacks on protesters and the media by agents firing tear gas and pepper balls. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump are among those named in the filing.

One reporter claims her car was targeted with a chemical agent while she was simply sitting outside the ICE processing center in Broadview. A spokesperson for ICE denies that any journalist was ever targeted outside that facility.

On Wednesday, Judge Sara Ellis said sufficient evidence exists to suggest that protesters and the press are ""at risk of injury"" because government agents had acted indiscriminately in the past. Judge Ellis said First Amendment behavior appeared to be a ""motivating factor"" in the defendants' behavior.

""The loss of First Amendment freedoms, even for a limited time, represents irreparable injury,"" Ellis told a packed courtroom.

""It is hard to imagine how an injunction that requires the defendant to adhere to the Constitution could be harmful,"" she said.

Ellis indicated that she plans to grant the TRO but that numerous details and language remain to be hammered out between the parties. That language would govern ICE and CBP behavior in specific situations, including when people are ""actively resisting"" and ""assaultively resisting.""

The order would allow agents to order protesters and the media to disperse from certain locations after they are given sufficient warning and that journalists are give ""objectively reasonable"" time to observe and report.

The judge rejected a government request that the order only apply to an area within 500 feet of the Broadview ICE building.

""These issues are not limited to Broadview,"" she said. ""I am not going to limit this TRO to Broadview.""

Judge Ellis also said the order would not extend to Trump, who is named in the filing. She said she had no power to set limits on the president's behavior.

The Trump administration has asserted that drug traffickers are armed combatants threatening the United States, creating justification to use military force.
Wednesday’s vote was brought under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was intended to reassert congressional power over the declaration of war.
However, Republican leaders stridently argued against the resolution on the Senate floor Wednesday, calling it a political ploy from Democrats.
“Fortunately most of those drugs are now at the bottom of the ocean.” Risch thanked Trump for his actions and added that he hoped the military strikes would continue.","Senate Republicans voted down legislation Wednesday that would have put a check on Donald Trump’s ability to use deadly military force against drug cartels after Democrats tried to counter the administration’s extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers to destroy vessels in the Caribbean.

The vote fell mostly along party lines, 48-51, with two Republicans, Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, voting in favor and the Democrat John Fetterman voting against.

It was the first vote in Congress on Trump’s military campaign, which according to the White House has so far destroyed four vessels, killed at least 21 people and stopped narcotics from reaching the US. The war powers resolution would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes on the cartels.

The Trump administration has asserted that drug traffickers are armed combatants threatening the United States, creating justification to use military force. But that assertion has been met with some unease on Capitol Hill.

Some Republicans are asking the White House for more clarification on its legal justification and specifics on how the strikes are conducted, while Democrats insist they are violations of US and international law. It’s a clash that could redefine how the world’s most powerful military uses lethal force and set the tone for future global conflict.

The White House had indicated Trump would veto the legislation, and even though the Senate vote failed, it gave lawmakers an opportunity to go on the record with their objections to Trump’s declaration that the US is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels.

“It sends a message when a significant number of legislators say: ‘Hey, this is a bad idea,’” said the senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who pushed the resolution alongside Adam Schiff, a Democrat of California.

Wednesday’s vote was brought under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was intended to reassert congressional power over the declaration of war.

“Congress must not allow the executive branch to become judge, jury and executioner,” Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has long pushed for greater congressional oversight of war powers, said during a floor speech.

Paul was the only Republican to publicly speak in favor of the resolution before the vote, but a number of Republican senators have questioned the strikes on vessels and said they are not receiving enough information from the administration.

The senator Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, acknowledged “there may be some concern” in the Republican conference about the strikes. However, Republican leaders stridently argued against the resolution on the Senate floor Wednesday, calling it a political ploy from Democrats.

“People were attacking our country by bringing in poisonous substances to deposit into our country that would have killed Americans,” said the senator Jim Risch, the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee. “Fortunately most of those drugs are now at the bottom of the ocean.”

Risch thanked Trump for his actions and added that he hoped the military strikes would continue.

Members of the Senate armed services committee received a classified briefing last week on the strikes, and Cramer said he was “comfortable with at least the plausibility of their legal argument”. But, he added, no one representing intelligence agencies or the military command structure for Central and South America was present for the briefing.

“I’d be more comfortable defending the administration if they shared the information,” he said.

Kaine also said the briefing did not include any information on why the military chose to destroy the vessels rather than interdict them or get into the specifics of how the military was so confident the vessels were carrying drugs.

“Maybe they were engaged in human trafficking, or maybe it was the wrong ship,” Schiff said. “We just have little or no information about who was onboard these ships or what intelligence was used or what the rationale was and how certain we could be that everyone on that ship deserved to die.”

The Democrats also said the administration has told them it is adding cartels to a list of organizations deemed “narco-terrorists” that are targets for military strikes, but it has not shown the lawmakers a complete list.

“The slow erosion of congressional oversight is not an abstract debate about process,” the senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate armed services committee, said in a floor speech. “It is a real and present threat to our democracy.”

The secretary of state Marco Rubio visited the Republican conference for lunch Wednesday to emphasize to senators that they should vote against the legislation. He told the senators that the administration was treating cartels like governmental entities because they had seized control of large portions of some Caribbean nations, according to the senator John Hoeven of North Dakota.

Rubio told reporters at the Capitol: “These drug-trafficking organizations are a direct threat to the safety and security of the United States to unleash violence and criminality on our streets, fueled by the drugs and the drug profits that they make. … And the president, as the commander in chief, has an obligation to keep our country safe.”

Still, Democrats said the recent buildup of US maritime forces in the Caribbean was a sign of shifting US priorities and tactics that could have grave repercussions. They worried that further military strikes could set off a conflict with Venezuela and argued that Congress should be actively deliberating whenever American troops are sent to war.

Schiff said, “This is the kind of thing that leads a country, unexpectedly and unintentionally, into war.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29826de71a1fb02d9155f427faeedcb10f739382/268_0_2350_1880/master/2350.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7cdf939d55a029fbd5eb381f445b7ba0",N,,2025-10-08 23:56:21.887622

“In this appeal, the President of the United States and various federal agency officials, as well as their agencies (collectively, the Government), challenge a preliminary injunction that the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire issued on February 10, 2025. The injunction bars enforcement of Executive Order No. 14160, titled ‘Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship’ (the EO). The EO announces as its ‘purpose’ the denial of United States citizenship to children born here whose fathers are neither a United States citizen nor a lawful permanent resident alien and whose mothers are, at the time of birth, in this country either unlawfully or lawfully but only temporarily. …

“The Government does not challenge the District Court’s cause-of-action ruling or the Article III standing of the plaintiffs. Although the District Court did not address Article III standing, we have an independent obligation to make sure that the plaintiffs have met their requisite burden at this stage of the litigation to show such standing exists. Roe v. Healey, 78 F.4th 11, 21 n.8 (1st Cir. 2023). We see no basis for concluding that any of the plaintiffs have failed to do so. …

“The question of Article III standing aside, we also see no basis for concluding that the District Court erred in determining that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims based on [8 U.S.C.] §1401 and the Citizenship Clause. …

“That leaves only the issues concerning the scope of the preliminary injunction that the Government raises. The Government points out that the injunction runs against the President directly. Enjoining the President raises significant and distinct issues, … and the District Court did not address them or explain why it was necessary for the injunction to run against him, insofar as it also runs against the agency officials. We thus conclude that it was an abuse of discretion to enjoin this defendant and vacate the injunction in that respect. We note, too, as we did in Doe regarding the injunctions at issue there, that the injunction runs against the agencies themselves, even though the underlying cause of action is an equitable action for injunctive relief against agency officials. … We thus also conclude that the injunction must be limited to apply only to agency officials. …

But on Wednesday Pope Leo made some of his strongest comments yet, urging U.S. bishops to strongly support immigrants as President Trump escalated his deportation campaign, including in Chicago, the pope’s hometown.

With National Guard troops expected to arrive in Chicago, Pope Leo met with a group of Catholics from El Paso. The group gave the pope more than 100 handwritten letters, written by immigrants — mostly undocumented individuals but also mixed families — living in Catholic communities across the United States.

The letters were tied together with twine and included a small yellow note that read, in Spanish, “Pope Leo, please listen to the clamor of those who are being marginalized.”

Pope Leo did not specifically mention Mr. Trump, Bishop Seitz said, or Chicago. But the crisis unfolding in the church in America — where a third of the church is Hispanic and families have told priests they are uneasy about going to Mass for fear of being apprehended by officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — was the obvious backdrop.

The group and the pope discussed the challenge of wanting to avoid the political fray while still speaking boldly for their beliefs, and how to translate that to action, Bishop Seitz said.

“To have the United States changing so radically is something that calls for attention,” he said.

Pope Leo said “that he would love to see a statement from the conference of bishops,” Bishop Seitz said, adding that one was already in progress. The bishops are scheduled to meet in Baltimore next month for their annual conference, where the issue is expected to be a central focus.

Pope Leo told the group it was critical that the church speak “forcefully and in unity” about these issues, said Dylan Corbett, the founding executive director of the Hope Border Institute, who attended the meeting with the pope.

The Trump administration has said its tactics on immigration are necessary to protect public safety because some illegal immigrants are violent criminals. Some conservative Catholics support the president’s position despite church teaching on immigration, similar to how some progressive Catholics support abortion rights, which also contradicts church teaching.

Vice President JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism six years ago, said in an interview shortly after Pope Leo’s election that immigration “at the levels and at the pace that we’ve seen over the last few years” has destroyed “social solidarity.”

“That’s not because I hate the migrants or I’m motivated by grievance,” he said. “That’s because I’m trying to preserve something in my own country where we are a unified nation.”

The meeting at the Vatican on Wednesday had been requested to present to the pope “the pain and the anxiety that’s felt by the immigrant community in the United States right now,” said Mr. Corbett, whose group does research and advocacy on social justice issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The pope agreed to watch a four-minute video with the delegation. Titled “Letter to Pope Leo XIV and the Catholic Church in the United States,” it highlighted the concerns, as well as the resilience, of the nation’s immigrant communities, Mr. Corbett said. They all huddled around the screen and watched together.

The El Paso delegation also included the Auxiliary Bishop Anthony C. Celino; Msgr. Arturo Bañuelas; and Lorena Andrade, a civil rights and labor activist.

Catholic bishops in the United States have worked for months to rally opposition to Mr. Trump’s mass deportation efforts, protesting bills in Congress, supporting migrants at immigration courts and condemning ICE raids and arrests.

Archbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, is expected to meet with Pope Leo in the coming days for an annual meeting about the state of church in America.

Pope Leo has so far adopted a more reserved political tone than his predecessor, Pope Francis, who frequently criticized Mr. Trump’s positions, even suggesting that Mr. Trump was “not Christian” for his promise to deport immigrants and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.

But Pope Leo has also consistently made his support for migrants clear. In May, his brother John Prevost said that Leo was “not happy with what’s going on with immigration. I know that for a fact.”

Last weekend, Pope Leo celebrated a special Holy Year Mass for migrants, in which he called on people to welcome and care for migrants fleeing from poverty, violence and suffering. They “cannot and must not find the coldness of indifference or the stigma of discrimination,” Pope Leo said.

Last week, he wrote to the Catholic Charities USA network, thanking them for being “agents of hope” for the “most vulnerable, including migrants and refugees.”

He also commented after some conservative bishops in the United States vehemently protested the decision by Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago to give Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, an award for his commitment to immigration reform. They objected because Mr. Durbin also supported abortion rights.

Pope Leo weighed in from the papal residence at Castel Gandolfo, noting the complexity.

“Someone who says, ‘I’m against abortion but says I’m in favor of the death penalty’ is not really pro-life. So someone who says that ‘I’m against abortion, but I’m in agreement with the inhumane treatment of immigrants who are in the United States,’ I don’t know if that’s pro-life,” he said.

He asked “that we search together — both as human beings, in that case as American citizens or citizens of the state of Illinois, as well as Catholics — to say we need to really look closely at all of these ethical issues and to find the way forward as church. The church teaching on each one of those issues is very clear.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08NAT-POPE-IMMIGRATION-sub-cpmb/08NAT-POPE-IMMIGRATION-sub-cpmb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 20:57:22.858472

The new legislation requires counties to participate with ICE by assigning certain federal immigration functions to local and state officers.

The legislation banned sanctuary policies and empowered local law enforcement to inquire about immigration status of inmates in lawful detention.
The study also argues that local law enforcement agencies are given the pretense of legal authority to engage in immigration enforcement that, in practice, leans into bias.","Although Central Texas has not been subjected to the numbers of immigration raids and sweeps by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that have been seen along the border with Mexico, or the National Guard deployments to support ICE operations in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Texas leads the nation in arrests this year.

The Texas Tribune reported in mid-September that Texas Department of Public Safety officers have helped arrest more than 3,000 undocumented immigrants across the state this year at the direction of Governor Greg Abbott. “Among them was a Honduran man in Austin who was riding in the passenger seat of a car stopped for an expired registration after DPS apparently staked out his home,” the story stated. In addition, authorities raided a party in Hays County and arrested almost four dozen people, including children.

According to a CBS analysis in July, of the 109,000 arrests over the previous five months, nearly one-quarter occurred in Texas. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a data gathering, research and distribution organization based at Syracuse University, lists the number of detainees in Texas in 2025 at 13,415 through September 15th, which is almost twice as many as Louisiana and nearly four times as many as California. TLAC data also notes that 70.3 percent of those detainees had no criminal convictions; instead their offenses were minor infractions such as traffic violations.

Law enforcement officials in Travis County have been vocal and public about their positions. While Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez has stated she does not favor turning over undocumented detainees to federal agents, Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis went a step further stating in an interview with KUT in late-January, “It is not the function of the local police department, and my function is to keep Austin safe. So that, to me, means it’s a sanctuary city.” In a separate interview, Hernandez told KUT that an increased presence of ICE enforcement makes her job more difficult, as people pull back from police and emergency services. “We want victims to run to our agency in a crisis, not run away.”

New law requires sheriffs to aid ICE

On June 20th, Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) into law. The new legislation requires counties to participate with ICE by assigning certain federal immigration functions to local and state officers. Specifically, it requires sheriffs in 43 counties with populations of more than 100,000 to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE. This refers to a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that allows the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate formal agreements between ICE and state and local law enforcement agencies. The federal government provides funding to train and authorize local officers to perform immigration enforcement functions—essentially deputizing them as ICE agents.

Supporters of SB 8 described it as a “safety bill” that makes it easier to locate criminals already incarcerated and hand them over to ICE. State Representative David Spiller (R-Jacksboro) was not subtle when describing the target of the legislation to CBS: “There has been an unprecedented number of illegal aliens that have come across that either are convicted felons, rapists, murderers, child molesters, terrorists, that have come into our community and they are among us.”

In terms of what types of participation will be required by SB 8, counties must select one of three choices attached to the 287(g) agreements:

Warrant Service Officer—This gives local law enforcement the authority to serve and execute administrative warrants to undocumented inmates in their agency’s jail and then hold the individuals until ICE can detain and process them. As of March 20th, 35 counties and one city police department in Texas already had warrant service agreements with ICE.

Jail Enforcement Model—This deputizes jail officers to screen for immigration status, issue immigration detainers, and start removal paperwork before ICE picks up the inmates.

Task Force Officer—Deputized officers can enforce immigration law in field situations such as traffic stops and “community patrols.” This model has been largely phased out due to criticisms that, when previously implemented, it led to racial profiling. Still, it remains an option within the 287(g) agreements.

SB8 a response to earlier efforts?

SB 4 passed in 2017, forcing local jurisdictions to assist in federal immigration enforcement while overriding local discretion. The legislation banned sanctuary policies and empowered local law enforcement to inquire about immigration status of inmates in lawful detention.

Both the City of Austin and Travis County resisted SB 4, even joining a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the bill. Just days before the law was set to go into effect, U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia, based in San Antonio, granted a preliminary injunction. His order stated that the requirement for jail officials to honor all ICE detainers violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures.

“If during a lawful detention or arrest an officer obtains information that a detained or arrested individual is undocumented, he may not arrest that individual on this basis,” Judge Garcia wrote in a 94-page ruling. “SB 4 gives local officers discretion to inquire and share information, but it does not provide them with discretion to act upon the information they may obtain.”

SB 8 removes discretion by mandating federal partnerships and deputizes officers to begin processing the inmates. It’s unclear whether this new law could see similar legal challenges.

“The way they were doing it in SB 4 clearly violated longstanding constitutional precedent by allowing the state police to essentially deport immigrants without going through any type of federal process or judicial process,” said Luis Figueroa, senior director of legislative affairs at the advocacy organization Every Texan. He testified against SB 8 during legislative hearings. “SB 8 certainly has problems and undermines community trust but, in my opinion, the ways they’re doing it are very different. SB 4 was much more problematic from a constitutional prospective.”

Figueroa was initially supportive of SB 8 when the Warrant Service Officer model was the only 287(g) mandate, targeting immigrants already in jail to turn them over to ICE. He believed having the warrant service model as the sole mandate was a reasonable compromise and, essentially, already in practice in the jails. “It’s a common sense approach to just say, yeah we can have somebody trained that is designated as the liaison to ICE at the local jail,” he said.

Figueroa claims that, although the Senate version of the bill included all three models in the mandate, many Republicans in the House were supportive of only mandating the warrant service model.

On May 30th, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that SB 8 should be passed “as written” in the Senate and that he was “watching closely.” Figueroa says this led to the House eventually adopting the Senate language.

Representative Spiller dismisses this characterization, stating that the actual language of the bill never changed. Even though he and other Republicans did see the Warrant Service Model as easiest to operate and the least expensive, Spiller emphasizes that sheriffs’ offices still only have to choose one of the three models. “I was encouraging and stressing the warrant service model program,” he said. “But, even under our bill, you could choose any of the three and be in complete compliance.”

Currently, when inmates enter the Travis County jail they are processed and their fingerprints are taken. Those prints are sent to ICE and if the individuals do not have legal status, ICE issues detainers to hold them in the jail. If ICE does not pick up the inmates within 48 hours, they are released. In late August The Austin Bulldog filed a public information request to get copies of ICE detainer forms received by the Travis County Sheriff’s Office. Travis County declined to provide those documents and instead filed a request for an attorney general’s ruling, which is still pending.

“Some of these larger counties want to turn a blind eye and ignore and treat these folks as though they’re not here illegally, and just release them out onto the street,” Spiller said. “What SB 8 does is prevent that from happening.”

Although Sheriff Hernandez has not publically made a decision about which model will be enforced in Travis County, she believes the Warrant Service Officer model would not require as many officers and would have “less impact on our community.”

Regarding cost, a preliminary evaluation by the Sheriff’s Office provides estimates for the Jail Service and Task Force models only. Staffing alone for the Jail Service model could reach $1.3 million for the first year (2026) and $1.2 million in ongoing annual salary expenses. Training is also involved for this model, and is not included in those numbers. The Task Force model would be, by far, the most costly with estimates of $4.2 million for personnel and $5.5 million for equipment including uniforms, computers, vehicles, and a body camera system. Training costs are also not included for this model.

Hays County Sheriff Anthony Hipolito has yet to enter into a 287(g) agreement. Williamson County has been using the Jail Enforcement Model since 2020, with the former Sheriff Robert Chody stating that the program “cuts out the middle man.” Current Williamson County Sheriff Matthew Lindemann has not commented publically on his office’s continuing collaboration with ICE.

Sheriff Hernandez sees SB 8 as a continuation of SB 4 and laments how the legislation could distract her office from other priories and stretch the budget thin. “They’re wanting to get county sheriff’s offices, to force us to help them with their mission,” she said, “whether we have resources or not.”

ICE cooperation costs reimbursed

An ICE fact sheet lists the benefits to counties that participate in a 287(g) agreement as “Enhanced public safety, free training, and possible eligibility for federal payments through a DOJ program.” Another page states: “ICE bears the cost of 287(g) training for law enforcement agencies.”

Additionally, the Department of Justice will reimburse counties for correctional officer salaries incurred while incarcerating undocumented inmates through a program known as the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Administered through the Bureau of Justice Assistance, Texas has historically been one of the largest recipients of this funding because of its high population of inmates without legal status. In 2024, Travis County received $273,127 in SCAAP funding while the Texas Department of Criminal Justice took in more than $11 million.

SB 8 also provides for $20 million in grants to counties with populations of fewer than 1 million, to be administered by the Texas Comptroller’s Office. Grants will range from $80,000 to $140,000, depending on the size of the county. These grants are meant to cover costs over a two-year period that aren’t paid for by the federal government, such as officer salaries and overtime, travel and lodging during training, and other administrative costs. The grant money may also be needed to cover legal costs for lawsuits covering cases such as wrongful detainment and for violations of jail standards.

Harris County already tried this

In 2008, then-Harris County Sheriff Tommy Thomas entered into a 287(g) agreement, which was carried over by the succeeding sheriffs through 2016. Over the course of that time, Harris County paid out $675,000 per year in salaries for 10 deputies and 7 detention officers and faced challenges such as overcrowding in the jail, staffing shortages, and further financial strain due to overtime pay costs of $2 million per month.

By 2017, newly elected Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez made good on a campaign promise by ending the agreement with ICE. In addition to the costs, Sheriff Gonzalez cited the need to allocate resources to other aspects of policing such as investigating violent crimes, increasing overall patrol presence around the city, and tackling a backlog in investigations. In step with Travis County Sheriff Hernandez’s concerns, Gonzalez hoped the move would help restore trust with immigrant communities.

Although Sheriff Gonzalez declined to be interviewed, Harris County Senior Policy and Communications Advisor Jason Spencer issued this statement: “When Sheriff Gonzalez withdrew from the 287(g) program, he granted ICE access to the jail to perform that agency’s federal immigration law enforcement duties directly, which they have been doing ever since. Regarding SB 8, it is our intent to comply with the law.”

Around the state

More than 70 counties in Texas have already entered into 287(g) agreements with ICE, most of which have chosen the Jail Enforcement Model. While it seems the vast majority of counties will not be using the Task Force Model for their compliance, at least four counties (Caldwell, Goliad, Jefferson, and Smith) have used that option as part of their enforcement approach. This represents a combined population of more than a half-million people.

With such an influx of inmates, there have been concerns that overcrowding in jails could lead to poor conditions within those facilities and result in lawsuits. In February, Bexar County exceeded its jail capacity, with more 2,900 inmates awaiting indictment. Eventually, the inmates were housed in neighboring counties at a monthly cost of $300,000. In February, the overall population of prisoners in Texas was 2.5-percent higher than at the same time the previous year and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice has projected a 10.2-percent increase in the incarceration population over the next five years.

“I mean, we’re trying to handle our own issues here in Travis County,” said Commissioner Margaret Gomez. “Every time that the jail population grows, the cost for it grows, so the taxpayers have to handle that.” Gomez also warned that a shift in priorities toward ICE detainment could force the county to take a more lax approach toward punishment for other inmates to free up space in the jail, “making the community more dangerous.”

Austin attorney Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch runs a virtual immigration law firm and just celebrated her 10-year anniversary. Lincoln-Goldfinch, who is Mayor Kirk Watson’s appointee to the City’s Commission on Immigrant Affairs, says that before President Trump began increasing ICE activities in Texas, she would have maybe one client a month detained after a criminal incident. Now, that caseload has risen to around 10 per month. She added that, formerly, most of her clients were detained after criminal events. Now, they are being picked up without any charges.

Florida litigation

In late April, ICE pulled off the largest single-state immigration enforcement sweep in the department’s history. Operation Tidal Wave used 287(g) agreements with all 67 counties in Florida and is described on ICE’s website as “a first-of-its-kind statewide operation that netted 1,120 criminal illegal alien arrests.” Governor Ron DeSantis used warrior language by describing the push as the “tip of the spear.”

In April a coalition of civil rights organizations sued over Florida Senate Bill 4-C, arguing several concerns such as the lack of due process, civil rights violations, and the fact that immigration is described in the constitution as a federal responsibility. In July, a federal district court blocked enforcement of the bill and the Supreme Court declined to lift the injunction. The law currently remains unenforceable.

“After this law (Texas SB 8) comes online and after counties become compliant with it, we could see Texas unleash its own form of Operation Tidal Wave, where the state is working with local law enforcement to pop up operations in different parts of the state and arrest vast numbers of people,” said Roberto Lopez, a senior advocacy manager in the Beyond Borders program at the Texas Civil Rights Project.

Although SB 8 doesn’t create any new state crimes tied to immigration status—as Florida attempted to do—the legislation is still very likely to face lawsuits based on the separation of enforcement powers between state and federal authorities and the unfunded mandate that counties must provide training and additional space in jail facilities. Civil rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have already signaled their opposition and have outlined plans to challenge the law based on federal anti-commandeering statutes and coercion. Congress allowed for, but didn’t require, local participation with the 287(g) program. Civil rights groups could argue that SB 8 upsets that voluntary structure by making those agreements mandatory, thereby setting up a supremacy clause conflict and interfering with the intended permissiveness of the federal program.

“SB 8 will not make our communities safer, but it will force sheriffs to do the work of ICE in support of the federal government’s shameful mass deportation efforts,” said Sarah Cruz, ACLU policy and advocacy strategist. “The legislature should not strip local communities of their ability to make decisions about what keeps them safe.”

Sheriff Hernandez also didn’t rule out potentially joining litigation, saying “That would all depend on impacts.”

Racial profiling, civil rights

In April 2022, the ACLU released a report, “License to Abuse: How ICE’s 287(g) Program Empowers Racist Sheriffs and Civil Rights Violations,” a 63-page review of 142 participating law enforcement agencies. The report concluded that 287(g) agreements enabled or exacerbated racial profiling, civil rights abuses, and discriminatory enforcement by sheriffs and local agencies. The study also argues that local law enforcement agencies are given the pretense of legal authority to engage in immigration enforcement that, in practice, leans into bias.

Although Representative Spiller admits that the Trump administration is “actively trying to locate people” who have detainers or arrest warrants, he dismisses concerns over civil rights violations saying they are “just not happening.”

“As far as a law enforcement officer just stopping someone on the street, just hauling people in because of your skin color, that’s not happening,” he said.

The ACLU study completely contradicts Spiller’s assessment, providing examples around the country where individuals were targeted for their skin color or perceived ethnicity. Under Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona, federal courts determined that deputies “systematically targeted Latino drivers for traffic stops and prolonged detentions based solely on their appearance or Spanish accents, not on evidence of criminal activity.” Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt of court in July 2017 and was pardoned by President Trump in August 2017. Sheriff Terry Johnson in Alamance County, North Carolina, was investigated by the Department of Justice for instructing his deputies to “go out there and get me some Mexicans,” while avoiding white neighborhoods. Johnson is seeking his seventh term in 2026.

In Corpus Christi in 2019, Nueces County entered a 287(g) jail enforcement model agreement, with local media reporting described fears and allegations that deputies conducted “sweeps” in Latino neighborhoods, worrying the community that the program increased the risk of racial profiling. In Montgomery County Texas in 2020, The Courier covered a $2 million lawsuit alleging that deputies engaged in discriminatory policing practices that led to the prosecution of innocent people. Although the latter case is not related directly to immigration policy, it highlights a pattern of overreach by law enforcement and indicates that empowerment and bias lead to racial discrimination.

Forcing sheriffs to aid ICE could bring even more expenses to taxpayers, said the Texas Civil Rights Project’s Lopez, as there are always costs associated with lawsuits for racial profiling. Although reimbursements from the federal government could cover some of those expenses, it’s not clear at this point whether that will be enough.

“When an officer who is only lightly trained in immigration sticks someone in jail for a while and there’s a civil lawsuit as a result of that,” Lopez said, “it’s just more expenditures to the county. There are going to be a lot of costs that come from this law that aren’t baked into it.”

What’s next for Texas

As the Trump administration and Governor Abbott continue to step up ICE raids and incursions within immigrant communities, the 287(g) agreements will continue to play more of a role in terms of local law enforcement collaboration with federal agencies. Although some sheriffs may complain about losing trust and feeling hamstrung by mandated actions, they will be forced to comply by threat of Attorney General Ken Paxton, who could issue fines, seek injunctions through a lawsuit or, potentially remove the sheriff from office. In March, Paxton, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by John Cornyn, opened an investigation into the City of Dallas, accusing its police department of refusing to assist ICE and alleging “sanctuary city” policies.

Interim Dallas Police Chief Michael Igo stated during a meeting with members of the community that his department “is not assisting any federal agency on detaining people that are either documented or undocumented in the city of Dallas.” In April, Igo resigned after 33 years in law enforcement. Although he was one of five candidates for the position of the new chief, the city chose Daniel Comeaux—a former Houston Police Officer and special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration.

“The law is not optional,” Paxton said in a public statement. “My office will take all necessary legal actions to ensure compliance with state law and hold accountable any local entity that defies its legal obligations.”

And what happens when those obligations change? The models that sheriffs must choose from are set by ICE and the Trump Administration, and could change at any time. That instability could further complicate the effectiveness and legacy of SB 8, as Texas law enforcement participation would still be at the whim of the federal process.

”That seemed to get missed a little bit in the political debate,” said the Texas Civil Rights Project’s Lopez, adding that he is hopeful local law enforcement won’t be forced to act fully as ICE agents in the streets. “There is always that fear that one day they could change up the models and force sheriffs to enter into the worst form.”

“There’s no stopgap. There’s still a requirement that they have to join one of these models,” Every Texan’s Figueroa said. “The models go away or there’s less models, and maybe there’d be some litigation involved in that but it’s unclear at this moment.”

Attorney Lincoln-Goldfinch believes it could be the legislation itself that has kept Central Texas out of the Trump Administration’s crosshairs. ” No one can be a sanctuary under a law like this and so, to the extent that the administration is setting their sites on the sanctuary places then they’re going to leave Texas alone,” she said. “But, it doesn’t really matter because all the police are enforcing the laws so, at the end of the day, you’ll probably have more enforcement than you would anyway.

As bipartisan frustration with the strikes mounts, the Senate was voting Wednesday on a war powers resolution that would require the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes on the cartels.

The military has carried out at least four strikes on boats that the White House said were carrying drugs, including three it said originated from Venezuela. It said 21 people were killed in the strikes.

The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly about the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the administration has only pointed to unclassified video clips of the strikes posted on social media by President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and has yet to produce “hard evidence"" that the vessels were carrying drugs.

The administration has not explained why it has blown up vessels in some cases, while carrying out the typical practice of stopping boats and seizing drugs at other times, one of the officials said.

The Republican administration in a retroactive memo justifying one of the strikes last month declared drug cartels to be “unlawful combatants” and said the United States is now in an “armed conflict” with them.

The declaration has raised stark questions about how Trump intends to use his war powers. It also has been perceived by several senators as pursuing a new legal framework to carry out lethal action and has raised questions about the role of Congress in authorizing any such action.

Trump Administration Points to Videos as Proof

Asked about the lack of underlying evidence provided to Congress, the Pentagon on Wednesday pointed to videos of the strikes, which do not confirm the presence of drugs.

The Pentagon also noted public statements by Hegseth, including a social media post following the latest fatal strike in which he said, “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”

Lawmakers have expressed frustration that the administration is offering little detail about how it came to decide the U.S. is in armed conflict with cartels or even detailing which criminal organizations it claims as “unlawful combatants.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi was pressed at a Senate hearing Tuesday about what advice she's provided Trump to legally justify the strikes. She said, “I’m not going to discuss any legal advice that my department may or may not have given or issued at the direction of the president.""

A White House official suggested that lawmakers were being disingenuous with their criticism and that the Trump administration has been “much more forthcoming” with the legal rationale than Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration was when it carried out strikes targeting militants in the Middle East.

The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Pentagon officials have held six separate classified briefings to Congress on the operations.

Trump administration officials have argued that the strikes are necessary acts of self-defense as cartels funnel drugs into the United States that they say are leading to thousands of U.S. deaths. While Venezuela produces cocaine, the bulk of it is sent to Europe.

A Few in the Administration Are Said to Be Driving the Push for Strikes

Trump has largely bypassed traditional interagency processes in formulating his strategy to carry out strikes against drug cartels, according to the U.S. officials and a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.

A small group of top administration officials — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Trump aide Stephen Miller — has driven the push to carry out the fatal strikes, officials said.

Rubio, dating back to his days in the Senate, has advocated for taking a harder line on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted on U.S. federal drug charges, including narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. This year, the Justice Department doubled a reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million, accusing him of being “one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.""

Trump has focused attention on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which he claims is serving as “front” for Maduro, and said members of the gang were in the first boat targeted last month. No details on alleged affiliations have been released in the three other strikes.

Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term in January despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro’s claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, won by more than a two-to-one margin.

A Pause in Diplomacy

Early in his term, however, Trump dispatched special envoy Richard Grenell to Caracas to meet with Maduro. Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were freed by Maduro's government during Grenell's visit.

But diplomatic efforts with Caracas have been largely paused in recent months, with Grenell mostly sidelined, said the person familiar with the matter and a congressional aide, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Maduro says the boat strikes are an attempt to undercut his authority and try to foment unrest that would lead to his ouster from power.

The State Department pushed back against the notion that the administration had been involved in anything other than an operation targeting drug traffickers.

“Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela; he’s a fugitive of American justice who undermines regional security and poisons Americans and we want to see him brought to justice,"" said Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman. ""The U.S. is engaged in a counter-drug cartel operation and any claim that we are coordinating with anyone on anything other than this targeted effort is completely false.”

Federal officers are firing so much tear gas at protesters outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, that some nearby community members who aren’t even protesting are struggling to breathe when they leave their homes to run errands.

That’s according to a lawsuit filed this week by journalists and demonstrators who accuse the Department of Homeland Security of using “extreme brutality” to “intimidate and silence” them while they protest or report on protests outside the facility, about 12 miles west of downtown Chicago.

“Snipers with guns loaded with pepper balls, paintballs, and rubber bullets are stationed on the roof of the Broadview ICE facility with their weapons trained on the press and civilians,” the lawsuit states. “Federal agents have tackled and slammed people to the ground; they have lobbed flash grenades and tear gas canisters indiscriminately into the crowd.”

It continues: “No legitimate purpose exists for this brutality or for these arrests. The officers are not physically threatened. No government property is threatened.”

Broadview’s ICE facility is the main processing center for immigrants who are arrested throughout the Chicago area, and protests sprang up over the summer amid reports that it was holding people for longer than allowed in cramped and uncomfortable conditions; some protesters tried to block federal vehicles from driving out of the facility with detained immigrants.

In September, after the Trump administration expanded immigration enforcement in the Chicago area with “Operation Midway Blitz”—an operation that has since led to hundreds of arrests and a militarized overnight raid of an entire apartment building, terrorizing residents—protests intensified. The lawsuit is filled with examples of people who injured by federal officers outside the Broadview facility. Here are a few from last month:

The Reverend David Black, a protester and pastor with the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago, was struck repeatedly by chemical pellets after he extended his arms, palms outstretched, toward ICE officers in a posture of prayer, he said: “It was clear to me that the officers were aiming for my head, which they struck twice.”

Raven Geary, a co-founder of Unraveled Press, a local media outlet covering the protests, was wearing press credentials and a helmet that said “PRESS” while standing in a public parking lot and photographing an ICE officer 30 feet away. The officer shot her in the face with a pepper ball.

Leigh Giancreco, a freelance reporter working for Block Club Chicago, was also shot in the head with pepper balls despite her helmet labeled PRESS and her neon yellow vest.

Stephen Held, another co-founder of Unraveled Press, was “tackled, thrown to the ground, handcuffed, and brought inside the Broadview facility,” according to the lawsuit, after he tried to film officers on a public parkway. He was then released without charges.

Federal officers “are acting to intimidate and silence the press and civilians engaged in protected First Amendment activities,” the plaintiffs argue in the suit. Their attorneys are also seeking a temporary restraining order against officers.

On October 2, Illinois State Police used concrete barriers to demarcate a “First Amendment zone” outside the facility, asking protesters to remain inside the area to avoid violence from officers. Many protesters ignored the zone and protested on the other side of the facility. The next day, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was visiting, commended officers for their “professionalism” and urged them to “hammer” protesters.

“We’re not taking this anymore,” she said. “The president’s sick of it. I’m sick of it. And we’re going to give you guys all the authority that you need to go out there and arrest these individuals who are advocating for violence against you.”

In Broadview, federal immigration officers have also harmed individuals who came to the ICE facility for business, according to the lawsuit:

In late September, officers armed with pepper balls shot a 16-year-old boy who was trying to drop off possessions for his immigrant dad, who was detained inside the building.

Broadview’s own police chief says federal agents “verbally abused” his officers.

“The relentless deployment of tear gas, pepper spray, and mace at the ICE facility is endangering nearby village residents, harming police officers, harming firefighters and American citizens exercising their First Amendment rights,” Mayor Katrina Thompson said in September.

The tear gas has a 200- to 700-foot radius when it’s deployed, but wind carries it farther, the mayor said. The lawsuit cites several Broadview residents who have struggled to breathe because of the noxious fumes, including Jose Juan Alvarado and his wife, who were “sickened and reduced to tears” when they went to the grocery store.

Dimeko Harden, who lives a block from the ICE facility, has been unable to retrieve mail or “engage in normal activities without experiencing pain and difficulty breathing,” the lawsuit adds. “She has been forced to keep her teenage son at home, because he suffers from asthma.”

On Monday, Thompson announced an order limiting protests at the facility from 9 am to 6 pm, citing the “escalation of violence by ICE” and the effect on residents. “People have to go to work, they have to get their children ready for school, our businesses have to serve their customers, and our residents with developmental disabilities, who have sensory issues, have suffered emotional meltdowns because of the chaotic environment when protests get disruptive,” she said.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/8Oct2025teargas2.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-10-08 22:56:40.604868

Almost the first thought I had, in watching videos of federal agents snatching campus protesters and opinion writers, among many others seized somewhat violently on camera this year, was about what looked like a new anonymity protocol. There were agents wearing masks and others without visible name tags or badges, many operating in plain clothes. Why were so many of these agents trying to hide their identities?

“ICE goes masked for a single reason — to terrorize Americans into quiescence,” a federal judge, William Young, wrote in a blistering 161-page First Amendment ruling handed down last week. “In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police,” he continued. The judge, a Reagan appointee, compared immigration agents to “cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan” and declared that federal efforts to deport outspoken protesters amounted to a “full-throated assault” on freedom of speech. “Carrying on in this fashion, ICE brings indelible obloquy to this administration and everyone who works in it.”

Is this a true secret police? The term is darkly tempting, though much of what we’ve observed from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection this year has fallen distressingly within the bounds of our brutally capacious immigration law. The National Guard deployments, too, have unfolded in public view. The terroristic sweep of President Trump’s mass deportation program will be repeatedly litigated in the years to come, in courts of both law and public opinion — U.S. citizens arrested by agents apparently uninterested in their immigration status, agents drawing guns on civilian bystanders. And to the extent that many of those officers and their superiors have been not just enforcing laws and executive orders but also engaging in a kind of conspicuous and public cosplay, the costumes they have chosen are those of the enforcement arm of an authoritarian regime. When the masks came on, the mask came off.

The cosplay is now bleeding into state violence, and even for those used to pointing fingers and calling out authoritarianism, the past week has been a precipitous escalation: Trump speaking of the “enemy from within” as a national defense strategy waiting for approval proposes focusing the military on domestic threats and the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, compares political opposition to terrorism; a military-style raid on a Chicago apartment complex; local police officers hit with tear gas from ICE agents.

The footage continued through the weekend, much of it horrifying. But at least we saw it.

***

Last Friday, the 48-year-old Emmy-winning reporter Mario Guevara was deported to El Salvador from an ICE detention facility in Folkston, Ga. He was held in detention there for over 100 days. The state’s filings concerning his detention seem to largely focus on the crime of committing journalism.

Guevara was arrested in June at a No Kings rally outside Atlanta, where, while filming the protest for his livestreaming platform MG News, he (clearly wearing a press vest and keeping his distance from both protesters and law enforcement) briefly stepped into a roadway. Within days, the charges against him were dropped. But instead of being released, he was transferred to ICE custody. And although an immigration judge granted him bond, finding him neither dangerous nor a flight risk, the government appealed it, arguing that his recording of law enforcement activity itself constituted a danger. And so Guevara — whose work primarily documents immigration enforcement actions, which he often livestreams to hundreds of thousands of followers — was kept in ICE detention. Meanwhile, his immigration case was reopened, and eventually deportation proceedings commenced.

When the Columbia activist and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil was detained in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that Khalil’s participation in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza amounted to a deportable threat to American foreign policy. The administration appeared to offer a similar argument about Rumeysa Ozturk — seemingly confirming that she had been detained for activism, namely by being a writer of a campus opinion piece criticizing her university for its response to Israel’s war in Gaza, and that she should be deported for that speech crime.

Both of those First Amendment cases still hang in a kind of judicial limbo, though Khalil and Ozturk are — for now, at least — free. Guevara is not, having been sent from the country in which he raised a family and built a news organization for years back to the one he left fearing persecution for his reporting in 2004. “It’s a real frontal attack on journalism and freedom of the press,” said Jose Zamora of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “I think it also shows you how all these democratic institutions that take hundreds of years to build can be dismantled in a year.”

The immigration side of Guevara’s case is complicated. Technically, authorities are given broad discretion in deciding deportation cases. By contrast, the detention that enabled those deportation proceedings to begin again is not complicated. “There’s no real crime here. It’s just pretext,” said Adam Rose, the press rights chair of the Los Angeles Press Club and the deputy director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “That was totally in retaliation for his reporting,” said the A.C.L.U’s Scarlet Kim, one of Guevara’s lawyers in his recent proceedings. “The government has made that explicitly clear.”

Over the past six months, federal officials have again and again declared that documenting immigration enforcement activities by ICE agents is, by definition, a form of doxxing, which they describe not only as a form of harassment or even effectively an incitement to violence but also as the equivalent of violence. Such activity, they promised, would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Last month federal prosecutors made good on the threat, issuing an indictment against three activists for doxxing ICE agents in August.

Students of political theory sometimes define the state as the entity that exercises a monopoly on violence; under Trump, the state seems to want to claim a monopoly on anonymity, too. Rose called the logic Orwellian. “It’s almost like doublespeak to say that filming is violence,” he said. “That is absurd. What filming does isn’t violence. It documents violence. It actually proves what really happened.”

Of course, there has been real violence against journalists since Trump returned to office, as well, not just arguments about whether Jimmy Kimmel should be on the air. During the protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles this June, more than 30 incidents of police violence against members of the media were documented by the Los Angeles Press Club, which last month won a remarkable injunction in a Federal District Court in California, in which the judge, Hernán Vera, had to detail that law enforcement could not attack or assault members of the press just for documenting a raid or protest. Vera described the attacks during the protests as “savagery.”

And in recent weeks, the violence has seemed to enter a new phase or perhaps merely a more visible one. On Sept. 28 an ICE agent fired a pepper ball at the car of a television journalist surveying a detention facility for signs of protest, of which there were none. On Sept. 30 at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, ICE agents shoved journalists to the floor, sending one to the hospital, just a week after a similar episode at the same facility led to the suspension of one agent — and only briefly.

And last Thursday in Portland, Ore., the conservative journalist Nick Sortor was arrested while documenting a protest against ICE — producing an immediate wave of right-wing outrage and, reportedly, a promise by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, that her department would surge resources to the city. Elsewhere in the city, ICE agents pepper-sprayed a woman who seemed to be filming them on her phone. In Chicago, ICE agents were accused of making bogus calls to the police, saying that people were tampering with a detention facility’s gate. (Police officers quickly determined the people were there only to observe.) A Chicago City Council member was arrested after asking whether the agents had a warrant for someone they’d detained. “If arresting an elected official for peacefully asking questions isn’t a demonstration of authoritarianism, then what is?” Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois asked. “They seem to feel they can just willy-nilly shoot tear gas canisters at people and shoot them with foam rounds that can permanently maim people,” said Rose. “They’ve done this over and over.”

To a degree, the pattern follows a global trend. The U.N. has been warning about increasing violence and hostility toward the press for many years, with killings of journalists up 38 percent in 2022 and 2023 from the two previous years. More than 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict there — a figure much higher than in previous wars — making it, the Committee to Protect Journalists said, “the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists” that the organization had ever documented. What makes this even more remarkable is that Israel has largely blocked foreign reporters from entering Gaza since the conflict began.

It also reflects an increasing porousness about the term “journalist” and what we even mean by it in 2025, when almost anyone holding a phone can claim to be doing journalism, including many of those superficially indistinguishable from protesters (who, it pains me to have to say, should enjoy robust First Amendment protections in the United States, too). That porousness also means that category distinctions can be made pretty arbitrary — not just between observers and activists but also between the groups the online right likes to distinguish, citing Carl Schmitt, as friend and enemy. “There is an authoritarian playbook, and it has different steps,” said Zamora. “And it has started happening here in a very fast way.”

At various points over the past decade, nervous Americans sometimes told themselves certain calming stories about the threat of Trumpism — that liberal hysteria was a bigger threat to democracy, that the lesson of his first term was that incompetence stymied ideology, that popularity would be a check and that the courts would be trusted to ultimately hold.

ICE’s budget for the 2025 fiscal year is now set to roughly triple from the year before, as is its number of deportation officers, and Stephen Miller, Trump’s top domestic policy adviser, does not appear inclined to defer to surveys of public opinion when it comes to deportations and border enforcement. Democrats have come a long way since “Abolish ICE,” too, with many pivoting pretty hard on immigration in recent years.

In certain moments from certain vantages, the proceedings can look like incompetence, with all the Sturm und Drang of Trump’s policies producing far fewer than his desired one million deportations and a high-profile monthlong operation in Chicago yielding just more than 1,000 arrests. On social media, it can even look like farce — someone flinging a Subway sandwich at Customs and Border Protection officers in D.C., someone else cursing the president and then scooting off on his bike as Border Patrol agents chased on foot in downtown Chicago, a crowd surrounding and shaming two agents as they wrestled a man to the ground on the South Side, eventually getting them to flee.

But these are not the clips we are meant to see. For that, we have a beautiful, high-production-value hype video full of portentous music, documenting an apartment raid, that Noem posted to social media over the weekend. “Chicago, we’re here for you,” she wrote.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/opinion/08wallace-wells-newsletter-image/08wallace-wells-newsletter-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:57:51.337222

Throughout Tuesday, Portland police said they monitored activity at the ICE building while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the city.

Just before 4 p.m., police said they made their first arrest of the day for a misdemeanor harassment charge.

Several hours later, police said they made another arrest, Eric Sanchez, 32, for third-degree assault and second-degree robbery related to a fight that happened on Sept. 28, where two other people were arrested.

Shortly thereafter, police said they saw a man running towards the Willamette River, and they learned there was probable cause to arrest him.

The suspect hid in bushes along the river, police said, and as officers approached him, he jumped into the river and swam to Ross Island.

Officers, accompanied by K9 units, were transported to the island by a Portland Fire & Rescue boat, where they tracked the suspect and arrested him just after 1:30 a.m.

The suspect was identified as 36-year-old Nathan V. Kaleel, of Portland, and is accused of using physical force when he stole a tripod from a victim and damaged their cell phone. The tripod was later recovered from the roof of a nearby building.

Kaleel was briefly taken to the hospital for a hand injury he sustained on the shoreline of the river before swimming away from police. He was later found hiding in the foliage of Ross Island and transported to the mainland by a Portland Fire and Rescue boat. After being discharged from the hospital, Kaleel was booked into jail and faces charges that include third-degree robbery and second-degree criminal mischief.

H-1B $100K Fee Sparks Lawsuit and Industry Backlash

A coalition of universities, healthcare providers, and nonprofits has sued the Trump administration over the new $100,000 H-1B application fee, calling it unlawful and economically damaging. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also objected, warning the policy would limit access to critical talent and force companies to outsource key functions.

The lawsuit argues the government bypassed required rulemaking and failed to consider the harm to organizations that rely on H-1B professionals, from schools and hospitals to tech and manufacturing firms. The Chamber urged the administration to withdraw the fee and instead pursue reforms that align visa policy with U.S. workforce needs.

Impact: If implemented, the $100K fee could reshape hiring strategies, spike program costs, and accelerate a shift toward alternative visa categories and green card sponsorships.

Supreme Court Allows Termination of TPS for Venezuelans

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan nationals, affecting hundreds of thousands of individuals currently residing and working in the U.S.

The decision stays a lower court order that had blocked termination while litigation continued. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, warning the ruling overlooks the irreparable harm to families and communities that have relied on TPS stability.

Impact: Employers with Venezuelan nationals under TPS should immediately review work authorization timelines and prepare contingency plans, including transitioning to alternative visa categories or permanent residence options to avoid workforce disruption.

USCIS, ICE, and the FBI conducted “Operation Twin Shield,” a large-scale fraud detection initiative in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the agency’s first surge of this magnitude in a single region. Over 900 site visits and interviews were conducted, targeting 1,000+ cases with potential fraud or ineligibility indicators.

USCIS reported evidence of noncompliance or fraud in 275 cases, with 42 referrals to ICE and several arrests. Director Joseph Edlow warned this is “the first of many” such operations and advised other cities to prepare for similar enforcement activity.

Impact: Employers should expect heightened scrutiny of immigration filings nationwide, particularly around employment verification, site visit preparedness, and documentation accuracy. Now is the time to audit records, confirm public access files, and reinforce compliance training with HR and managers supporting foreign nationals.

Refugee Admissions Slashed to Record Low for FY2026

The Trump administration plans to cut U.S. refugee admissions to 7,500, down from 125,000 under the Biden administration and reportedly prioritize certain groups, including white Afrikaners from South Africa, citing claims of “unjust discrimination.”

This marks one of the lowest refugee ceilings in U.S. history and continues a broader rollback of humanitarian and asylum pathways.

told reporters Monday that he was briefed on the deployment of California and Texas Guard troops.","Republican senators are increasingly uneasy about President Trump’s standoff with Democratic governors over deploying National Guard troops from other states to Portland, Ore., and Chicago.

The conflict between federal and state authorities escalated dramatically over the weekend when Trump moved to send National Guard soldiers to Oregon and Illinois despite opposition from their respective governors, Tina Kotek and JB Pritzker.

Trump’s use of military forces was all the more controversial because a Trump-appointed federal judge for the District of Oregon ruled Saturday that the administration could not federalize Oregon’s National Guard to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Portland.

Senate Republicans want to support Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, but they said the president’s actions are raising alarming questions about states’ rights, presidential authority and the precedent of deploying National Guard troops across state lines.

“I worry about someday a Democrat president sending troops or National Guard from New York, California, Oregon, Washington state to North Carolina. I think it’s bad precedent,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said.

“If you look at this particular issue, I don’t see how you can argue that this comports with any sort of conservative view of states’ rights,” he added.

Tillis told Attorney General Pam Bondi at a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing Wednesday that the cities and states should be handling local crime themselves.

“I’m having a real struggle right now with the National Guard being deployed and masking the abject failure of leaders at the state and local level,” he said.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she’s worried about the precedent of sending National Guard members from one state to another despite the objections of those states’ governors.

“It’s one thing if governors ask and they say, ‘Hey, I need help.’ That’s the way we’ve handled it before,” she said. “I am concerned, I am very apprehensive about the use of our military for policing and, more, the politicization that we’re seeing within the military.”

She said the use of the National Guard to respond to natural disasters when requested by the governor of a state makes perfect sense but warned that Trump is moving into a dangerous new realm.

“This is not the role of our military,” she said.

Murkowski said fellow Republican senators don’t want to clash with the president but are also sympathetic to states’ rights.

“We’re seeing these orders, we’re seeing a directive that is unprecedented, and it should make us all concerned,” she said.

One Republican senator who requested anonymity said Trump’s attempts to circumvent restrictions on his deployment of National Guard troops in Democratic states raises “questions.”

“I don’t know it’s the best way to solve the issue, but it looks like in Portland, the place is on fire, but that could be isolated reports,” the lawmaker said.

“I think he’s just poking his finger in their eye,” the senator added, referring to the firestorm provoked by Trump’s aggressive use of guard troops in Democratic-leaning states.

Oregon District Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by Trump in 2019, accused the administration Sunday night of defying her order blocking it from federalizing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect an ICE facility in Southwest Portland after a few dozen protesters showed up there.

Immergut on Saturday rejected the Trump administration’s argument that it needed to federalize Oregon Guard members to protect the ICE facility in Portland and to enforce federal immigration law. She said the administration’s actions risked “blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of the nation.”

When the administration pivoted by attempting to send 200 California Guard troops to Portland despite California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) objection, the judge warned during an emergency hearing Sunday night that the administration risked being “in direct contravention” of her order from Saturday. She also said Trump’s claim that Portland is “burning down” was “untethered to the facts.”

Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden (D), who noted the judge was confirmed with strong bipartisan support, said “there’s no question” that the Trump administration flouted Immergut’s Saturday order.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he’s not a “fan” of deploying federal troops into American cities but argued there’s a “supremacy” of federal authority when it comes to protecting federal property.

He criticized Democratic mayors for supporting soft-on-crime policies, which he argued have triggered federal intervention.

“Look at Chicago, the murder capital of the U.S. People live in utter despair and they’ve voted for Democrats for 70 years,” he added. “It’s right for the president to point that out and to try to offer help. I think the Democrats would be better off actually accepting his help.”

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a moderate who is up for reelection next year in a Democratic-leaning state, pointed to Chicago’s “crime problem” and a “sky-high murder rate.”

But she said deploying National Guard troops “works much better when the governor is in concert” with the president.

“I do think the National Guard has an important role to play in natural disasters, in protecting federal personnel and federal sites. In those cases, you can justify nationalizing the guard,” she said. “Generally, this should be a police and law enforcement action. It’s a complicated issue.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters Monday that he was briefed on the deployment of California and Texas Guard troops.

“It was a request from the Department of Homeland Security and designed to protect law enforcement personnel and federal buildings … which is a justifiable use of executive branch authority there,” Thune said. “If there are federal personnel who are being threatened, then I think the president has a right to protect them.”

But Thune said he expects the Trump administration to follow judges’ rulings, noting district court rulings will be appealed to the appellate courts and perhaps the Supreme Court.

Asked if officials should comply with orders against deploying guard troops, such as Immergut’s ruling handed down over the weekend, Thune said: “My assumption is … when it works its way through the legal process, whatever that decision is will be final.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/NationalGuard_Bolton_AP_EthanSwope.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-08 23:56:29.131552

The chief of the National Guard Bureau, which administers two organizations — the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard — was a job for a three-star general until recent years.
The Army National Guard and the Air National Guard have units in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
As of Oct. 1, there were still nearly 2,200 Guard troops deployed in Washington, with more than 950 from the D.C. National Guard.
Late Sunday, a federal judge blocked Mr. Trump from sending California National Guard troops to Portland, Ore. Texas National Guard troops arrived in the Chicago area on Tuesday and were expected to deploy by Wednesday.","Instead, Democratic governors are accusing Republicans, especially Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, of a betrayal, even an “invasion” of their states.

“Greg Abbott is a tool of Donald Trump, he’s his lackey,” said Mr. Pritzker in an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC this week.

Mr. Abbott returned fire, calling Mr. Pritzker “clueless.”

Such animus would once have been considered unusual or out of bounds for governors, who generally have seen themselves as pragmatic politicians, required to balance budgets and find solutions for their states, regardless of party. The governors have hosted “disagree better” road shows in between twice-annual meetings and White House galas marked by bonhomie.

But the deployment of about 200 troops from Texas to the Chicago area, and the threatened movement of Texas troops to Portland, Ore., have ruptured such comity.

“The president wants to call up National Guard troops in a way that we don’t believe is lawful,” Gov. Tina Kotek of Oregon, a Democrat, said in an interview. “That should concern every governor, Republican or Democrat.”

Democratic governors pleaded with Mr. Abbott to rebuff the president’s troop request. The Texan in turn castigated his Democratic colleagues as weak on crime and illegal immigration.

For Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Abbott, the rift over Texas troops is only the latest in an ongoing and bitter public feud that has not been a model of respectful debate.

Beyond calling Mr. Pritzker clueless, Mr. Abbott said during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, “If anybody is shot, if anybody is attacked, I tell you what, Governor Pritzker and the local mayor there in Chicago, they are accomplices to those crimes by stirring up this hate against I.C.E. agents.”

(Mr. Trump said Wednesday that Mr. Pritzker and the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, “should be in jail.”)

Playing in the background is the 2028 presidential election, in which many of the big state governors — including Mr. Pritzker, Mr. Newsom and Mr. Abbott — see themselves as prime candidates to be their party’s nominee.

Mr. Abbott said as much about the Illinois and California governors during the Tuesday interview. “They’re hoping to be first in line when it comes to the Democrat nomination for the presidency,” he said. “But it doesn’t matter which one of them may be the winner of that nomination, because they are utter failures for our country.”

Mr. Abbott has previously denied that he himself has presidential aspirations, and a political consultant for the governor said that the Texas governor was focused on his re-election bid next year. But politics are always present: Mr. Abbott’s campaign sent an email on Wednesday soliciting support — and an email and phone number — for the deployment.

“While other states turn their backs on President Trump, elite members of the Texas National Guard are stepping in,” the email read.

Some bipartisanship still exists — with former governors. More than two dozen of them filed a motion on Wednesday afternoon requesting permission to enter a legal brief objecting to the Texas Guard mobilization in Illinois. Among the Republicans were William Weld of Massachusetts, Bill Graves of Kansas, Arne Carlson of Minnesota, Marc Racicot of Montana and Christie Whitman of New Jersey.

“The president’s assertion of authority to deploy military troops on domestic soil based on his unreviewable discretion, and without the cooperation and coordination of state authorities, threatens to upset the delicate balance of state and federal authority that underlies our constitutional order,” more than two dozen former governors wrote.

All of this has put severe strains on the National Governors Association, which since 1908 has sought to create a space for socializing and negotiations between Republican and Democratic states.

The association has so far been silent on the brewing clash between governors and the threats by Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Newsom to quit. Messages and emails to several representatives of the association were not returned.

Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas, the chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, called the National Guard deployments across state lines ordered by the president “a blatant abuse of power and an attack on state sovereignty.”

But the current chairman of the National Governors Association, Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican, has not commented publicly. He has previously suggested that the role of the bipartisan association was not to make statements but to find areas of agreement between the two parties. (The Republican Governors Association has also not weighed in.)

“The N.G.A. is to bring people together, and I don’t think America wants people to take their ball and go home,” Mr. Stitt said last month, referring to the departure from the association of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, earlier this year. She cited a lack of bipartisanship as her reason for leaving the group.

Mr. Newsom suggested he would do the same if the association did not position itself against the interstate deployments over the objections of governors.

“If the National Governors Association cannot stand against states LITERALLY INVADING ONE ANOTHER — count me out,” he wrote on social media.

The California governor’s office later responded to a social media posting from Mr. Abbott — which suggested Democratic governors were mad at Mr. Trump for trying to do something about crime in their cities — with a litany of statistics about the high crime in Texas cities.

In recent years, the group has tried to show the country how to “disagree better,” putting out videos in which governors of different parties demonstrate to voters how to air political conflicts face-to-face, rather than to retreat to separate partisan corners. Instead, this week the disagreements got worse, after Mr. Abbott agreed to send his troops north.

The idea of “disagree better,” spearheaded by Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah, a Republican, when he was chair of the organization, was to have governors model productive debate for people around the county in order to try to turn down the political temperature and lessen the nation’s polarization.

The effort appeared to be effective, said Robb Willer, a Stanford University professor and adviser to the initiative who studied its impact. “We found that when we showed that to even far-left and far-right Democrats and Republicans, that they were impressed,” he said, ”and on average tended to view the governors more positively.”

Now, Dr. Willer said, by fighting aggressively in public, the governors may be worsening already-heightened political tension.

“Cues from party leaders are a major factor that influences Americans’ levels of toxic polarization,” he said.

A spokesman for Mr. Cox did not respond to a request for an interview with the governor.

Tension between Mr. Abbott and Mr. Pritzker has been growing over the last few years as each has found ways to insert himself into the affairs of the other’s state.

From 2022 to 2024, the Texas governor sent more than 36,000 migrants from the border to Chicago, part of his aggressive effort to target Democratic cities that had held themselves out as sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants.

Then this summer Mr. Pritzker welcomed dozens of Democratic lawmakers from Texas who left the state in order to thwart a Republican effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts, which was pushed by Mr. Trump and enthusiastically supported by Mr. Abbott. The two state leaders traded frequent barbs during the two weeks that the Texas Democrats were holed up in a hotel outside of Chicago.

Anna Griffin contributed reporting.

The decision, issued on Tuesday, is confined to Chicago and will expire in February, but it could influence the courts’ interpretations of ICE’S legal authorities in similar cases elsewhere.

The 52-page ruling from Magistrate Judge Jeffrey I. Cummings challenges the legal basis for one of ICE’S tools for making arrests — blank warrants that are often filled out by officers in the field. Under Tuesday’s order, those forms can be used only as a basis to arrest someone who has already received a notice to appear before an immigration judge.

That change alone sharply limits ICE’S authority to make “collateral arrests” of unknown individuals who officers encounter in the field, unless the agents have probable cause to believe those people are likely to escape before a warrant can be issued.

“If ICE can’t arrest them without a warrant, that really limits the use of racial profiling,” said Mark Fleming, a lawyer at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which represented the plaintiffs.

Judge Cummings highlighted the importance of probable cause after a recent Supreme Court interim ruling that allowed immigration authorities to continue to stop people and question them based on factors like their ethnicity.

“Citizens, non-citizens with legal status, and foreign nationals are interwoven throughout ICE’S Chicago Area of Responsibility and American society in general,” Judge Cummings wrote. Under the Supreme Court’s ruling, he wrote, U.S. citizens and legal residents could now be questioned or detained for sharing “commonalities” like ethnicity and language with “Latino foreign nationals.”

That, he said, heightens the need for ICE agents to show probable cause.

Mr. Fleming praised the decision. “We’re seeing more people who have deep community ties — families, loved ones, people with jobs, some of them U.S. citizens — being taken into ICE custody,” he said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in an email that the department “complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.”

The order focuses on the arrest of 22 individuals. Eleven of them were working at a restaurant in Liberty, Mo., when ICE took them into custody on Feb. 7, less than a month after Mr. Trump returned to office.

Judge Cummings found that ICE did not have reason to believe that the individuals were “reasonably likely” to escape before the agency could obtain a warrant, in violation of a consent agreement that the agency had entered into in 2022, when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was still in office.

In the agreement, ICE denied the plaintiffs’ allegations and did not admit to any wrongdoing by its officers.

According to the plaintiffs, another 11 people were arrested in violation of the agreement in the Chicago area and were taken into custody by ICE.

Rather than extend the 2022 agreement for another three years, as the plaintiffs had asked, Judge Cummings extended it by 118 days. None of the 22 arrestees are still in custody, but the order requires ICE to “lift any imposed conditions” of their release. The court also required ICE to again send out a policy statement explaining the legal requirements to make an arrest to all ICE officers nationwide.

Magistrate Judge Gabriel Fuentes dismissed the case against the two protesters, Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo, on Wednesday morning after prosecutors said in a hearing that they had not secured an indictment.

Richard S. Kling, a lawyer who represented Mr. Collins, called the failure to secure an indictment “highly unusual.”

Grand jurors consider evidence presented by prosecutors and the witnesses they choose to present — not from the defense or the people accused — during secret proceedings. Unlike in a criminal trial, where juries must reach a unanimous verdict, only a simple majority of the grand jury is required to issue an indictment.

Mr. Kling cited the legal adage maintaining that the threshold for securing an indictment is so low that a grand jury would readily indict a ham sandwich. “Obviously, they didn’t have enough for a ham sandwich here,” he said.

Other grand juries have also bucked federal prosecutors seeking to crack down on those who have stood in the way of the government’s aggressive immigration enforcement campaign.

In August, a federal grand jury in Washington declined to indict a man who was facing felony assault charges for lobbing a sandwich that struck a federal agent. Days earlier, federal prosecutors in Washington downgraded charges against a woman accused of assaulting an F.B.I. agent during a protest after failing to persuade three grand juries to indict her on felony charges.

The latest case involved the ICE facility in Broadview, Ill., a small suburb west of Chicago, which has been the site of protests since the Department of Homeland Security began focusing on the Chicago area about a month ago, in an operation it calls Midway Blitz.

Mr. Collins and Ms. Robledo were among those protesting outside the facility on the evening of Sept. 27. According to the criminal complaint, Mr. Collins and Ms. Robledo, who are engaged, were part of a group that scuffled with law enforcement officials as they sought to push protesters away from the building.

As agents sought to restrain Mr. Collins, “he resisted, struggling with agents,” which caused an injury to the thumb of a federal agent, according to the complaint. Mr. Collins and Ms. Robledo were both armed during the scuffle, with weapons that they had permits for, according to prosecutors.

Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago, declined to say whether the office would present the case to a new grand jury.

Mr. Kling said he was heartened that grand jurors had reined in prosecutors in cases involving acts of protest.

“I’m gratified the grand jury stood up for the First Amendment in reaction to what is going on in the streets of this country,” he said.

Ms. Noem and other federal leaders have said the situation around the ICE building, where demonstrators typically stand or sit on the sidewalks and sometimes attempt to block cars from entering or leaving, must change.

“We want more security at the building, a bigger buffer zone to keep our officers safe,” she told Fox News Tuesday evening, adding that she didn’t want to “let the anarchists run this city anymore.”

Ms. Noem came to Portland with a list of demands, which were laid out in a letter the U.S. attorney for Oregon gave to Portland’s police chief on Tuesday. Among them: The federal government wants the city police to create a buffer zone of limited access around the building at least one block in radius, establish “free speech zones” to limit where demonstrators can gather, insure that federal agents can enter and leave the building without interference and prioritize responding to “any call for assistance based on threats to federal property or persons.”

Local elected officials acknowledged that their conversations with the secretary, held at Portland International Airport and at the ICE building, were direct and, at times, uncomfortable.

“I’m glad she had time for me,” Tina Kotek, Oregon’s governor, said in an interview. “I think it’s important that she’s here to see what is going on. And, hopefully, she’ll come away with the understanding that this is not an insurrection or a rebellion or whatever else the president is saying.”

Mayor Keith Wilson of Portland responded to Ms. Noem’s demands on Wednesday with a letter to her general counsel. He did not directly address her request for a larger buffer zone around the building or designated areas for protests, but did note that deciding how to handle political demonstrations was the responsibility of the city, not the federal government.

He also raised a point that was not in the U.S. attorney’s letter but came up in conversations between local and federal leaders: The city could take over the lease or outright buy the ICE building, and the processing ICE does there could be relocated.

“Given the operational challenges and expense this facility likely demands, we believe this may be a mutually beneficial solution in the best interests of all parties and stakeholders,” Mr. Wilson wrote.

The governor and mayor also said they also made their own requests: that federal agents abide by Oregon laws regarding how and when law enforcement can use force, including tear gas.

Ms. Noem told Fox News that she was dealing with “a bunch of pansies” in her talks with elected officials in Oregon and was “extremely disappointed” by her conversation with Mr. Wilson.

“I told him that if he did not follow through on some of these security measures for our officers,” she said, “we are going to cover him up with more federal resources and that we were going to send four times the amount of federal officers here so that the people of Portland can have some safety.”

The scene at the ICE building when Ms. Noem visited on Tuesday was calm. About a dozen demonstrators, including a woman in a bear costume and sombrero and a man in a chicken onesie, were outnumbered by journalists. The police had cordoned off a one-block area around the facility, so Ms. Noem’s only view of the protests came when she surveyed the scene from the roof of the building — alongside some federal employees and several conservative influencers — and when her motorcade entered and exited the building.

The Portland police continued to keep a one block radius around the building closed to the public on Wednesday morning, but a department spokesperson said the area would be reopened to the public later in the day. Overnight, the police removed a sidewalk camp that protesters had been using for several months.

A Federal District Court judge, Karin Immergut, has temporarily blocked President Trump’s plan to send federalized National Guard soldiers to protect the ICE building. An appeal in that case is underway at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.

Mr. Trump has activated the Guard several times this year in Democratic-led cities, in what he has called a crackdown on crime and as part of his escalating immigration enforcement tactics.

Here is an overview of what the National Guard typically does and how Mr. Trump is currently deploying the force in the United States.

What is the National Guard?

Tracing its history to the Massachusetts militia in 1636, the National Guard is a component of the U.S. military that has state and federal missions and traditionally operates under the jurisdiction of governors under Title 32 of the U.S. Code.

By comparison, the active-duty military operates under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, and the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act makes it a crime to use the regular military as a domestic police force in most circumstances.

Who is in charge of it?

The chief of the National Guard Bureau, which administers two organizations — the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard — was a job for a three-star general until recent years.

According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress elevated the job to a four-star position in 2008 and made the chief a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2011.

The current chief of the National Guard Bureau is Gen. Steven S. Nordhaus of the Air Force.

Operationally, the Guard troops currently being sent into U.S. cities are under the command of Gen. Gregory M. Guillot of U.S. Northern Command, a four-star general who takes his orders from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Where are Guard units located?

The Army National Guard and the Air National Guard have units in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

How large is the force, and what does it do?

More than 430,000 soldiers and airmen serve in the National Guard and operate akin to a reserve component of the active-duty force, typically reporting for duty one weekend a month and two weeks a year.

Beyond those obligations, they can be mobilized on active duty for specific periods by a state or territorial governor for support operations such as responding to natural disasters or civil unrest.

The White House can mobilize Guard troops under Title 10 of the U.S. Code for national missions — including overseas deployment to serve in wars — over the objection of state and territorial governors. (The District of Columbia National Guard reports to the federal government, as the capital does not have a governor.)

The Guard also participates in training foreign allies and partners in more than 100 countries under the State Partnership Program, which evolved from a Cold War-era initiative to help former Soviet states operate their own military forces as newly democratic nations. Troops participating in the program often spend their two weeks of active federal service deployed to a partner nation, working with the same units to build relationships over repeat visits.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian military leaders often turned to their longtime partners in the California National Guard for assistance.

Has the federal government mobilized Guard troops for domestic missions before?

Yes.

The Guard has been federally mobilized at least 10 times since World War II, according to a recent Guard document.

Five of the mobilizations were in support of racial desegregation efforts and the protection of civil rights: at schools in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957-58; Oxford, Miss., in 1962; twice in Alabama in 1963, and again in 1965 to protect civil rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery. Until this year, the 1965 mobilization was the last time a president federalized a state’s National Guard without the cooperation of a governor.

Three federal Guard mobilizations were in response to riots: in Detroit in 1967; in multiple cities in 1968 after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; and in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers who had assaulted Rodney King, a Black motorist.

Another federal mobilization was in response to a strike by Postal Service workers in New York in 1970, and another was to restore order in the U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.

Have domestic deployments gone badly before?

Yes.

In 1970, the mobilization of Guard soldiers by Gov. James A. Rhodes, Republican of Ohio, ended tragically when troops opened fire on students who were peacefully protesting the Vietnam War on the campus of Kent State University. The soldiers killed four students and wounded nine unarmed protesters, who were all in their late teens and early 20s.

Neither the governor nor any of the Guardsmen who shot students were found criminally liable for the shootings.

How many Guard troops are federally mobilized right now?

The exact number is unclear.

According to the National Guard Bureau, its troops can have dozens of federal missions at any given time to include “disaster relief, defense support of civilian authorities, training missions” and “community engagement.”

The bureau on Monday referred questions about the number of troops who are currently deployed on the order of the president to the Army component of U.S. Northern Command, which then referred questions to the defense secretary’s office.

The defense secretary’s press office on Tuesday referred those questions back to the Guard task force in Washington, D.C., and to a U.S. Northern Command website for what it calls the “federal protective mission” in the United States.

Here’s what we do know: In June, 2,000 members of the California National Guard were mobilized to Los Angeles to quell immigration protests. In July, Mr. Trump authorized the deployment of Guard troops to immigration facilities in 20 states.

In August, Mr. Trump federalized the local police in Washington and mobilized troops to fight crime, even though violent crime was falling in the city. Later that month, he directed the Defense Department to create a mobile Guard unit that could be sent anywhere in the country for “ensuring public safety and order.”

In September, the president signed an order authorizing the use of the National Guard in Memphis and said he would consider similar deployments in Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans.

As of Oct. 1, there were still nearly 2,200 Guard troops deployed in Washington, with more than 950 from the D.C. National Guard. A majority of the troops patrolling the capital are normally based in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia.

Late Sunday, a federal judge blocked Mr. Trump from sending California National Guard troops to Portland, Ore. Texas National Guard troops arrived in the Chicago area on Tuesday and were expected to deploy by Wednesday.

Do Guard troops on federal orders still get paid during the government shutdown?

The National Guard receives state and federal funding, but troops are paid by their state legislatures when mobilized by governors. Those on federal orders will not be paid until congressional funding is restored.

Arguments made by Mr. Trump’s Justice Department, she continued, “risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

Hours earlier, after a Friday hearing before Judge Immergut, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff who is the architect of Mr. Trump’s push to deploy U.S. soldiers on their own soil, said the problem lay elsewhere. “Far-left Democrat judges,” he said, were obstructing the administration’s attempt to “dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

But Judge Immergut is anything but a far-left judge. When Mr. Trump first nominated her to the federal bench in 2018, she arrived with strong conservative credentials, and her career shows a willingness to pursue cases no matter which party’s ox is gored. As a lawyer during the 1990s, she served under Ken Starr during his investigation of President Bill Clinton.

She personally questioned Monica Lewinsky about the details of her affair with Mr. Clinton before a grand jury, successfully eliciting fine-grained specifics of their sexual encounters that critics would later call salacious when they appeared in Mr. Starr’s report.

During the next two decades, she built a career as a federal prosecutor, first in California and then in Oregon. She prosecuted white-collar fraudsters, money launderers and drug traffickers. In 2003, she was chosen by President George W. Bush to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Oregon, supervising dozens of prosecutors and overseeing high-profile terrorism cases.

As a prosecutor, Judge Immergut was “incredibly hard-working” and “apolitical in her approach,” said Billy J. Williams, who has known her since the 1990s and also went on to lead Oregon’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, first under President Obama and then continuing through Mr. Trump’s first term. “When she’s on the bench, she’s an incredible listener who isn’t afraid, in the moment, to either make a statement or ask deeper questions. She’s always prepared.”

Scott Asphaug, who also worked under Judge Immergut during her time as Oregon’s chief federal prosecutor, said she told her team to “do the right thing, for the right reason.”

“Our job was not simply to win,” he said. “Our job was to act in a judicious and just manner.”

In an emergency hearing on Sunday night, Judge Immergut clarified her restraining order, barring the administration from sending in National Guard troops from any other state. Having already ruled that President Trump lacked a legal basis for sending the military, she warned the administration could be “in direct contravention” of her order, citing reports that troops from Texas and California could soon be on their way.

“Aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order?” she asked. “Why is this appropriate?”

Like Judge Immergut, Mr. Williams was working out of the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse in downtown Portland in the summer of 2020. That was when Attorney General Bill Barr sent federal agents to Portland to deal with crowds who had gathered around the courthouse to protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police.

Mr. Williams said that while parts of downtown Portland did resemble a “war zone” back in 2020, the circumstances of the current protests, which are smaller in scale and concentrated around an ICE building in South Portland, were “vastly different.”

“I don’t fault ICE for doing their work,” he said. “I believe in law and order. And people get to protest it, so long as that’s done in a lawful manner. It’s a careful balance.”

Judge Immergut’s ruling, he said, “was based on the facts of 2025, not 2020; what’s happening now is nothing like what happened then.”

The judge has not yet made a final ruling on the merits of the case. Her temporary restraining order will expire later this month, and a trial is scheduled in Portland for the morning of October 29.

The Trump administration has appealed Judge Immergut’s initial ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. And on social media, Mr. Miller is not letting Judge Immergut’s conservative background interfere with his attacks on the legitimacy of her rulings. Her order, he wrote, amounted to an attempt to “nullify the 2024 election by fiat.” On Monday, he called her a “district court judge with no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President,” and an “Oregon judge.”

On Sunday, Mr. Trump addressed his selection of Judge Immergut more directly, telling reporters that “if they put judges like that on, I wasn’t well-served by the people who picked judges.”

But while he seemed to be cognizant of the fact that one of his nominees had ruled against him, his awareness did not extend to that judge’s gender. Mr. Trump repeatedly referred to Judge Immergut as “he” and “him.”

“That judge ought to be ashamed of himself,” he said.

Here's who continues working, per the Indianapolis Star: Active-duty military: Active-duty military, National Guard and reservists remain on duty without pay.","Over 1 million active-duty military members and contractors may not receive their October 15 paychecks if Congress does not pass legislation.

Essential federal employees, including military personnel and ICE agents, must continue to work without pay during the shutdown.

While workers are entitled to back pay after the shutdown ends, President Trump has suggested some furloughed employees may not ""deserve"" it.

One week into the government shutdown and the country has already seen significant impacts on federal agencies. So far, there have been over 750,000 furloughed workers, air travel delays due to an air traffic controller shortage and reduced services at Social Security offices.

Now, military service members may not get paid.

As the ongoing stalemate in Congress lingers, paychecks for military service members and civilian contractors are on the line. Payments set to be issued on Oct. 15 may not be sent out if lawmakers don't reach an agreement. Legislation would have to be passed by Oct. 13 (Columbus Day) to process payments for troops to be paid on time, according to Reuters.

More than 1 million active-duty military, as well as hundreds of thousands of active National Guard members and civilians who work for the Department of Defense (DOD), would be affected. Military personnel still have to work during a government shutdown.

Here's who will and won't get paid during the shutdown.

What happens if military members don't receive Oct. 15 paychecks?

Service members must continue to work during a government shutdown, but that doesn't mean they will get paid during that time.

In many cases, payment is delayed until after the shutdown ends, but service members are entitled to back pay, a move signed into law by President Trump in 2019 to compensate active-duty military members and furloughed employees for back pay once the government reopens. While troops did get paid on Oct. 1, future missed payments may present financial hardships to military families.

However, Trump has since said this week that some furloughed federal workers “don’t deserve” back pay and has threatened mass layoffs and widespread cuts to government programs, USA TODAY reports.

Does ICE get paid during the government shutdown?

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which operates under the Department of Homeland Security, will also continue working since it is deemed ""essential"" to government operations.

Like DOD military members, ICE agents do not receive paychecks during the shutdown but are guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends.

Will the National Guard get paid during the government shutdown?

Active-duty military, National Guard and reservists are expected to remain on duty without pay, Indianapolis Star reports, but will receive back pay after the shutdown.

Who continues working, getting paid in a government shutdown?

Essential workers are still on the clock. They must continue working without pay, and they typically aren't eligible to collect unemployment benefits. Here's who continues working, per the Indianapolis Star:

Active-duty military: Active-duty military, National Guard and reservists remain on duty without pay.

Air travel: Transportation Security Administration agents at airports and air-traffic controllers are required to work without pay.

Border Patrol and ICE: Border Patrol officers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and customs officials will keep working without pay.

Federal law enforcement: The FBI, CIA, DEA and Secret Service stay on the job without pay.

IRS: Employees at the IRS worked during the first five days of the shutdown, according to a contingency plan the agency posted Sept. 30, by tapping into funds already authorized by Congress.

Mail: The U.S. Postal Service remains open. It doesn't depend on Congress for funding, so postal employees will still get paid throughout the government shutdown.

Prisons: Correctional officers at U.S. prisons keep working without pay.

""Non-essential"" staff at national parks, NASA, the Department of Education and other government positions may either be furloughed or laid off in staffing cuts during the government shutdown.","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/08/USAT/86580929007-20251008-t-011023-z-278100572-rc-277-hamejkt-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpchicago.JPG?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-08 18:56:41.516676

In a letter written to Congress on Wednesday, the signatories condemned a series of recent US strikes on boats in the Caribbean, including at least three originating from Venezuela, that have killed more than 20 people since September. The strikes are the first lethal US military operations in the Caribbean in decades, part of what the Trump administration calls a fight against “narcoterrorism”.

“The Trump administration has not provided any valid legal justification for these strikes or any evidence to substantiate its claims that the victims were an imminent threat to the security of the United States,” the letter said.

Signed by nearly 60 organisations – including Oxfam America, Human Rights First, Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns and the American Friends Service Committee – the letter called on members of Congress to block what it described as unauthorised and illegal uses of force.

“We fear, barring decisive action by members of Congress, there will be more strikes, more extrajudicial killings, and potentially a full-blown limitless war with one or more countries in the region, with likely devastating humanitarian and geopolitical consequences,” the letter said.

The appeal was issued before a War Powers Resolution introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Adam Schiff was expected to reach the Senate floor on Wednesday. Schiff said he and Kaine will force a vote to block the government from carrying out lethal strikes against vessels in the Caribbean.

“If a president can unilaterally put people or groups on a list and kill them, there is no meaningful limit to his use of force,” Schiff said.

The measure seeks to halt unauthorised US military activity in the Caribbean and reassert Congress’s authority over the use of force.

Escalation and legal concerns

The New York Times reported in July that Trump signed a secret directive authorising the possibility of “direct military operations at sea and on foreign soil against cartels”.

Within weeks, US Navy warships and aircraft and more than 4,000 soldiers were deployed to the southern Caribbean. Two weeks later, the first of four strikes occurred.

To justify the escalation, the administration labelled certain regional groups like Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang as “foreign terrorist organisations” and “specially designated global terrorists”. However, legal experts noted these designations do not authorise the use of military force overseas.

Administration officials have defended the escalation as a counternarcotics mission, insisting that the targeted vessels were linked to drug trafficking and “terrorist organisations”.

But according to the Washington Office on Latin America and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, about 90 percent of US-bound cocaine transits the eastern Pacific and western Caribbean, not near Venezuela’s coast. The Drug Enforcement Agency likewise reported that fentanyl entering the US is produced in Mexico using precursor chemicals from China, not Venezuela.

At the Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia this week, Trump told reporters that if traffickers “aren’t coming by sea any more”, US forces might “move the fight onto land”.

Regime change fears

As the administration’s rhetoric has increasingly blurred the line between targeting drug traffickers and targeting the Venezuelan state itself, civil society groups are arguing that the strikes are part of a broader strategy aimed at regime change in Venezuela. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has long advocated for regime change there, has referred to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government as a cartel “masquerading as a government” and branded him a fugitive from US justice, offering up to a $50m reward for his capture.

However, internal documents obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation confirmed that US intelligence agencies acknowledged Maduro’s government is “not directing [Venezuela’s] Tren de Aragua’s operations in the United States”.

Alex Main, director of international policy of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, warned that Trump’s campaign “could soon be directed at Venezuela in an attempt to incite violent regime change” and other countries, such as Mexico or Panama, could also face US intervention with “potentially disastrous consequences” for the region.

Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of Representatives have also stated that “Trump and Rubio are pushing for regime change in Venezuela,” adding: “The American people don’t want another war – and Congress can’t let any president start one illegally or unilaterally. That’s not how the Constitution works.”

Elizabeth Tregaskis Gordon, senior policy advisor for LAC at Oxfam America, told Al Jazeera that many Venezuelans are already “living through crisis” and warned that an increase in US military would disrupt humanitarian work in the country.

“Many cannot access basic necessities to survive, while they face rising prices for consumer goods and increasing food insecurity,” she said. “Worsening of the humanitarian crisis will only lead to more chaos and disruption; current US military action is unconstitutional, violates the UN charter, and should cease immediately. ”

Faith communities take a stand

“War is always a defeat,” Susan Gunn, director of the Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns, told Al Jazeera. “When such killing is aimed at civilians with no due process, it violates the sacredness of human life and undermines basic human rights and the rule of law.”

The letter her group and others wrote to Congress also warns that further escalation could worsen Latin America’s largest modern displacement crisis, deepening the suffering of millions of people who have already fled Venezuela.

The signatories urged Congress to reverse the military build-up, investigate civilian deaths and pursue diplomacy.

The Friends Committee on National Legislation’s general secretary, Bridget Moix, added: “War is not the answer at home or abroad.”

“In these unprecedented times,” the letter concluded, “it is critical that the US Congress reclaim its constitutional powers.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_68e6a230-1759945264.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-08 18:56:38.084655

More than 30 agents have been injured during protests, “including multiple hospitalizations,” and more than 50 people were arrested, according to government lawyers.","A Presbyterian minister in Chicago is suing Donald Trump’s administration after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were captured in viral video firing pepper balls at his head during protests against the president’s anti-immigration agenda.

The Rev. David Black joined a lawsuit with Chicago reporters and protesters accusing the administration of unconstitutional threats to their First Amendment rights and religious freedoms with “a pattern of extreme brutality” designed to “silence the press and civilians.”

Last month, Black — dressed in black and wearing a clerical collar while standing with demonstrators — was hit with chemical agents while praying in front of an ICE facility in Broadview, a Chicago suburb that has emerged as a flashpoint for protests against the administration as the president deploys National Guard troops to Illinois.

“I invited them to repentance,” Black told Religion News Service. “I basically offered an altar call. I invited them to come and receive that salvation, and be part of the kingdom that is coming.”

Black is not alone, according to the lawsuit. Agents “dressed in full combat gear” have “indiscriminately” tossed flash grenades and tear gas and fired guns loaded with chemical irritants and rubber bullets against demonstrators in the Chicago area, the complaint says.

Protesters and reporters have faced “serious injuries” and “some are being randomly singled out for arrest” and detained inside the ICE facility where they “are detained incommunicado for hours,” according to the complaint.

“No legitimate purpose exists for this brutality or for these arrests,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote. “The officers are not physically threatened. No government property is threatened. Defendants are acting to intimidate and silence the press and civilians engaged in protected First Amendment activities.”

Black, the senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago in Woodlawn, was “offering prayers and urging ICE officers stationed on the roof of the Broadview ICE facility to repent from their unnecessarily brutal enforcement of the immigration laws” before officers fired at him, according to the lawsuit.

In footage from the scene on September 19, a person wearing a helmet moves in front of Black before ICE officers on the roof above them “suddenly and without warning” shot pepper balls that struck the top of Black’s head and exploded into a puff of white powder.

Black then falls to his knees in pain. Moments later, officers on the street sprayed him with tear gas, according to the complaint.

The lawsuit also accuses the Trump administration of violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which states that the government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.”

Officers’ practice of targeting Black and other clergy “substantially burdens their exercise of religion,” according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit also cites an incident involving the Rev. Beth Johnson, an ordained minister in the Unitarian Church, who was “fired upon without warning or justification as she and other protesters and clergy members stood on the sidewalk singing ‘We Shall Overcome’ and other traditional songs of protest,” the filing says.

The Rev. Hannah Kardon, a United Methodist pastor who leads United Church of Rogers Park in Chicago, told Religion News Service that ICE agents fired several rounds of pepper balls against her, including while she was praying with her eyes closed and hands lifted.

“We’re a faith of immigrants — Jesus was an immigrant,” she told the outlet. “But to me, this is basic created-being stuff. When you see what is happening here, your whole body and heart resists it because it’s fundamentally wrong.”

A growing number of faith leaders are speaking out against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign and the aggressive law enforcement response to demonstrations against it, including Pope Leo XIV and prominent Catholic leaders across the United States.

Lawyers for the Trump administration have accused the plaintiffs of trying to “dictate crowd-control policy in ways that would tie the hands of federal law enforcement officers … even in circumstances of imminent danger and would risk bogging this court down in micro-management of crowd-control decisions.”

“These inflexible and vague constraints are untenable on their face,” lawyers for Homeland Security wrote Wednesday.

The operation is being led by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose masked agents have surged into several Democratic-led cities to conduct raids, stoking outrage among many residents and protests outside federal facilities.

“Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! Governor Pritzker also!” Trump posted Wednesday on his Truth Social platform.

Local officials argue that city and state law enforcement are sufficient to handle the protests, but Trump claims the military is needed to keep federal agents safe, heightening concerns among his critics of growing authoritarianism.

After National Guard deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, 200 troops arrived in Illinois on Tuesday.

An immigration enforcement building outside Chicago has also been the site of clashes between federal agents and protesters.

A judge will have a role in determining how many boots are on the streets: There’s a court hearing Thursday on a request by Illinois and Chicago to declare the National Guard deployment illegal.

‘Stand up and speak out’

Trump’s attacks on Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, both Democrats, follow similar extraordinary public calls by the president for his political opponents to face legal charges.

They come on the same day that former FBI director James Comey was arraigned on charges of lying to Congress – an indictment which came just days after Trump urged his attorney general to take action against him and others.

Pritzker, seen as a potential Democratic candidate in the 2028 presidential election, has become one of Trump’s most fiery critics.

He pledged Wednesday to “not back down,” listing a litany of grievances against Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“Making people feel they need to carry citizenship papers. Invading our state with military troops. Sending in war helicopters in the middle of the night,” he wrote on X.

“What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?” he asked. “We must all stand up and speak out.”

By “war helicopters”, Pritzker was referring to a major raid last week in which Black Hawk helicopters descended on a Chicago housing complex.

Dozens of people were arrested in the surprise operation, according to the Trump administration, but US media reported that American citizens were detained for hours.

Mayor Johnson has since announced “ICE-free zones” where city-owned property will be declared off-limits to federal authorities.

Johnson accused Republicans of wanting “a rematch of the Civil War”.

Trump’s immigration crackdown is aimed at fulfilling a key election pledge to rid the country of what he called waves of foreign “criminals”.

Trump has nonetheless faced some legal setbacks, including a federal judge in Oregon blocking his bid to deploy troops in Portland, saying his descriptions of an emergency there were false and that the US is a “nation of Constitutional law, not martial law”.

Trump says he could invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to force deployments of troops around the country if courts or local officials are “holding us up”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25280665815461-1759868765.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-08 17:57:58.107312

“Given the Trump Administration’s disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE’s repeated attacks on the rule of law,” the lawmakers wrote.

Lawmakers noted that while Paragon claims it has safeguards in place to protect against civil liberty and privacy violations, it comes with the ability for “zero-click” access to messaging apps and has been used to spy on journalists and human rights activists.

Allowing ICE officers to use this spyware could threaten Americans’ freedom of speech and movement, lawmakers warned.

“Allowing ICE to utilize spyware raises serious questions about whether ICE will respect Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless search and seizure for people residing in the U.S.,” stated the letter.

The representatives gave Noem until Oct. 20 to provide details on all ICE records on its use of spyware, including Paragon’s Graphite tool, internal legal justifications for deploying such technology in immigration enforcement, and a list of surveillance targets and ICE’s domestic spying strategy.

About 200 members from multiple units in the Texas National Guard and 300 members from units in the Illinois National Guard have been activated and sent to the Chicago area, the statement said. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has denounced the deployment as an unconstitutional invasion.

The troops are stationed at the Army Reserve center in Elwood, outside Joliet, about an hour southwest of Chicago.

In a statement Sunday, ahead of the National Guard’s arrival, Pritzker said, “We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion.”

“It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops,” he said.

​“The brave men and women who serve in our national guards must not be used as political props,” he said. “This is a moment where every American must speak up and help stop this madness.”

President Donald Trump said Wednesday on Truth Social that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson “should be in jail” in an escalation of his conflict with the two Democratic officials.

“Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” he said in the post. “Governor Pritzker also!”

Trump has threatened for weeks to send troops to Chicago as part of a crime-fighting and immigration effort, and Democrats have pushed back and said any deployment would be politically motivated against his perceived enemies and an overreach of authority.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

Pritzker responded to Trump on X, saying, “I will not back down.”

“Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power,” he said. “What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?”

Reached for comment, Johnson said, “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” he added.

The Trump administration is also seeking to send the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, but a judge granted a temporary restraining order over the weekend to block the move as the case is considered in court.

A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday granted an administrative stay of Judge Karin Immergut’s ruling Saturday and will allow for the federalization of Oregon National Guard members. The ruling did not address the deployment of those members in Portland, which is expected to be addressed at a hearing Thursday.

The emergency administrative ruling stands, while the appeals process in the case continues.

A Pentagon spokesperson said the troops would have worked to support ICE and other federal personnel, as well as protect federal property.

On Tuesday, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek directed U.S. Northern Command to demobilize Oregon’s 200 National Guard troops and return another 200 California National Guard members to their state.

Referring to the judge’s decision temporarily blocking Trump from sending the National Guard into Portland, Kotek said in a statement, “Immergut’s orders are a clear and forceful rebuttal to President Trump’s misuse of states’ National Guard.”

“Thus, I am directing Northern Command to send Oregon’s citizen-soldiers home from Camp Rilea immediately,” she said. “Let’s remember that these Oregonians are our neighbors and friends, who have been unlawfully uprooted from their family and careers — they deserve better than this.”

It was unclear whether Kotek’s letter to U.S. Northern Command would have any effect. The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment about legal standing for directing Northern Command to send troops home. Northern Command also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has asked a federal appeals court to block Immergut’s order while the case makes its way through the courts, arguing her ruling “improperly impinges on the Commander in Chief’s supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the field, and endangers federal personnel and property.” Attorneys for the state contend her order should stay in place. The 9th Circuit court is scheduled to hear both sides’ arguments at a hearing Thursday.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251008-national-guard-gk-914415.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 19:58:16.022377

Just before 4 p.m., officers arrested 43-year-old Leah Bothamley of South Dakota. She was taken to the Multnomah County Jail on one count of harassment. Jail records indicate that she was released on her own recognizance.

At 8:48 p.m., officers took 32-year-old Eric Sanchez of Kelso into custody. He was booked for assault in the third degree and robbery in the second degree in connection with an assault on September 28, police said. The assault was connected to a fight which led to the arrest of two people that night.

Just before 10 p.m., police say a disturbance broke out near the ICE facility. “Officers saw someone running away to the east toward the Willamette River and learned that there was probable cause to arrest him,” Portland Police said. “The suspect hid in some bushes along the Willamette River, and as officers approached, he jumped in and swam across to Ross Island.”

With the help of the Portland Fire Bureau, K9 units and officers boarded a fire boat and were taken to the island. Police say the suspect was arrested just after 1:30 a.m. Name and charges will be released later.

Since Trump returned to office in January, federal immigration officers have conducted sweeping raids in communities across the country. According to the latest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, the agency has removed more than 71,405 people this year.

The operations have sparked widespread protests and fears from migrant communities and their supporters. The crackdown has also been met with various legal challenges.

Mark Seitz, the bishop of El Paso, Texas, told Reuters that the pope is “very personally concerned about these matters” and “expressed his desire that the U.S. Bishops’ Conference would speak strongly on this issue.”

The Hill has reached out to the Vatican to confirm the pope’s remarks. The White House referred The Hill to press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s response disputing Leo’s stance from last week.

Last month, Leo said that those who are against abortion but in support of the “inhuman treatment of immigrants” in the U.S. are not “pro-life.”

“Someone who says, ‘I’m against abortion’ but says, ‘I’m in favor of the death penalty,’ is not really pro-life,” the pope told reporters, via EWTN News. “Someone who says that, ‘I’m against abortion but I’m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants who are in the United States,’ I don’t know if that’s pro-life.”

On Tuesday, the Vatican announced that the pope will make the first international trip of his papacy to Turkey and Lebanon from Nov. 27 to Dec. 2.

“Lawful permanent residence was always considered secure — almost unassailable,” Nia said. “To see people who have lived and worked here for years suddenly detained or deported with little to no process is alarming. ICE appears to be acting unlawfully in many of these cases, without proper judicial oversight.""

US media reported this week that two Iranian green card holders were arrested in recent months by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in cases apparently involving minor crimes.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has stepped up efforts to detain and deport some green card holders citing past crimes or political activity at odds with its values. Most of the cases are being contested in courts.

Under US immigration law, green-card holders can only be deported in limited circumstances, such as when they commit certain crimes, falsify immigration documents, or remain outside the country for extended periods.

Nia said what is happening now goes far exceeds those bounds.

“Deporting Iranians who fled repression — or sending them to third countries like Sudan or Somalia — violates both international law and America’s own treaty obligations,” she said.

“This normalization of lawlessness should concern every American.”

In Los Angeles, NBC News reported that Sharareh Moghaddam, a small-business owner who had already passed her citizenship exam, was detained after attending what she thought was a routine immigration appointment. Her husband, Hooshang Aghdassi, said she had entered the country legally and had no record of wrongdoing.

“She had green card and passed exam for citizenship and was waiting for the ceremony,” Aghdassi told NBC. “She is not a bank robber or thief or criminal.”

ICE rejected that account, telling NBC Los Angeles in a written statement that reports claiming Moghaddam had no criminal history were “completely FALSE.” The agency described her as “an Iranian native and citizen with a documented criminal history dating back to 2015,” citing two theft convictions between 2015 and 2019, and concluded that she was “subject to removal under US immigration law.”

Newseek reported last month Reza Zavvar, a 52-year-old green card holder in Maryland who has lived in the United States for four decades, was detained for seventy-seven days by ICE in a case related to a marijuana charge in the nineties.

Zavvar, who first came to the country as a child, described his treatment as “unnecessary, inhumane, corrupt.”

“Saying that you can stay here as long as you don’t get in trouble, that you stay clean and just stay here, work, pay taxes — and that’s what I was doing,” Zavvar told the news outlet.

Iranians sent back from US without consent, lawyer says

More recently, 120 Iranians — including political dissidents and Christian converts — were deported to Tehran.

This comes after The New York Times reported that the operation followed “months of negotiations” between Washington and Iranian officials, and that the deportees were flown aboard US-chartered aircraft that left from a military airport in Louisiana, stopped in Puerto Rico to collect more passengers, and continued to Doha before their transfer to Iran.

Immigration attorney Ali Herischi, of Herischi & Associates in Maryland, told Iran International that two of his clients were among those deported against their will. “Their belongings — including their files, evidence and cell phones — have been handed to Iranian authorities. That’s very dangerous,” Herischi said.

Deported in shackles: Iranians sent back from US without consent, lawyer says

He added that some detainees were given a stark choice: “ICE would say, ‘either you consent to deportation to Iran, or we send you to Somalia or Sudan.’ It was, ‘pick your poison.’ In the case of my clients, they didn’t even get that. They just said, ‘you’re done, let’s go.’”

Another Iranian national, Erfan Qaneifard, a political activist and writer, has been held for six months at the Prairieland Detention Center in Texas.

His lawyer, Masoud Peyma, told Iran International that ICE contacted Iran’s Interests Section in Washington seeking travel papers to deport him. “The risk is real. If he is sent back, his life will be in danger,” Peyma said. “There is no reason for him to remain in detention after six months.”

Iranian political activist held in Texas faces risk of deportation, lawyer says

For Nia, these cases expose a broader collapse of process and accountability within the immigration system.

“It’s the normalization of a lack of process — the idea that even a green card, or eventually citizenship, could become conditional on political speech,” she said. “That’s authoritarianism creeping into the system.”

Civil-rights groups echoed those concerns, warning that forced returns could endanger vulnerable Iranians.

“Asylum seekers now face the possibility of being returned to a country where they have a well-founded fear of persecution,” the Iranian American Legal Defense Fund, Pars Equality Center, and the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans said in a joint statement.

“This runs against core American values as a nation based on hope, freedom, and liberty that has long welcomed people facing oppression who, in turn, have contributed mightily to America,"" the statement read.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to Iran International requests for comment on these cases.","https://i.iranintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/d02fe36364552a6b8e68cf690c36ff9219e2a390-876x642.png?rect=31,99,845,444&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-10-08 19:57:37.756370

Humane immigration policy, focused on public safety threats, would also increase public support for ICE operations, reducing hostility in the community.","This weekend, Immigration and Customs Enforcement accused me — a policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute — of causing assaults on its agents. I’m just the latest in a long line of people — mayors, governors, members of Congress and more — whom ICE has blamed for a rise in violent confrontations with their deportation agents.

In fact, ICE is endangering its own agents. According to the Trump administration, ICE agents suffered about 90% fewer assaults under President Joe Biden than under President Donald Trump. Biden’s ICE better protected agents by adopting interior enforcement policies that reduced chaotic interactions with the public.

This weekend, ICE accused me — a policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute — of causing assaults on its agents.

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security is doing the opposite, demanding agents conduct operations in ways they’ve rarely done before. According to my analysis of ICE records, ICE is arresting 1,100% more people on the streets — that is, outside of jails, prisons or police custody — than it did even in 2017 during the first Trump administration. Most of these people have no criminal records.

This nearly matches DHS’ claimed 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE agents this year over last year. DHS agents in masks have been told to “go out on the streets” and detain random people to see whether they are here illegally.

The result is chaos. DHS’ targets don’t know why they’re being approached or what their rights are. Agents don’t know what to expect, either, putting them on edge. Onlookers often believe they are watching masked men abducting their friends and attempt to intervene.

Here’s an example: A U.S. citizen from California named Andrea Velez was on her way to work when an ICE agent ran her over. The agent reported he was chasing someone else because that person didn’t want to talk to him. ICE accused Velez of deliberately stepping in the agent’s way and charged her with assault, but the case was dismissed.

Another U.S. citizen watching Velez get picked up and carried away for seemingly no reason attempted to block ICE from driving away with her. An agent pepper-sprayed him inches away from his eyes, and the man swiped back, knocking off the agent’s baseball hat. He, too, was arrested and charged with assault.

So we ended up with two purported assaults on ICE, both stemming from the decision to “go out on the streets” and grab random people. These interactions never would have happened under Biden because his administration prohibited racial profiling in immigration enforcement and focused enforcement on public safety threats who were usually already secured behind bars.

When Biden’s ICE did target someone on the streets, it was a carefully planned operation with numerous agents working as a team to catch a specific public safety threat — not random, unplanned encounters with unknown people. This intentionally focused on officer safety. ICE has overturned this policy so that it can maximize arrests and meet a 3,000-per-day arrest target set by the White House.

Which brings us to the incident that led ICE to blame me for assaults. In that case, two agents working alone pulled over a Hispanic driver after he dropped off his two young U.S. citizen children at school. ICE officers receive little training in traffic stops, and these two failed to ensure he had turned off his car and removed his keys — a common police practice — before they reached inside.

The result is chaos. DHS’ targets don’t know why they’re being approached or what their rights are.

The driver appears to have panicked when he realized the officers were ICE and started to back up. Video shows that rather than step away from the moving car, one ICE agent pulled a gun, while the other held on to the moving car with his hands. When the driver didn’t stop, the agent who initially held on to the car shot and killed him. Though the seconds just before the shooting were off camera, DHS says the agent was “dragged.”

In its X post, ICE claimed I caused assaults on its officers by spreading “misinformation” about the case. That misinformation? An NBC News report that showed ICE lied about some facts. ICE called the man a “criminal,” but he had no criminal record, just years-old traffic citations. ICE said the officer was “severely injured,” but the officer reported that he had only a few scrapes. “Nothing major,” he said.

But these discrepancies aren’t the most important point: This incident and injury to an ICE agent most likely wouldn’t have happened at all before Trump for several reasons.

First, ICE wouldn’t have targeted a noncriminal living here for decades. Second, it wouldn’t have sent two agents alone. Third, they wouldn’t have gone without a clear plan to arrest him safely.

Fourth, while we can’t know what motivated his attempted flight, many people are now well aware of the inhumanities that befall immigrants in Trump administration ICE custody — everything from months in horrific ICE detention centers away from their families to deportations to random authoritarian countries or even straight to foreign prisons.

By treating immigrants more humanely, Biden took away a reason to flee agents or potentially engage in physical confrontations. Humane immigration policy, focused on public safety threats, would also increase public support for ICE operations, reducing hostility in the community.

Contrary to ICE’s implication, I don’t want ICE officers to be harmed. Indeed, I am more interested in ICE officer safety than ICE itself is.

ICE cares more about running up the deportation numbers than protecting its officers. If ICE returned to Biden’s interior enforcement policies, officers, Americans and immigrants would all be safer.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251005-chicago-ice-vl-502p-c80f2d.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 19:57:28.986266

One order is specifically aimed at preparing for the possibility that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ramps up activity in the Emerald City.

Among multiple other steps to be taken by city departments, Harrell said he has directed the city council to come up with an ordinance that bans law enforcement from wearing face masks, except in limited situations. Agents would also be required to display visible emblems and badges that identify their agency.

“We have all seen photos and videos of masked ICE agents literally kidnapping people from neighborhoods, from our streets and sidewalks with impunity,” Harrell said. “Masked agents operating without clear identification diminish transparency, they erode accountability, and they sow fear in our communities. They are waging a campaign based on fear, and also creating a dangerous possibility for other bad actors.”

When asked how he would enforce this, Harrell suggested that it is the Seattle Police Department’s responsibility to carry out city ordinances, but clarified that specific enforcement structures are to be worked out in the weeks to come. The Seattle Police Department will be trained on how they are to respond should they receive a 911 report that masked or unidentified individuals are detaining people within the city.

Should the ordinance pass, Seattle will become the first major city to enact such a ban. The state of California passed a law in September that bars local and federal law enforcement from concealing their faces with masks.

Harrell plans to propose another piece of legislation that would ban federal immigration employees from staging in city parking lots, or conducting their operations on city property.

Preparing for a potential National Guard deployment

Harrell signed a second executive order Wednesday morning that outlines how the city and its departments will respond if Trump deploys that National Guard to Seattle.

Trump has attempted to deploy the guard to Chicago and Portland, two other sanctuary cities that have pushed back on ICE. Harrell said he has no knowledge of concrete plans by the Trump administration to send the National Guard to Seattle, but it’s being treated as a real possibility.

The order Harrell signed directs the city to proactively evaluate and prepare all legal options to challenge a National Guard deployment in court, and resist any encroachments on the roles and jurisdictions of the Seattle Police Department.

It seems as if the city is also proactively planning to referee between protestors and federal agents, should the National Guard be deployed. Harrell said the city “reaffirms its unwavering support for first amendment activities (and) protests,” but that officials will work directly with organizers in efforts to minimize the potential for conflicts.

""We want people to use their voice, that is part of our power, but we also don’t want to, as some would say, take the bait,” Harrell said Wednesday. “We don't want to see anyone in harm's way when we can't predict the abusive actions taken by our federal government.""",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/c9107680-6a0b-4576-a23d-2afce5fd20ff/20251008T194749/c9107680-6a0b-4576-a23d-2afce5fd20ff_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 16:58:39.830724

That led federal prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois to move to dismiss the charges Wednesday. Immigration officials had touted the arrests in the case last month, writing on social media that the defendants “will be prosecuted and held accountable.”

While the facts of every case are different and grand jury deliberations are secret, the bottom-line pattern of these rejections is impossible to ignore.

While the facts of every case are different and grand jury deliberations are secret, the bottom-line pattern of these rejections is impossible to ignore. It’s difficult to overstate how rare it is for grand juries to reject indictments — yet, these days, it’s not so unusual in the Trump Justice Department. Whether grand jurors are finding that prosecutors are overcharging, or grand jurors are refusing to return indictments despite finding sufficient evidence to proceed — or some combination thereof — this ongoing phenomenon is one of the most remarkable developments of Trump’s second term.

The Illinois dismissal coincided with the arraignment of former FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday morning, whose charges Trump himself had demanded. In that case, led by an inexperienced former Trump personal lawyer over the objection of career prosecutors, Washington-area grand jurors in Northern Virginia rejected one of the three counts proposed by the administration. Comey pleaded not guilty.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251008-chicago-protest-se-1117a-0e4b96.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 19:58:04.799486

The first Executive Order protects local communities and control over law enforcement resources in the event that federalized National Guard troops are deployed to Seattle. The second Executive Order strengthens services to immigrant and refugee communities and proposes legislation to prohibit the practice of masked, non-uniformed federal agents conducting immigration enforcement raids within the City, as well as an ordinance to prevent federal law enforcement from staging on or conducting immigration enforcement operations on City property.

“We are in a truly unprecedented time in modern history where the president is talking about using American cities as ‘training grounds’ for the military – a disturbing statement that shows his disrespect for the law and disregard for the collaboration it takes between all levels of government to ensure our country thrives,” said Mayor Harrell. “As I said last week in partnership with Governor Bob Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown, we do not need federal troops in Seattle, and this dangerous strategy will only sow fear, distrust, and confusion in our communities. We cannot be under-prepared at this critical moment when President Trump is escalating his attacks on cities and carrying out his cruel deportation agenda on our immigrant and refugee neighbors with warrantless arrests by masked, un-identifiable officers. These Executive Orders are proactive steps we can take to protect our communities and values.”

Together, the Executive Orders will:

Coordinate legal and intergovernmental actions:

Proactively evaluate and prepare all available legal options, ensuring readiness in the event of unlawful troop deployment.

Establish coordination citywide if federalized troops are deployed, creating a task force so there is a clear process and communication in place.

Ensure clear lines of communication and coordination with the Governor, Attorney General’s Office, City Attorney’s Office, and community.

Increase transparency around immigration enforcement:

Develop an ordinance to ban the use of face masks by law enforcement, with limited exceptions, in the City of Seattle and require law enforcement officials to have visible emblems and badges that identify their agency.

Develop an ordinance that prohibits federal law enforcement from staging on or conducting immigration enforcement operations on City property.

Provide the Seattle Police Department clear guidance on how to respond to 911 calls where masked or unidentified individuals are detaining people in the City.

Maintain local control and accountability of the Seattle Police Department (SPD):

Strengthen policies preventing unconstitutional and unlawful encroachment on the roles, responsibilities, and jurisdiction of SPD by the federal government.

Reaffirm that SPD has no role in federal civil immigration enforcement, which is solely the responsibility of the federal government.

Protect First Amendment activities:

Reaffirm the City’s unwavering support for First Amendment activities, and in the event of unilateral troop deployment, directs the City to work with organizers to keep protests peaceful and minimize the potential for conflict.

So far this year, President Trump has deployed and threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Memphis, and Portland. Last month, a federal judge ruled that President Trump’s use of military troops in Los Angeles was illegal. Last week, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the state’s National Guard in Portland, finding no legal basis for deployment. The Trump administration attempted to circumvent the order by sending California National Guard to the city, which the judge also blocked over the weekend.

President Trump has justified his deployment of troops in American cities to address crime and restore safety. In Seattle, SPD data shows that violent crime, property crime, and shots fired incidents are down compared to last year, and homicides are down 41% compared to 2024. Additionally, SPD is making record-breaking progress to restore police staffing, with nearly 130 officers hired so far this year.

“True public safety is not something that can be achieved by parachuting federal troops into Seattle. Policing is a profession that demands training, accountability, and a deep understanding of our communities,” said Police Chief Shon Barnes. “Decisions about Seattle’s safety should be based on facts and community feedback — not political talking points from people who do not live here and have no stake in our neighborhoods. The Seattle Police Department remains committed to evidence-based policing and building trust and real partnerships with our diverse communities.”

The City has advanced multiple legal and legislative steps to protect residents from the Trump administration’s unlawful actions and funding cuts, including legislation to strengthens local protections for people seeking gender-affirming and reproductive health care; a lawsuit over DEI and gender ideology Executive Orders and unlawful conditioning of funds; a lawsuit challenging threats to cities with sanctuary policies; and a lawsuit over frozen counterterrorism funds through the Securing the Cities program.

The Mayor’s 2026 proposed budget also includes a $27.6 million investment plan to safeguard essential services threatened by federal funding cuts, including shelter, rental assistance, and food access programs, and a 70% increase in funding for immigrant and refugee services including legal supports, Know Your Rights trainings, and workforce development.

As part of the Executive Order, the Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (OIRA) is launching a One Seattle Community Resource Fair series for community members and service providers. The events will connect residents with City services and resources from local community-based organizations. The first resource fair was Monday, October 6 and similar resource fairs are planned for the coming months.

“The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs will devote resources and expertise to our close coordination with the Mayor’s office and other City departments, as outlined in both executive orders. A connected, fearless approach is what is needed right now to provide trust and safety during any potential deployment of the national guard, an encroachment purely meant to disrupt local control and threaten immigrant and refugee residents,” said OIRA Director Hamdi Mohamed. “Seattle’s immigrant residents are best served when they are empowered and informed about their rights, not targeted and misrepresented. The One Seattle approach outlined in these executive orders, along with coordination between state partners and community organizations, echoes loud and clear that Seattle will remain a Welcoming City.”

Additionally, OIRA will re-launch the Immigrant and Refugee Commission, following a brief hiatus earlier this year and is actively recruiting new members. The Commission advises the Mayor and City Council on issues directly impacting immigrants and refugees living and working in Seattle and supports advocacy and outreach efforts citywide.

What People Are Saying

King County Executive Shannon Braddock

“As public officials, transparency and trust are fundamental to our work, and we must stand by our values and stand up for the law. King County has continually pushed back against the Trump administration’s continued disregard for these principles and its unlawful actions, which only undermine public confidence in government. We stand united with our local and state leaders against this federal overreach in our community.”

Martiza Rivera, Seattle City Councilmember, District 4

“We must stand united in denouncing President Trump’s irrational and authoritarian actions. It is deeply disturbing and wrong that we are in this position – needing to prepare for an unwarranted deployment of Federal troops to our city. Unfortunately, it is essential that we do and do so as One Seattle. I support Mayor Harrell’s EO’s and am at the ready to work with him to protect ALL of our City’s residents.”

Dan Strauss, Seattle City Councilmember, District 6

“The president’s actions in Portland are not just unacceptable, they are unlawful. That’s not just me saying that. It was the ruling of a judge that he, himself appointed. Today’s executive order demonstrates another way we continue to harden our local government to withstand any threat from the Trump administration.”

Bob Kettle, Seattle City Councilmember, District 7

“There is simply no reason for the National Guard to be deployed in our city. We are on the job. As Chair of our Public Safety Committee, we have developed and implemented our Strategic Framework Plan, with nearly 30 pieces of legislation out of council, to help create a safer Seattle. Further, our military defends OUR nation. If it is seen as defending a partisan effort, then that vital concept is undercut with negative consequences long-term. We must continue to push back on such actions and rhetoric – we cannot normalize them.”

Sara Nelson, Seattle City Council President, Position 9 (At-Large)

“Seattle is prepared and ready to respond. If National Guard troops are ordered to Seattle, we will do all we can to prevent unmasked federal agents from intimidating our residents and we’re prepared to use all legal options to protect their rights and safety. We’re in close communication with the Governor, Attorney General’s Office, and City Attorney’s Office and we will support our Seattle Police Department in their mission – to protect and serve every person in our Seattle community – not to participate in the scare tactics of our federal government in uninvited immigration enforcement.”

Vanessa Reyes, Policy Manager, Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network (WAISN)

“As the largest statewide network for immigrant justice in Washington, we welcome the Mayor’s executive actions affirming Seattle’s commitment to safety, dignity and community autonomy. Restricting the use of masks by federal enforcement officers helps protect public trust and safety. When unidentified, armed individuals appear in our neighborhoods, community members understandably call 911, fearing kidnappings or violence. These situations harm not only immigrant communities but also strain local emergency systems and endanger all. Our communities deserve to know who is acting with state or federal authority. Likewise, starting military-style deployments undermines that public safety is rooted in trust, care, and local solutions, not intimidation or fear. These measures reflect Seattle’s dedication to protecting all residents, regardless of immigration status, and to rejecting tactics that threaten civil and constitutional rights as well as community wellbeing.”

Kathleen Carson, Board Member, Seattle Indivisible

“Seattle Indivisible joins this effort because our city must remain a place where no one lives in fear for who they are or where they come from. When federal agencies act outside the bounds of law or humanity, we have a duty to draw a line and defend our neighbors. This executive order is a statement of principle—that Seattle will not collaborate with cruelty. It will not give legitimacy to raids that tear families apart. It will not stand silent while human rights are violated in our streets. We know that words alone will not stop an armored vehicle or a deportation order. But solidarity—spoken clearly and lived out daily—still matters. It tells every person being targeted that they are not alone, and it tells every official planning escalation that we are watching, organizing, and will not yield. Our resolve is simple: whatever comes, Seattle Indivisible will stand with our immigrant and refugee neighbors and all being targeted by our federal government. Seattle will not be intimidated into abandoning its values.”",https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/10/EO-Signing-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 15:57:51.536783

FIRST ON FOX: The University of Chicago exclusively told Fox News Digital that it condemns violence after a professor at the school was charged with violent felonies during an anti-ICE riot in the city's suburbs, but will not say whether the professor is still teaching classes.

Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi was arrested and charged on Oct. 3 with two counts of aggravated battery to a government employee, a Class 3 felony, and two counts of resisting/obstructing peace, a Class A misdemeanor.

""Safety is a paramount concern at the University of Chicago,"" University of Chicago's director of public affairs Gerald McSwiggan told Fox News Digital.

FAR-LEFT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PROFESSOR CHARGED WITH VIOLENT FELONIES DURING ANTI-ICE RIOTS IN BROADVIEW

The university stopped short of specifically commenting on Abdelhadi's arrest, and despite multiple requests, would not say whether she is still actively teaching courses. As of Wednesday morning, her biography page on the school's website remained active.

Court records show that Abdelhadi requested a jury trial during an appearance in Cook County on Monday. Her attorney declined to comment.

Hours before her arrest, she posted photos on X of a line of Illinois State Police officers guarding the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, and chastised the state and Gov. J.B. Pritzker for using state resources for that purpose.

Rioters and protesters have clashed with authorities outside the facility for weeks.

Abdelhadi did not return a comment request, but she remained defiant in a post on her Bluesky account Monday.

I keep thinking about all our neighbors and siblings—hundreds in Chicago alone—who’ve been detained into the unknown of horrendous facilities. We owe them resistance.""

Abdelhadi appeared on far-left Truthout's ""Movement Memos"" podcast the day before her arrest, where she spewed menacing messages about ICE and towards fellow left-wingers.

""These people are terrorizing our communities and they’re setting up shop. I mean, in Broadview, ICE has been setting up shop in our backyard. Just brazenly taking up community resources to terrorize this very same community,"" she said.

Eswatini, the landlocked nation formerly known as Swaziland, is Africa’s last remaining absolute monarchy. It is the kind of place where King Mswati III—who took the throne as an 18-year-old four decades ago—can warn in a speech, as he did in 2023, that nobody should “complain if mercenaries kill” political activists. When one of the country’s leading human rights lawyers was murdered only hours later, the king’s representatives suggested there was no connection. No one was punished.

In other words, Eswatini is just the kind of country—small, untroubled by democracy, and presumably eager to avoid a superpower’s wrath—with which the Trump administration has been eager to do business.

In May, officials from the US and Eswatini signed a deal that allows the Trump administration to deport people from all over the world to the African nation. A copy of the arrangement I reviewed shows that the United States has agreed to pay Eswatini $5.1 million to take in up to 160 so-called “third-country nationals”—immigrants who came to the US with no ties to the country to which they are being deported.

In July, the first five of such men arrived in Eswatini, where they were sent to a maximum-security prison and detained in the country without any clear legal basis. Last weekend, the Trump administration sent 10 more people to the Eswatini prison. None of the 15 men sent to the nation are from Eswatini. But they are now under the authority of its king.

The situation is a “legal black hole,” according to Tin Thanh Nguyen, a North Carolina–based attorney who is representing five men from Vietnam and Laos now imprisoned in the African country. As he explained in a statement Monday: “I cannot call [my clients]. I cannot email them. I cannot communicate through local counsel because the Eswatini government blocks all attorney access.”

The arrangement with Eswatini, which has a population of 1.1 million, is similar to the deal that allowed the United States to send more than 200 Venezuelans to an infamous prison in El Salvador earlier this year. The Venezuelans sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT)—most of whom had no criminal history—were released in July as part of a prisoner swap following sustained international outrage. (As we reported, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeted many Venezuelans because of tattoos that the agency falsely claimed were evidence of gang membership.)

Although the CECOT disappearances led to international outrage, the Trump administration’s efforts to offload people to a prison in Eswatini, along with similar arrangements with South Sudan and other African nations, have attracted much less attention.

A practice that would have been unthinkable under past administrations is becoming normalized: sending ICE detainees, without due process, to far-flung prisons in countries with notorious human rights records.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin warned in a statement last month: “If you come to our country illegally, you could end up in CECOT or a country you didn’t even know existed.” Eswatini’s US Embassy also did not respond to a request for comment.

The legal pathway for third-country deportations became far easier over the summer.

In May, the Trump administration tried to summarily remove a small group of third-country nationals to South Sudan, despite a preliminary injunction from a federal judge in Massachusetts that clearly blocked the move. At an emergency hearing, Judge Brian Murphy found that DHS’s conduct was “unquestionably violative” of his preliminary injunction. He ordered the men not to be handed over to South Sudan.

In late June, the Supreme Court removed the protections Murphy put in place—effectively rewarding the Trump administration for flagrantly disobeying court orders. Justice Sonia Sotomayor excoriated the move in a dissent joined by Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan.

“Apparently,” Sotomayor wrote, “the Court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a District Court exceeded its remedial powers.” (At another point, Sotomayor compared the administration’s legal nitpicking in the case to an “arsonist who calls 911 to report firefighters for violating a local noise ordinance.”)

DHS quickly took advantage of the power granted it by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority.

In July, the department followed through on the South Sudan removals and announced the first five deportations to Eswatini. In a series of social media posts, DHS claimed the men were so “uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.” The posts said the men sent to Eswatini—who were from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen—had been convicted in the United States of serious criminal offenses, including murder and rape.

The severity of the crimes obscures the legal stakes of the case. All of the men DHS sent to Eswatini had served their sentences and been ordered deported. The question was (and is) not whether they can be deported, but whether the Trump administration has the authority to send people anywhere it wants, without due process, and imprison them in countries where the detainees have never broken any law.

Trina Realmuto, one of the lead lawyers in the case before Murphy, stressed that all of the class members she is representing have rights regardless of their criminal histories.

“But make no mistake,” said Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, “this is going to happen to people without criminal convictions.”

DHS did not name the people it sent to Eswatini but did share their photos. Through those photos, family members and friends in the United States learned that the men had been sent to a small kingdom on the other side of the world. It would be about two weeks before they were able to speak with them.

Nguyen, the North Carolina immigration lawyer, and two other American lawyers who took the cases of the men in Eswatini began working with Sibusiso Nhlabatsi, who is well known in Eswatini for his work as a human rights lawyer.

Nhlabatsi was also a colleague and close friend of Thulani Maseko, the activist and lawyer who was killed in 2023 while watching television at home with his wife and two young children. No one has been held accountable for his friend’s murder, and Nhlabatsi said he fears for his own “safety every day” due to his work. “It’s a risk that you have to take,” he told me. “Unfortunately, sometimes you have to pay the highest price.”

So far, Nhlabatsi’s efforts to represent the people sent to Eswatini from the United States have been thwarted by the kingdom. For the first time in his career, Nhlabatsi said prison officials have repeatedly denied him the chance to meet with his clients at the prison.

In response, Nhlabatsi filed suit to try to force the courts in Eswatini to allow him access to the men deported from the United States. But what has happened since has been Kafkaesque.

After taking the government to court, Nhlabatsi said a legal adviser for the country’s prison system told him that he would be able to meet his clients. But when he returned to the Matsapha Correctional Complex, which houses the maximum-security prison where the men are being held, Nhlabatsi said he was “pushed from pillar to post” and made to wait hours. Finally, Nhlabatsi said the head of the prison told him that he would not be able to meet with his clients after all. The reason was absurd: The prison director claimed the men were refusing to see him.

A close friend of Roberto Mosquera, the Cuban national sent to Eswatini in July, said Mosquera told her during a brief call that he never refused to meet with Nhlabatsi. She said officials in Eswatini “just blatantly lie and say that Mr. Mosquera refuses counsel.”

Mia Unger, an immigration attorney at the Legal Aid Society in New York, represented a man sent to Eswatini named Orville Etoria. “He requested to speak with us numerous times, and he wasn’t allowed,” Unger said. “They didn’t allow him to call us.”

Etoria’s story is particularly galling because there appears to be no basis for DHS’s claim that Jamaica, his home country, refused to take him back. Unger said Etoria, who was convicted of murder nearly three decades ago and released from prison in 2021, was asked by ICE to obtain a Jamaican passport at a check-in earlier this year. He got the passport, went to another ICE check-in in June, and was taken into custody. “There was never any question of whether he was able to go to Jamaica,” Unger said. As a result, it should have been illegal to send him to Eswatini. (US law makes it clear that people can be deported to third countries only when it is “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible” to send them to countries to which they have close ties.)

After Etoria arrived in Eswatini, Jamaica’s government immediately made clear that it had not refused to take him back. And in September, after being imprisoned for two months at Matsapha, Etoria returned to the Caribbean island. (A Mexican national sent to South Sudan was also repatriated after the Mexican government facilitated his return.)

Alma David, an immigration attorney with Novo Legal, is representing Mosquera and Kassim Saleh Wasil, a Yemeni national in Eswatini. She told me the head of the Matsapha prison said via WhatsApp that the only way to have an unmonitored conversation with her clients would be for her or another attorney to come in person. She noted that Nhlabatsi had tried and been repeatedly turned away. In response, David said the prison chief told her that Nhlabatsi needed to go to the US Embassy to get permission to meet with his clients.

It is unclear what the actual policies are. “It’s a monarchy,” David explained. “Nobody wants to be the person who does the wrong thing or does the thing they’re not supposed to do. But nobody really knows what they’re supposed to be doing.”

“All of these people had served their sentences,” she stressed of the men sent to Eswatini. “They were living in the community and were not considered a danger to anybody until one day, they were picked up and sent to Eswatini.”

When we first spoke late last month, Nhlabatsi said he would soon be in court to secure an order allowing him to meet with the men sent from the United States. Last Friday, he said the court ordered him to have access. But it came with a major caveat: The government immediately appealed the judgment.

It means that Nhlabatsi is likely months away from being able to meet with his clients—if he is able to do so at all. The goal appears to be to try to stonewall until the men are removed from Eswatini, at which point their claims would become moot.

Nhlabatsi said the case has become big news in his country. Many residents have not been happy to learn that their government is holding people convicted of serious crimes in the United States. In contrast to the propaganda video El Salvador released after Venezuelans arrived at CECOT, Eswatini’s government seems to have tried to draw as little attention as possible to what it’s doing on behalf of the United States. (Nhlabatsi said he does not believe that the men are being physically abused while in custody but added that being in prison is bad enough.)

ICE is now doubling down on these deportations. Nguyen, the North Carolina lawyer, said ICE told a group of men in detention in the United States on Saturday that they were about to be deported to Eswatini. Nguyen said the new group of deportees includes people from Cambodia, Chad, Cuba, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Flight tracking records indicate that the plane carrying them arrived in the nation around midnight Monday. (Unlike the first five people sent to Eswatini, this group was able to make short calls after arriving in the country, according to Nguyen.)

Court records show that Mosquera, the Cuban national sent to Eswatini in July, was arrested in 1988 and later convicted of attempted first-degree murder. (ICE has incorrectly claimed that he was convicted of homicide.) He later was ordered deported, but the federal government was apparently unable to remove him to Cuba, which has often refused to accept deportees. Following additional arrests in 2008 and 2015, Mosquera was convicted of offenses including grand theft auto, assaulting a law enforcement official, and misdemeanor assault.

Mosquera’s close friend, who requested anonymity due to fear of potential retaliation by ICE, said Mosquera had “paid his dues to society” and had turned his life around by the time he was detained by ICE at a routine check-in in June. She said Mosquera, who came to the US as a boy more than 40 years ago, should never have been sent to a prison in a country where he has never committed a crime.

“I used to believe in the Constitution,” Mosquera’s friend said. “I used to believe that I lived in the greatest country in the world.” She explained that she was born in the US after her parents left Cuba in the early 1960s. “But this is not the America that I grew up in,” she continued. “This is a whole different America.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25262501672131-master.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-10-08 15:57:54.847166

""Every single week I would ask myself, is this when everything is going to fall apart and explode, and I'm still waiting for it, but we're getting closer,"" said Allison Cutler, an immigration attorney from New York Legal Assistance Group who is in court at 26 Federal Plaza almost every day.

New York City has seen 460 ICE arrests this year through July that likely took place in immigration court, more than in any other city, a new analysis of federal data found. The estimates, by mathematician Joseph Gunther, are the first attempt to quantify arrests in immigration courts at a national level.

Gunther identified nearly 2,400 ICE arrests likely made in immigration courts across the country, a total he said may still be an undercount. The analysis fills a gap left by the lack of DHS reporting on how many arrests ICE has made in or around courts.

Those arrested very rarely had criminal records, the analysis found. Over 90% had only civil immigration charges, such as crossing the border illegally.

ICE did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the analysis, but Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a May news release that ""arrests of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense.""

""It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be,"" she said. ""These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons.""

To quantify courthouse arrests, Gunther cross-referenced data on ICE arrests from the Deportation Data Project with data on immigration court hearings from the Executive Office for Immigration Review. ICE data does not have precise location information on arrests. But by comparing dates, places and demographic information between the two datasets, Gunther compiled a list of arrests that likely took place on the same day as a court hearing. The methodology was reviewed by two immigration experts.

""These are the first general estimates of something that shouldn't be secret in the first place,"" Gunther said. ""It shouldn't be necessary at all to do this drawn-out data analysis to know such basic facts.""

ICE began making arrests at immigration courts in late May, when DHS rescinded Biden-era guidance limiting them.

DHS attorneys then began moving to dismiss cases and initiate expedited removal proceedings. Once immigrants face expedited removal, they are detained and are not entitled to any more hearings before a judge.

Previously, expedited removal had been mostly limited to migrants encountered near the border. In January, the Trump administration expanded that to apply to undocumented immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who entered less than two years ago.

On Aug. 30, a federal judge paused this expansion, blocking ICE's strategy of fast-tracking deportations of those with dismissed cases.

ICE is also arresting immigrants in court with ongoing cases, immigration attorneys and court watchers said.

""A lot of immigration judges say, I'm going to give you another court date, but I don't know what will happen when you leave this court room,"" said Dee Ann Croucher, a volunteer who observes hearings in El Paso multiple times a week. ""I saw a lady just break down sobbing when they said that to her.""

The woman was detained in the hallway after the hearing, Croucher said.

Immigrants arrested in court are often transferred far from home and family, limiting access to legal representation and sometimes placing them in a more conservative court system, immigration attorneys said.

A CBS News analysis of the arrests Gunther identified found that nearly all were transferred to another facility, often hundreds of miles away. Those arrested in New York were moved an average of more than 1,000 miles away, often to Texas or Louisiana.

Some have been released from detention after federal judges ruled their detainment was unlawful, but not everyone has the legal resources to file a petition, said Hasan Shafiqullah, immigration supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society.

""Many people are languishing in detention,"" he said. ""Because detention is so terrible, people are often giving up and just saying, ""You know what? Just give me a deportation order.""

In Miami, some are choosing to self-deport after ICE arrested them in court, said Miami immigration attorney Antonio Ramos, whose office is in the same building as the court.

Miami's immigration court sees the second-most hearings for non-detained immigrants, following New York. There have been about a third of estimated in-court arrests in Miami than in New York this year, according to the analysis.

New York City's immigration courts see more non-detained hearings than any other city. Cutler, the New York immigration attorney, said that ICE agents have told her they are specifically targeting New York City because of its sanctuary policies.

""I've had officials tell me this to my face that they are punishing New York,"" she said. ""They would say, when New York stops being a sanctuary city, that is when we will leave.""

DHS has been clear that New York and other cities with sanctuary policies will be the target of increased enforcement, but did not respond to inquiries from CBS News about how they choose which courts to deploy ICE officers to.

Following New York, Gunther's analysis found there were 190 ICE arrests in El Paso that likely took place in immigration court. Immigration courts in the Los Angeles area — within the city itself and in Van Nuys and Santa Ana — also had a high number of estimated arrests when combined, at 282.

Immigration advocates who observed the arrests in El Paso's court described a less hostile atmosphere and no instances of excessive force. In one case, volunteers were able to negotiate with ICE agents to allow a noncitizen with a medical disorder to be electronically monitored instead of being detained, said Emily Miller, program manager at the Border Immigration Law and Justice Center in El Paso.

""We have developed a cordial relationship with ICE,"" said Miller, who helps coordinate a group of volunteer court watchers. ""Whether we agree with what [ICE is] doing or not, there is no yelling and filming taking place anymore. At the beginning, there was yelling and filming, we saw ICE be more forceful, that has stopped.""

Twenty-one of the arrests in El Paso were of children who were arrested with their family members, the analysis estimated. It identifies a total of 73 children arrested, almost all in Texas or the Los Angeles area, and none in New York.

The Biden-era memo had prohibited courthouse arrests because it would ""disincentivize noncitizens from appearing for their hearings."" When a noncitizen does not appear for their hearing, an immigration judge may order them removed ""in absentia.""

Immigrants face ""an impossible catch 22,"" said Amy Belsher, supervising attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union: show up to court and risk arrest, or stay home and receive a deportation order.

The rate of ""in absentia"" removal orders have ticked upward from 46% of non-detained case completions in May, when the arrests first started, to 52% in August.

""It's going to do lasting and irreparable harm to noncitizens' trust in government systems,"" Belsher said.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/07/2bdab084-d418-427d-8207-4994409f283b/thumbnail/1200x630/2281a3a2f4f84d0e523e8ef836b63925/gettyimages-2239572864.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 14:56:31.767510

However, the country’s migration pathways do not take into account the effects of climate change and disasters.
This includes the Pacific Access Category Resident Visa (PAC), which provides permanent residency to a limited number of nationals of Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tonga and Fiji.
“Taking action on climate change and displacement is no longer a political choice but a legal obligation.
“In 2015 we applied for the PAC visa and in 2016 my husband left with our daughter.","Over recent years, as climate change and disasters deepen social inequalities and economic hardship across the Pacific, many have felt their best option is to migrate. For many Tuvaluans and I-Kiribati, Aotearoa New Zealand is the most viable destination given the countries’ close historic and cultural ties.

However, the country’s migration pathways do not take into account the effects of climate change and disasters. This includes the Pacific Access Category Resident Visa (PAC), which provides permanent residency to a limited number of nationals of Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tonga and Fiji.

The PAC scheme is only available to people between 18 and 45 years of age, who can secure a job offer and prove they have an “acceptable standard of health”. This excludes anyone with impairments that are associated with a disability, as well as anyone living with certain medical conditions perceived to represent a cost for Aotearoa New Zealand.

“For many people in Tuvalu and Kiribati, staying or leaving is not a matter of choice but survival,” Agnès Callamard said. “Pacific Island communities have shown extraordinary resilience in pursuing adaptation and mitigation strategies to enable people to remain on their lands, but the Aotearoa New Zealand government needs to do more to support them, without discrimination.”

It is simply unacceptable for a high emitting country like Aotearoa New Zealand to claim it cannot take people apparently due to the cost they could generate, especially knowing that people with disabilities face increased risks during climate-induced extreme weather events.

Agnès Callamard

Amnesty International met with several individuals with disabilities and their families, who were separated as a result of the visa requirements.

Alieta, a teacher and mother from Tuvalu with a visual impairment, had to remove her name from her family’s PAC application to enable her six-year-old daughter and husband to go to Aotearoa New Zealand in 2016. She has been separated from them ever since.

Talking about the impact of climate change, Alieta explained: “When the high tide came, the whole road and the house flooded… that’s why I want to move away from the sea.” She said that she agreed to her daughter going to New Zealand because she wants a better life for her, even though she finds it very hard to be apart.

“In the beginning I was not angry at New Zealand. I kept on asking for a visa… But I am sad for my daughter. I didn’t want to be separated from my daughter. It is hard on children.”

Agnès Callamard said: “It is simply unacceptable for a high emitting country like Aotearoa New Zealand to claim it cannot take people apparently due to the cost they could generate, especially knowing that people with disabilities face increased risks during climate-induced extreme weather events.”

Tuvalu and Kiribati – on average two metres above sea level – are particularly exposed to the effects of sea level rise. Coastal erosion, floods and droughts, as well as water and soil contamination and salinisation, dramatically limit the availability of drinking water and land to grow food and build homes. This is having a particularly severe impact on people’s health, particularly older people and those living with disabilities.

Aleki, who lives with her husband, her four children and her sister’s family in Funafuti, Tuvalu’s capital, told Amnesty International that obtaining clean drinking water has become a challenge: “We take buckets and go to the government building for filtered water every day for drinking.”

There are heat waves, droughts and king tides and they have destroyed all these plants.

A 56-year-old I-Kiribati woman

Soil contamination from salty water, which renders it unusable for growing most crops, is such an issue in Kiribati that the island is now nearly entirely dependent on imported food, which is often limited in variety and prohibitively expensive.

A 56-year-old I-Kiribati woman told Amnesty International: “In Kiribati you hardly find good food. You can find only rice and canned stuff. You don’t have vegetables or stuff like that. We don’t grow our food at home. There are heat waves, droughts and king tides and they have destroyed all these plants.”

The situation is also precarious for people who manage to reach Aotearoa New Zealand and fall into irregular status after their visas expire. With no access to dedicated protection mechanisms, those in this situation live with the constant fear of deportation, and are unable to access public services, including healthcare and education.

Under international human rights law, everyone has the right to be protected against forcible removal to a place where they would be at real risk of serious human rights violations, including due to climate change and disasters.

“Amnesty International is calling on Aotearoa New Zealand to urgently reform its immigration policies to align with a rights-based approach to climate displacement. In doing so, the government must develop and implement policies consistent with Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Indigenous Peoples’ rights,” Agnès Callamard said.

The Pacific is sounding the alarm. If the world fails to act here, it will fail everywhere.

Agnès Callamard

This would include offering dedicated humanitarian visas that prioritize those who are unable to meet the existing immigration requirements, to ensure the rights, including family unit, of those migrating. Dedicated protection mechanisms against deportation are also needed, including suspension of deportations for nationals of Tuvalu and Kiribati.

“Aotearoa New Zealand – and the international community at large – must act now to protect, respect and promote the rights and dignity of Pacific People in the face of the climate crisis, both at home and in their country of destination. Anything less is a betrayal of our shared responsibility to uphold human rights and ensure climate justice,” Agnès Callamard said.

“Taking action on climate change and displacement is no longer a political choice but a legal obligation. The Pacific is sounding the alarm. If the world fails to act here, it will fail everywhere.”

Alieta, 55, is a teacher and mother from Tuvalu with a visual impairment. In 2016, she was left with no choice but to remove her name from her family’s PAC visa application to enable her husband and six-year-old daughter to go to Aotearoa New Zealand. She has never been able to visit her daughter in Aotearoa New Zealand after all her visitor visa applications got rejected.

“In 2015 we applied for the PAC visa and in 2016 my husband left with our daughter. We went to Fiji, but I got stuck there waiting. I stayed there to try and re-apply for my own visa. The first time, with the PAC application, I was not accepted because of my disability. I have low visibility; I can only see short distances.

The first form [registration to the ballot] does not mention disabilities. It is only at the second stage that the forms say that people with disability cannot apply. I was sad during the application process. I would not have applied for the family to go in the first place if I had known that they would not accept people with disability. I did not want our family to be separated.

I have a disability, but I wanted my daughter to be proud of me. I was thinking if I went to New Zealand, I would try my best to find a good job there, so that she would be proud of me, of what I would be doing for her.

When the high tide came, the whole road and the house flooded

I wanted [my husband] to have a good job for schooling our daughter and I think of climate change here. I am scared of climate change.

Climate change and people with disabilities… It’s very difficult for us. I was staying in a place very near to the sea, between the ocean and the lagoon. When the high tide came, the whole road and the house flooded. The rain came into the house. In these situations, it is difficult for us as people with disabilities to move around, but [staying in] the house is not safe either. During bad weather, we just stay inside… that’s why I want to move away from the sea.

I was trying to be strong for my daughter

When my daughter said goodbye, at boarding time, she was crying and said: ‘Oh mum, I don’t want to go, I want you to come!’ I was trying to be strong for my daughter, I wanted my daughter to go so to give her an education. I wanted a good life for her future. [As a teacher], I had followed early childhood education courses, so I knew how hard it would be for my child. I was not showing her how weak I was feeling.

After they left in 2015, I met them only once, in Fiji, in 2017 for a one-month visit. I call my daughter and talk to her, but since then, we never met again. I speak to my daughter, but my husband has blocked me… The first time, with the PAC application, I could not go. I went to the people’s lawyer here in Tuvalu, and he said to reapply again for a visa. I applied for a visitor visa from Fiji in 2017 and was still rejected. I applied 2-3 times, and it was always declined. I paid AU$200-300 for each application.

Immigrants form a growing share of the U.S. population and workforce, and as of 2024, there were over 50 million immigrants residing in the country. President Trump’s agenda has focused on restricting immigration and enhancing immigration enforcement, which research shows has negative impacts on the mental and physical health of immigrant families, including the millions of U.S. citizen children living in them, as well as broader economic effects on communities. The Trump administration and Congress also have made policy changes that further restrict access to health coverage and care for immigrant families.

This issue brief provides an overview of Trump administration and Congressional actions that are likely to impact immigrants’ access to health coverage and care, including new restrictions on eligibility for health coverage and services as well as changes in immigration enforcement and other policies. Together, these changes will likely increase uninsured rates and reduce access to care among immigrants and their children. Over the long-term, these changes may also lead to worse health outcomes and have negative impacts on the U.S. economy and workforce, given the major role immigrants play, particularly in certain industries, including health care, agriculture, and construction.

Reductions in Access to Health Coverage

The 2025 tax and budget law includes significant cuts to the Medicaid program as well as eligibility restrictions that make many lawfully present immigrants (LPIs) ineligible for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces, and Medicare coverage. Under the new law (H.R.1), eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP, subsidized Marketplace coverage, and Medicare will be limited to lawful permanent residents (LPRs or “green card” holders), Cuban or Haitian entrants, and citizens of Compact of Free Association (COFA) residing in the U.S (Table 1). States can also maintain Medicaid and CHIP coverage for lawfully residing pregnant people or children covered through a state option as well as through the “From-Conception to End of Pregnancy” option, which provides coverage to low-income children regardless of their parent’s immigration status. This change will make many groups of lawfully present immigrants ineligible for coverage, including refugees, asylees, people with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), as well as individuals on work visas, among others. The law also eliminates eligibility for subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage for all lawfully present immigrants with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) who do not qualify for Medicaid coverage due to immigration status. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that these coverage restrictions will result in 1.4 million LPIs becoming uninsured with $131 billion in reduced federal spending and $4.8 billion in increased federal revenues by 2034. There is no effect on coverage of undocumented immigrants, who are already ineligible for all federally funded health coverage. Some states use their own money to provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants.

The new eligibility restrictions for lawfully present immigrants have staggered implementation dates. The eligibility restrictions for Medicare became effective July 4, 2025 (the date that the 2025 tax and budget law was enacted), and current beneficiaries subject to the new restrictions will be disenrolled from coverage no later than 18 months from enactment of the legislation (January 4, 2027). Eligibility for subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage for lawfully present immigrants with incomes below 100% FPL ends January 1, 2026, while the other restrictions for subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage take effect as of January 1, 2027. The eligibility restrictions for Medicaid and CHIP go into effect October 1, 2026 (Table 2).

Beyond changes in the law, enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which will make coverage unaffordable for many immigrants and likely lead to coverage losses. Without renewal of the enhanced tax credits, average premiums could rise by over 75%, and in some states, they may even double. As a result, total Marketplace enrollment is projected to fall from 22.8 million in 2025 to 18.9 million in 2026 and 15.4 million by 2030. Without enhanced subsidies, many immigrants who remain eligible could lose access to affordable coverage, particularly in states that have not expanded Medicaid to adults.

Some states also have reduced or eliminated state-funded coverage designed to fill gaps in federally funded coverage for immigrants. Three states (California, Illinois, and Minnesota) plus D.C. have recently proposed or enacted budgets to end or limit new enrollment of adults in state-funded health coverage programs for immigrants regardless of immigration status as part of broader efforts to reduce state budget deficits.

Regulations published by the Trump Administration in June 2025 eliminated ACA Marketplace eligibility for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients on August 25, 2025. Under earlier policy, individuals with DACA status were not considered lawfully present for purposes of health coverage eligibility and remained ineligible for Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA Marketplace coverage despite having a deferred action status, which otherwise qualified for Marketplace coverage. These eligibility restrictions left DACA recipients ineligible for federally funded health coverage programs. The Biden administration published regulations that made DACA recipients newly eligible to purchase ACA Marketplace coverage with premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions beginning November 1, 2024. Following legal challenges, implementation of the Biden administration regulations was limited to 31 states and D.C. New regulations published by the Trump administration once again made DACA recipients in all states and D.C. ineligible for ACA Marketplace coverage. Most states will terminate coverage for enrolled DACA recipients on September 30, 2025.

The Trump administration published new guidance regarding verification of citizenship and immigration status of Medicaid enrollees, which could contribute to disenrollment due to challenges providing documentation. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), states will be required to separately verify the citizenship or immigration status of individuals whose status cannot be confirmed through federal databases such as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system based on monthly enrollment reports. Under already existing policies, in addition to meeting other eligibility requirements, lawfully present immigrants must have a “qualified non-citizen” status to be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, and many, including most lawful permanent residents or “green card” holders, must wait five years after obtaining qualified status before they may enroll. States already are required to verify citizenship and immigration status with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) SAVE system to determine eligibility for Medicaid coverage at the initial application and provide Medicaid benefits to applicants during a “reasonable opportunity period” of 90 days while their immigration status is being verified, if they otherwise meet all eligibility criteria. Although some implementation details of the new verification process announced by CMS remain unclear, it is possible that states will need to re-verify the eligibility of enrollees identified in reports and applicants may need to provide paperwork as proof of their eligible immigration status for manual verification, which could increase administrative burdens on both states and applicants or enrollees and potentially lead to coverage losses due to administrative challenges.

Restricted Access to Health and Other Services

The Trump administration issued a policy change that expands the list of health and other service programs that certain immigrants are prohibited from accessing. On July 14, 2025, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a notice of a policy change to update the definition of “federal public benefits” as outlined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) to add an additional 13 programs to the 31 programs considered “federal public benefits” that are restricted to individuals with a “qualified” immigration status. The notice further indicates that the updated list of federal benefits is not exhaustive, and additional programs may be added in the future. Among the 13 new programs added to the list are Head Start, the Health Center Program, and the Title X family planning program, among others (Box 1). This change bars many groups of lawfully present immigrants as well as undocumented immigrants from accessing several health care, educational, and other social services and will likely have negative impacts on the health and well-being of immigrant families. It also may create new challenges and complexities for service providers. This policy change was expected to take effect immediately upon publication of the notice in the federal register on July 14, 2025, although it provided for a 30-day comment period. However, the HHS had to delay implementation until September 11, 2025, following court orders. Further, on September 10, 2025, a District Court issued an injunction on the administration’s new policy, blocking the implementation of the policy as it relates to the Health Center Program and Head Start in 20 states and D.C.

Enhanced Immigration Enforcement

President Trump also has increased immigration enforcement activity to support mass deportation and detention, which research shows negatively impacts the health and well-being of immigrant families. The administration has shifted enforcement actions from focusing on criminals and recent border crossers to prioritizing all of the estimated 14 million undocumented immigrants for deportation, even though many have some form of temporary deportation protections. As a result, there have been increased worries about detention and deportation among immigrants, including among naturalized citizens, and immigrant families with undocumented immigrants report that immigration-related fears have worsened their mental health and well-being. KFF survey data from March 2025 find that about a third (32%) of immigrants overall say they have experienced negative health repercussions due to worries about their own or a family member’s immigration status (Figure 1). Immigrants also reported they avoided seeking health care due to concerns about costs and fears, were fearful of accessing public programs, and were confused whether these programs can negatively impact immigration status.

In January 2025, the Trump administration rescinded longstanding protections that prohibited immigration enforcement action in certain areas including health care facilities, schools, and places of worship. Based on a memorandum originally issued by the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in 2011, immigration enforcement actions were prohibited from occurring in “sensitive locations” such as health care facilities, schools, and places of worship, with limited exceptions. In 2021, the Biden administration issued an updated memorandum further strengthening and expanding these protections by including disaster relief areas and other sites of essential services on the list of “sensitive locations”. Following the recission of these longstanding protections by the Trump administration, there have been reports of ICE agents showing up at hospitals. Some health care facilities have invested resources into training staff on how to comply with the new policy. Health care providers also have expressed concerns about the new policy deterring individuals in immigrant families from seeking health care. In KFF focus groups conducted with likely undocumented Hispanic immigrants, several participants talked about avoiding seeking health care due to concerns about potential enforcement risks.

Immigration-related worries may be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s actions to share Medicaid enrollee information with enforcement officials. In June 2025, there were reports of the Trump administration sharing the personal and health data of noncitizen Medicaid enrollees with the DHS for purposes of immigration enforcement despite concerns related to the violations of federal and state data privacy protections. A federal court in California issued a preliminary injunction in August 2025 that temporarily blocks the Trump administration from sharing enrollee data for the purposes of immigration enforcement in 20 states that filed a lawsuit against the administration. Breaches or sharing of Medicaid enrollees’ information for purposes other than the provision of health coverage and care pose risks for individuals and may jeopardize confidence in the security of data held by agencies. They may also exacerbate immigration-related fears, potentially leading to immigrants and their children foregoing enrollment in health coverage or seeking health care.

“Immigration enforcement” is defined as all efforts to investigate, enforce, or assist in the investigation or enforcement of any federal civil immigration law or federal criminal immigration law that penalizes a person’s presence or employment in the United States.
“Immigration officer” means any state, local, or federal law enforcement officer who is seeking to enforce immigration law.
The CDE encourages all California school districts to make these resources visible and accessible to families.","On September 20, 2025, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill (“AB”) 49, known as the “California Safe Haven Schools Act,” and Senate Bill (“SB”) 98 regarding immigration activity and enforcement in K-12 and postsecondary educational institutions. Both bills contained urgency language and therefore took effect immediately.

Please note that these newly enacted laws build on AB 699 and AB 21, both of which established policies and protocols to be followed in the event immigration activity and enforcement were to take place at California’s educational institutions with the goal of protecting all students irrespective of their immigration status, including those who are undocumented. AB 699 and AB 21, in addition to SB 54, known as the “California Values Act,” were addressed in our prior Alert.

Assembly Bill 49

Effective immediately, AB 49 amended Education Code section 234.7 of the Education Code regarding immigration enforcement officers’ access to school property. Existing law prevents local educational agencies (“LEAs”) from collecting information or documents regarding citizenship or immigration status of pupils or their family members. Existing law also requires a superintendent to inform the governing school board if immigration enforcement officials make a request for information or access to a school site for the purpose of enforcing immigration laws.

AB 49 expands section 234.7, subsection (a) to require an immigration enforcement officer or agent to present proper supporting documentation in order to enter school sites. Specifically, section 234.7 now prohibits an officer or employee of an agency conducting immigration enforcement from entering a nonpublic area of a school site without the following:

Valid identification, and

A valid judicial warrant, judicial subpoena, or a court order.

Section 234.7, as amended by AB 49, also prohibits LEAs from disclosing any personal information about a pupil or pupil’s family to an officer or employee of an agency conducting immigration enforcement, without the written consent of the pupil’s guardian(s). “Personal information” includes, but is not limited to, information about a pupil’s place of residence, education records, and travel schedule.

Lastly, AB 49 requires LEAs to maintain and update its policy limiting assistance with immigration enforcement by March 1, 2026, to align with the new requirements of AB 49 regarding immigration enforcement at public schools. LEAs are also required under AB 49 to make their policy available to the California Department of Education upon its request. AB 49 further requires the California Attorney General to update its model policies by December 1, 2025. LEAs can comply with the policy requirements by adopting the Attorney General’s model policies.

Senate Bill 98

SB 98 requires certain California postsecondary educational institutions to inform its community about any immigration-related activities expected to occur, occurring, or scheduled to occur, on campus. Specifically, effective immediately, SB 98 amends Education Code sections 32282, 47605, 47605.6, 47606.3, and 66093.3 to require postsecondary educational institutions to immediately notify all pupils, parents, faculty, staff, and other community members of certain postsecondary educational institutions of the presence of immigration officers on campus.

Additionally, SB 98 requires the following institutions of higher education to implement various precautionary measures, explained in greater detail below, when federal immigration enforcement activities take place on campus:

The California State University system

The Governing Boards of the Community College Districts

Independent Institutions of Higher Education which are Cal Grant qualified.

SB 98 also requests the Regents of the University of California to comply as well.

As part of above-referenced precautionary measures, postsecondary educational institutions are required to advise all students, faculty, and staff that they should notify the office of the chancellor or the president as soon as possible if they receive information that an immigration officer is “expected to enter, will enter, or has entered the campus to execute a federal immigration order.”

This newly enacted law also requires these postsecondary educational institutions to notify all students, faculty, staff, and community members when the presence of immigration enforcement is confirmed on campus. The notice shall include the date and time the immigration enforcement was confirmed, the location of the confirmed immigration enforcement, and a hyperlink to additional resources.

“Immigration enforcement” is defined as all efforts to investigate, enforce, or assist in the investigation or enforcement of any federal civil immigration law or federal criminal immigration law that penalizes a person’s presence or employment in the United States. “Immigration officer” means any state, local, or federal law enforcement officer who is seeking to enforce immigration law.

CDE Guidance

To support the implementation of these new laws, the California Department of Education (“CDE”) published a new toolkit titled Our Schools: Resources for Including Immigrant Families. The toolkit provides informational, family-facing posters that communicate assurance of schools’ obligation under the law to provide every child with access to an education in a safe learning environment, regardless of immigration status. The toolkit also provides guidance for best practices when immigration agents are present on school sites.

The toolkit is available on the CDE website and is currently available in both English and Spanish. The CDE encourages all California school districts to make these resources visible and accessible to families.[1]

They pulled out guns and handcuffed this young child.”

In response to the scenes, Newsom signed a bill last month barring local and federal law enforcement from wearing masks while on duty.

The new law quickly drew fire from federal officials. Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli instructed federal officers to disregard what he called a dangerous and unconstitutional law. In a recent interview on KCRA, Essayli accused California officials of passing the law because they “don’t want our immigration laws being enforced.”

“So they’re dehumanizing, and they’re delegitimizing the federal government. They call ICE agents kidnappers. They’re saying they’re making people disappear,” he said. “People are being arrested in compliance with federal law and the Constitution. … And all they’re doing with this bill and this rhetoric is putting the lives of our agents in danger.”

California’s latest immigration battle

The masking bill is the latest skirmish in an ongoing battle between California and the Trump administration over how federal law enforcement agencies operate in the state — a fight likely headed to court.

There’s already a pending federal lawsuit over President Donald Trump’s decision to seize control of the California National Guard earlier this summer and deploy guard troops and U.S. Marines to assist in immigration raids.

Last weekend, California also joined a lawsuit in Oregon challenging the president’s move to send National Guard troops into Portland. And legal battles over the state’s sanctuary laws, which prohibit state and local police from assisting in immigration enforcement, date back to Trump’s first term.

Essayli and other federal prosecutors have also aggressively pursued criminal charges against people who come into contact with federal officers, though many cases have been dismissed or reduced after grand juries declined to hand down indictments. In some cases, evidence contradicted Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security agents’ claims.

Critics say the aggressive tactics and lack of identification by immigration officers raise questions about both the rights of Americans and the accountability of federal law enforcement officers.

San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat, wrote the bill barring law enforcement from wearing masks. He said ICE’s “authoritarian tactics” are creating a combustible situation that makes law enforcement less safe by eroding trust with the public and opening the door to people impersonating law enforcement. It also makes it nearly impossible for Americans to know whether the people detaining them are actually law enforcement, he said.

The city of San José also passed a policy last week aimed at forcing federal immigration agents to unmask and identify themselves when they are working in the city.

“This entire ICE operation, essentially secret police, is terrifying and scary. Having ICE agents, and lord knows who else, vigilantes, bounty hunters, having them patrolling, roving around neighborhoods and grabbing people out of bus stops, out of their front yards, out their workplaces — it’s absolutely terrifying,” Wiener said. “You can’t even see the face of the person you’re dealing with. You don’t know who you’re interacting with.”

‘I’m a citizen. I am not doing anything wrong’

U.S. citizens, including George Retes, are among those being caught up.

Retes, a 25-year-old Army veteran and security guard, was arrested in July during a raid on the Ventura County cannabis farm where he works as a security guard. He was held for three days before being released without charges. After he wrote an op-ed about his experience, DHS accused him of assault on the social media platform X. No charges have been filed, according to his lawyers.

Retes said he tried to comply with orders as he approached the farm in his vehicle, but federal agents gave him contradictory commands before using tear gas, smashing his car window, pepper-spraying his face, pulling him out of the car and pinning him to the ground with their knees. He was transferred to a Los Angeles County facility and released without explanation.

Retes has filed a claim alleging unconstitutional detention — the precursor to a lawsuit — but his lawyers have been unable to identify the officers involved.

“I’m just trying to get to work. I’m a citizen. I am not doing anything wrong,” he said. “I thought everything was going to be OK.”

Retes missed his daughter’s third birthday during his detention, and was suspended from work for three weeks until he could prove he wasn’t charged with a crime.

Institute for Justice attorney Anya Bidwell, who represents Retes, alleged that his arrest and detention — and the threat of assault charges now being leveled at him — illustrate how ICE officers are comfortable acting with impunity.

Bidwell said federal regulations already require immigration officers to identify themselves when making arrests — a point noted in a letter earlier this year from Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, who demanded ICE agents unmask and identify themselves.

“This administration is kind of just exploiting the cracks that we have in the system,” Bidwell said. “Federal officials have such a high degree of immunity that they essentially don’t even care if they break the law.”

“They’re not following their own regulations,” she added. “But again, it doesn’t matter that they’re not following their own regulations, at least in their mind, because like, go ahead, sue me. What are you going to do?”

Local police caught in the middle

By contrast, local and state police in California are legally required to identify themselves in most cases, said Brian Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, or PORAC. The group represents 87,000 rank-and-file police officers in the state.

“You have to have either a badge or a name or identification indicating that you’re a peace officer in the state of California,” Marvel said, adding that after someone is arrested,” their name, their ID number and the agency they work for will be all available to that individual.”

PORAC opposed the masking bill, arguing that it unfairly entangles local police in a broader political fight that’s really about federal authorities. Marvel said no California agency uses masks to conceal identity, but the law could expose officers to lawsuits even if they cover their faces for legitimate reasons, like cold weather or to protect their health and safety.

Federal officials have made clear they will not comply. Before Newsom signed the bill, Department of Homeland Security officials called on the governor to veto it. In a statement, DHS insisted federal agents do identify themselves but wear masks to prevent doxing and retaliation from “highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin went on to blame Wiener for violence against ICE agents, saying that his legislation “and rhetoric comparing them to ‘secret police’ — likening them to the Gestapo — is despicable.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/BorderPatrolAgentsGetty.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:01:16.356602

At a press conference, several House Republicans spoke to reporters as the government shutdown enters its eighth day. “This madness can end. This madness needs to end with sanity finally emerging,” said majority leader Steve Scalise, while continuing to blame Senate Democrats for not passing a House-passed funding bill. “Chuck Schumer, if you can’t do the right thing because you’re so afraid of your political job, think about the jobs of millions of families out there who don’t want to have that suffering inflicted on them.”

Throughout the conference, a number of lawmakers continued to push misleading claims that Democrats are “fighting to give illegals health care”. Undocumented immigrants remain ineligible for federally funded health care, except for emergency Medicaid – which is required under federal law.

Donald Trump has placed dozens of people with ties to the fossil fuel sector in his administration, including more than 40 who have directly worked for oil, gas or coal companies, according to a new analysis.

The report from Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy and ethics non-profit that has been critical of the Trump administration, alongside the Revolving Door Project, a corporate watchdog, analyzed the backgrounds of nominees and appointees within the White House and eight agencies dictating energy, environmental and climate policy. That includes the Environmental Protection Agency, the interior and energy departments and others.

The analysis comes as Trump wages broad attacks on climate and energy policies and on renewable energy. The president’s so-called one big beautiful act, for instance, opened swaths of federal land to drilling and mining and enshrined the rapid phaseout of incentives for renewable energy.

Johnson says federal workers should receive back pay, despite White House mixed messaging

House speaker Mike Johnson said today that he does believe furloughed federal workers should and will get paid, despite mixed messaging from the White House which has suggested that employees might not be guaranteed to back pay.

“There is some other legal analysis that’s floating around, I have yet had time to dig into and read that. But it has always been the case that is tradition, and I think it is statutory law that federal employees be paid,” Johnson said.

He went on to further chastise congressional Democrats, saying that their decision to hold out on passing the Republican-written continuing resolution, leaves them responsible for certain groups of federal workers not getting paid. “They voted that they did not want the troops to be paid. They did not want TSA agents to be paid. They did not want air traffic controllers, border patrol agents and all the rest. They live with that vote. They made that decision,” Johnson said. “The House is done. The ball is now in the Senate’s court. It does us no good to be here dithering on show votes. We did it. We sent the product over. It is clean.”

The arraignment of James Comey is now over, according to reporters in the courtroom. The former FBI director’s lawyers are also moving to dismiss the case, arguing that the federal prosecutor who brought the charges against Comey, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed.

A reminder that Trump installed Halligan after he pressured her predecessor, Erik Siebert, to resign. The former US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia had said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Comey and other political adversaries of the president.

Outside the courthouse today, a small group of demonstrators gathered ahead of Comey’s appearance in court to protest against the criminal charges brought against the former FBI director.

Senate to hold sixth vote on stopap funding bills amid government shutdown

The US Senate will hold its sixth vote on the dueling short-terms spending bills to reopen the government at 12pm EST today.

Both bills are set to fail, yet again, as lawmakers continue to dig their heels in and trade barbs, blaming the other party for the shutdown, which has now lasted a full week.

A reminder that on Monday, only three senators broke ranks with the Democratic party, and voted “yes” on the House-passed continuing resolution to maintain government funding until 21 November. This still leaves Republicans nowhere near the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the bill.

GOP leaders in congress have continued to say that the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, is being pressured by the progressive arm of his party into rejecting the funding extension, which mirrors the bill that he signed back in March.

Democrats, meanwhile, say that their colleagues across the aisle have avoided any negotiations about their proposal, which includes several healthcare provisions – including an extension of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and could increase insurance premiums for millions of Americans.

As we prepare to you bring you the latest from James Comey’s arraignment in less than an hour, it’s worth noting the last time that a former FBI director was criminally charged was in 1978. When L. Patrick Gray, who actually served as the acting head of the bureau during the Watergate scandal, was indicted for conspiring to violate Americans’ constitutional protections by allowing unauthorized federal raids – as agents searched for members of Weather Underground, the left-wing militant group. The charges against Gray were dropped.

Trump says Chicago mayor ‘should be in jail’ for not protecting Ice officers

The president is already posting on Truth Social. As Texas national guard troops descend on Chicago today, Trump wrote that the mayor – Brandon Johnson – “should be in jail” for “failing” to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents.

Johnson signed an executive order this week, that stops federal immigration agents from using city property.

In his post, the president added that Illinois governor JB Pritzker should also be in jail.

A federal judge has set a hearing for Thursday, regarding the lawsuit that city and state officials in Illinois filed against the administration, to block the deployment of the military.

National guard troops are outside Chicago and could be in Memphis soon

National guard troops are positioned outside Chicago and they could be in Memphis by Friday, the Associated Press reports, as the Trump administration pushes ahead with an aggressive policy toward big-city crime whether local leaders support it or not.

National guard members from Texas had settled in at an Army Reserve center in Illinois by early Wednesday, despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders. Their exact mission was not clear, though the Trump administration has an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the nation’s third-largest city, and protesters have frequently rallied at an immigration building outside Chicago in Broadview.

The president has called Chicago a “hell hole” of crime, although police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides.

In Memphis, Tennessee, police Chief Cerelyn Davis said a small group of commanders were already in the city, planning for the arrival of guard troops.

Republican governor Bill Lee has said troops will be deputized by the US Marshals Service to “play a critical support role” for local law enforcement, though that role hasn’t been precisely defined yet.

Democrats introduce bill to help federal workers cover childcare costs during shutdown

Michael Sainato

Congressional Democrats are introducing a bill that would provide childcare relief to federal workers affected by the shutdown of the federal government, as it drags on through a second week.

Parents would be reimbursed for fees paid to childcare facilities during the shutdown under plans initiated by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

Any federal employee who has been furloughed, or remains working through the shutdown without pay, would be entitled to support under the Federal Worker Childcare Protection Act of 2025.

The bill authorizes the General Services Administration to receive official documentation for childcare expenses from federal workers to apply for reimbursement.

“When you talk to federal workers right now, a lot of them are exhausted. They’re proud of what they do, but they’re tired of being treated like their lives are expendable,” Omar said in a statement on the bill.

“This administration has made it clear it’s not interested in standing up for workers – but I am,” she added. “As a working parent, I know the importance of having reliable childcare. This bill is a small but necessary way to show that their work and their families matter.”

About 100 childcare centers previously operated in GSA-managed federal spaces, providing childcare for thousands of children daily, but the so-called “department of government efficiency” eliminated the GSA office that managed these facilities earlier this year.

Co-sponsors of the bill include the congressional Democratic representatives Pramila Jayapal, Summer Lee, Gregory Meeks, Jerry Nadler, and Rashida Tlaib.

Six former US surgeons general – the top medical posting in Washington – warned in an opinion column published on Tuesday that policy changes enacted by the health and human services (HHS) secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, are “endangering the health of the nation”.

The surgeons general – Jerome Adams, Richard Carmona, Joycelyn Elders, Vivek Murthy, Antonia Novello and David Satcher – who served under both Republican and Democrat administrations, identified changes in vaccine policy, medical research funding, a shift in priorities from rationality to ideology, plunging morale, and changes to staffing as areas of concern.

Referring to their oaths of office, both Hippocratic as physicians and as public servants, the former officials wrote in the Washington Post that they felt “compelled to speak with one voice to say that the actions of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are endangering the health of the nation”.

“Never before have we issued a joint public warning like this. But the profound, immediate and unprecedented threat that Kennedy’s policies and positions pose to the nation’s health cannot be ignored,” they said, adding that they could not ignore the “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” of his policies.

Under a “Make America Healthy Again” (Maha) agenda, Kennedy has accelerated vaccine policy changes despite opposition from scientists, including narrowing eligibility for Covid-19 vaccine shots and dismissing members of a vaccine advisory panel.

He has cut federal funding for mRNA vaccine research for respiratory illnesses and instituted a review of vaccine recommendations. Kennedy also sought the dismissal of Dr Susan Monarez, former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Monarez testified before Congress last month that her firing by Donald Trump came after refusing a request from Kennedy to dismiss CDC vaccine experts “without cause”.

The back-and-forth comes as Texas National Guard troops were seen assembling at the Army Reserve Training Center in Elwood, a village about 45 miles southwest of Chicago. Troops arrived after the White House ordered their deployment on Oct. 4 over the vociferous objections of local and state leaders, who filed a lawsuit challenging the move.

U.S. District Judge April M. Perry at an emergency hearing allowed the deployment to move forward but warned that any troop action before an Oct. 9 hearing could be used as evidence against the Trump administration.

Pritzker and Johnson for weeks have condemned increasingly aggressive ICE raids in the city and Trump's characterization of Chicago as ""the worst and most dangerous city in the world."" Earlier this week, Johnson signed an executive order establishing an ""ICE Free Zone"" prohibiting federal immigration agents from using city property in their operations.

The nation's third-largest city has become the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration's intensifying deportation campaign and crackdown on crime in Democratic-led cities. Trump this week floated the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act if judges or leaders in blue cities continue to hold up National Guard deployments.

Protests break out as ICE raids ramp up in Chicago

Trump’s battle with Chicago has been stewing for more than a month, with the president threatening that the city would be next in line after deploying 800 National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., in August.

Trump says his Chicago-area immigration crackdown, called Operation Midway Blitz, is needed to apprehend ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants. The stepped-up enforcement has fueled a simmering powder keg, heightening tensions in the city and spurring ongoing protests, especially at the ICE processing center in the suburb of Broadview, where several protesters were arrested last weekend.

This week, groups of nonprofits, unions, journalists and protesters filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration saying federal agents responded to demonstrations ""with a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians."" Among the plaintiffs is a pastor who said federal agents shot him with pepper balls and sprayed him in the face with tear gas.

Protests swelled in recent weeks as ICE has launched highly visible and aggressive raids across Chicago. On Sept. 30, immigration agents descending from Black Hawk helicopters stormed and wrecked a South Side apartment building in search of Venezuelan gang members. Two of the 37 people subsequently arrested were ""confirmed"" members of the Tren de Aragua gang, the Department of Homeland Security said.

On Oct. 4, a woman was shot by a U.S. Border Patrol in a clash between protesters and immigration officers on Chicago’s Southwest side, while according to the Chicago Sun-Times, masked federal agents unleashed a chemical irritant outside a Logan Square neighborhood grocery store where protesters had blocked their progress.

'This is about consolidating power,' governor says

Pritzker has said the state ""won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator"" and called the activation of National Guard troops a ""manufactured performance.""

""I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,"" he said on Oct. 4, posting on X that the War Department had given him an ultimatum: ""Call up your troops, or we will. It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.""

According to immigration authorities, more than 800 ""illegal aliens including worst of the worst criminals"" have been detained since the blitz began.

But Illinois leaders fear Trump is using conflict between federal agents and anti-immigration enforcement protesters to justify troop deployment and to ultimately take control of the heavily Democratic stronghold.

""This is not about fighting crime, this is about sowing fear and intimidation among Americans,"" Pritzker said last month. ""This is about consolidating power in Donald Trump's hands.""

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has included Chicago among blue cities and states whose federal funds are being withheld during the ongoing government shutdown. Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said that $2.1 billion in promised federal funds for Chicago's transit system have been paused.

At a hearing in June, Cummings stated that the consent decree remained in effect while the motions were pending.","CHICAGO — Federal immigration agents illegally arrested nearly two dozen people earlier this year without warrants in violation of a 2022 consent decree, a federal judge in Chicago ruled late Tuesday.

Immigration and civil liberties advocates based in Chicago sued federal authorities in March over the arrests of 26 people in the Midwest — including one U.S. citizen — during the opening days of President Donald Trump’s second term in January.

They claimed that such arrests violated a three-year consent decree banning warrantless arrests unless agents have probable cause to believe someone is in the United States unlawfully and is a flight risk. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings concluded that attorneys for the National Immigration Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois provided enough evidence to show that ICE arrested 22 people without a warrant in violation of the consent decree and federal law.

Cummings also extended the settlement agreement to Feb. 2 and ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to begin making monthly disclosures of how many warrantless arrests agents make each month until the agreement’s new expiration date.

The original 2018 lawsuit that led to the consent decree — referred to as the Castañon Nava consent decree — stemmed from a large-scale ICE enforcement operation in the Chicago area that led to 156 arrests during a weeklong period. Of those arrests, more than 100 were made without a warrant.

According to the lawsuit, ICE instructed its agents to circumvent federal law on warrantless arrests by having them create “post-hoc” warrants in the field for people who were already under arrest.

ICE officials previously denied that its agents violated the agreement, which it asserted expired earlier this year. It asserted that agents had probable cause to believe that the people it arrested without warrants would likely escape before they could get a warrant for their arrest. In other cases, warrants were prepared while people were detained for questioning, ICE officials said.

Cummings wrote Tuesday that issuing warrants to arrest people in the field was a “new policy that has never been implemented by ICE” prior to the consent decree. In 12 cases from Missouri that were cited in the lawsuit, the judge wrote, ICE later prepared post-arrest forms that Cummings said did not include any facts that would provide probable cause that any of the detainees were likely to escape before arrest warrants could be obtained. Subsequent forms provided a month later reflected details ICE agents did not know at the time they made the arrests, Cummings added.

“Today’s decision makes clear that DHS and ICE – like everyone else – must follow the Constitution and the law,” said Michelle García, co-counsel in the case and ACLU of Illinois’ Deputy Legal Director. “The federal government’s reckless practice of stopping, harassing and detaining people – and then finding a justification for the action must end.”

According to Cummings’ order, the 22 people subject to illegal warrantless arrests have since been released on bond and are no longer in the custody of ICE. But Cummings ordered ICE to reimburse all bond payments and lift any imposed conditions of release.

ICE began violating the agreement with the January operation and completely ceased compliance in June, when its principal legal adviser sent an email to all ICE employees stating that the agreement was terminated despite pending litigation. On Tuesday, Cummings ordered ICE to reissue a broadcast that the agreement is again in effect “to all ICE officers nationwide.”

The judge also ordered ICE to, within 10 days, produce a tally of all foreign nationals subjected to warrantless arrest in the Northern District of Illinois from June 11-Oct. 7. It must continue to produce that data on the first day of each month between Oct. 22 and when the agreement expires.

“The court’s decision recognizes the scope and gravity of the constitutional violations the federal immigration enforcement operations have wrought on Chicagoans, both citizens and immigrants alike, as was so graphically perpetrated during the South Shore apartment building raid,” Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation for the National Immigration Justice Center, said in a statement.

“The court emphasizes that ensuring ICE has probable cause to make an arrest is more important than ever in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s Vasquez Perdomo racial-profiling decision. This decision gives us tools to hold DHS and ICE accountable.”

Attorneys: Family’s Millennium Park Detention Was Also A Violation

Prior to Cummings’ ruling, attorneys also filed multiple notices to the court of additional consent decree violations in which they alleged that ICE had “dramatically escalated” its enforcement in Chicago.

One high-profile case cited was the recent arrests of a family in Millennium Park.

Federal agents detained Noemi Chavez; her husband, Jaime Ramirez; their 8-year-old daughter, Dasha Ramirez; and their 3-year-old son at Millennium Park during a family outing on Sept. 28. Chavez told the Tribune that federal agents surrounded her and her husband as her children played in the Crown Fountain and asked if they had their “documents.” Chavez said that when she asked to see a warrant, her request was ignored.

In a Sept. 30 court filing, attorneys with the National Immigrant Justice Center wrote that the arrest was among many made this year “without warrants or any flight risk determinations.”

The Chavez-Ramirez family was detained as large groups of border patrol agents marched through Downtown. During the Sept. 28 patrol, Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino told WBEZ some of the people his agents are arresting are chosen based partly on “how they look.”

More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the Chicago area since the Department of Homeland Security launched Operation Midways Blitz at the start of September. The National Immigration Justice Center has identified more than 30 recent examples of warrantless arrests “lacking sufficient probable cause,” according to court documents.

The Castañon Nava consent decree was supposed to sunset in May. However, in March, the National Immigration Justice Center and the ACLU of Illinois filed a motion to enforce the consent decree and extend it for three more years. At a hearing in June, Cummings stated that the consent decree remained in effect while the motions were pending.

Last week, attorney Keren Zwick with the National Immigration Justice Center filed a habeas corpus petition with the U.S. District Court on behalf of the Chavez-Ramirez family. Originally from Guatemala, the family came to the United States in 2023 “in search of protection,” Zwick said. She said the family has an asylum hearing date set for October 2027.

During a Monday status hearing, Zwick told U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis she believed the family was “stopped because of their skin color.”

“I know I have no jurisdiction as to how ICE operates its enforcement procedures, but I will just say as an aside, I find it extremely troubling that there is no other indication that this family was not here legally and clearly they were stopped based on their appearance which, absent any other factors, is unconstitutional,” the judge said Monday.

After their detainment, the Chavez-Ramirez family was taken to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Broadview before Chavez and the children were moved to O’Hare’s immigration-customs enforcement area at Terminal 5, according to the Tribune.

Chavez and the children were released Wednesday. But Jaime Ramirez was transferred from Broadview to the Port Isabel Immigration Processing Center in Texas and then to a facility in Clay County, Indiana, according to Zwick.

Jaime Ramirez originally came to the United States in the early 2000s, but he was deported. He returned in 2014 and was convicted of illegal entry and was served an order of removal, Zwick said. Jaime Ramirez returned with his family in 2023.

On Monday, attorney Craig Oswald, who is representing Bovino on behalf of the U.S. Attorney’s Office, said he believed federal agents discovered Jaime Ramirez’s past entries after the family was detained.

Marcos Charles, acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, said last month that about 50-60 percent of arrests in ICE’s ongoing Chicago operation were targeted arrests. Yet in a recent filing in the Castañon Nava case, the National Immigration Justice Center wrote the remaining 50-60 percent of arrests are collateral arrests “which means they were warrantless and likely failed to comply” with the consent decree.

Filings from the National Immigration Justice Center describe cases where people were arrested on their way to and from work and church, an early morning raid in Elgin where two U.S. citizens were detained and an incident where a 5-year-old girl and her parents were arrested as they loaded groceries into their car.

“Together, the violations we describe in our court filing paint a picture of increasingly violent and dangerous arrests by [Department of Homeland Security] and other federal officers who show no regard for people’s safety or constitutional rights,” Fleming said in a recent news release. “We urgently need the court to hold the Trump administration accountable for the fear, family separation and physical harm these arrests are causing.”",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/UBP5.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:59:08.535504

The Chicago I represent is not a testing ground for militarization; it is a proving ground for democracy.
For months now, I have worked alongside rapid response teams that mobilize the moment there is word of an ICE raid or sweep.","While many families prepared their children for school Monday morning, Sept. 29, I woke up to calls from parents in Chicago too afraid to leave their homes. Rumors of immigration enforcement were spreading, and the simple act of walking a child to school felt like too much of a risk. I am a mother and an Illinois state representative, and these calls hit me in two places at once: as a parent who wants my child to grow up free from fear and as an elected official entrusted to protect the rights and dignity of my community.

Friday, the scene in my Chicago neighborhood included helicopters flying above and armed convoys patrolling our streets.

Some of our worst fears were realized the next day when, as NBC Chicago reported, ICE agents rappelled from helicopters onto a housing complex during a 1 a.m. raid and zip-tied people, including U.S. citizens and children, in the South Shore neighborhood. That’s near where my family has lived for decades. By all accounts the federal administration has used this exaggerated staging as a media opportunity without producing a shred of evidence that its use of excessive force was justified.

By Friday, the scene in my Chicago neighborhood included helicopters flying above and armed convoys patrolling our streets. In broad daylight, federal agents released multiple tear gas canisters into a crowd across the street from an elementary school. In a second instance, as a local TV station reported, agents released tear gas outside an emergency room in my community, and Alderwoman Jessie Fuentes, our City Council representative, posted a video of being handcuffed by ICE briefly after she questioned agents at that medical facility.

That is what makes President Donald Trump’s latest threat, that Chicago is one of the cities he wants to use as a “training ground” for the military, even more chilling. Trump is not only scapegoating our city and other cities for political gain; he is openly plotting to experiment on working families, immigrants and communities of color by turning our neighborhoods into staging grounds for authoritarian force. We must not turn away at this moment.

I know what militarization looks like, and it is not safety, it is fear. It looks like children crying when their parents don’t come home. It looks like families going underground, skipping school or work, because they are terrified of who might be waiting outside their doors. Militarization leads to trauma that lingers long after the raids end.

I know how this feels because I grew up with a mother who was undocumented. I grew up not knowing whether my mother would be there when I came home from school. I also know what real safety looks like. It looks like parents walking their kids to school. It’s stable housing, a living wage, health care and classrooms where children can learn without fear.

Chicago resists because it must. When Trump threatens to tear us apart, we come together through rapid response networks, neighborhood associations, congregations and coalitions of workers and students. The Chicago I represent is not a testing ground for militarization; it is a proving ground for democracy.

I grew up with a mother who was undocumented. I grew up not knowing whether my mother would be there when I came home from school.

And we are not powerless. For months now, I have worked alongside rapid response teams that mobilize the moment there is word of an ICE raid or sweep. We have turned resistance into law. In Springfield, I led the Safe Schools for All Act, which ensures schools remain safe from immigration enforcement. I worked to secure major state investments for Illinois’ Welcoming Centers and the Access to Justice program, in which immigrant families receive housing, health care and legal support that is denied to them in other settings. Additionally, I worked alongside the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights to ensure resources reached grassroots organizations on the ground.

As I reflect on the moment, I am reminded of the important work to follow. This veto session, Illinois lawmakers have a clear opportunity to take the next step: passing legislation to ban ICE from courthouses, health care settings and day care centers, places where people should feel safe. For too long, immigration agents have lurked in the hallways of our courts, deterring victims of crime and survivors of abuse from seeking justice. A courthouse should be a place where truth and fairness are protected, not where fear is manufactured. If we are serious about building communities where families can thrive, we must ensure that every resident, regardless of status, can access the justice system without intimidation.

I return to where I started. I’m a mother. When I walk my son to school in West Humboldt Park, I want him to see a city that welcomes families, not one that frightens them into silence. I want him to grow up knowing that leaders stood up against fear politics and that resistance is not only possible, but powerful.

Trump may see Chicago as a training ground. I see it as a home, one worth defending with everything I have as a mother, an attorney and a state representative. We will not be his training ground. No city should ever be used as a training ground; authoritarian reach is not acceptable anywhere in the country. I am part of a network of mothers, attorneys and elected officials at every level of government who will resist.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-broadview-il-chicago-suburb-ice-agent-ac-1159p-d08f2f.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 11:58:46.851159

Associated Press

President Donald Trump’s administration is warning Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been longstanding policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House.

The move was widely seen as a strongarm tactic to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, as party leaders remain seemingly at an impasse on day 7 of the shutdown. Democrats are conditioning their support for a short-term funding patch on extending the health subsidies that lessen the cost of plans offered under the Affordable Care Act.

After the longest government shutdown in 2019, Trump signed legislation into law that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.

The president during an Oval Office meeting Tuesday suggested he’ll “ follow the law ” on back pay for federal workers, minutes after saying the compensation “ depends on who we’re talking about ” and that some workers would be taken care of “in a different way.”

The Latest:

Seeking more immigration barriers, Noem waives environmental protections in New Mexico

The Trump administration is waiving a long list of environmental protections and regulations as it seeks to expand barriers to immigration along the southwest U.S. border in New Mexico.

In a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, the Department of Homeland Security is invoking an “acute and immediate need to construct additional physical barriers and roads” in a remote area of the state near the border with Mexico.

The directive from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem describes the area west of El Paso, Texas, as a traditional place of high illegal entry to the U.S. Noem is suspending federal regulations there aimed at protecting endangered species, clean water, migratory birds, sacred Native American sites and more.

Laiken Jordahl of the Center for Biological Diversity said there are fears any new construction would take a toll on wildlife populations near the remote bootheel of southwest New Mexico.

House Democrats press Trump on drug cartels he designated as terrorist groups

Several House Democrats say they want President Donald Trump to name the drug cartels he claims are in an “ armed conflict” with the U.S. government.

Five U.S. representatives released a letter Tuesday that also asks the president to explain just how he determined the cartels were designated as terrorist organizations.

The lawmakers also asked for the intelligence and the legal justifications behind the U.S. military’s four fatal strikes recently against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.

Trump has declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants in an administration memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press last week. The memo appears to represent an extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers, with Trump effectively declaring that trafficking of drugs into the U.S. amounts to armed conflict requiring use of military force.

Justice Department names new head of immigration courts

A former immigration court judge and longtime Marine is going to be the next director of the federal office overseeing the nation’s immigration courts.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday that Daren K. Margolin will head the Executive Office of Immigration Review.

Margolin has served as an assistant chief immigration judge and as a lawyer at the legal office prosecuting immigration cases. He also served in various legal positions during a nearly 30-year career in the Marine Corps.

Margolin takes over an immigration court system struggling with a ballooning case backlog. Immigration courts have also increasingly become hubs for immigration enforcement with ICE agents arresting people in hallways after their court proceedings.

Past surgeons general argue HHS secretary is ‘endangering' nation's health

Six former surgeons general said in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” to the nation’s health.

An HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, accused the past surgeons general of criticizing the first HHS secretary who is taking on the “decline in America’s public health” after they presided over it.

“We remain committed to restoring trust, reforming broken health systems, and ensuring that every American has access to real choice in their health care,” Nixon said.

Oregon Gov. Kotek meets with DHS Sec. Noem in Portland

Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said she met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for about 20 minutes upon Noem’s arrival at the Portland airport on Tuesday. Kotek reached out to Noem after hearing through “unofficial channels” that Noem might be visiting.

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon. Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland,” Kotek said in a statement.

Noem then went to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. News crews and some protesters lined up behind yellow police tape that cordoned off the blocks in front of the building.

White House says it will use tariff revenue to bolster food aid program facing funding shortages

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that Trump has “identified a creative solution to transfer resources” from tariffs the administration has imposed on U.S. trading partners to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

Also known as WIC, the program provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples but was threatened by the government shutdown.

Leavitt did not provide details of how such funding transfers might work. But she wrote that the Trump White House “will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry.”

Trump meets with American hostage freed from Gaza and with relatives of American killed there

Trump has met with an American hostage freed from Gaza, and with the family of an American-Israeli soldier who was killed there but whose remains have yet to be recovered.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a photo online of Trump meeting in the Oval Office with Edan Alexander. He was taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that led to the Israel-Hamas war.

The meeting wasn’t public. But the picture also showed Trump with the family of Omer Neutra, whose body is still in Gaza. Peace talks are being held in Egypt over Trump’s plan to end fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Trump also met this summer with Alexander, who was the last living American hostage in Gaza and released from captivity in May.

House Speaker Mike Johnson says he’ll schedule the swearing in of new Arizona Democrat ‘as soon as she wants’

Adelita Grijalva won a special election for a House seat on Sept. 24, but has been unable to actually represent her district in Congress until the speaker officially swears her into office. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has so far refused to accommodate her request to officially take office while the House is not conducting legislative business during the government shutdown.

Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant Tuesday by saying he would swear her into office as soon as she wants. However, Grijalva could be sworn in during one of the House’s pro-forma sessions. The next one is Wednesday.

Once she officially takes office, Grijalva has said she will join a legislative maneuver to force a vote in the House on a bill that would require the Department of Justice to release the case files on the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Judge blocks changed guidance for teen pregnancy prevention grants

A judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump’s administration from requiring recipients of federal teen pregnancy prevention grants to comply with Trump’s orders aimed at curtailing “radical indoctrination” and “gender ideology.”

The ruling is a victory for three Planned Parenthood affiliates that sued to try to block enforcement of a Department of Human Services policy document issued in July that they contend contradict the requirements of the grants as established by Congress.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, blasted the administration’s policy change in her written ruling, saying it was “motivated solely by political concerns, devoid of any considered process or analysis, and ignorant of the statutory emphasis on evidence-based programming.”

Federal grand jury in Atlanta charges 2 men with making threats against ICE officer and his wife

Frank Andrew Waszut and Anthony Patrick Noto are charged with knowingly making interstate threats of violence. Both men were indicted last month, and the indictments were unsealed Monday. They were both in custody and online court records did not show either man having a lawyer who could comment on the charges.

Federal prosecutors said in a news release Tuesday that Waszut posted a video on Instagram that identified and showed photos of the officer, who lives and works in Georgia. Waszut is accused of encouraging people to “make him famous” and urging anyone who sees the officer to “give him the cell block one treatment,” which prosecutors said means subjecting him to violence.

Noto posted a comment on Instagram under a photo of the officer’s wife that called her a “pretty good target” for anyone wanting to test out a semiautomatic rifle.

Waszut, who lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, was in jail in Texas, where he’s accused of making separate threats against Republican lawmakers. Noto, who lives in Ronkonkoma, New York, was in federal custody.

National Guard members from Texas are in Illinois in Trump’s latest move to send troops to cities

National Guard members from Texas are at an Army training center in Illinois. It’s the most visible sign yet of the Trump administration’s plan to send troops to the Chicago area despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders.

The Associated Press saw military personnel in uniforms with the Texas National Guard patch at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, 55 miles (88 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. On Monday, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media showing National Guard members from his state boarding a plane, but he didn’t specify where they were going.

US authorities report 2025 border arrests at 55-year low

Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday that authorities made 237,565 arrests at the border with Mexico during the government’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That’s down 84% from more than 1.5 million during the previous 12-month period and the lowest tally since 1970.

There were more than 2 million arrests in 2022 and 2023.

The latest number includes nearly four months of the Biden administration. Arrests fell sharply after the Biden administration imposed severe asylum restrictions in June 2024. They plummeted more after the Trump administration virtually eliminated asylum access and dispatched thousands of miliary troops to the border.

During September, authorities averaged 279 arrests a day. That’s up from 204 arrests a day in August but down from nearly 1,800 a day in September 2024.

Democrats ask Bondi about Tom Homan: Where’s the money?

As Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a Senate panel, Democrats time and again asked her what happened to $50,000 that White House “border czar” Tom Homan accepted last year from undercover agents posting as businesspeople.

The investigation into Homan was shut down by the Trump administration, but Democrats repeatedly questioned whether the money was recovered or whether Homan kept the money and reported it as income on his taxes.

“Do you know sitting here whether he took the money?” Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked Bondi during one particularly combative exchange with the attorney general.

Bondi said the decision to clear Homan of wrongdoing was made before she was sworn in as attorney general and defended Homan. She repeatedly refused to say what actually happened to the $50,000, though.

“You think you got a gotcha with Tom Homan our border czar who has been out there fighting for our country since Donald Trump took office,” Bondi replied to Schiff.

GOP senator questions whether National Guard deployment to cities is ‘best practice’

Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is suggesting that National Guard troops are not the best equipped to address crime in cities and that instead accountability for policing should remain with local officials.

“Is this deployment of the National Guard a part of an emerging best practice that I just don’t get yet?” Tillis asked Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Senate oversight hearing.

It was a bit of indirect criticism from Tillis, who is not seeking reelection next year, on how President Donald Trump is deploying National Guard troops to major cities as part of his crime and immigration agenda.

Supreme Court seems skeptical about state bans on ‘conversion therapy’

The Supreme Court ’s conservative majority seems likely to side with a Christian counselor challenging bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.

Most justices on the high court didn’t seem convinced that states can restrict voluntary talk therapy aimed at potentially changing feelings or behavior for kids who identify as gay or transgender.

Justice Samuel Alito said the Colorado law being challenged “looks like blatant viewpoint discrimination.”

DHS Sec. Kristi Noem to visit Portland

The city and police department confirmed her visit in a joint statement after conservative podcaster and influencer Benny Johnson said on social media that Noem was going to Portland on Tuesday.

The city said it received notice of her visit to the Portland area but did not have full details about her agenda. Portland police “will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary.”

Her trip comes as local and state officials continue to fight the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to the city.

A federal judge issued two restraining orders over the weekend blocking the deployment, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments in the case for Thursday morning. The court indicated the arguments could be canceled if judges determine they aren’t needed.

Trump praises Carney as a ‘world-class leader’ and ‘good man’

The president said of his Canadian counterpart that he is “a great prime minister,” and added: “He could represent me anytime.”

But, Trump said: “He’s a nice man but he can be nasty.”

When asked by a reporter what is holding up trade talks with Carney if he’s such a great man, Trump said: “Because I want to be a great man too.”

Trump says he’ll meet with Xi in a few weeks

“I’ll be meeting him in South Korea,” Trump said, referencing a summit that he’s expected to attend there at the end of the month.

A meeting between the two leaders has not been formally announced.

Trump says his first-term trade deal with Mexico and Canada could be negotiated – or even replaced

The president appeared to dismiss a key achievement of his first term, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.

Trump says he’ll negotiate trade deals on Tuesday with the visiting Canadian prime minister.

But asked about USMCA -- which took effect in 2020, replacing NAFTA -- he offered a surprise. “We could renegotiate it or we could create a different deal,” Trump said.

He offered no further details.

The president said the Democrats “started” the shutdown fight and that the minority party was taking such aggressive tactics because “they have nothing to lose.”

“Well, they’re the ones that started it,” Trump said in response to a question about his message to Democrats. “They’re the ones that have it, and it’s almost like a kamikaze attack by them. You want to know the truth, this is like a kamikaze attack. They, they almost, you know, they have nothing to lose.”

Trump suggests he’ll ‘follow the law’ on federal worker backpay

Asked a second time about backpay for furloughed federal workers given that the requirement is spelled out in law, Trump said: “I follow the law, and what the law says is correct.”

But asked about what he meant previously about dealing with workers in “a different way” than backpay, the president ducked the question, suggesting reporters would have to find that out for themselves.

Carney says the U.S. and Canada are competing, not in conflict

The Canadian prime minister pushed back at Trump’s characterization of the two nations being in “natural conflict.”

Carney pointed out that Canada is the United States’ second-largest trading partner and is also a major foreign investor. He said the relationship between the U.S. and Canada are “maybe not so much conflict” but that they “compete.”

“There are areas where we compete, and it’s in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works,” Carney said. “But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re focused on”

GOP senator suggests FBI interview Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after his comments about Epstein

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, is suggesting that the FBI look into comments that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made during a recent interview in which he called the late financier Jeffrey Epstein the “greatest blackmailer ever.”

During a Senate hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi reiterated her previous stance that the Department of Justice has not uncovered evidence that could be used in relation to Epstein’s sex trafficking of teenage girls. But Kennedy said that the comments from Lutnick, who was formerly a neighbor with Epstein, suggested others were involved.

“Don’t you think that you ought to talk to him after this interview?” Kennedy asked Bondi.

The attorney general responded that Lutnick had not been interviewed and she was noncommittal about any future interviews.

Trump says there is ‘natural conflict’ with Canada

The president said there’s a “natural business conflict” between the U.S. and its northern neighbor but said there’s also “mutual love.”

“There’s still great love between the two countries,” Trump said.

Trump says back pay for furloughed federal workers ‘depends on who we’re talking about’

The president didn’t dismiss back pay for all workers, but added, “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way” without elaborating.

He also blamed Democrats for putting “a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy.”

Trump’s comments came as his administration threatened no back pay for federal workers in a memo Tuesday. That’s despite a 2019 bill Trump signed into law guaranteeing back pay.

Chicago mayor says he doesn’t know where National Guard troops are in his city

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Trump administration has not told him where the National Guard is, when it may arrive in Chicago or what its task will be.

“None of that has been made clear,” Johnson said at a Tuesday news conference. “That is what is so difficult about this moment, you have an administration that is refusing to cooperate with a local authority.”

Johnson said Trump’s federalizing of the national guard is “unconstitutional, it’s illegal and it’s dangerous.”

“The federal government is out of control,” Johnson said. “This is one of the most dangerous times in our nation’s history.” Johnson said Trump is “unchecked” and “If Congress is not going to hold the president of the United States of America accountable, then I will.”

‘Law is clear’ on federal worker back pay, House Democratic leader says

“Every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay. Period. Full stop,” Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday, responding to a White House memo outlining a rationale it’s considering for denying back pay to federal workers during the shutdown.

“The law is clear,” Jeffries added. “And we will make sure that law is followed.”

Illinois braces for National Guard deployments amid legal challenge

Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has said that some 300 of Illinois’ guard troops were to be federalized over his objections and sent to Chicago, along with 400 from Texas.

“He wants to justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command,” Pritzker said, accusing the president of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.”

A federal judge in Chicago scheduled a hearing for Thursday on a legal challenge that describes Trump’s military mobilization plan for Illinois as unlawful and dangerous. A federal judge in Oregon blocked the Guard’s deployment to Portland.

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media Monday showing Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, without saying their destination.

Bryan Stevenson, 65, is a civil rights lawyer and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit law group that represents imprisoned and condemned inmates. He has a message for those cultural institutions: expand your efforts, don’t retreat.

“We dishonor those who came before us if in this moment of crisis we remain silent,” Mr. Stevenson said. “I don’t think it’s just unempathetic. I don’t think it’s just cowardly. I think it’s dishonorable.”

Mr. Stevenson, whose memoir “Just Mercy” became a movie of the same name, has helped transformed Montgomery into a global destination for reckoning with the nation’s racial past. His E.J.I. Legacy Sites — museums and monuments focused on racial injustice — have drawn over two million visitors.

His newest site, the Freedom Monument Sculpture Park, opened in March 2024 on 17 acres, featuring work from more than two dozen artists and a towering National Monument to Freedom — a 43-foot-tall wall inscribed with the 122,000 surnames adopted by formerly enslaved people listed in the 1870 census. The park opened the same week Alabama banned teaching “divisive concepts” about race in public schools and universities.

The Equal Justice Initiative’s latest project, the Elevation Hotel, was designed as a sanctuary for visitors engaging with this difficult history. I interviewed Mr. Stevenson recently in Montgomery as he walked through the sites and prepared for the hotel’s opening on Oct. 8.

This conversation has been edited and condensed.

How would you describe the environment for cultural institutions engaged in telling the unvarnished story of our country’s racial history now?

I see the administration’s attempt to review and remove exhibits as proof that our work is critically important. I feel incredibly lucky that we’re eight years into establishing our major public history sites and cultural work. If we were just starting this effort, it would be too late to successfully fight back against this political push to erase certain difficult or inconvenient historical truths.

If you could bring Donald Trump to Montgomery right now, which of your sites would you take him to, and what specific truth would you want him to confront?

I would take him through the museum, just so he could understand the connection between what happened during the trans-Atlantic slave trade and today. It’s so interesting when he says, “Stop talking about how bad slavery was.” He thinks of himself as being anti-crime and tough on criminals.

Well, kidnapping 13 million people is a crime. It was a crime in the 15th century. There’s never been a time in human history where kidnapping was seen as acceptable. We’re talking about crime victims who weren’t just victimized for a day or a week; they were victimized for their whole lives.

He would never say to the people who lost loved ones on 9/11, “Oh, you guys should stop talking about what happened on 9/11.” He did the opposite. I want him to understand that what Black people went through is the exact same thing, except we never got comforted. We never got embraced.

And I would bring him to the lynching memorial because the people who were lynching Black people thought they were keeping the white community safe. This will send a very strong message about where that path leads.

Given the threats to federal funding and political scrutiny, what is the responsibility right now of cultural institutions focused on the Black experience and marginalized histories?

We’re going to have to do things that are uncomfortable. Given the knowledge and the resources and the privileges that so many of us have, we can’t afford to hope somebody else does the truth-telling for us.

We didn’t take any federal funding at our sites. You can get philanthropic support. You don’t have to take federal money. And if the federal government is involved and tries to take away the essence of these cultural institutions, I would advise them to tell the government, “Keep your money.”

I keep giving these talks, and I say, “They may try to take away our 501(c)(3) tax status, which would be devastating. But I would rather be a truth-teller and taxed, than to be silent and untaxed.” The room is usually just dead quiet, but I really feel that way.

Inside the Legacy Museum, visitors are surrounded by harrowing evidence, including the newspaper headlines celebrating lynchings and the audio testimonies of the wrongly condemned. How do you respond to the argument that we should not focus on this brutal, graphic history?

You have to be privileged and protected to go through life only thinking positive thoughts.

It’s like saying, “I’m going to the doctor, but I’ve already instructed my doctor, Don’t give me any bad news.” If your doctor isn’t allowed to be truthful with you, you’re going to get sick, and you’re going to die prematurely. So if you don’t want to be sick, if you don’t want to die, you have to be willing to hear the truth of your condition.

If we have the courage to hear the truth of this, there are things we can do to recover from this history of violence. It begins by committing to being against violence, being committed to the rule of law, to actually educating people about what happens when you give in to fear and anger.

Even in relationships, if you want to be in a good, healthy relationship, if you make a mistake and your partner is forbidden from giving voice to that, you’re just going to breed resentment and hostility. I just think that applies to history.

The new hotel is unusual. It is designed as a place of refuge for people who have toured Montgomery and your sites — a journey that can be incredibly emotionally draining and painful. Why do you see places like the hotel as important?

More than ever, those who are courageous enough to not be silent, to pursue the truth of our history, are going to need shelter. They’re going to need protection. They’re going to need help to navigate this moment, where it’s become dangerous to have museums and cultural institutions that are honest about history.

That image of Private Gordon and his brutalized back — that’s something we want everybody to see. Until you understand the brutality and cruelty of slavery, you’re not going to appreciate the harm it created.

You describe yourself and your historic sites as being part of a wider narrative struggle over telling the nation’s story. What do you mean by that?

I do think we’re in the midst of a narrative struggle. We won the deconstruction of legal apartheid. Now, we’re in a moment where I think the battle is a narrative battle. We can no longer rely on the rule of law alone. We have to engage in the storytelling, the teaching that helps this country recognize why we are still in a struggle for equality and justice.

You’ve described having to navigate these presumptions yourself, even as an accomplished lawyer. Can you share an example?

I was in a courtroom once, and a judge came in, saw me sitting there, and said, “Hey, I don’t want any defendant sitting in my courtroom without counsel. You get back out there in the hallway.” I had to apologize and explain I was the lawyer. They just laughed.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08nat-stevenson-qa-01-qzwm/08nat-stevenson-qa-01-qzwm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:58:39.653957

The outlet also has joined a separate lawsuit against ICE for what is being alleged as the unlawful treatment of journalists.
Local fire department officials have also complained about the fence.
“ICE’s illegally constructed fence on a public street, Beach Street, in the Village of Broadview, is an unacceptable risk.
The fence is currently blocking access for the Broadview Fire Department to businesses on that road,” Broadview’s acting Fire Chief Matt Martin said in a statement to Fox 32.","A suburb outside Chicago has sued the Trump administration for erecting an 8-foot fence around an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility, alleging that the barrier blocks emergency services and patrons from accessing the site and surrounding businesses.

The Village of Broadview asked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials to remove the fence in the lawsuit, filed Friday, and cited a lack of medical staff present at the facility as another reason for concern, according to the nonprofit news organization Block Club Chicago. The outlet also has joined a separate lawsuit against ICE for what is being alleged as the unlawful treatment of journalists.

Local fire department officials have also complained about the fence.

“ICE’s illegally constructed fence on a public street, Beach Street, in the Village of Broadview, is an unacceptable risk. The fence is currently blocking access for the Broadview Fire Department to businesses on that road,” Broadview’s acting Fire Chief Matt Martin said in a statement to Fox 32.

“In case of a fire or other emergency, our fire trucks or ambulances cannot use the street to get to the scene,” he added.

Prior to the fence’s installment, protesters attempted to block the barrier from being put in place. Demonstrators have alleged those being processed at the facility are being forced to use toilets outside and sleep in rooms without beds before being sent to other federal sites, WBEZ Chicago reported.

Broadview Mayor Katrina R. Thompson attempted to meet with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Friday to discuss the “danger created by the fence and to again ask for its removal,” Block Club Chicago reported, citing the lawsuit.

Noem, however, reportedly was unable to meet. Later in the day, the secretary posted a video on the social platform X criticizing the suburb after seemingly being denied entry into their municipal building for a bathroom break.

“It is clear that [Homeland Security], ICE, and their officials has developed, confirmed, and executed a policy, pattern, or practice of illegally trespassing on the Village’s property in defiance of the Village’s generally applicable ordinances,” the lawsuit reads.

The plaintiffs have requested a temporary restraining order in order to have the fence removed. They also asked a judge to declare the action unlawful under the Administrative Procedures Act and urged constituting the fence as a continuing trespass and public nuisance under state and local law, per Block Club Chicago.

An ICE spokesperson told the outlet the suit is “yet another political stunt by the local politicians fueling aggression against federal law enforcement in Broadview.”

“We will not apologize for decisive, lawful action to protect our personnel, facilities, and those in our custody, and to uphold the rule of law, and keep the community safe, something local authorities should be doing as well,” ICE spokesperson Emily Covington added in a statement.

Just two weeks after President Donald Trump’s proclamation imposing an unprecedented $100,000 fee on every new H-1B applicant, the legal challenge many immigration experts expected—but few anticipated in this form—has arrived. A broad and seemingly unprecedented coalition of labor unions, academic associations, religious institutions, and private employers has joined forces to take the administration to court.

Other plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers (UAW), the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), and several faith-based organizations.

Represented by a consortium of advocacy groups and IMMpact Litigation—a joint venture of the immigration law firms Siskind Susser, Kuck Baxter, Joseph & Hall, and Bless Litigation—the plaintiffs argue that the president lacks the statutory authority to unilaterally alter the regulatory and financial framework governing the H-1B visa program.

The lawsuit states: “The proclamation transforms the H-1B program into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, to be granted at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security—a system that invites selective enforcement and corruption.”

In a conversation with The American Bazaar, leading immigration attorneys Greg Siskind and Charles H. Kuck—two of the principal architects of the legal challenge and co-counsels in Global Nurse Force v. Trump—explain why the lawsuit could become a defining moment in the balance of power between Congress and the executive branch in immigration law.

The American Bazaar: Can you walk us through the principal legal argument behind this lawsuit challenging President Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee order?

Charles Kuck: The authority invoked by the President does not allow him to condition entry on a tax or fee. Furthermore, since this is clearly not a fee or a gift, it constitutes a tax—and only Congress has the power to levy taxes.

The lawsuit highlights the case of Phoenix Doe, an Indian researcher whose work is now stalled. How representative is her case of the broader harm caused by the new rule?

Greg Siskind: Regarding Phoenix Doe, her case illustrates well the story we wanted to highlight. The H-1B visa covers a broad range of highly skilled individuals in the US. It has a common requirement of the position being bachelor’s level. But that hits every important sector in American society.

For decades, America has led the world in scientific research, thanks in large part to foreign nationals who come here to work in our universities and research institutions. As an aside, just today Michel Devoret—an immigrant from France who is a professor at UC Santa Barbara and formerly at Yale University—won the Nobel Prize in Physics!

A substantial portion of those scientists rely on the H-1B visa to do their work. We also wanted to emphasize the diversity of H-1B employers, since the proclamation—and much of the media coverage—tends to focus only on the tech sector. Yes, tech is important, and we believe H-1B workers there are incredibly valuable, but the visa is also used by religious organizations, schools educating our children, rural hospitals, and many other sectors facing severe shortages—employers who are in no position to afford a $100,000 tax on each worker.

READ: Trump’s H-1B crackdown puts tech and U.S.-India ties at risk (

Are there any previous cases where unilateral fee or tax impositions by the executive branch have been struck down by the courts? Also, what is the immediate legal relief you are seeking?

Charles Kuck: Yes, many courts have struck down illegal taxes and tariffs, and the constitution gives exclusive power to the Congress on these issues. As for the immediate relief — we are looking for the court to strike down the proclamation as unlawful.

Has there been any response from the administration or federal agencies since filing the case?

Greg Siskind: We have not heard anything from the administration to date. We also have not seen any communications from government agencies about the tax since we filed the case.

The plaintiffs include labor unions, universities, and religious groups—an unusual coalition. How did these diverse groups come together for this case?

Greg Siskind: As for the diversity of the plaintiffs, as I noted, the untold story of the H-1B is that it touches so many people in the country in direct and indirect ways, and we wanted to make sure this was known.

The proclamation is premised on the idea that the H-1B is just a visa to bring in cheap tech workers who displace Americans. First, that’s not true. But secondly, it obscures the point that the H-1B is used so broadly to fill critical worker shortages and that this rule means religious congregations won’t have clergy, health care clinics won’t have nurses and doctors, cancer research will slow significantly, and more.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-X-Court.png,N,,2025-10-08 08:56:29.090794

These voices are not partisan. They are principled. Having served on the bench with fidelity to law over politics, these jurists now step forward—not to advocate for any party or agenda but to illuminate the constitutional architecture that protects liberty and equality for all.

Their reflections are rooted in experience, not ideology. Their warnings are grounded in precedent.

At a time when threats to judicial independence are growing more frequent and more brazen, The Fulcrum offers this series as a civic resource and a moral compass. We believe that understanding how our courts function and why their integrity is essential to preserving the democratic experiment our founders envisioned is crucial.

Today, Judge John S. Martin Jr, who served as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York from 1990 to 2003, answered several important questions for the Fulcrum.

Judge Martin’s distinguished legal career has spanned more than six decades. Before his judicial appointment, Judge Martin served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1980 to 1983, leading one of the nation’s most prominent prosecutorial offices. Earlier in his career, he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief Appellate Attorney in the SDNY. He also served as an Assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General from 1967 to 1969. Judge Martin additionally held positions in private practice at several prominent firms, including Debevoise & Plimpton and Schulte Roth & Zabel, and was a founding partner of Martin & Obermaier.

Following his retirement from the bench, Judge Martin remained active in legal practice, serving as an arbitrator and consultant in matters involving commercial contracts, executive compensation, insurance coverage, and construction claims—routinely handling disputes valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Judge Martin is a graduate of Manhattan College (B.A., 1957) and Columbia Law School (LL.B., 1961).

His words are a reminder that the judiciary is not a tool of power; it is a bulwark against its abuse.

Why did the framers enshrine an independent judiciary—and how does that safeguard our democracy today?

The genius of the Constitution lies in the fact that it created three separate coequal branches of the government, each with an independent responsibility. Congress was to pass laws; the president was the chief executive who would execute and enforce those laws, and the judiciary was to provide a forum for citizens and others to litigate disputes arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Most important, it was for the courts to have the final say as to whether either Congress or the president had overstepped their bounds and engaged in conduct that was either contradictory to or unsupported by something in the Constitution and laws of the United States. Thus, an important function of the federal courts is to ensure that neither Congress nor the president exercise power not granted by the Constitution.

Why are retired judges speaking out now—what compels you to break tradition and raise your voice?

The current political atmosphere has given rise to both physical threats to judges and efforts to undermine the independence of the judiciary.

Those who adopted the Constitution recognized the importance of having judges who were truly independent and who would act free from any pressure to do anything other than that which the law required. For that reason, the Constitution provided that federal judges should serve for life and could only be removed by impeachment and also provided that their compensation could not be diminished.

Why is using impeachment to challenge judicial decisions a threat to constitutional balance?

The Constitution prohibits removing a federal judge from office except by impeachment for ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Thus, there is no grounds for an impeachment proceeding based solely on a judge's good-faith decision in a particular case.

Even though a judge cannot be impeached for a particular decision, the commencement of such a proceeding impinges upon the independence of the judiciary for two reasons. 1) it causes the judge to have to spend time and money defending a baseless proceeding, and 2) it inflames public reaction to such a decision and thereby creates a threat that someone will seek to injure the ""offending"" judge either physically or financially.

What do you wish more Americans understood about the role of judges in preserving liberty and equality?

Because of their independence, federal judges have the freedom to decide cases solely on the merits. That gives them the ability to protect the rights of each of us from any type of prohibited discrimination or from an unwarranted criminal or civil litigation.

What moment from your time on the bench best captures the weight—or wonder—of serving justice?

For me, the most difficult and most rewarding part of my work involved sentencing individuals for violation of criminal law. It was difficult because sentencing anyone to a substantial term in prison is an awesome responsibility. Federal law requires use of a sentencing guideline system, which in many cases can result in an unjust sentence if the guideline is literally applied. However, there are cases in which a judge can impose a sentence less than that set by the guidelines if the judge can articulate the existence of some factor that was not adequately considered by the commission that set up the guidelines. I think I did my best work as a judge in several cases where I dramatically reduced the sentences the guidelines established, using this exception. I think, for example, of the case in which I reduced the sentence of the mother of three young children from 3 1/2 years to seven months, and another in which I reduced the sentence of a low-level drug dealer from 19 to 12 years. Feeling that you are doing justice to those who may not have otherwise received it is one of the greatest satisfactions you can have as a judge.

While Claudia is a naturalized citizen with full legal status to be in the United States, in April, she started carrying her passport in her car in case ICE agents confronted her. Claudia works for herself, cleaning houses and individual apartments, and has never been in trouble with the law. Still, because she “looks” Latina, with darker features than some fair-skinned Latinos, she believes ICE agents would target her for questioning and even detainment if their paths should cross.

“They (ICE agents) are racial profiling,” Claudia tells palabra. “I feel this about people who are in office trying to make this country white. Every week, something happens to good people who are just trying to work. At this point, I don’t feel safe even with my passport. They’ve picked up citizens. ICE agents are acting with a lot of hate. They don’t care if you show them a passport; they don’t want to see it. They’re using violence against people walking on the street or driving in their cars.”

Asked for a response about the fear experienced by many people who are in the country legally, the ICE press office provided this comment via email:

“In the United States, immigration laws mandate that all non-U.S. citizens carry proof of their authorization to be in the United States. This requirement, rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act, emphasizes the importance of having immediate access to documentation that verifies one’s right to be in the U.S. Whether you are a visitor, a student, or a permanent resident, understanding and complying with this law is crucial for navigating daily life in the United States without legal complications. Stating that a fear of law enforcement is the main reason for carrying such documents, which are required by law, is like saying the reason you carry a driver’s license on your person while driving a vehicle is because you are afraid of the police. Bottom line: it's the law. What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

White House Border Czar Tom Homan said in an interview earlier this year that ICE agents don’t need probable cause to detain people briefly, explaining that an individual’s appearance is reason enough for immigration officers to detain someone.

“People need to understand, ICE officers and Border Patrol do not need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them,” Homan said on “Fox and Friends.” “They just go through their observations, get articulable facts, based on their location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions.”

There are countless examples on YouTube, on X (formerly Twitter), and on TikTok of ICE agents aggressively questioning – and sometimes handcuffing and detaining – people who are in the country legally.

ICE agents have detained U.S. citizens as well as permanent legal residents.

Some examples:

In early August, ICE agents conducting a raid at a car wash in Anaheim, Calif., about 26 miles southeast of Los Angeles, tackled and detained U.S. citizen Isaac Domínguez. Domínguez told the local NBC affiliate and KCAL News that he was driving to the car wash when he saw ICE agents and pulled over. “That’s when I got upset because I think to myself, they’re just attacking Hispanic people. They tackled me to the floor and put the cuffs on me, hands behind my back.”

A Department of Homeland Security official released a statement accusing Domínguez of tossing an object at a government law enforcement vehicle and of trying to punch ICE agents who approached him, which he denies. After several hours, authorities released him without any charges.

In June, ICE agents in Los Angeles detained U.S. citizen Andrea Vélez. The woman said her mom and sister dropped her off on a downtown street where masked, plainclothes men were “going after” people. One of them grabbed her, and when she tried to tell him she’s a U.S. citizen, he accused her of impeding him. When she asked for his badge number or identification, he responded that she didn’t need to know any of that, she said in an interview with the Los Angeles NBC affiliate.

Vélez said she told other ICE officers she is a U.S. citizen and showed them her real ID, but they didn’t believe her. A report on the news program Democracy Now! showed video of an ICE agent carrying Vélez, who is 4’11. She spent two days in a detention center and had nothing to drink for 24 hours. In a criminal complaint, federal prosecutors alleged Vélez stepped into an agent’s path and extended an arm in an apparent attempt to prevent an ICE agent from catching a man he was chasing. Authorities released her after 48 hours, and prosecutors dropped the charge against her.

In April, at the request of federal immigration officials, authorities in Florida held Juan Carlos López-Gómez in a local jail in Leon County, which is in the Florida Panhandle region. Local authorities detained him even after his mother presented his birth certificate and Social Security information to a local judge. Florida Highway Patrol officers, who have been deputized by Gov. Ron DeSantis to conduct immigration enforcement, acted on a request by ICE and took the 20-year-old to jail following a routine traffic stop for speeding - he was a passenger in the car and was coming to Florida from Georgia for work. López-Gómez was born in Georgia.

He was released after the case received widespread media coverage.

ICE’s aggressive tactics have even sparked fear among some non-Hispanic, white immigrants who are in the country legally.

For example, Katia, a white South African immigrant who is a naturalized citizen and lives in Fairfax County, Va., says ICE’s approach prompted her in recent months to always carry her U.S. passport inside her bag. (Katia is not her real name; like Claudia, she asked to be identified by a pseudonym because she fears retaliation from ICE). She worries about how an ICE agent would react if they heard her speak and noticed her South African accent.

Katia, who is in her 50s, works in communications for a social justice organization. She came to the U.S. in the early 1990s and became a naturalized citizen in 1994.

She says that the type of tactics ICE is currently using was common in South Africa, which had an apartheid government at the time she emigrated to the U.S. “It was common practice for (South African) authorities to pull people off the street and ship immigrants off to their home countries. I didn’t think I’d ever see that happen in the U.S.”

When she became a U.S. citizen, “Americans were so lovely to me. People I would tell would give me a hug,” she says. “Randos would congratulate me. It seemed they were touched that I would want to become an American citizen. I don’t feel that way anymore.”

The Trump administration’s mass deportation program is not the first time the U.S. government has carried out a campaign to expel immigrants on a mass scale.

In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched “Operation Wetback” to send Mexican immigrants, including some who were American citizens, to their native country. Border Patrol officers carried out the program, which lasted several months. At the time, Border Patrol officers claimed that 1.2 million people of Mexican descent were either arrested or left the U.S. on their own, but some researchers believe that number was exaggerated, and that the true number was in the hundreds of thousands.

The federal government at some point will pay a steep price in court for the overzealous tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol, a civil rights attorney says.

""The U.S. government will face significant financial liability in court for ICE’s aggressive tactics, says Cary J. Hansel, a civil rights attorney in Baltimore. Hansel adds that civil lawsuits on behalf of those unlawfully detained by ICE, alleging ICE is violating the 14th Amendment – which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and provides “equal protection under the law” in addition to prohibiting the government from depriving individuals of due process – will lead to large jury verdicts or settlements.

“There will be a tremendous price to pay for this kind of lazy and unconstitutional conduct. In a democracy that values freedom, people should not have to show their papers to prove they belong. This conduct turns the Constitution on its head.”

The bishops presented the pope with letters from immigrants expressing fear of deportation and family separation.

Why It Matters:

This marks one of Pope Leo’s strongest interventions on U.S. immigration since assuming office in May. Although known for his more reserved approach compared to the late Pope Francis, Leo has recently become more vocal, questioning whether Trump’s anti-immigration measures align with the Catholic Church’s pro-life teachings. His comments signal growing Vatican pressure on the U.S. Church to take a firmer public stance.

Key players include Pope Leo, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and the Trump administration. The bishops especially from border regions such as El Paso are now under renewed encouragement to speak out on human rights and migrant protection, potentially heightening tensions between the Church and Washington.

What’s Next:

The Vatican has yet to issue an official statement on the meeting. The U.S. bishops are expected to discuss coordinated responses in upcoming conferences, while the White House continues to defend its immigration enforcement as a fulfillment of Trump’s campaign promises.

“Trump and [Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco] Rubio are pushing for regime change in Venezuela,” the account for the Democratic committee members posted on social media on Tuesday.

“The American people don’t want another war — and Congress can’t let any president start one illegally or unilaterally. That’s not how the Constitution works,” the group added.

Rubio has been leading the effort for regime change, the New York Times reported late last month.

The push for regime change would involve a “broad campaign that would escalate military pressure to try to force” out Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, the Times reported. Administration officials have said that U.S. forces have struck four vessels in the Caribbean that they claim originated from Venezuela over the past weeks, killing 21 people so far. These strikes have been roundly condemned by human rights experts as illegal.

Trump administration officials have, indeed, been steadily escalating their rhetoric against the country. Last week, Trump reportedly sent a memo to Congress saying that he has “determined” that the U.S. “is in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organizations.” It added that he has directed the Pentagon to “conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict.”

Additionally, Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee highlighted that U.S. officials say the Trump administration has cut off diplomatic relations with the country amid an effort for a negotiated diplomatic agreement.

U.S. officials allege that Maduro is a leader of “narco-terrorists,” citing an indictment against him issued during Trump’s first term. However, the U.S. has not provided any evidence of this claim, and the National Intelligence Council has released an assessment saying that the Maduro government does not lead the Tren de Aragua gang as administration officials have claimed.

Democratic leaders have largely stayed quiet about Trump effectively declaring war without the permission of Congress. In fact, some senior Democrats are reportedly warning fellow members against opposing Trump’s war, saying that it would be tantamount to throwing their support behind Maduro.

Some Senate Democrats are reportedly seeking to force a vote on a war powers resolution, introduced last month by Senators Adam Schiff (D-California) and Tim Kaine (D-Virginia), in an attempt to bar Trump from using further force against Venezuela this week.

The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed (Rhode Island), sharply condemned Trump’s “armed conflict” declaration last week.

“Every American should be alarmed that the President believes he can wage secret wars against anyone he chooses. Congress alone has the constitutional power to decide when America goes to war. The President cannot launch military campaigns and invent legal cover after the fact,” he said in a statement on Friday. “The Administration must immediately testify before Congress and the American people about this reckless campaign.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_10-07-trump-rubio.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:01:06.669422

Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker of serving the American public a ""smorgasbord of lies"" as it released a list that it says ""debunks"" his claims about federal law enforcement operations in Chicago.

The federal pushback comes as the Democratic governor and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson filed a lawsuit Monday to block the Trump administration from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas in Chicago and surrounding cities.

""Our message to JB Pritzker: Get out of your mansion and see Chicago,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""If JB Pritzker actually walked the streets of his own city, he would see domestic terrorists and violent rioters attacking police officers and the scourge of violent crime as a direct result of his own policies.""

The DHS added that it ""is setting the record straight about Pritzker’s lies and defending the brave men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from his smears and slander.""

PRITZKER SUES TRUMP TO BLOCK NATIONAL GUARD ACTION IN ILLINOIS

During a press conference Monday, Pritzker said there has been an ""unconstitutional invasion of Illinois by the federal government,"" and, ""For weeks now, Donald Trump, Kristi Noem, and [Commander at Large of the U.S. Border Patrol] Gregory Bovino have brought their militarized CBP and ICE agents to the streets of Chicago to cause violence and chaos in this city.""

However, the DHS said the ""reality"" is that, ""this is neither unconstitutional nor an invasion.""

""President Trump has the authority under the Constitution to deploy troops, wherever they’re stationed, to defend federal facilities from attacks,"" it added in response to Pritzker’s first claim on the list. ""Whether it’s the ICE facility in Broadview or the courthouse in Portland, we will defend federal property wherever they are under siege.""

In an appearance on CNN on Monday, Pritzker said, ""People are getting detained, they’re getting arrested: U.S. citizens. They did this when they raided a building in the middle of the night in South Shore [Chicago]. One hundred thirty people, they were emptied out of this building. They were going after a few gang members, and instead, they broke windows, they broke down doors, they ransacked the place... They are the ones that are making it a war zone.""

PRITZKER SAYS TRUMP ORDERING 400 MEMBERS OF THE TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD TO ILLINOIS, OREGON AND OTHER LOCATIONS

""Law enforcement conducted a targeted operation at an apartment building in the South Shore community of Chicago,"" DHS said in response. ""This operation, conducted by the CBP, the FBI, and the ATF, resulted in the arrest of 37 illegal aliens, from such countries as Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, and Nigeria. Among them were Tren de Aragua gang members and violent criminals.""

""DHS has routinely debunked the absurd claim that DHS is targeting U.S. citizens during ICE operations. ICE does not arrest or deport U.S. citizens. Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement,"" it also said.

Pritzker’s office did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

The Illinois governor said on Monday, ""On September 12, ICE shot and killed a man in Franklin Park, a nearby suburb of Chicago. His name was Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez. Reports say that he had just dropped his kids off at a daycare and was headed to work.""

""Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez was an illegal alien who, when law enforcement ordered him to stop his car, instead drove his car at the officers. One of the ICE officers was hit by the car and dragged a significant distance. Fearing for his own life and broader public safety, the officer fired his weapon,"" according to DHS. ""Despite his injuries, the officer and his partner immediately started administering emergency medical care to the illegal alien, who was pronounced dead. Villegas-Gonzalez, who was the target of the operation, was a criminal illegal alien with a history of reckless driving.""

Then Pritzker added, ""In the small suburban village of Broadview, with a population of 8,000, federal agents have turned two blocks of protest areas into a warzone by firing tear gas and chemical agents at peaceful protesters.""

""Rioters against DHS and other law enforcement in Illinois have been anything but peaceful. Over the weekend, Border Patrol law enforcement officers were ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles,"" Homeland Security said. ""One woman, Marimar Martinez, driving one of the vehicles, was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and has a history of doxxing federal agents. She took defensive fire from CBP agents, has been discharged from the hospital, and is currently in the custody of the FBI. The driver of another vehicle, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, involved in the ramming, has been apprehended by law enforcement.""

Pritzker also said Monday that, ""Peaceful protesters have been hit with tear gas and shot with rubber bullets. Journalists simply reporting the facts on the ground have been targeted and arrested. Us citizens, including children, have been traumatized and detained. This escalation of violence is targeted and intentional and premeditated. The Trump Administration is following a playbook, cause chaos, create fear and confusion.""

""The First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting. DHS is taking reasonable and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers,"" DHS said in response. ""ICE officers are facing a nearly 1000% increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, and gang members. We remind members of the media to exercise caution as they cover these violent riots and remind journalists that covering unlawful activities in the field does come with risks — though our officers take every reasonable precaution to mitigate those dangers to those exercising protected First Amendment rights.""

CHICAGO'S POLICE CHIEF PUTS CRIMINALS ON NOTICE AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS TARGETED IN WEEKEND CONFRONTATIONS

During his CNN interview with host Jake Tapper, Pritzker also said, ""They’re raiding neighborhoods, where, instead of going after the bad guys, they’re just picking up people who are brown and [B]lack and then checking their credentials.""

""Since Operation Midway Blitz began in Illinois last month, ICE and CBP officers have arrested more than 1,000 illegal aliens — including the worst of the worst pedophiles, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers,"" DHS said. ""We have also arrested multiple members of the gang Tren de Aragua, and illegal aliens with criminal histories that include drug trafficking, child rape, and murder, among other violent convictions. Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE. What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.""

And lastly, Pritzker said, ""There were people who were held, elderly people, and children zip-tied, elderly people held for three hours at a time,"" during the South Shore operation.

Adopted in October 2000, Resolution 1325 established that women should be full, safe, equal, and meaningful participants in all discussions about their country’s future, including peace talks. Resolution 1325 has never been more important than it is today, as we face a global backlash against women’s rights and escalating wars and crises around the globe.

And yet, we are seeing a dangerous erosion of the basic principle 1325 stands for.

Women still have to fight for a seat at the tables where key discussions take place; the UN itself sometimes excludes women.

In 2020, then-UN undersecretary general Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka described 1325 as “one of the crowning achievements of the global women’s movement and one of the most inspired decisions of the United Nations Security Council.” But the Security Council members that unanimously adopted the resolution 25 years ago have often failed to uphold 1325. And the number of women’s rights defenders briefing the council has fallen dramatically, a trend worsened by the US immigration crackdown, which has blocked many potential speakers from traveling safely to New York, where the council meets.

Resolution 1325 has been stress-tested over the last 25 years. Subsequent resolutions detailed what full participation by women means, and how countries and multilateral bodies should ensure women’s participation and respond to gendered impacts of conflict. Well over 100 countries developed national action plans for how they would implement Resolution 1325.

All this effort helped prove what women in war zones already knew: women’s participation makes a difference. One comprehensive study found that when women are involved in peace negotiations, those processes are more likely to lead to agreement, and agreements are more likely to be implemented. In its 20 year review of Resolution 1325, UN Women wrote that research “comprehensively demonstrates that the participation of women at all levels is key to the operational effectiveness, success and sustainability of peace processes and peacebuilding efforts.”

If we want a peaceful world for ourselves and future generations, we should mark this anniversary by reminding policymakers everywhere of the unofficial slogan of the women’s movement fighting to uphold Resolution 1325: “No women, no peace.”",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/10/202510un_us_security_council.JPG?h=790be497&itok=FbB9P2Cm,N,,2025-10-08 04:57:17.364656

Now, a legal battle is unfolding as states like Oregon and Illinois challenge the federal government's use of the National Guard against the wishes of state and city leaders.

The arrival of the Texas National Guard in Chicago marks a divide between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.

""We have these local states that are refusing to enforce the law, and we have chaos,"" Abbott told Sean Hannity on Monday.

Meanwhile, Pritzker slammed President Donald Trump as the state of Illinois takes legal action to stop the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago.

""Donald Trump is using our servicemembers as political props,"" Pritzker said during a press conference Monday.

Governor Abbott shared a post on 'X' Monday night with a photo of servicemembers boarding a plane.

""Our elite National Guard in the state of Texas began their deployment as they were loading on planes in Texas, boarding on flights to parts of the country where they will be able to safeguard ICE officials and other federal officials,"" Abbott said.

Pritzker challenged Abbott's backing of the move.

""I have called upon Governor Abbott to immediately withdraw his support for this decision,"" he said.

A Trump-appointed judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the use of the National Guard in Portland on Monday. A judge in Illinois did not do the same.

Constitutional law expert Chris Mirasola, assistant professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said the president's use of the National Guard is testing the law in new ways.

""We're increasing the likelihood that judges at the initial stages of this litigation are going to disagree,"" Mirasola said of the lack of court precedent.

Mirasola said there is a chance the use of the National Guard without the consent of governors could make it to the Supreme Court.

President Trump has answered that he's not ruling out using the 'Insurrection Act' to bypass court rulings.

""The text of the act is really old and really broad, and so there are a lot of questions about what the factual showings are that you need to invoke the Insurrection Act,"" Mirasola said.

Immigration facility remains open amid legal challenges The contradiction raises questions about who actually has authority over detainees there and whether due process is being followed.","(NewsNation) — Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice say many detainees held at the Florida immigration detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” have never been in removal proceedings, directly contradicting what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been saying since it opened in July.

Attorneys for the DOJ argued Thursday in a court filing that the detainees at the facility in the Everglades are housed with immigration detainees “in all stages” of the process, and they don’t have enough in common to be certified as a class in a lawsuit over whether they’re getting proper access to attorneys.

A removal proceeding is a legal process initiated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to determine if someone should be deported from the United States.

That directly contradicts DeSantis, who has repeatedly claimed that everyone at the facility is already under a final order to be deported.

Detainees denied proper legal access: DOJ attorneys

The DOJ attorneys argue that detainees at the facility are being denied access to their attorneys. They also wrote that the detainees have too many different immigration statuses to be considered a class.

“The proposed class includes all detainees at Alligator Alcatraz, a facility that houses detainees in all stages of immigration processing — presumably including those who have never been in removal proceedings, those who will be placed into removal proceedings, those who are already subject to final orders of removal, those subject to expedited removal, and those detained for the purpose of facilitation removal from the United States pursuant to a final order of removal,” they wrote.

Since the facility opened, DeSantis has been publicly stating that each detainee has undergone a process to determine that they can’t legally be in the United States.

“I can tell you, DHS is sending people who they absolutely believe are here illegally and subject to deportation,” DeSantis said during a July 25 news conference. “Everybody here is already on a final removal order. They have been ordered to be removed from the country.”

At a July 29 speech before a conference of the Florida Sheriffs Association, DeSantis said, “The people that are going to the Alligator Alcatraz are illegally in the country. They’ve all already been given a final order of removal.”

So far, DeSantis’ office has not responded to the DOJ’s statements.

Immigration facility remains open amid legal challenges

The contradiction raises questions about who actually has authority over detainees there and whether due process is being followed.

The court filing by DOJ attorneys was made in a lawsuit in which civil rights groups allege that the facility’s detainees have been denied proper access to attorneys, in violation of their constitutional rights. The civil rights groups on Thursday asked a federal judge in Fort Myers for a preliminary injunction that would establish stronger protections for detainees to meet with attorneys privately and share documents confidentially.

The court case is one of three lawsuits filed by environmental and civil rights groups over the detention center, which was hastily built this summer by the state of Florida and operated by private contractors and state agencies.

A federal judge in Miami ordered the facility to wind down operations in August, citing environmental issues with the Everglades site. But weeks later, a different judge’s panel put that on hold, allowing the detention center to stay open while the legal fight continues.

At one point, the facility held more than 900 detainees, but most of them were transferred after the initial injunction. It wasn’t clear on Monday how many detainees were at the center, which was built to hold 3,000 people.

Meanwhile, the number of ICE detainees with a prior criminal conviction (15,725) is now smaller than the number without any criminal record.
This is the “first time” that’s “EVER” happened, according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.
To substantiate his claim, Reichlin-Melnick charted the fluctuations in ICE’s detention population since May 2019, which is as far back as the data goes.
One reason is that the administration has set a new quota of 3,000 ICE arrests per day, up from 1,000 previously.","President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other top Trump administration officials have long claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would spend Trump’s second term prioritizing “the worst of the worst” for deportation: not necessarily immigrants who came to (or stayed in) America without authorization, but rather those who have committed serious crimes since arriving here.

Now, nine months after Trump returned to the Oval Office, new government data suggests that ICE is no longer following that playbook.

According to the agency’s own Sept. 25 custody report, the largest group of immigrants arrested in the interior and currently detained by ICE (16,523) are people with no criminal record at all. (To be clear, being present in the U.S. unlawfully is a civil immigration law violation punishable by deportation — not a federal crime punishable by jail.)

Meanwhile, the number of ICE detainees with a prior criminal conviction (15,725) is now smaller than the number without any criminal record. The same goes for the share who face pending criminal charges (13,767).

This is the “first time” that’s “EVER” happened, according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council. To substantiate his claim, Reichlin-Melnick charted the fluctuations in ICE’s detention population since May 2019, which is as far back as the data goes. Here’s what that chart looks like:

The orange line represents detainees with no criminal record. After remaining relatively low and flat for years, it effectively goes vertical at the start of 2025, a period coinciding with Trump’s return to office — and shoots up so quickly and suddenly that it now surpasses the two other categories of detainees.

ICE is “raiding neighborhoods, where, instead of going after the bad guys, they're just picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials: Are you a U.S. citizen?” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, claimed on Monday. “They need to get out of Chicago if they're not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they were going to do.”

Who Trump said he would deport

Pritzer’s comments came days after Border Patrol agents in Chicago surrounded a five-story apartment building in Chicago’s largely Black South Shore neighborhood, then reportedly “rappelled” from helicopters and went door to door, rousing residents — including children — and using zip ties to restrain them.

“They was terrified,” one resident told the local ABC affiliate. “The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other.”

The Department of Homeland Security said that it arrested 37 individuals during the operation, all of whom were “involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes and immigration violators.”

During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump pledged to launch “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” adding elsewhere that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” — a statement widely criticized as racist — and coming to the U.S. from “mental institutions.”

His inspiration, he said, was the “Eisenhower model” — a reference to President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s 1954 campaign, known by the ethnic slur “Operation Wetback,” to round up and expel Mexican immigrants in what amounted to a nationwide “show me your papers” rule.

But when experts questioned how Trump would actually deport all of the estimated 14 million unauthorized immigrants residing in the U.S., the candidate and his allies claimed that they would prioritize “criminals” — much like previous administrations.

“We will start by prioritizing the most dangerous criminals,” read the platform adopted at the 2024 Republican National Convention.

“Let's start with the first million who are the most violent criminals, who are the most aggressive,” Vance added at a Pennsylvanian campaign stop. “Get them out of here. First prioritize them, and then you see where you are, and you keep on taking bites of the problem, until you get illegal immigration to a serviceable point.""

Who ICE is targeting — and why

The latest ICE data shows that the agency is still arresting and detaining people with criminal records or pending charges; their ranks have also swelled as immigration enforcement has intensified under Trump, and the Department of Homeland Security frequently puts out press releases publicizing the capture of “heinous criminals.”

In July, Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, called the assessment that ICE isn’t targeting immigrants with a criminal record “false,” telling the Associated Press that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had directed ICE “to target the worst of the worst — including gang members, murderers and rapists.”

Yet since then, noncriminal arrests and detentions have risen at a much greater rate than criminal arrests and detentions. All told, less than 10% of people booked into ICE custody since last October have been convicted of “serious violent or sexual crimes,” according to CNN. A majority do not have any prior criminal convictions at all.

Why? One reason is that the administration has set a new quota of 3,000 ICE arrests per day, up from 1,000 previously. Another is that apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border — which were already falling under former President Joe Biden — have plummeted to their lowest level in decades since Trump took office, leaving agents with fewer easy, newly arrived targets for removal.

Enforcement priorities seem to have shifted as a result. Frustrated by ICE’s initial failure to meet its new deportation quotas, top White House aide Stephen Miller — the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda — held a testy meeting in May at agency headquarters, where he demanded that officers do “what they needed to do” to make more arrests — including rounding up noncriminals in public places, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

Miller told agents they “didn’t need to develop target lists of immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, a longstanding practice,” the Journal reported. “Instead, he directed them to target Home Depot, where day laborers typically gather for hire, or 7-Eleven convenience stores. Miller bet that he and a handful of agents could go out on the streets of Washington, D.C., and arrest 30 people right away.”

The real people who have been affected

For the past few months, ICE has been conducting mass raids in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere to meet its quotas. The agency has also been arresting people when they check in at immigration court and enforcing decades-old deportation orders.

On Wednesday, the Texas Tribune reported on the case of Sergio Garcia, a well-known Waco, Texas, chef and restaurateur who entered the U.S. in 1989; overstayed his visa, became a favorite of the White House press corps under President George W. Bush, and eventually “spent more than 25 years trying to obtain legal status, hiring immigration attorneys in Austin, Houston, San Antonio and Florida.”

In March, ICE arrested and deported Garcia, separating him from his wife and his four U.S.-born adult children — and citing a two-decade-old deportation order that other agents had never attempted to enforce.

“Deportations like Sergio’s — to fixtures of the community — are making people think, ‘This could be me next, or my favorite place next, or somebody who I talk to every day,’” Mito Diaz-Espinoza, president of the Cen-Tex Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told the Tribune. “The protection of ‘Just do the right thing, put your head down, work hard, don’t get caught drunk driving’ — that’s no longer a safety net. That’s no longer going to protect you.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YsBCyPuSj_rZImozK4io2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/84874a60-a377-11f0-a7ff-a63faf559a91,N,,2025-10-08 08:56:24.867028

The proposed changes seek to better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on participation by Providence Police Department (PPD) personnel in federal immigration enforcement activities.
The amendments were advanced to the full city council with a recommendation to pass on a 3-0 vote, with two members abstaining.
“These amendments are intended to better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on voluntary Providence Police Department cooperation in federal immigration enforcement,” said Providence City Council Chief of Staff June Rose in testimony before the committee.
Well over 100 people packed the Providence City Council Chamber, and dozens spoke in favor of the ordinance.","On Monday, the Providence City Council Committee on Ordinances approved an ordinance amending the Community Safety Act (officially known as the Community-Police Relations Act, but referred to as the CSA in this piece) to strengthen protections for city residents. The proposed changes seek to better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on participation by Providence Police Department (PPD) personnel in federal immigration enforcement activities. The amendments were advanced to the full city council with a recommendation to pass on a 3-0 vote, with two members abstaining.

The proposed changes come as Providence residents demand greater accountability following several concerning incidents this summer involving the Police Department. In one such incident, PPD officers were found to have assisted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel performing a raid in the city as part of President Donald Trump’s dangerous and racist crackdown on undocumented Americans.

“These amendments are intended to better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on voluntary Providence Police Department cooperation in federal immigration enforcement,” said Providence City Council Chief of Staff June Rose in testimony before the committee. “In Providence. Such cooperation is already unlawful.”

Upon passage, continued Rose, “the CSA barred the police department from collaborating with federal immigration authorities, absent a judicial warrant. The CSA states that Providence Police are not permitted to comply with requests by other agencies to support or assist in operations conducted solely to enforce federal and civil immigration law, including, but not limited to, requests to establish traffic perimeters related solely to immigration enforcement. The police department’s internal policy mirrors this language.

“This policy was recently tested in a widely circulated video of the July 13th Alberton Avenue incident,” noted Rose. “Viewers watched as Providence police officers provided assistance to ICE in what PERA, the independent board charged with oversight of the department, found was operationally significant. Critically, this was during an exclusively immigration enforcement action where ICE officers were operating without a judicial warrant. Counselors have argued that the incident exposed gaps in the CSA’s protections by showing how Providence Police could still, in practice, provide indirect assistance to federal immigration enforcement.”

The proposed changes fall into five major categories:

Expanding types of prohibited contact between PPD and federal immigration authorities, including ICE

By broadening the legal definition of federal immigration enforcement agencies to include any federal entity tasked with carrying out such activities, the prohibition on cooperation by PPD will include agencies not usually tasked with immigration, which the Trump administration has recently deputized to expand capacity and meet their stated goal of 3,000 arrests per day. The list of prohibited activities will be expanded to include identification verification and translation services, further limiting interactions between municipal and federal law enforcement that could be exploited to harm Providence residents.

The changes would prohibit the Police Department from exercising authority under 287(g) or 103(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows municipal law enforcement agencies to be formally deputized and authorized to conduct federal immigration enforcement.

Clarifying prohibited collaboration with federal authorities without a signed judicial warrant

Under the proposed changes, Providence Police will continue to comply with all federally required and lawfully directed actions, as they always have – as long as a valid, signed, criminal judicial warrant accompanies those directives. The proposed CSA changes prohibit police involvement based on civil immigration warrants, an intimidation tool used by federal immigration authorities that carries no legal requirement for compliance by local law enforcement. The amended ordinance clearly lists what exactly is prohibited, including but not limited to:

Providing information to ICE about arrestees that is not available to the public

Using any city money, personnel, or resources to assist in the investigation, interrogation, detention, detection, or arrest of anyone for immigration enforcement

Establishing traffic perimeters or otherwise controlling public areas to assist immigration enforcement

The amendments also allow for student IDs or any other valid photo IDs to be used as acceptable forms of identification.

Establishing protected spaces within the city

The changes expand the CSA’s definition of “schools” to include charter schools, city-run preschool and early-learning programs, and daycare and after-school facilities. The ordinance then requires those schools, as well as the courts and non-public parts of the public department, to deny access to their premises if immigration enforcement requests entry without presenting a valid judicial warrant. Defining these protected spaces gives families, especially youth, more confidence about their safety while at school or accessing city services. Providence Police, courthouses, prisons, and jails would also be required to designate a person who can independently verify judicial warrants that are presented by federal authorities.

Limiting collection and disclosure of sensitive personal data

To meet their presidentially directed quotas of resident arrests, federal immigration authorities have been demanding more frequent and specific private personal data from municipal law enforcement. To limit the harm disclosing this data would cause to Providence communities, the proposed changes would prohibit Providence police from collecting demographic data, such as race or ethnicity, via city-operated surveillance technologies, such as Flock cameras and services such as the Real Time Crime Center. They would then require that all current and future partner agencies accessing city-owned data agree via formal written agreement to all the restrictions outlined in the ordinance, including not sharing any data with federal immigration enforcement, absent a judicial warrant.

Allowing organizations to hold the city accountable by suing after alleged violations

The proposed changes establish organizational standing in the private right of action. This would allow specific non-government organizations, such as civil rights, human rights, and youth organizations, to file civil action against the city, the department, or an officer if they allege CSA violations by the Providence Police. By intentionally broadening the city’s accountability in cases of alleged violation, councilors are sending a clear message that every Providence resident deserves to have their rights protected – and that violations must be accompanied by consequences.

Well over 100 people packed the Providence City Council Chamber, and dozens spoke in favor of the ordinance. Only one person, Allen Waters, who has declared his candidacy for Mayor of Providence, spoke against the ordinance, and in a classy move, dropped an ethnic slur while doing so.

Testimony was heard for three hours. Here’s the video:

If they were checking, local officials would be providing an additional layer of oversight at a time when the number of people held in detention centers has surged because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on unauthorized immigrants.

Two state laws provide state, county and local officials the authority to review health and safety conditions in privately-run immigration detention facilities.

The first, passed during the first Trump administration, allows the attorney general’s office to inspect for violations of national detention standards and health or safety issues. The AG’s office has used that power to publish annual reports on conditions inside detention centers, including one this year that alleged deficient mental health care.

The second, a 2024 law, empowers counties to inspect privately run detention facilities. In the past, counties have inspected jails and prisons, finding mold, rats, and other health violations. But county health officials have not used that power to inspect federal immigration detention facilities.

In Kern County — where three detention centers operate — the health officer, through an attorney, has said in testimony before a federal judge that he has “no intention” of exercising his new authority to inspect the facilities to ensure they comply with state and local health standards.

The companies that manage the detention centers through contracts with the federal government say they take seriously their responsibility to adhere to federal standards and uphold human rights. One unsuccessfully sued to overturn the new California inspection law, alleging it was unnecessary and an intrusion on the federal government’s authority.

More than 5,700 people are in immigration detention in California, an 84% increase since the spring. On April 16, there were 3,100 people detained in the state, according to the California Attorney General’s latest report.

Advocates for detainees are drawing attention to what they describe as unhealthy conditions, including in the state’s newest detention center. It opened in Kern County without proper permits or a business license as required by state law, according to California City’s mayor.

CoreCivic’s 2,560-bed immigration detention center there sits on 70 acres in the Mojave desert about 80 miles east of Bakersfield.

A detainee who goes by the name of Loba has been locked up in the California City facility since Aug. 28. She said some detainees have not received the medication they need for more than 20 days. She asked CalMatters not to fully identify her because she feared retaliation by CoreCivic guards for speaking with a reporter.

“There’s a lack of interest on the part of CoreCivic to care for individuals with diabetes problems and people who have heart problems or any other health conditions. They’re really not caring for detainees and not giving us the proper medical treatment in detention,” Loba said.

She said she observed five people who needed emergency care because they could not get medication. Another California City detainee described similar conditions in an interview with CalMatters.

Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said the site has robust medical and mental health care on site, including around-the-clock access to those services. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

“There are no delays in individuals getting their prescription medications,” Gustin said.

Counties reviewing inspection law

In the four counties where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detention facilities, only one county health department conducts the kind of inspections allowed under the 2024 law. A San Bernardino County spokesperson said the county has the authority to inspect for disease control and “general health and sanitation,” but he later said the reviews are limited to the facilities’ food processing and service.

Officials from two other counties said they’ll use their new authority to respond to specific concerns, but that they had not yet done any inspections.

The Imperial County health department said it would respond to a complaint “if the facility falls within our legal authority to inspect.” The San Diego County health department said only that it “is exploring how to effectively operationalize this law in its jurisdiction.”

California has seven immigration detention centers: Adelanto ICE Processing Center and Desert View Annex in San Bernardino County; The Golden State Annex, Mesa Verde ICE Processing facility, and the California City detention facility in Kern County; The Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Imperial County; and the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego County.

ICE pays the for-profit prison company GEO Group to operate four of the centers: Adelanto, Desert View Annex, Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center.

MTC manages the detention center in Imperial County, while CoreCivic manages Otay Mesa and California City.

The 2024 law gives local health officials the authority to inspect private detention facilities as they deem necessary, but it does not require them to do so unless requested by local lawmakers or law enforcement. And it does not specify exactly what county health inspectors should check, despite lawmakers and cosponsors of the bill citing “detainees facing challenges in accessing timely medical attention” as one of the reasons the new law was necessary.

As the bill moved forward, lawmakers also cited a May 2020 COVID-19 outbreak at the Otay Mesa Detention Center that resulted in more than 300 staff and detained individuals becoming infected. “Conditions in these facilities not only affect the lives of those detained, but also impact the surrounding communities,” wrote the bill’s author, state Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles.

It passed without any recorded opposition and with unanimous votes in the Legislature.

GEO Group sued to challenge the law, arguing it was unconstitutional because it stepped on the federal government’s authority to manage detention centers. By extension, GEO claimed intergovernmental immunity as a contractor.

“This case involves the latest in a string of attempts by the State of California to ban federal immigration enforcement in the state, or so significantly burden such efforts as to drive federal agencies and contractors involved in that constitutionally-mandated national security function from California,” GEO attorneys argued in the suit, which was filed in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of California.

In federal court this year, Kern County attorney Jeremy McNutt said county health officer Kristopher Lyon doesn’t want to use the new law to inspect the Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex facilities in his county. McNutt said Lyon would inspect the facility if the governor ordered him to, but otherwise, he “has no intention of inspecting the facility whatsoever.”

“If he’s not ordered to do it then he has no intention of doing it, doesn’t really care to have the right to do it or not,” McNutt said of Lyon. “We don’t believe he has a duty to inspect the facility … There is no commitment or desire to inspect.”

A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in May, letting the law stay in place. Lyon did not respond to a request for comment about whether his position has changed in light of an influx of new detainees and the opening of a new detention center.

Adelanto cleared county review

In the only county making use of its powers to access the detention centers, a San Bernardino County inspector spent about an hour on May 29 at the Adelanto center for food and service issues. The facility passed, according to inspection reports.

San Bernardino County inspector Mary Ann Glass made no notes or comments, and she found no deficiencies or violations at the facility, the paperwork shows.

“Yes, our inspections are limited to food processing and service,” confirmed San Bernardino health department spokesperson Francis Delapaz.

Adelanto is where a 39-year-old detainee was being held shortly before his death in September.

Internal emails obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that about two weeks after arriving at Adelanto in August, Ismael Ayala-Uribe reported symptoms including a cough, fever, and severe pain. Staff flagged his condition as potentially life-threatening and last week escorted him to the facility’s medical center in a wheelchair, the newspaper reported. About an hour and a half later, medical staff sent him back to his dormitory. He was not sent to a hospital until three days later, where he died.

Adelanto detainees, who spoke with CalMatters on condition that they not be named because they fear retaliation, said the sites are crowded, and it’s taking a long time to access medications and medical care.

An immigrant who was arrested in an ICE raid in Los Angeles in June and spent more than a month at Adelanto, said it took three days for him to be assigned a bed when he arrived at the facility.

During that time, he wasn’t allowed a shower or a change of clothes and wasn’t permitted to call his family. He said the dorm he ultimately slept in doubled in population, to its full capacity of about 90 people. Staff, he said, asked for volunteers to keep the walkways and windows clean, and detainees waited longer than three days to hear back about medical requests.

“Everyone was getting sick with coughs, the flu, with the air being cold all day,” he said. “Almost 50% of the people were like that.”

A Geo Group spokesperson said the company provides around-the-clock access to medical care.

“Geo strongly rejects these baseless allegations,” spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in an email to CalMatters. “Our contracts also set strict limits on a facility’s capacity. Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.”

California tried to ban for-profit detention

The federal government’s own inspections indicate allegations of abuse and possible lapses in suicide prevention at the Adelanto facility. In 2024, the Office of Detention Oversight found one detainee who alleged an officer inappropriately squeezed his chest and genitals during a pat-down search, and another told inspectors he had thoughts of self-harming because of the poor conditions inside the facility.

State inspectors released a report in April that documented similar issues with conditions across the state. Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, the report stated.

Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged that state and local oversight over detention facilities is limited, particularly after the state in 2019 attempted to ban private for-profit facilities, a bill Bonta authored as a legislator. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found the law unconstitutional.

Legislators “thought the conditions and practices inside these detention centers were so bad that they should be completely prohibited. And unfortunately, that was struck down,” Bonta told CalMatters.

“Because these are federal detention centers, there is a limit on what I can do, what the California legislature can do. The authority rests more with the federal government, particularly Congress,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LNM-20250930-MATTERSINSPECT-01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-08 03:56:32.430341

“ICE agents listened to every conversation between him and his doctors,” they stated.
The temporary restraining order is scheduled to expire on Oct. 18.","A federal judge over the weekend issued a temporary restraining order requiring immigration officials to get rid of guards monitoring a man who suffered a broken leg during a car wash raid by federal agents in Carson more than a month ago.

U.S. District Judge Cynthia Valenzuela, according to the L.A. Times, also ordered that handcuffs shackling Bayron Rovidio Marin to the bed in Harbor-UCLA Medical Center be removed.

Rovidio Marin had reportedly been under constant surveillance, unable to speak privately with doctors or legal counsel, since he was swept up and seriously injured when a “roving patrol” of Border Patrol agents raided the carwash and later transferred him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, The Times reported.

“He is presently detained under restrictions that limit his access to counsel, medical providers, and family,” the judge wrote in her Oct. 4 order. “He has been questioned by government officials while in pain and under the influence of medication. He cannot place phone calls and remains handcuffed to a hospital bed despite a broken leg that prevents him from walking.”

So far, ICE has yet to charge Rovidio Marin with violating immigration laws, set bond, issue a Notice to Appear or process him for removal proceedings.

In her temporary restraining order, Judge Valenzuela wrote that the government had failed to prove that the man had “violated any law or regulation” or shown that he was a “flight risk.”

U.S. immigration attorneys told the court that Rovidio Marin’s immigration status would be determined once he was released from the hospital, though attorneys for the man argued that his detainment for 37 days without charges is a violation of the U.S. Constitution.

Federal law requires the government to provide a person arrested without a warrant with a reason for their detainment within two days, a regulation only waived under extraordinary circumstances.

Judge Valenzuela referenced the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as “extraordinary circumstances” in delaying due process for noncitizen detainees and said that Rovidio Marin had been held “substantially longer.”

“For 37 days, our client was forced to endure medical treatment and recovery with ICE agents in his room, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Cynthia Santiago, Attorney for CLEAN Carwash Worker Center and Nicolas Thompson-Llera, Attorney for CHIRLA said in a statement obtained by The Times. “ICE agents listened to every conversation between him and his doctors,” they stated. “They interrogated him while he was in pain and under the influence of medication. They did not permit him to see his family and removed his access to phone calls.”

KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on the case and is awaiting a response.

“I didn’t resist. I complied and everything and they shoved me into the car,” Lake County resident Dariana Fajardo, who was arrested and released in Waukegan on Monday, said. “It was very scary, but there’s people who have been through a lot worse.”

ICE’s social media surveillance plans

Republicans love to peddle debunked conspiracy theories about spooky government targeting of conservatives online. Now, the same right-wing movement that brought you the “Twitter Files” conspiracy theory is standing idly by as the government reportedly assembles a social media surveillance apparatus to aid President Donald Trump’s bigoted mass incarceration and deportation agenda.

Wired magazine was the first to report on publicly available contracting records showing that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is seeking contractors to potentially run an around-the-clock social media surveillance program out of two offices, located in Vermont and California.

Per the report:

Federal contracting records reviewed by WIRED show that the agency is seeking private vendors to run a multiyear surveillance program out of two of its little-known targeting centers. The program envisions stationing nearly 30 private analysts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Vermont and Southern California. Their job: Scour Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms, converting posts and profiles into fresh leads for enforcement raids.

The proposal is still at an early stage and has not been finalized. But along with Trump’s open threats against the left — such as his concrete steps urging the Department of Homeland Security to target liberals and the military to vanquish the “enemy within” — this proposal raises the possibility of a tool that could be used to spy on the administration’s supposed enemies or suppress free speech.

Ahead of Noem’s arrival Tuesday, about two dozen demonstrators waited outside the ICE facility playing music and holding signs.
They argued that sending troops to Portland would cause irreparable harm, including financial harm, by inciting greater protests than would exist without the federal troops.
After that meal, Noem was spotted on the roof of the ICE facility looking out at the small group of protestors and press.

Ahead of Noem’s arrival Tuesday, about two dozen demonstrators waited outside the ICE facility playing music and holding signs. About an hour before Noem’s arrival, federal police took down protest signs that had been affixed to nearby walls and fences for weeks.

“I’m a combat veteran, a veteran who fought real wars against real terrorists,” he said. “Not this so-called insurrection and so-called terrorists Trump would have you believe we are in Portland.”

Federal District Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term, blocked Trump from mobilizing 200 Oregon National Guard troops on Saturday. On Sunday, she issued a broader order blocking troops from anywhere in the U.S. from coming to Portland after the administration began sending federalized troops from California and called up 400 Texas National Guard members to federal service.

On Tuesday, Gov. Tina Kotek sent a letter to the head of the U.S. Northern Command, which is overseeing Oregon and California troops, urging him to immediately send home the 200 Oregon soldiers stationed at Camp Rilea in Warrenton and the 200 California soldiers stationed at Camp Withycombe in Happy Valley.

“Our citizen soldiers deserve better than to be uprooted from their families and careers, only to be mobilized for an illegal mission positioning our soldiers in opposition to the U.S. Constitution’s 1st, 4th and 10th amendments, of which they have taken an oath to uphold,” Kotek wrote.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals set oral arguments for Thursday morning on the federal government’s request to stay Immergut’s ruling. Without a stay, a restraining order will continue to block troops from being deployed until mid-October, when Immergut will decide whether to renew the order. She set a trial on the merits of the state’s case for the end of the month.

Attorneys for Oregon, the city of Portland and now California have argued that deploying federalized troops violates the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees that police power within the states resides with the states. They argued that sending troops to Portland would cause irreparable harm, including financial harm, by inciting greater protests than would exist without the federal troops.

Immergut agreed, saying in her Saturday ruling that there was no evidence of a rebellion or danger of a rebellion in Portland protests.

“Furthermore, this country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,” Immergut wrote. “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law. Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

Noem visits

Federal agents pushed protesters and local reporters back from the ICE facility before Noem arrived, but a handful of conservative influencers — including one arrested for fighting outside the ICE facility last week — accompanied her. One posted a video on X showing Noem praying over a meal from Burgerville, the Vancouver-based regional fast food chain.

After that meal, Noem was spotted on the roof of the ICE facility looking out at the small group of protestors and press.

Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement Tuesday that she met Noem at the airport Tuesday after hearing through unofficial channels that she might visit. Kotek said she told Noem that Oregon is united in opposition to military policing in communities.

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon,” Kotek said. “Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland. I was clear that I have confidence in local law enforcement to meet the moment.”

Sen. Ron Wyden, also a Democrat, was harsher in his statement.

“Kristi Noem is cosplaying as a public official,” Wyden. “In reality, she’s been sent by Trump to incite violence.”",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2008-2048x1361.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 04:57:44.121425

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center at 1930 Beach Street has become a hotbed for protests since President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively ramped up his deportation campaign in the Chicago area last month under the name “Operation Midway Blitz.” Since then, protesters have arrived at the facility in the early morning hours, sometimes as early as 5 a.m., and have clashed with federal authorities into the late night hours.

The new protest hours are from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, according to the executive order, which cites public safety concerns. The executive order is in effect immediately and will be until it is “deemed no longer necessary to protect residents’ health, safety, and welfare.”

Protesters have sometimes been met with federal agents spraying tear gas, pepper spray and shooting various forms of rubber pellets.

“People have to go to work, they have to get their children ready for school, our businesses have to serve their customers, and our residents with developmental disabilities, who have sensory issues, have suffered emotional meltdowns because of the chaotic environment when protests get disruptive,” Thompson said in a statement.

The fixed protest hours could bring into question first amendment infringement. The Village of Broadview’s curfew is 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and midnight Fridays and Saturdays.

American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois spokesperson Ed Yohnka said the organization hopes “no one limits free speech,” and he said the ACLU will monitor how the protest hours will be enforced.

He cast blame for the fixed hours on the “increasingly militarized tactics and behavior of ICE and other federal officers.”

“These officers have turned dangerous weapons on protesters, fired projectiles indiscriminately and used chemical agents against protesters and journalists,” Yohnka said. “The solution to this situation is for ICE and the Trump administration to end the escalation of these tactics both at Broadview and when doing civil immigration enforcement in neighborhoods across the area.”

In a statement, the Chicago Activist Coalition for Justice said it “heavily disagree[s]” with the designated protest time.

“It secretly silences our voices to be heard,” Rabbi Michael Ben Yosef, leader of the coalition, said in a statement. “This executive order by the mayor is a win for the Trump administration who rejects our presence as activists for human rights.”

Last week, the Illinois State Police stepped in to control protest crowds and erected concrete barriers to form “designated protest areas” outside the facility’s main entrance on Beach Street and near another entrance on 25th Avenue.

Protesters marched down 25th Avenue Saturday night and tried entering Interstate 290, causing state police to temporarily block the interstate exit, while 25th Avenue was closed to traffic between Lexington Street and Roosevelt Road for most of the protest.

In another recent instance, federal agents in military dress chased two protesters across traffic on 25th Avenue and into a nearby resident’s yard, breaking a piece of their fence while shooting rubber baton rounds. One federal agent appeared to injure himself during the chase and was helped back across the street by another agent, who pointed a Taser at motorists, protesters and journalists as they made their way back to the ICE facility.

A business next door to the ICE facility last week placed wooden barricades outside its building in an effort to keep protesters — and clashes between them and ICE agents — off its property.

The Village of Broadview last week filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE, citing serious public safety concerns over an 8-foot fence erected outside the immigration facility’s Beach Street entrance last month.

Thompson has spoken out in recent weeks against federal agents’ use of chemical agents against protesters outside the facility, which is tucked into an industrial corridor, with residential homes lining the 25th Avenue entrance. She previously called on Russell Hott, director of the ICE Chicago field office, to stop “making war on my community,” saying the “relentless deployment” of chemical agents and rubber bullets endanger nearby residents and first responders.

“The residents, our business[es], all of the visitors — we’re responsible for them,” Thompson said in a recent interview with WBEZ. “We’re responsible for the protesters, their well-being, their safety. We are responsible for the journalists that come to our town.”

In her statement Monday, Thompson said she supports the protesters’ First Amendment rights, but she emphasized the need to balance those rights with public safety.

“I support their [protesters] cause. But the repeated clashes with ICE agents in our town are causing enormous disruptions in the quality of life for my residents whose rights I have taken an oath to protect. We live here. Our residents live here and deserve dignity and respect,” Thompson said.

However, her freedom remains at risk as the government continues to challenge the ruling that vindicated her constitutional rights. It’s a case with sweeping implications for thousands of immigrants who end up detained in Louisiana’s sprawling detention system.

Kostak, a 50-year-old Ukrainian woman, has been living in Brooklyn, New York for nearly two decades after fleeing Ukraine for political reasons in 2005. She became a pillar of her neighborhood and a beloved community member. On June 26, 2025, she attended a routine court appointment for her asylum case and was abruptly seized and arrested by federal authorities without warning. She was then transported more than 1,000 miles away from her home and husband to Monroe, Louisiana.

Kostak is one of millions of immigrants actively targeted by the current administration’s sweeping initiative to incarcerate as many immigrants as possible, regardless of whether they have a criminal background. Her petition became one of the first to establish that immigrants who have spent decades in this country are entitled to make their case for release. When Kostak did so, an immigration court granted her a federal-court-ordered bond hearing. It concluded that she was not a danger or a flight risk and therefore should be released from immigration detention.

Despite this clear judicial ruling, the government blatantly ignored the court’s decision and kept Kostak locked away. She has been released, but the threat of re-arrest and incarceration remains.

Her fear of re-arrest is palpable because the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is being asked to vacate her bond so she can be put behind bars once again. Her case illustrates this administration’s desire to subject all immigrants to mandatory detention, and render them ineligible for bond, no matter how long they have lived, worked, and paid taxes in this country, and regardless of whether they have ever committed a single crime.

“Larysa never should have been detained in the first place,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director for the ACLU of Louisiana. “And she shouldn’t have had to go to court for a bond hearing to which she was entitled. She’s now stuck in a limbo of fear and confusion as she could be re-arrested all over again because of the administration’s attempt to overrule the Constitution by virtue of its control over the administrative agency that reports to it: the BIA. ”

“ICE officers detained Larysa at her court hearing without notice or warning, then subjected her to unnecessary and unlawful detention over a thousand miles from her home,” said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at RFK Human Rights. “Even though she’s now been released, she remains in legal limbo and is fearful of being re-detained for no other reason than the Trump administration thinks they can. Her story is emblematic of the Trump administration’s blatant attempts to bypass Constitutional rights and expand mandatory immigration detention – no matter the circumstances and no matter the cost.”

Others have already been subjected to prolonged lockup with no end in sight. Carlos Raul Ventura Martinez, another ACLU of Louisiana client, lived in Maryland for 12 years and is now detained. He has a wife and three children there and has no criminal record.

Like Kostak, Mr. Ventura Martinez, was arrested in Maryland and detained in Louisiana. He too was granted bond by an immigration judge, only to see the BIA vacate his bond determination based on sham precedent that violates constitutional law. Kostak is terrified the same fate is likely to befall her and will lead to her re-arrest.

The Trump administration’s vendetta against unaccompanied immigrant children continued last week with a new scheme to pay children $2,500 to “voluntarily” give up their legal rights and return to their home country. It’s a disingenuous and dangerous form of coercion that risks the lives and well-being of vulnerable children and youth.

Initial reports from advocates suggested that the Department of Homeland Security would transmit letters to unaccompanied minors ages 14 to 17 currently in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), offering them money to withdraw their legal claims and ask for “voluntary departure.”

As part of the operation, supposedly dubbed “Freaky Friday,” children who declined the offer would be ineligible for release to a sponsor—staying in custody for the duration of their cases—and could endanger their parents’ immigration status as well. Other reports suggested that the plan could be extended to children as young as 10 and to children already residing in communities.

It appears, for now at least, that the scheme is more limited, but no less insidious.

Piecing together various ICE statements and social media posts, as well as messages sent to shelter care providers and legal service providers, the current plan appears to offer children ages 14 to 17 who have expressed an interest in voluntarily returning and are in ORR custody a “resettlement stipend” of $2,500. ORR care providers are instructed to facilitate a meeting between the child, legal service providers and ICE.

If the child “agrees to the stipend,” ICE will generate a form for signature and submit it to the immigration judge. ORR care providers may be required to provide available contact information for parents or other responsible adult contacts in the home country.

Discharge from ORR custody will take place only after an immigration judge approves the withdrawal. The child will receive the funds only after returning to the home country.

ICE maintains that the stipend is part of its new initiative to offer unaccompanied children a “voluntary option [which] gives [them] a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future.”

But voluntary departure, under strict rules designed to ensure a child’s decision is informed and in their best interests, already exists. Legal service providers and child advocates, as well as immigration judges, take pains to explain to children all options and to explore with them, often in consultation with family members, how they wish to proceed.

In other words, the child already has a choice about whether to remain in the United States to seek protection; the government is trying to stack the deck by putting what might be an irresistible incentive in front of kids who opt for voluntary departure.

Given that many children may not yet have an attorney and haven’t been to immigration court, it appears the government may also be counting on an accelerated process to secure the child’s agreement without having the time to fully consult with an attorney or for child advocates to conduct the necessary home studies required to ensure that the child will be able to safely return to their country.

It appears that the government will initiate the request for voluntary departure on behalf of the child—hoping perhaps that the child’s signature will convince the immigration judge to approve the transaction on paper, no questions asked.

Let’s hope immigration judges don’t take the document at face value. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 is designed to protect children not only from the threat of trafficking and other harms but from the kind of manipulation evident here. The TVPRA recognizes the unique vulnerabilities of children, consequently authorizing legal services, modified procedures for applying for asylum and other protections, as well as the appointment of child advocates for particularly vulnerable children, including those who are considering self-deportation.

… ensuring that every child can return home safely should be the norm—not a reward for increasing the government’s deportation numbers.

The TVPRA also forbids the government from returning a child, whether through voluntary departure or a removal order, without first ensuring that the child can be safely repatriated. Child advocates conduct assessments regarding the child’s best interests, family and living situation, and the safety risks that will assist the immigration judge in determining whether voluntary departure is appropriate.

Given these protections, I suspect many immigration judges will raise the following questions:

Does an agreement to accept the stipend equal informed consent? The government does not, in its explanation of the program, describe the child’s agreement to forgo their legal rights and withdraw any efforts to stay in the United States. Instead, the emphasis is on the child’s agreement to take the money. Rather than “helping” the child, it appears the government is attempting to bribe them to give up their legal rights.

How old is the child? With whom did they consult? Did the child have adequate time to discuss the decision with attorneys and with a child advocate appointed by ORR? (Under current policy guidelines, any child seeking voluntary return is assigned a child advocate.) Has that child advocate conducted a home study and made a recommendation to the court regarding the best interests of the child?

If this stipend is designed to help the child, why is it limited to children who ask to voluntarily return home? A child who applies for asylum but is denied needs the support to return home every bit as much as a child who decides to withdraw earlier in the process. If the government is truly interested in protecting children, ensuring that every child can return home safely should be the norm—not a reward for increasing the government’s deportation numbers.

Nor is the $2,500 the only evidence that the government is trying to coerce children into forgoing their rights. Many children have been pressured by CBP agents at the border to agree to voluntary departure—with absolutely no legal counsel or other advice.

Twenty-three children’s advocacy groups recently objected to ICE agents conducting interviews with older teenagers in ORR custody, sometimes without counsel present, asking them whether they are interested in returning to their home country. Children in custody are aware of the failed Labor Day effort to deport Guatemalan minors; anxiety over whether the government might force them to return home runs high.

And on Oct. 1, just days before this $2,500 gambit started, ICE issued guidance ordering that all children in custody who turn 18 must be turned over to adult detention. Because ORR only has custody over unaccompanied children until they turn 18, the urgency of finding an appropriate placement increases as the child nears their 18th birthday.

In the past, most children never faced this dilemma because ORR quickly placed them with sponsors. The administration’s current sponsor eligibility requirements have become so onerous, however, that children are averaging six months in custody, placing more of them at risk of aging out before an appropriate sponsor or other living situation can be found.

Incredibly, the first Trump administration had already tried and failed to force all 18 year olds into adult custody—and the resulting order in Garcia Ramirez, et al requiring ICE to place 18 year olds transferred from ORR into the least restrictive custody setting available is still in effect.

Although advocates immediately obtained a temporary injunction against Adult Detention, Round 2, the Trump administration is not likely to let the matter drop because the messaging is more important than the actual outcome.

The Trump administration practices incremental intimidation.

If children are told at the border that they should consider returning home, if they are prevented from reuniting with their families in the United States, and if they hear that they might stay in custody the whole time they are in the U.S., despair will inevitably follow.

If children think about the friends in their shelters who were pulled from their beds in the middle of the night, if they can’t talk to attorneys and other adults who want to help them, and if they learn that they might end up in an adult jail, voluntary departure might start sounding better and better.

It’s called detention fatigue, and children are highly susceptible to it. The government is cynically counting on the $2,500 to push that fatigue into resignation. After all, is it really giving up if you are coming home with cash in hand?

My money, however, is on the children. Despite the “give up and give in” earworm playing almost daily, the children who risked everything to come to the United States are a resilient and brave group of people. Some of them have already said “no,” and pushed back when the government tried to deport them in the middle of the night. Many of them know that they cannot return home safely and that their only hope is in pursuing their claims. And many of them know that the people who love them do not want them to return to the horrible conditions they fled.

If this administration really cared about unaccompanied children, it would stop coercing them and start listening to them. Because clearly, the Trump administration has a lot to learn if they think these tenacious kids will simply go away.",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Charly-Triballeau.png,N,,2025-10-07 22:57:18.647478

The move was widely seen as a strongarm tactic to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, as party leaders remain seemingly at an impasse on day 7 of the shutdown. Democrats are conditioning their support for a short-term funding patch on extending the health subsidies that lessen the cost of plans offered under the Affordable Care Act.

After the longest government shutdown in 2019, Trump signed legislation into law that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.

The president during an Oval Office meeting Tuesday suggested he’ll “ follow the law ” on back pay for federal workers, minutes after saying the compensation “ depends on who we’re talking about ” and that some workers would be taken care of “in a different way.”

The Latest:

The Trump administration is waiving a long list of environmental protections and regulations as it seeks to expand barriers to immigration along the southwest U.S. border in New Mexico.

In a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, the Department of Homeland Security is invoking an “acute and immediate need to construct additional physical barriers and roads” in a remote area of the state near the border with Mexico.

The directive from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem describes the area west of El Paso, Texas, as a traditional place of high illegal entry to the U.S. Noem is suspending federal regulations there aimed at protecting endangered species, clean water, migratory birds, sacred Native American sites and more.

Laiken Jordahl of the Center for Biological Diversity said there are fears any new construction would take a toll on wildlife populations near the remote bootheel of southwest New Mexico.

Several House Democrats say they want President Donald Trump to name the drug cartels he claims are in an “ armed conflict” with the U.S. government.

Five U.S. representatives released a letter Tuesday that also asks the president to explain just how he determined the cartels were designated as terrorist organizations.

The lawmakers also asked for the intelligence and the legal justifications behind the U.S. military’s four fatal strikes recently against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.

Trump has declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants in an administration memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press last week. The memo appears to represent an extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers, with Trump effectively declaring that trafficking of drugs into the U.S. amounts to armed conflict requiring use of military force.

A former immigration court judge and longtime Marine is going to be the next director of the federal office overseeing the nation’s immigration courts.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday that Daren K. Margolin will head the Executive Office of Immigration Review.

Margolin has served as an assistant chief immigration judge and as a lawyer at the legal office prosecuting immigration cases. He also served in various legal positions during a nearly 30-year career in the Marine Corps.

Margolin takes over an immigration court system struggling with a ballooning case backlog. Immigration courts have also increasingly become hubs for immigration enforcement with ICE agents arresting people in hallways after their court proceedings.

Six former surgeons general said in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” to the nation’s health.

The former public officials — appointed by every Republican and Democratic president since George H.W. Bush — warned that Kennedy’s moves on vaccines, autism and other issues have undermined the public health system and amplified health misinformation instead of combating it.

An HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, accused the past surgeons general of criticizing the first HHS secretary who is taking on the “decline in America’s public health” after they presided over it.

“We remain committed to restoring trust, reforming broken health systems, and ensuring that every American has access to real choice in their health care,” Nixon said.

Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said she met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for about 20 minutes upon Noem’s arrival at the Portland airport on Tuesday. Kotek reached out to Noem after hearing through “unofficial channels” that Noem might be visiting.

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon. Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland,” Kotek said in a statement.

Noem then went to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. News crews and some protesters lined up behind yellow police tape that cordoned off the blocks in front of the building.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that Trump has “identified a creative solution to transfer resources” from tariffs the administration has imposed on U.S. trading partners to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

Also known as WIC, the program provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples but was threatened by the government shutdown.

Leavitt did not provide details of how such funding transfers might work. But she wrote that the Trump White House “will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry.”

Trump has met with an American hostage freed from Gaza, and with the family of an American-Israeli soldier who was killed there but whose remains have yet to be recovered.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a photo online of Trump meeting in the Oval Office with Edan Alexander. He was taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that led to the Israel-Hamas war.

The meeting wasn’t public. But the picture also showed Trump with the family of Omer Neutra, whose body is still in Gaza. Peace talks are being held in Egypt over Trump’s plan to end fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Trump also met this summer with Alexander, who was the last living American hostage in Gaza and released from captivity in May.

Adelita Grijalva won a special election for a House seat on Sept. 24, but has been unable to actually represent her district in Congress until the speaker officially swears her into office. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has so far refused to accommodate her request to officially take office while the House is not conducting legislative business during the government shutdown.

Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant Tuesday by saying he would swear her into office as soon as she wants. However, Grijalva could be sworn in during one of the House’s pro-forma sessions. The next one is Wednesday.

Once she officially takes office, Grijalva has said she will join a legislative maneuver to force a vote in the House on a bill that would require the Department of Justice to release the case files on the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

A judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump’s administration from requiring recipients of federal teen pregnancy prevention grants to comply with Trump’s orders aimed at curtailing “radical indoctrination” and “gender ideology.”

The ruling is a victory for three Planned Parenthood affiliates that sued to try to block enforcement of a Department of Human Services policy document issued in July that they contend contradict the requirements of the grants as established by Congress.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, blasted the administration’s policy change in her written ruling, saying it was “motivated solely by political concerns, devoid of any considered process or analysis, and ignorant of the statutory emphasis on evidence-based programming.”

A federal grand jury in Atlanta has indicted two men after authorities said they made online threats against an ICE officer and his wife.

Frank Andrew Waszut and Anthony Patrick Noto are charged with knowingly making interstate threats of violence. Both men were indicted last month, and the indictments were unsealed Monday. They were both in custody and online court records did not show either man having a lawyer who could comment on the charges.

Federal prosecutors said in a news release Tuesday that Waszut posted a video on Instagram that identified and showed photos of the officer, who lives and works in Georgia. Waszut is accused of encouraging people to “make him famous” and urging anyone who sees the officer to “give him the cell block one treatment,” which prosecutors said means subjecting him to violence.

Noto posted a comment on Instagram under a photo of the officer’s wife that called her a “pretty good target” for anyone wanting to test out a semiautomatic rifle.

Waszut, who lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, was in jail in Texas, where he’s accused of making separate threats against Republican lawmakers. Noto, who lives in Ronkonkoma, New York, was in federal custody.

National Guard members from Texas are at an Army training center in Illinois. It’s the most visible sign yet of the Trump administration’s plan to send troops to the Chicago area despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders.

The Associated Press saw military personnel in uniforms with the Texas National Guard patch at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, 55 miles (88 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. On Monday, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media showing National Guard members from his state boarding a plane, but he didn’t specify where they were going.

Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday that authorities made 237,565 arrests at the border with Mexico during the government’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That’s down 84% from more than 1.5 million during the previous 12-month period and the lowest tally since 1970.

There were more than 2 million arrests in 2022 and 2023.

The latest number includes nearly four months of the Biden administration. Arrests fell sharply after the Biden administration imposed severe asylum restrictions in June 2024. They plummeted more after the Trump administration virtually eliminated asylum access and dispatched thousands of miliary troops to the border.

During September, authorities averaged 279 arrests a day. That’s up from 204 arrests a day in August but down from nearly 1,800 a day in September 2024.

As Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a Senate panel, Democrats time and again asked her what happened to $50,000 that White House “border czar” Tom Homan accepted last year from undercover agents posting as businesspeople.

The investigation into Homan was shut down by the Trump administration, but Democrats repeatedly questioned whether the money was recovered or whether Homan kept the money and reported it as income on his taxes.

“Do you know sitting here whether he took the money?” Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked Bondi during one particularly combative exchange with the attorney general.

Bondi said the decision to clear Homan of wrongdoing was made before she was sworn in as attorney general and defended Homan. She repeatedly refused to say what actually happened to the $50,000, though.

“You think you got a gotcha with Tom Homan our border czar who has been out there fighting for our country since Donald Trump took office,” Bondi replied to Schiff.

Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is suggesting that National Guard troops are not the best equipped to address crime in cities and that instead accountability for policing should remain with local officials.

“Is this deployment of the National Guard a part of an emerging best practice that I just don’t get yet?” Tillis asked Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Senate oversight hearing.

It was a bit of indirect criticism from Tillis, who is not seeking reelection next year, on how President Donald Trump is deploying National Guard troops to major cities as part of his crime and immigration agenda.

The Supreme Court ’s conservative majority seems likely to side with a Christian counselor challenging bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.

Most justices on the high court didn’t seem convinced that states can restrict voluntary talk therapy aimed at potentially changing feelings or behavior for kids who identify as gay or transgender.

Justice Samuel Alito said the Colorado law being challenged “looks like blatant viewpoint discrimination.”

The city and police department confirmed her visit in a joint statement after conservative podcaster and influencer Benny Johnson said on social media that Noem was going to Portland on Tuesday.

The city said it received notice of her visit to the Portland area but did not have full details about her agenda. Portland police “will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary.”

Her trip comes as local and state officials continue to fight the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to the city.

A federal judge issued two restraining orders over the weekend blocking the deployment, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments in the case for Thursday morning. The court indicated the arguments could be canceled if judges determine they aren’t needed.

The president said of his Canadian counterpart that he is “a great prime minister,” and added: “He could represent me anytime.”

But, Trump said: “He’s a nice man but he can be nasty.”

When asked by a reporter what is holding up trade talks with Carney if he’s such a great man, Trump said: “Because I want to be a great man too.”

“I’ll be meeting him in South Korea,” Trump said, referencing a summit that he’s expected to attend there at the end of the month.

A meeting between the two leaders has not been formally announced.

The president appeared to dismiss a key achievement of his first term, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.

Trump says he’ll negotiate trade deals on Tuesday with the visiting Canadian prime minister.

But asked about USMCA -- which took effect in 2020, replacing NAFTA -- he offered a surprise. “We could renegotiate it or we could create a different deal,” Trump said.

He offered no further details.

The president said the Democrats “started” the shutdown fight and that the minority party was taking such aggressive tactics because “they have nothing to lose.”

“Well, they’re the ones that started it,” Trump said in response to a question about his message to Democrats. “They’re the ones that have it, and it’s almost like a kamikaze attack by them. You want to know the truth, this is like a kamikaze attack. They, they almost, you know, they have nothing to lose.”

Asked a second time about backpay for furloughed federal workers given that the requirement is spelled out in law, Trump said: “I follow the law, and what the law says is correct.”

But asked about what he meant previously about dealing with workers in “a different way” than backpay, the president ducked the question, suggesting reporters would have to find that out for themselves.

The Canadian prime minister pushed back at Trump’s characterization of the two nations being in “natural conflict.”

Carney pointed out that Canada is the United States’ second-largest trading partner and is also a major foreign investor. He said the relationship between the U.S. and Canada are “maybe not so much conflict” but that they “compete.”

“There are areas where we compete, and it’s in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works,” Carney said. “But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re focused on”

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, is suggesting that the FBI look into comments that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made during a recent interview in which he called the late financier Jeffrey Epstein the “greatest blackmailer ever.”

During a Senate hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi reiterated her previous stance that the Department of Justice has not uncovered evidence that could be used in relation to Epstein’s sex trafficking of teenage girls. But Kennedy said that the comments from Lutnick, who was formerly a neighbor with Epstein, suggested others were involved.

“Don’t you think that you ought to talk to him after this interview?” Kennedy asked Bondi.

The attorney general responded that Lutnick had not been interviewed and she was noncommittal about any future interviews.

The president said there’s a “natural business conflict” between the U.S. and its northern neighbor but said there’s also “mutual love.”

“There’s still great love between the two countries,” Trump said.

The president didn’t dismiss back pay for all workers, but added, “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way” without elaborating.

He also blamed Democrats for putting “a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy.”

Trump’s comments came as his administration threatened no back pay for federal workers in a memo Tuesday. That’s despite a 2019 bill Trump signed into law guaranteeing back pay.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Trump administration has not told him where the National Guard is, when it may arrive in Chicago or what its task will be.

“None of that has been made clear,” Johnson said at a Tuesday news conference. “That is what is so difficult about this moment, you have an administration that is refusing to cooperate with a local authority.”

The City of Chicago and state of Illinois sued Trump on Monday, seeking to stop the sending of National Guard troops to Chicago. The legal challenge came hours after a judge blocked the Guard’s deployment in Portland, Oregon.

Johnson said Trump’s federalizing of the national guard is “unconstitutional, it’s illegal and it’s dangerous.”

“The federal government is out of control,” Johnson said. “This is one of the most dangerous times in our nation’s history.” Johnson said Trump is “unchecked” and “If Congress is not going to hold the president of the United States of America accountable, then I will.”

“Every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay. Period. Full stop,” Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday, responding to a White House memo outlining a rationale it’s considering for denying back pay to federal workers during the shutdown.

“The law is clear,” Jeffries added. “And we will make sure that law is followed.”

Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has said that some 300 of Illinois’ guard troops were to be federalized over his objections and sent to Chicago, along with 400 from Texas.

“He wants to justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command,” Pritzker said, accusing the president of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.”

A federal judge in Chicago scheduled a hearing for Thursday on a legal challenge that describes Trump’s military mobilization plan for Illinois as unlawful and dangerous. A federal judge in Oregon blocked the Guard’s deployment to Portland.

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media Monday showing Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, without saying their destination.

(WRIC) — While President Donald Trump’s order ending automatic citizenship for the children of people in the country illegally or temporarily is headed to the Supreme Court, immigrant advocates say one Virginia leader has been silent.

The Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights (VACIR) is asking Attorney General Jason Miyares to join the nationwide lawsuits blocking the executive order.

“The U.S. constitution has always been clear on this issue,” said Kim Leung with the Asian Law Caucus on Tuesday, during a press conference to bring attention to Miyares. “If you are born here, you are a citizen.”

President Trump signed the order last January, which would deny citizenship that in the past has been granted by the 14th amendment. Since then, it has faced multiple legal challenges, including a lawsuit signed by 22 attorneys general across the country.

Miyares was not one of those signees, and VACIR says by not joining the lawsuit, Miyares is leaving Virginians vulnerable.

“It is a problem that the Attorney General is disregarding his constituents who pay taxes, that pay his salary, that are urging for the defense of Virginia families,” said Monica Sarmiento with VACIR.

The group said they have made multiple efforts to meet with Miyares and get him to publicly oppose the order, including starting a petition for him to join the lawsuit that has gained more than 1,300 signatures.

“He has abandoned our community, abandoned us, in our most vulnerable time of need,” Sarmiento said.

(KOIN) – A majority of Oregon counties are supporting a federal lawsuit filed by Marion County seeking clarity on Oregon’s sanctuary state laws.

On Monday, Marion County announced that 20 of Oregon’s 36 counties have signed a letter to United States Attorney General Pam Bondi and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, which comes after a handful of Oregon counties initially joined a separate letter of support.

The letter is in support of Marion County’s lawsuit filed in August — seeking a federal court’s opinion on whether the county has the authority to turn over parole records of four alleged undocumented immigrants under Oregon’s sanctuary law.

In the lawsuit — filed against Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons — Marion County argues that Oregon’s sanctuary law conflicts with state public records law and federal immigration law.

Marion County’s lawsuit comes after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents served subpoenas to the county on August 1, requesting the records of four people on parole for crimes including multiple rape convictions, multiple sexual abuse convictions and convictions for kidnapping/robbery. According to court documents, a fifth subpoena was served for an individual whose identity was not clear at the time.

Now, 20 of Oregon’s 36 counties are signaling support for the lawsuit, Marion County said, noting the counties are supporting the lawsuit but are not joining the litigation.

In their letter, the Oregon counties stated, in part, “Legal uncertainty harms everyone and benefits no one. It is currently unclear how Oregon’s Sanctuary Promise Act, Oregon’s Public Records Act, and federal laws interact and apply due to apparent conflicts, including in situations where a local government is served with an administrative subpoena.”

The Oregon counties are not the only state institutions showing support for the lawsuit.

In late August, the Oregon State Sheriff’s Association sent a letter signed by 34 of 36 sheriff’s offices — also seeking clarity on ICE enforcement.

In response to Oregon counties showing support for Marion County’s lawsuit, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield previously said, “Oregon’s sanctuary law has already been upheld by the courts, including the Ninth Circuit, which made clear it does not conflict with federal law. My office has also been clear with Marion County and others, Oregon sanctuary law allows officials to produce information in response to a judicial warrant, but an administrative subpoena from ICE is not a judicial warrant.”

Rayfield continued, “For immigrant communities, these legal battles can create fear and confusion. My office will vigorously defend Oregon’s sanctuary law, so families feel safe reporting crimes, sending their kids to school, and living their lives without fear of being targeted unfairly.”

Spokespeople for Gov. Kotek and U.S. Attorney General Bondi have previously declined to comment on the pending litigation.

In a statement, Marion County Counsel Steve Elzinga noted, “The federal and state governments disagree about when public records already provided to the media about violent criminals can be provided to federal agents, so Marion County asked the federal court to determine what the law requires.”

The county added that it is “committed to prosecuting and holding accountable all people who commit crimes regardless of their immigration status.”",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/10/generic-immigration-customs-ice-federal-agents-10072020.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-07 23:56:49.459203

Platkin, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha.","CHICAGO – Attorney General Kwame Raoul today announced that after he led a coalition of 20 attorneys general in filing a multistate lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the DOJ has now dropped its plan to impose illegal conditions on nearly $1.4 billion in Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration, disregarding the clear letter of the law and intent of Congress, declared that states would be unable to access VOCA funds unless they agreed to the administration’s demands that states assist in federal immigration enforcement. VOCA funds are used to support victims and survivors of crimes and are not related to immigration enforcement.

“This is a win for survivors of violent crimes who rely upon this funding for programs that help them recover from the physical and emotional trauma they have endured,” Raoul said. “These funds have no relationship to civil immigration policy, and the Trump administration’s plan to impose conditions on this funding was unlawful and immoral. I will continue to lead the effort, along with other attorneys general, to protect federal funding for programs that support survivors of violent crimes.”

Following the lawsuit Raoul and the coalition filed, the DOJ is abandoning its plan to impose immigration-related conditions on $178 million in VOCA Victim Assistance Grants and $1.2 billion in VOCA Victim Compensation grants. Now, these grants will continue to be provided to states with no requirement that states assist the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in immigration enforcement.

Article continues after sponsor message

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable states to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives. The funding supports victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams and more. The funding streams for these services – totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide – have long ensured that states could fulfill their most fundamental duties to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents.

States, including Illinois, use these funds to assist nearly 9 million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year. Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to states to be based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump administration, through the DOJ, declared that states, along with the victims and survivors they serve, would be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the administration’s political agenda, namely its immigration enforcement priorities. The DOJ has placed these conditions on $54 million of fiscal year 2025 funds allocated to Illinois to support crime victims.

In order to receive these funds, the Trump administration was requiring states to assist DHS with civil immigration enforcement efforts, which is a federal – not state government – responsibility.

Raoul is co-leading this lawsuit with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha. Also part of the lawsuit are the attorneys general of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media Monday showing Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, without saying their destination.","President Donald Trump’s administration is warning Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been longstanding policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House.

The move was widely seen as a strongarm tactic to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, as party leaders remain seemingly at an impasse on day 7 of the shutdown. Democrats are conditioning their support for a short-term funding patch on extending the health subsidies that lessen the cost of plans offered under the Affordable Care Act.

After the longest government shutdown in 2019, Trump signed legislation into law that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.

The president during an Oval Office meeting Tuesday suggested he’ll “ follow the law ” on back pay for federal workers, minutes after saying the compensation “ depends on who we’re talking about ” and that some workers would be taken care of “in a different way.”

The Latest:

Seeking more immigration barriers, Noem waives environmental protections in New Mexico

The Trump administration is waiving a long list of environmental protections and regulations as it seeks to expand barriers to immigration along the southwest U.S. border in New Mexico.

In a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, the Department of Homeland Security is invoking an “acute and immediate need to construct additional physical barriers and roads” in a remote area of the state near the border with Mexico.

The directive from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem describes the area west of El Paso, Texas, as a traditional place of high illegal entry to the U.S. Noem is suspending federal regulations there aimed at protecting endangered species, clean water, migratory birds, sacred Native American sites and more.

Laiken Jordahl of the Center for Biological Diversity said there are fears any new construction would take a toll on wildlife populations near the remote bootheel of southwest New Mexico.

House Democrats press Trump on drug cartels he designated as terrorist groups

Several House Democrats say they want President Donald Trump to name the drug cartels he claims are in an “ armed conflict” with the U.S. government.

Five U.S. representatives released a letter Tuesday that also asks the president to explain just how he determined the cartels were designated as terrorist organizations.

The lawmakers also asked for the intelligence and the legal justifications behind the U.S. military’s four fatal strikes recently against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.

Trump has declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants in an administration memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press last week. The memo appears to represent an extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers, with Trump effectively declaring that trafficking of drugs into the U.S. amounts to armed conflict requiring use of military force.

Justice Department names new head of immigration courts

A former immigration court judge and longtime Marine is going to be the next director of the federal office overseeing the nation’s immigration courts.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday that Daren K. Margolin will head the Executive Office of Immigration Review.

Margolin has served as an assistant chief immigration judge and as a lawyer at the legal office prosecuting immigration cases. He also served in various legal positions during a nearly 30-year career in the Marine Corps.

Margolin takes over an immigration court system struggling with a ballooning case backlog. Immigration courts have also increasingly become hubs for immigration enforcement with ICE agents arresting people in hallways after their court proceedings.

Past surgeons general argue HHS secretary is ‘endangering' nation's health

Six former surgeons general said in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” to the nation’s health.

The former public officials — appointed by every Republican and Democratic president since George H.W. Bush — warned that Kennedy’s moves on vaccines, autism and other issues have undermined the public health system and amplified health misinformation instead of combating it.

An HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, accused the past surgeons general of criticizing the first HHS secretary who is taking on the “decline in America’s public health” after they presided over it.

“We remain committed to restoring trust, reforming broken health systems, and ensuring that every American has access to real choice in their health care,” Nixon said.

Oregon Gov. Kotek meets with DHS Sec. Noem in Portland

Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said she met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for about 20 minutes upon Noem’s arrival at the Portland airport on Tuesday. Kotek reached out to Noem after hearing through “unofficial channels” that Noem might be visiting.

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon. Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland,” Kotek said in a statement.

Noem then went to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. News crews and some protesters lined up behind yellow police tape that cordoned off the blocks in front of the building.

White House says it will use tariff revenue to bolster food aid program facing funding shortages

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that Trump has “identified a creative solution to transfer resources” from tariffs the administration has imposed on U.S. trading partners to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

Also known as WIC, the program provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples but was threatened by the government shutdown.

Leavitt did not provide details of how such funding transfers might work. But she wrote that the Trump White House “will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry.”

Trump has met with an American hostage freed from Gaza, and with the family of an American-Israeli soldier who was killed there but whose remains have yet to be recovered.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a photo online of Trump meeting in the Oval Office with Edan Alexander. He was taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that led to the Israel-Hamas war.

The meeting wasn’t public. But the picture also showed Trump with the family of Omer Neutra, whose body is still in Gaza. Peace talks are being held in Egypt over Trump’s plan to end fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Trump also met this summer with Alexander, who was the last living American hostage in Gaza and released from captivity in May.

House Speaker Mike Johnson says he’ll schedule the swearing in of new Arizona Democrat ‘as soon as she wants’

Adelita Grijalva won a special election for a House seat on Sept. 24, but has been unable to actually represent her district in Congress until the speaker officially swears her into office. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has so far refused to accommodate her request to officially take office while the House is not conducting legislative business during the government shutdown.

Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant Tuesday by saying he would swear her into office as soon as she wants. However, Grijalva could be sworn in during one of the House’s pro-forma sessions. The next one is Wednesday.

Once she officially takes office, Grijalva has said she will join a legislative maneuver to force a vote in the House on a bill that would require the Department of Justice to release the case files on the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Judge blocks changed guidance for teen pregnancy prevention grants

A judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump’s administration from requiring recipients of federal teen pregnancy prevention grants to comply with Trump’s orders aimed at curtailing “radical indoctrination” and “gender ideology.”

The ruling is a victory for three Planned Parenthood affiliates that sued to try to block enforcement of a Department of Human Services policy document issued in July that they contend contradict the requirements of the grants as established by Congress.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, blasted the administration’s policy change in her written ruling, saying it was “motivated solely by political concerns, devoid of any considered process or analysis, and ignorant of the statutory emphasis on evidence-based programming.”

Federal grand jury in Atlanta charges 2 men with making threats against ICE officer and his wife

A federal grand jury in Atlanta has indicted two men after authorities said they made online threats against an ICE officer and his wife.

Frank Andrew Waszut and Anthony Patrick Noto are charged with knowingly making interstate threats of violence. Both men were indicted last month, and the indictments were unsealed Monday. They were both in custody and online court records did not show either man having a lawyer who could comment on the charges.

Federal prosecutors said in a news release Tuesday that Waszut posted a video on Instagram that identified and showed photos of the officer, who lives and works in Georgia. Waszut is accused of encouraging people to “make him famous” and urging anyone who sees the officer to “give him the cell block one treatment,” which prosecutors said means subjecting him to violence.

Noto posted a comment on Instagram under a photo of the officer’s wife that called her a “pretty good target” for anyone wanting to test out a semiautomatic rifle.

Waszut, who lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, was in jail in Texas, where he’s accused of making separate threats against Republican lawmakers. Noto, who lives in Ronkonkoma, New York, was in federal custody.

National Guard members from Texas are in Illinois in Trump’s latest move to send troops to cities

National Guard members from Texas are at an Army training center in Illinois. It’s the most visible sign yet of the Trump administration’s plan to send troops to the Chicago area despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders.

The Associated Press saw military personnel in uniforms with the Texas National Guard patch at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, 55 miles (88 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. On Monday, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media showing National Guard members from his state boarding a plane, but he didn’t specify where they were going.

US authorities report 2025 border arrests at 55-year low

Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday that authorities made 237,565 arrests at the border with Mexico during the government’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That’s down 84% from more than 1.5 million during the previous 12-month period and the lowest tally since 1970.

There were more than 2 million arrests in 2022 and 2023.

The latest number includes nearly four months of the Biden administration. Arrests fell sharply after the Biden administration imposed severe asylum restrictions in June 2024. They plummeted more after the Trump administration virtually eliminated asylum access and dispatched thousands of miliary troops to the border.

During September, authorities averaged 279 arrests a day. That’s up from 204 arrests a day in August but down from nearly 1,800 a day in September 2024.

Democrats ask Bondi about Tom Homan: Where’s the money?

As Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a Senate panel, Democrats time and again asked her what happened to $50,000 that White House “border czar” Tom Homan accepted last year from undercover agents posting as businesspeople.

The investigation into Homan was shut down by the Trump administration, but Democrats repeatedly questioned whether the money was recovered or whether Homan kept the money and reported it as income on his taxes.

“Do you know sitting here whether he took the money?” Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked Bondi during one particularly combative exchange with the attorney general.

Bondi said the decision to clear Homan of wrongdoing was made before she was sworn in as attorney general and defended Homan. She repeatedly refused to say what actually happened to the $50,000, though.

“You think you got a gotcha with Tom Homan our border czar who has been out there fighting for our country since Donald Trump took office,” Bondi replied to Schiff.

GOP senator questions whether National Guard deployment to cities is ‘best practice’

Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is suggesting that National Guard troops are not the best equipped to address crime in cities and that instead accountability for policing should remain with local officials.

“Is this deployment of the National Guard a part of an emerging best practice that I just don’t get yet?” Tillis asked Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Senate oversight hearing.

It was a bit of indirect criticism from Tillis, who is not seeking reelection next year, on how President Donald Trump is deploying National Guard troops to major cities as part of his crime and immigration agenda.

Supreme Court seems skeptical about state bans on ‘conversion therapy’

The Supreme Court ’s conservative majority seems likely to side with a Christian counselor challenging bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.

Most justices on the high court didn’t seem convinced that states can restrict voluntary talk therapy aimed at potentially changing feelings or behavior for kids who identify as gay or transgender.

Justice Samuel Alito said the Colorado law being challenged “looks like blatant viewpoint discrimination.”

DHS Sec. Kristi Noem to visit Portland

The city and police department confirmed her visit in a joint statement after conservative podcaster and influencer Benny Johnson said on social media that Noem was going to Portland on Tuesday.

The city said it received notice of her visit to the Portland area but did not have full details about her agenda. Portland police “will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary.”

Her trip comes as local and state officials continue to fight the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to the city.

A federal judge issued two restraining orders over the weekend blocking the deployment, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments in the case for Thursday morning. The court indicated the arguments could be canceled if judges determine they aren’t needed.

Trump praises Carney as a ‘world-class leader’ and ‘good man’

The president said of his Canadian counterpart that he is “a great prime minister,” and added: “He could represent me anytime.”

But, Trump said: “He’s a nice man but he can be nasty.”

When asked by a reporter what is holding up trade talks with Carney if he’s such a great man, Trump said: “Because I want to be a great man too.”

Trump says he’ll meet with Xi in a few weeks

“I’ll be meeting him in South Korea,” Trump said, referencing a summit that he’s expected to attend there at the end of the month.

A meeting between the two leaders has not been formally announced.

Trump says his first-term trade deal with Mexico and Canada could be negotiated – or even replaced

The president appeared to dismiss a key achievement of his first term, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.

Trump says he’ll negotiate trade deals on Tuesday with the visiting Canadian prime minister.

But asked about USMCA -- which took effect in 2020, replacing NAFTA -- he offered a surprise. “We could renegotiate it or we could create a different deal,” Trump said.

He offered no further details.

Trump likens Dem tactics on shutdown to a ‘kamikaze attack’

The president said the Democrats “started” the shutdown fight and that the minority party was taking such aggressive tactics because “they have nothing to lose.”

“Well, they’re the ones that started it,” Trump said in response to a question about his message to Democrats. “They’re the ones that have it, and it’s almost like a kamikaze attack by them. You want to know the truth, this is like a kamikaze attack. They, they almost, you know, they have nothing to lose.”

Trump suggests he’ll ‘follow the law’ on federal worker backpay

Asked a second time about backpay for furloughed federal workers given that the requirement is spelled out in law, Trump said: “I follow the law, and what the law says is correct.”

But asked about what he meant previously about dealing with workers in “a different way” than backpay, the president ducked the question, suggesting reporters would have to find that out for themselves.

Carney says the U.S. and Canada are competing, not in conflict

The Canadian prime minister pushed back at Trump’s characterization of the two nations being in “natural conflict.”

Carney pointed out that Canada is the United States’ second-largest trading partner and is also a major foreign investor. He said the relationship between the U.S. and Canada are “maybe not so much conflict” but that they “compete.”

“There are areas where we compete, and it’s in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works,” Carney said. “But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re focused on”

GOP senator suggests FBI interview Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after his comments about Epstein

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, is suggesting that the FBI look into comments that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made during a recent interview in which he called the late financier Jeffrey Epstein the “greatest blackmailer ever.”

During a Senate hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi reiterated her previous stance that the Department of Justice has not uncovered evidence that could be used in relation to Epstein’s sex trafficking of teenage girls. But Kennedy said that the comments from Lutnick, who was formerly a neighbor with Epstein, suggested others were involved.

“Don’t you think that you ought to talk to him after this interview?” Kennedy asked Bondi.

The attorney general responded that Lutnick had not been interviewed and she was noncommittal about any future interviews.

Trump says there is ‘natural conflict’ with Canada

The president said there’s a “natural business conflict” between the U.S. and its northern neighbor but said there’s also “mutual love.”

“There’s still great love between the two countries,” Trump said.

Trump says back pay for furloughed federal workers ‘depends on who we’re talking about’

The president didn’t dismiss back pay for all workers, but added, “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way” without elaborating.

He also blamed Democrats for putting “a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy.”

Trump’s comments came as his administration threatened no back pay for federal workers in a memo Tuesday. That’s despite a 2019 bill Trump signed into law guaranteeing back pay.

Chicago mayor says he doesn’t know where National Guard troops are in his city

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Trump administration has not told him where the National Guard is, when it may arrive in Chicago or what its task will be.

“None of that has been made clear,” Johnson said at a Tuesday news conference. “That is what is so difficult about this moment, you have an administration that is refusing to cooperate with a local authority.”

The City of Chicago and state of Illinois sued Trump on Monday, seeking to stop the sending of National Guard troops to Chicago. The legal challenge came hours after a judge blocked the Guard’s deployment in Portland, Oregon.

Johnson said Trump’s federalizing of the national guard is “unconstitutional, it’s illegal and it’s dangerous.”

“The federal government is out of control,” Johnson said. “This is one of the most dangerous times in our nation’s history.” Johnson said Trump is “unchecked” and “If Congress is not going to hold the president of the United States of America accountable, then I will.”

‘Law is clear’ on federal worker back pay, House Democratic leader says

“Every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay. Period. Full stop,” Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday, responding to a White House memo outlining a rationale it’s considering for denying back pay to federal workers during the shutdown.

“The law is clear,” Jeffries added. “And we will make sure that law is followed.”

Illinois braces for National Guard deployments amid legal challenge

Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has said that some 300 of Illinois’ guard troops were to be federalized over his objections and sent to Chicago, along with 400 from Texas.

“He wants to justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command,” Pritzker said, accusing the president of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.”

A federal judge in Chicago scheduled a hearing for Thursday on a legal challenge that describes Trump’s military mobilization plan for Illinois as unlawful and dangerous. A federal judge in Oregon blocked the Guard’s deployment to Portland.

They and others called on the plaza’s owner, Friedman Real Estate, to block federal agents from working there.

Local community groups have repeatedly warned Chicagoans that federal agents have detained people in Home Depot parking lots — which many immigrants frequent as they look for construction work.
“ICE agents are standing across the street with guns and tearing families apart.","BACK OF THE YARDS — Southwest Side officials, neighbors and organizers are calling on a Back of the Yards property owner to block federal immigration agents from using its parking lot for enforcement work.

The parking lot of the Yards Plaza, 4636 S. Damen Ave., has been frequently used by agents as a place to detain neighbors, transfer detained people and stage operations, local organizers have said. They and others called on the plaza’s owner, Friedman Real Estate, to block federal agents from working there.

“Friedman, we want you to kick ICE out of your property today,” said Corina Pedraza, a member of the Southwest Side Rapid Response Team, at a press conference Tuesday held next to the lot. The group has been recording ICE sightings, among other things, as a way to protect neighbors.

Friedman Real Estate did not immediately respond to Block Club’s request for comment.

Tuesday’s press conference came as tensions are ever-heightening due to operations Midway Blitz and At Large, which the federal government launched last month to increase immigration enforcement in and around Chicago. People and officials have increasingly sought ways to peacefully resist — including by trying to limit places where ICE can work.

On Monday, Mayor Brandon Johnson issued an executive order restricting federal agents from using city-owned properties for immigration enforcement. Officials have called on private property owners to opt in to the program, with the city offering signs that could deter agents from properties where the owner has joined in.

Ald. Julia Ramirez (12th) urged Friedman Real Estate to join the program. She called the property owners about two weeks ago to ask them to refuse entry to immigration agents, but company leaders refused and instead said they don’t want neighbors filming federal agents, she said.

“Friedman can well use their private security to inform agents that they are not allowed to stage on the back of this plaza,” Ramirez said at Tuesday’s press conference.

Those at the press conference called on other companies to join in, especially if their properties have been used by immigration agents, like Home Depot and Walmart. Local community groups have repeatedly warned Chicagoans that federal agents have detained people in Home Depot parking lots — which many immigrants frequent as they look for construction work.

The Yards Plaza shopping strip is home to a Planet Fitness gym, a Dollar Tree and a Taco Bell restaurant, among other businesses. It is across the street from Back of the Yards College Preparatory and near Agustin Lara Academy, an elementary school, and the Back of the Yards public library.

“ICE agents are standing across the street with guns and tearing families apart. That is impacting our students. … That’s not safety, that’s intimidation,” said Yesenia Lopez, a member of the Chicago Public Schools Board of Education representing the 7th District.

Southwest Side neighbors have been among the most targeted by immigration agents during the operations, Ramirez said. Masked and sometimes armed federal agents using “brutal tactics” have impacted the way people move in the neighborhoods, take care of their kids, shop for groceries and support one another, she said.

Russell Hott, ICE field director in Chicago, told Block Club more than 1,000 people have been arrested under Operation Midway Blitz and “several thousand” are still wanted.

Members of local rapid response teams said they’ll continue to coordinate their efforts to verify sightings of ICE agents and document their tactics, as well as to educate neighbors about their rights.

“We will use everything in our power to resist and to remind people that Chicago is our home,” Pedraza said. “We are putting business owners on notice [that] their silence and their complacent behavior towards ICE’s racist agenda will not be tolerated.

“We call on other business owners, corporations and companies that profit off of our money to step up and make sure you exercise your ability to kick ICE out of your private lots.”

""From prosecutors, special agents, and intelligence analysts to immigration judges, grant managers, civil rights attorneys, and more, we all carried out our duties faithfully, regardless of who occupied the White House. Until we no longer could,"" the 282 ex-DOJ employees wrote in a Monday letter released by the alumni network Justice Connection.

""Each of us left the department, either voluntarily or involuntarily, because of actions taken by this administration,"" they continued. ""It is incumbent on all of us to fight for the Justice Department before it's too late.""

The letter, first reported by MSNBC, calls out the DOJ for carrying out President Donald Trump's ""retribution campaign,"" spreading lies about the ""deep state,"" violating court orders, and inappropriately dismissing employees, including at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and attorneys in the Civil Rights Division.

""The administration is taking a sledgehammer to other long-standing work the department has done to protect communities and the rule of law, too,"" the letter notes, citing attacks on the Tax Division, the Public Integrity Section, FBI public corruption squads, and hundreds of millions of dollars in grants for at-risk communities.

""As for its treatment of its employees, the current leadership's behavior has been appalling,"" the letter adds. ""Demonizing, firing, demoting, involuntarily transferring, and directing employees to violate their ethical duties has already caused an exodus of over 5,000 of us.""

The letter urges DOJ leadership to ""adhere to the legal guardrails and institutional norms,"" Congress to ""exercise its oversight responsibilities far more vigorously,"" and fellow alumni and all Americans to speak out. It concludes that ""our democracy is only as strong as the rule of law, and the rule of law can't survive without the principal institution that enforces it.""

In a statement, Stacey Young, executive director and founder of Justice Connection, echoed that warning: ""For decades, the guiding tenet for those working at the department was to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons. Many believe that's no longer possible.""

""They're being asked to put loyalty to the president over the Constitution, the rule of law, and their professional ethical obligations,"" she added. ""We're seeing the erosion of the Justice Department's fabric and integrity at an alarming pace. Our democratic system cannot survive without the primary institution that enforces the law.""

Bondi and other DOJ leaders—particularly FBI Director Kash Patel—have faced mounting criticism throughout the second Trump administration, including for the attorney general's Day One memo arguing that department employees are expected to ""zealously defend"" the president's interests and policies.

""The abuse of the Justice Department under Bondi's watch has been rampant, including the recent high-profile and scandalous move to secure an indictment against former FBI Director Jim Comey after the president publicly demanded they do so, and despite the previous prosecutor’s claims of insufficient evidence,"" Public Citizen co-president Lisa Gilbert said in a Tuesday statement.

""The DOJ has been in constant turmoil since Bondi took the helm, firing prosecutors who worked Capitol riot cases or investigated Trump and pushing out senior officials at the FBI,"" she continued. ""At the same time, under her leadership, the Public Integrity Section of the DOJ, the section dedicated to fighting corruption from federal officials, has been reduced from a total of 36 employees to two.""

""The Department of Justice is intended to be independent from the White House, not its revenge arm,"" Gilbert stressed. ""Her tenure shows they have become exactly that.""

Accountable.US executive director Tony Carrk also issued a statement ahead of the Senate hearing. He said that ""in her eight months as Attorney General, Pam Bondi has confirmed all warnings about her treating the office as an enforcer for Donald Trump's personal whims while also acting as a walking conflict of interest for her former lobbying firm and clients.""

TRANSCRIPT

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: A federal judge in Chicago has refused the Illinois attorney general’s request to immediately block the Trump administration from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to the state, instead saying she’ll hear arguments on Thursday. This is in contrast to Portland, Oregon, where a federal judge appointed by President Trump did issue a restraining order to stop Trump from sending troops. Illinois Governor Pritzker said Monday he would not back down.

GOV. JB PRITZKER: Since the beginning of this invasion, families have been snatched up off the streets or removed from their homes, zip-tied and detained for hours, including especially U.S. citizens and legal residents of our state. And in the words of CBP chief patrol agent Greg Bovino, they’re being chosen by how they look.

AMY GOODMAN: Also on Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson announced he had signed an executive order to stop federal immigration agents from using certain city-owned spaces.

MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON: The order establishes ICE-free zones. That means that city property and unwilling private businesses will no longer serve as staging grounds for these raids.

AMY GOODMAN: This comes after an overnight ICE raid on a Chicago apartment complex days ago, when ICE agents, wearing fatigues and carrying guns, rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter and zip-tied children and U.S. citizens while carrying out arrests. A neighbor described the terrifying ordeal to ABC 7 Chicago.

EBONI WATSON: They was terrified. The kids was crying. People were screaming. They looked very distraughted. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids out, too, had them zip-tied to each other. That’s all I kept asking: Where’s the morality? Where’s the human? One of them literally laughed. He was standing right here. He said, ‘[bleep] them kids.’”

AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, Friday, federal agents handcuffed Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes and briefly detained her when she asked if they had a signed warrant for a man they were trying to detain at a hospital.

JESSIE FUENTES: He has constitutional rights.

FEDERAL AGENT 1: No.

JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed —

FEDERAL AGENT 1: No. You need to leave.

JESSIE FUENTES: — judicial warrant for me?

FEDERAL AGENT 1: Turn around. You’re impeding. Turn around and leave.

FEDERAL AGENT 2: Yeah. He is under —

FEDERAL AGENT 1: I am going to arrest you if you do not leave.

FEDERAL AGENT 2: He is under arrest.

JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed judicial warrant?

FEDERAL AGENT 2: You are going to be placed under arrest.

JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed judicial warrant for me?

FEDERAL AGENT 1: You need to leave.

AMY GOODMAN: For those who can’t see, the agent then pulled her hands behind her back and handcuffed her. The video was shared in a report by the news outlet Book Club Chicago, which is part of a coalition of Chicago journalists and activists who filed a new lawsuit with the ACLU of Illinois against the Trump administration over a pattern of, quote, “extreme brutality,” unquote, by federal agents during protests at the Broadview ICE detention center in a Chicago suburb. In this CBS News Chicago story, correspondent Asal Rezaei describes how she was attacked while reporting at the ICE jail.

ASAL REZAEI: An ICE agent that was masked pointed his weapon and shot directly at my car. He saw that my window was open, and he shot right here. You can see the point of impact right there.

MARISSA SULEK: You can see white powder exploded on the hood of her car, windshield, and even engulfed the inside.

ASAL REZAEI: And I was sitting right there with my window open. A lot of it went inside of my car and on my face. I immediately felt it burning. I started throwing up.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we’re joined by Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for the ACLU of Illinois.

Ed, thanks so much for being with us. There’s so much to discuss here, I mean, one lawsuit after another, most recently yesterday, the filing of the lawsuit around the deploying the federalized troops to Chicago. Apparently, Governor Abbott allowed the troops to go from Texas, and they’re in Indiana right now. But talk about the judge’s ruling and the other lawsuits, as well, that you’re a part of.

ED YOHNKA: Sure. So, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, as you say, filed a lawsuit yesterday to challenge the federalization of National Guard and deploying them here, for a very simple reason: There’s no emergency, and there’s no justification for having done — or, for having guards or troops here in the city of Chicago or in the Chicagoland area.

In fact, what we have seen over the last few weeks is the escalation of violence and chaos on behalf of ICE agents, or conducted by ICE agents, everything from, you know, marching up and down in fatigues and pulling families out of parks, marching up and down Michigan Avenue, pulling families out of parks, to, as was described in our lawsuit yesterday with a coalition of legal organizations, you know, taking on what we’ve seen is, you know, just the indiscriminate firing of projectiles and chemical weapons at the Broadview detention center and — or, processing center, which has become a detention center.

So, what we’re seeing, and, you know, in the other clips you played, is just this escalation of violence. And when anybody protests, then that’s seized upon by the administration as a claim for the need to bring in further forces. But further forces are just going to escalate tensions here. They’re not going to make things better.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ed, could you talk about that, this remarkable raid that occurred last week at an apartment complex that the ICE were claiming that it was a hotbed for Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang? Can you talk about what actually happened there?

ED YOHNKA: Yes. And, you know, Juan, you know how just incredible and, you know, remarkable this is, as a Chicagoan. Last week, what we saw was, in the middle of the night, hundreds of heavily armed ICE agents, you know, masked up, attacked a single apartment building, broke into that building, rappelled off of a Black Hawk helicopter to get to the roof of the building, then proceeded to go through the building and kick down every single door that they could, take whomever they found into custody, and then, as we know, release some of those people hours later because they either had no background, criminal background, they were green card holders, and, in many cases, you know, they were citizens, including zip-tying children, zip-tying children out in the streets of Chicago, separating them from their families and then hauling them away, as well.

You know, this is just — you know, and we have not yet, to this hour, heard any justification or rationalization for why it was that they needed this kind of overwhelming force. There’s not been charges brought against anybody. There’s been no explanation. There’s been no production of a warrant in public to justify why an entire apartment building was attacked. Even if there was a person or set of people in the building that they wanted to try to detain, they didn’t need to literally render, you know, a hundred people unhoused because they’ve created a situation where they can’t go back into the building.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And have they — have there been any reports of who was actually detained or where the people are?

ED YOHNKA: No, that’s been very difficult to find out, Juan. In fact, you know, our lawyers have spent the last several days trying to talk to people who lived in the building, trying to talk to neighbors and others around there, to see if we can find out where these people were taken to, to see what happened to them, to hear about their experiences firsthand. But the reporting on this is just awful.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about the possibility of President Trump invoking the Insurrection Act, and how rare this is?

ED YOHNKA: It would be incredibly rare, Amy. As you know, the Insurrection Act has been used only a few times in our country’s history. And the purposes of the Insurrection Act are in no way, shape or form met in the city of Chicago. There is no invasion here. There is no armed conflict going on. There is no, you know, sabotage to the actions of the federal government.

And in fact, the courts and the government and everyone else is proceeding and operating in the normal fashion. You know, just to make the point, yesterday, government lawyers stood against state lawyers in a federal courthouse and in a federal courtroom to raise the question about whether or not National Guard was available. Police stopped people yesterday in the city of Chicago. ICE continued to make raids in the city of Chicago. There is nothing here that justifies something as extreme as declaring that there is an insurrection, which requires, you know, troops and allowing troops to engage in practices that take them beyond just, quote-unquote, “providing protection” for federal officials.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk, Ed, also about the response of local city officials? There was an extraordinary press conference by Police Superintendent Snelling yesterday, where he said that some — more than 20 Chicago police officers were actually hit with tear gas at Broadview, fired by ICE agents.

ED YOHNKA: Actually, that was at a protest after a person was shot in the Brighton Park neighborhood —

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Oh, Brighton Park, I’m sorry, yeah.

ED YOHNKA: — on Saturday. CPD responded to that event because of the fact that there was shots fired. There was — you know, people had gathered around. There were people protesting, decrying the fact that ICE had once again shot someone, as we saw here a couple of weeks ago in a traffic stop. And in this instance, you know, CPD showed up to try to assist with crowd control, with clearing the traffic and allowing people to move on, and ICE, instead of letting CPD or any other official do their — other officials do their job, simply began to fire tear gas at the crowd.

This is the same thing, by the way, we’ve seen in Broadview. Last weekend, the Illinois State Police set up a protection zone at Broadview and tried to sort of create at least some barrier between ICE agents and others. And again, rather than working with local police, ICE just continued to behave in the way that they have for the past few weeks, to go through the crowd when they wanted to, to try to push back the crowd. You know, these are just these kind of bullying, goonish tactics that we’re just seeing them do anywhere. And it doesn’t matter if they’re, you know, trying — if they’re pushing back against protesters, against clergy members, against journalists or against the police. They just seem to think that they have the power to act and behave in whatever way they want.

AMY GOODMAN: Ed, we were just showing video put out by the Department of Homeland Security, as you were talking about the Black Hawk helicopter, ICE agents rappelling down from it, armed, automatic weapons, the agents moving into apartments. They’re putting it out because, presumably, they think this is good propaganda for them. Can you comment on this, the terror that these families felt, with faces not being obscured?

ED YOHNKA: Let me — thanks, Amy, for giving me the chance to speak to this. And let me start by noting they put out this propaganda reel before they ever explained what the actual rationale for the raid is. So, the most important thing for them was to have HD video of what was happening, not to actually speak to why this happened.

And what you’re — you know, what you see in that video, and I think what you hear from members of the community, is a complete terror, a sense of terror that their community, a working-class, Black and Brown community, is being targeted in this way by federal forces using this kind of militarized force. And it is — you know, it’s causing, you know, panic and terror and fear all across the community for many. There are people who are not leaving their homes every day out of fear. There are children who are not going to school. You know, restaurants and cafes and stores in some of our neighborhoods are suffering economically as the result of this fact. And all of this is in service of a reckless policy that is not in any way, shape or form making the city of Chicago or the Chicagoland area any more safe.

AMY GOODMAN: Thank you for being with us, Ed Yohnka, ACLU of Illinois director of communications.

Coming up, we go to Gaza as negotiators from Israel and Hamas are indirectly engaged in ceasefire talks. Stay with us.

President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.""
A federal judge did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops to Chicago as Illinois requested in its lawsuit — including the deployment of some troops from Texas and other states.","President Trump argues the National Guard is needed in Chicago — a city that had its fewest summer murders in 60 years — because it is overrun with crime.

But the conditions to legally justify troop deployments in Chicago simply don't exist, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told Morning Edition. The state filed a lawsuit Monday against the Trump administration in which it argues that the Illinois National Guard can only be federalized if there is a foreign invasion, rebellion or if the federal government is unable to enforce federal laws.

The only ""agitation"" and ""chaos"" in and around Chicago, Raoul said, is from ""[Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and Border Patrol firing pepper gas at civilians, journalists,"" and ""even Chicago police officers.""

For weeks, the Trump administration has carried out aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, including a recent raid of an apartment building during which agents pulled residents, including children, out of their homes and detained some U.S. citizens.

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.

Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are ""political in nature."" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year, according to WBEZ.

Last month, Trump said he would ""love to have"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House to make a formal request for troops. The president also posted on Truth Social last month that the city was going to find out ""why it's called the Department of WAR.""

""All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,"" Raoul said.

In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.""

A federal judge did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops to Chicago as Illinois requested in its lawsuit — including the deployment of some troops from Texas and other states. Oral arguments in that suit are set for Thursday.

Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member — said in an interview with Morning Edition if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.

""All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,"" Hayes said.

But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not ""normal times.""

""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.

On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""

""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday visited the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland, where protests continue amid the administration’s immigration crackdown.

Videos shared inside the facility showed Noem meeting with local officials and taking the first few minutes to pray over officers.

Her visit followed a heated meeting with Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek at the Portland airport, the governor's office confirmed.

""Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland. I was clear that I have confidence in local law enforcement to meet the moment.""

The governor added that she requested DHS and ICE ""obey Oregon laws when they engage in federal operations.""

The move came after Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued a temporary restraining order Saturday halting the deployment of Oregon troops, and expanded the order Sunday, prohibiting the federal government from deploying any federalized National Guard troops within Oregon.

Kotek directed the return of all 200 California National Guard members to California.

His statement Oct. 6 came as hundreds of California National Guardsmen are in limbo at a Portland military base as Trump and Democratic leaders wage a feverish legal battle over his attempts to deploy soldiers in American cities.

Trump ordered the Oregon Guard late last month to move into Portland, but local leaders sued and a federal judge temporarily halted the deployment. Then Trump deployed California and Texas Guard troops, but the Oregon judge stopped all federal troops from entering.

A similar standoff also was unfolding in Chicago.

Here's what to know about the National Guard deployments.

Trump's Portland deployment sets up of legal fight

Trump's first attempt to go after Portland demonstrators was Sept. 28: he ordered 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the region for an initial 60 days, according to court documents.

The troops, he said, would ""protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists"" and would use ""Full Force, if necessary,"" he wrote in a Truth Social post.

After Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, filed suit, a federal judge suspended the deployment Oct. 4.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, ruled the deployment was unnecessary because the demonstrations did not amount to a ""rebellion,"" and law enforcement was capable of handling the protests without military intervention.

National Guard Whac-A-Mole

The Trump administration then took up a new strategy: switch states.

Hours after the judge barred the Oregon troops, he tapped California guardsmen to take on the same job. Early Oct. 5, about 100 California National Guard troops arrived at the Portland Air National Guard base, followed by another 99 guardsmen that afternoon, according to court documents. That prompted California Gov. Gavin Newsom to join Kotek's lawsuit in an attempt to take back control of his state's troops.

The administration also ordered 400 members of the Texas National Guard to ""perform federal protection missions where needed, including in the cities of Portland and Chicago,"" according to a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Hegseth's order to the Texas National Guard – which came with Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's permission – notably left open that the troops could be deployed ""where needed.""

Immergut then issued an order temporarily halting all federal National Guard deployments to Portland.

Trump appealed that ruling Oct. 6, seeking to wrest control of those troops.

Joseph Nunn, a legal expert at the Brennan Center who specializes in National Guard deployments, said at the heart of Immergut's ruling was ""whether the facts on the ground justify deploying troops.""

""The fundamental problem for the Trump administration in Portland is that what they are saying is happening in Portland simply isn’t true,"" Nunn said.

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said of Immergut's ruling: ""With all due respect to that judge, I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law.""

""The ICE facility has been really under siege by these anarchists outside,"" Leavitt said. ""We are very confident in the president's legal authority to do this.""

'Chipocalypse now'

While the battle over Portland played out, Trump also ordered 300 Illinois National Guardsmen into Chicago on Oct. 4. He had also threatened an Illinois deployment in taunting comments and social media posts, including one that read ""Chipocalypse now"" in a reference to the Vietnam War-era film ""Apocalypse Now"" that depicted Trump in the foreground as the lieutenant colonel from the movie with helicopters flying over a burning Chicago skyline behind him.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, sued Oct. 6 to stop the deployment.

""Let me be clear – Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation's cities,"" Pritzker said at a news conference.

Trump deploys military to multiple cities

The Trump administration also sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, DC, earlier this year. Both deployments drew similar lawsuits from Democratic leaders.

In the nation's capital, more than 2,000 troops from the city's own National Guard force and other states have been deployed since mid-August. Those troops also have been assigned to pick up trash and help out with soup kitchens, among other ""beautification"" projects. Brian Schwalb, the city's attorney general, filed suit in early September to end the deployment.

The Trump administration sent about 5,000 California National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to control possible violence amid demonstrations against a wave of deportations. All but a few hundred of the soldiers – some of whom were sent to Portland over the weekend – have gone home.

A judge later ruled the deployment was illegal and violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids National Guard members acting on federal orders from carrying out law enforcement functions. The Trump admistration is appealing that ruling.

Trump also has deployed troops to fight crime in Memphis, Tennessee – with the consent of the state's Republican governor – and to assist immigration enforcement agents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump's use of National Guard called 'unprecedented'

Nunn, from the Brennan Center, said Trump's wielding of the National Guard is ""unprecedented in American history.""

Each day, we’re seeing neighbors kidnapped from our streets, detained in unsafe and inhumane conditions, and deported without due process to countries they’ve never known.

If there’s one silver lining, it’s this: The more Americans see of this agenda, the less they like it. And the more immigrants tell their stories, the better people understand why they belong.

Over 15 percent of Americans are immigrants. If you live here, there’s a good chance you know one. Since the late 1800s, we’ve called on immigrants to work in industry, health care, hospitality, agriculture, and other essential jobs. Immigration is a core to our story about who we are.

Immigrants contribute greatly to our culture and economy. They work jobs, pay taxes, volunteer in churches and schools, support American sports teams, and eat American foods. In 2022, immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes — more than many big name corporations.

At the root of why immigrants come to this country is the promise of a better life — a better job, a better education for their children, a chance to reunite with family. It’s not an easy choice to pick up and leave, and the journey is often perilous. But it’s often the only choice for migrants facing violence, death threats, climate disasters, or extreme poverty.

Against all odds, on average a few million have made their way here each year for the past five years. And generally speaking, the American people want them here — over 60 percent of Americans now disapprove of Trump’s cruel treatment of immigrants.

It turns out that deporting people to unsafe “third countries” they’ve never been to, building concentration camps like Alligator Alcatraz, attempting to end birthright citizenship, and deputizing local and state police as immigration enforcement are all unpopular.

Immigrants without a criminal conviction now make up the largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE. Yet the GOP’s Big Ugly Bill provided $170 billion to enact Trump’s unpopular mass deportation agenda.

Immigrant advocates like Jeanette Vizguerra are fighting back. The cost can be great — but the American people are listening.

Jeanette is a mother of four, an undocumented worker, and long-time immigrant rights activist currently in ICE detention despite having no criminal record. She founded the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition and, in 2017, was named one of TIME Magazine’s 100 most influential people.

On March 17, ICE agents detained Jeanette outside the Target store where she worked. She’s fighting her case in court, arguing that the Trump administration targeted her for her activism. Hundreds of union members, friends, and supporters have rallied outside the Aurora, Colorado detention center where she’s being held.

Also crucial to the movement are groups fighting immigration enforcement and detention. The Detention Watch Network works with local members across the nation to shut down detention facilities and block ICE expansion, urges lawmakers to cut enforcement and detention funding, and educates the public about the impact of immigration policy on ordinary people.

Both Jeanette and Detention Watch Network strive to shift from an immigration approach that emphasizes punishment to one built on dignity and freedom. Together, they’ve been awarded the 49th Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award by the Institute for Policy Studies, my organization, for their ongoing bravery and commitment to protecting our neighbors and loved ones.

The immigrant rights movement continues to fight for the human right to move and stay — and for dignified lives for all. And even with little support among mainstream politicians or the media, they’re making a huge impact in this dangerous time: Nearly 80 percent of Americans now say immigration is good for this country — a record high.

It’s time for our lawmakers and politicians to listen to their constituents. Immigration should remain a vital part of the U.S. past, present, and future.",https://ips-dc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/americans-dislike-Trumps-immigration-agenda.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 17:57:35.132228

“What has taken place since January 20, 2025, would make even President Nixon recoil,” he said.. “This is your legacy, Attorney General Bondi.
In eight short months, you have fundamentally transformed the justice department and left an enormous stain in American history.
The attorney general avoided talking about the indictment, saying it was a “pending case”, but argued it was approved by “one of the most liberal grand juries in the country”.
“You sure didn’t have order when you stormed secretary Noem,” the attorney general said.","Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, sparred on Tuesday with Democratic senators who demanded answers on her involvement in Donald Trump’s crackdown on political opponents, deployment of national guard troops to cities nationwide and handling of the Epstein files.

The clashes at an annual Senate judiciary committee hearing come after months of allegations from the Democrats that Trump has compromised the justice department’s traditional independence and instead used it to bring charges for political reasons.

Federal prosecutors have indicted the former FBI director James Comey, while a reported federal investigation of Tom Homan, the “border czar”, was dropped after Trump took office. Meanwhile, the president has continued to deploy national guard troops into Democratic-led jurisdictions for missions billed as fighting crime and safeguarding immigration agents, over the objections of local leaders.

Throughout the five-hour hearing, Bondi declined to talk about many of the administration’s controversial decisions, despite persistent questioning from the Democrats. When pressed, she personally attacked several senators from the minority or invoked the ongoing government shutdown to depict them as negligent.

“You voted to shut down the government, and you’re sitting here. Our law enforcement officers aren’t being paid,” Bondi replied when the committee’s top Democratic senator, Dick Durbin of Illinois, questioned the Trump administration’s rationale for sending the national guard into Chicago.

“I wish you love Chicago as much as you hate President Trump,” she continued, adding: “If you’re not going to protect your citizens, President Trump will.”

In his opening statement, Durbin described Bondi as doing lasting damage to the department tasked with enforcing federal law.

“What has taken place since January 20, 2025, would make even President Nixon recoil,” he said.. “This is your legacy, Attorney General Bondi. In eight short months, you have fundamentally transformed the justice department and left an enormous stain in American history. It will take decades to recover.”

Of particular concern to Democrats were the charges against Comey, which came after Trump publicly called on Bondi to indict his enemies and fired a veteran prosecutor who refused to bring the case.

The attorney general avoided talking about the indictment, saying it was a “pending case”, but argued it was approved by “one of the most liberal grand juries in the country”.

She was similarly dismissive of questions about the closing of the Homan investigation, in which he was said to have promised immigration-related federal contracts in return for $50,000 from an undercover FBI agent.

“The Department of Justice and the FBI conducted a thorough review, and they found no credible evidence of any wrongdoing,” Bondi said. She also refused to discuss the legal rationale behind the Trump administration’s attacks on boats allegedly carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela.

When Democratic senators became persistent, Bondi responded with critiques and allegations of hypocrisy. Durbin asked the attorney general why she had said earlier this year there was a list of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein’s clients “sitting on my desk”, only for the justice department to announce no such document existed.

“If you listen to my entire clip on that, I said I had not reviewed it yet,” she said.

Durbin then asked Bondi why there was no signature on a July memo from her department saying it had determined that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and no further details about his case would be made public.

“Did you take money from Reid Hoffman, campaign donations, who was a huge Epstein friend?” Bondi replied.

Hoffman is a billionaire venture capitalist who donates to Democrats. He has acknowledged and apologized for collaborating with Epstein on fundraising, but denied being one of his clients.

“Eventually, you’re going to have to answer for your conduct,” Durbin warned. “You won’t do it today, but eventually you will.”

After saying he was concerned about the politicization of the justice department, Senator Alex Padilla got into a back and forth with Bondi. He called for order, prompting Bondi to invoke a June incident where Padilla was briefly handcuffed at a Los Angeles press conference by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.

“You sure didn’t have order when you stormed secretary Noem,” the attorney general said.

The ugliest exchanges came during questioning from Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator from California and longtime Trump foe, who the administration recently accused of mortgage fraud.

As he sought details from Bondi on the handling of the Homan investigation, the attorney general said: “If you worked for me, you would have been fired, because you were censured by Congress for lying.”

Schiff, a former representative, was censured in 2023 by the Republican-led House of Representatives for his involvement in Trump’s first impeachment.

Republican senators generally spoke positively of Bondi, or used their questioning to ask how she would address specific criminal justice issues. Several expressed anger over a report published on Monday that Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed during Joe Biden’s presidency to prosecute Trump, obtained data of nine lawmakers’ phone calls.

“I’ve heard them say that Joe Biden never targeted his political enemies,” Republican senator Josh Hawley said of the Democrats. “Huh? That’s interesting, because I could have sworn that yesterday we learned that the FBI tapped my phone.”

Smith’s cases against the president ended when he won re-election last year. His report into the prosecutions mentions communications between senators and an unnamed co-conspirator, and notes that the justice department’s public integrity section was consulted during the investigation to ensure they did not run afoul of specific protections the law affords to members of Congress.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de6426e93a01b83337d36da9b73f1b82c59486bd/447_0_4583_3667/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8d1b4633e819917617db84bf443d5b8",N,,2025-10-07 16:57:27.377333

It goes hand-in-hand with other recently announced USCIS policies that seek to restrict access to immigration benefits and undermine legal immigration.","In an effort to weaponize an agency that provides pathways to legal immigration, the Trump administration is arming the United States Citizenship Immigration Services (USCIS) for the first time since the agency was created.

Under new regulations published in September, USCIS special agents will be allowed to make arrests, carry firearms, and execute search and arrest warrants. This is the latest effort in Donald Trump’s agenda to systematically restrict legal immigration and strip people of their legal status. The administration’s goal is to redeploy as many parts of the federal government as possible to serve a mass deportation system that will detain and remove as many people as possible.

USCIS is Not an Immigration Enforcement Agency

USCIS is a federal agency that oversees lawful immigration. It decides whether to grant immigration applications and petitions, including applications for green cards, work authorization, asylum, citizenship, and more.

Before USCIS was created, one agency was responsible for most aspects of U.S. immigration law, including carrying out immigration enforcement and deciding immigration benefits. When Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, it separated these duties into three separate agencies: USCIS was created to focus exclusively on deciding immigration benefits, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were charged with law enforcement duties. Congress deliberately separated these functions to allow USCIS to more efficiently and effectively adjudicate immigration benefits, stating that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could not recombine these functions in one agency.

Keeping USCIS separate from ICE and CBP also helped to ensure that people felt comfortable coming forward and applying for immigration benefits. By blurring these lines, the Trump administration is hoping to make it harder and more intimidating for people to apply for and obtain benefits that they are eligible for under U.S. law. This move will also redirect USCIS resources away from deciding whether to grant immigration benefits, and towards supporting ICE. Applications and petitions will languish and processing times will increase. All of this is by design—this administration intentionally keeps immigrants in more vulnerable immigration statuses to limit their rights and make it easier to deport them.

Trump Weaponizes Federal Agencies for Mass Deportations

The Trump administration is using this new rule to bypass Congress and turn USCIS into another arm of ICE. It goes hand-in-hand with other recently announced USCIS policies that seek to restrict access to immigration benefits and undermine legal immigration. For example, USCIS has announced several new policies that, if implemented, will make it harder for qualified immigrants to access citizenship and may stall naturalizations on a large scale. The agency has also instituted hurdles for naturalized citizens seeking to register to vote. Under another new policy, USCIS will deny benefits to people it decides may support “anti-American” ideologies or activities.

Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has weaponized agency after agency to carry out his mass deportation agenda. For example, the Department of Justice stated it would prioritize stripping citizenship from naturalized Americans. The administration has co-opted the military: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has deployed members of the military and used Department of Defense resources for immigration enforcement. ICE has aggressively recruited local police and sheriffs, convincing over one thousand department leaders to forgo local safety priorities and become an arm of its deportation machine. DHS has even deputized Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officers to help immigration enforcement, and attempted to force the IRS as well as Medicare and Medicaid to share information with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes.

USCIS Policy Changes Undermines Citizenship and Silences Immigrants

Turning USCIS into an enforcement agency is another blatant attempt to stigmatize and harm people who are immigrants—including long-time residents who are American in every way, but on paper. USCIS’s recent policy changes undermine the very bedrock of our democracy by keeping people from seeking legal status and citizenship. If immigrants cannot access citizenship and other immigration benefits, we risk having an underclass of people subject to the whims of this administration’s loyalty tests and able to be exploited. Just look at Miller’s plans to deprive noncitizen children of education and deny citizenship to American-born children.

The Trump administration is erasing our history as a nation of immigrants and attempting to rewrite what it means to be an American by intimidating immigrants, pushing them into the shadows, and silencing dissenters.

These attacks are a reminder that our undocumented neighbors and loved ones deserve a path to citizenship. They are raising families, paying taxes, and working to make our nation thrive.

Perhaps un-coincidentally, Lattarulo is a well-known immigration in the Boston area — his clients include the father of a 4-month old whose arrest by ICE drew public scrutiny — and has a popular social media presence that calls out problematic practices of immigration agents and is critical of Donald Trump’s policies.

As a result, he filed a lawsuit alleging violations of his First and Fourth Amendment rights. Lattarulo also filed an emergency motion seeking a temporary restraining order blocking the search of his phone and its return, as it contains confidential client information, as well as privileged information between himself and other attorneys. As stated in the motion, “The seizure was made eight hours after plaintiff had been inspected by United States Customs and Border Protection at a border crossing. Plaintiff’s phone was unlawfully seized and most likely searched in violation of plaintiff’s First and Fourth Amendments, and the constitutional rights of his clients.”

District of Massachusetts Judge Allison D. Burroughs granted the TRO, barring the government from searching the phone or analyzing any data that may have already been collected.

Lattarulo’s attorneys, Mary Lemay and Patrick Hanley from Butters Brazilian, said, “We believe attorney Lattarulo was targeted because he represents clients in immigration-related proceedings, and he has amplified the government’s own enforcement priorities via social media to immigrant communities and anyone else who might be interested.”

“Public criticism of our government is protected speech under the First Amendment. We initiated this suit to protect not only attorney Lattarulo’s constitutional rights, but also those of his clients.”

But this early success may not translate to ultimate victory. In 2021, Texas immigration attorney Adam A. Malik had his phone seized by border agents. The Fifth Circuit ruled DHS’s use of a filter team to sort out any privileged materials was sufficient to protect Malik’s clients, and that the government’s asserted connection between the attorney and an arms dealer created probable cause even if Malik is correct that the connection “appears dubious in hindsight.”",https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/GettyImages-2213399102-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:59:02.634050

President Trump does not have the authority to deploy the Texas National Guard other than under specific circumstances: invasion, rebellion, or if 'the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.'

“Exposure is not something that ICE wants,” Tim McOsker, a Los Angeles City Council member whose district covers Terminal Island, explained to me in a phone call.
From there, Trebach was moved to a federal detention facility in downtown Los Angeles, where she was held until later the next day.
“By the time our police officers arrived out there, everybody was gone.” The incident highlights the hollowness of the anti-Trump rhetoric of local politicians in Los Angeles.
There are masked men riding around my town trying to kidnap people.” This ethos harks back to another era of resistance in the Los Angeles harbor.","Back in June, Chiland, a Los Angeles public-school teacher, heard rumors that National Guard troops were being marshalled on Terminal Island in preparation to arrest anti-ICE demonstrators across the city. This inspired Chiland and his wife, Maya Suzuki Daniels, to co-found the Harbor Area Peace Patrol, a group of community activists that track the movements of immigration authorities around Los Angeles. “I came down here to check on that, because we wanted to let people know,” Chiland told me. He didn’t find any National Guard members that day, but “what I did see was a convoy of eleven vehicles”—some labelled Border Patrol, others unmarked, with tinted windows—leaving the federal complex and heading for the city. The next morning, another member of the newly established Peace Patrol returned to check if the Border Patrol convoys were back. They were. “We’ve been seeing them every day since,” he said. Today was day ninety-one.

By six-thirty, the Peace Patrollers were standing along the shoulder of Seaside Avenue. Maldonado, a Los Angeles-area workers-compensation hearing representative, distributed green reflective vests (“so they can’t say they didn’t see us”), and the group got to work. Four of the Patrollers whipped out their cellphones to photograph each passing vehicle, while Chiland managed the Peace Patrol’s Instagram account—a vital tool for broadcasting information and communicating with the public. Maldonado held tally clickers in each hand (one for inbound traffic to the federal complex, one for outbound) and counted the flow of vehicles. “We’ll get around a hundred to a hundred and thirty cars per day,” he told me. An S.U.V. and a sedan drove by. Click. Click. “If we get an influx of cars, that lets me know that there’s a lot of activity going on in L.A.” The busiest day since the Patrol started recording was in August, when three hundred and five vehicles passed through. He laughed: “We’ll tell our grandkids that we defeated fascism with six-dollar clickers.”

With the images they capture at Terminal Island, the Peace Patrol and Unión del Barrio, an affiliated community-activist organization, compare vehicles with those that appear at immigration raids throughout the region. Some vehicles logged at Terminal Island by the group have been spotted as far away as Ventura, and even Sacramento. Once a license plate has been confirmed as that of a federal agent by appearing both at Terminal Island and at an immigration-enforcement raid, the Peace Patrol will post an image of the plate and the vehicle to the group’s Instagram account. In a few instances, “we’ve seen one license plate on two different vehicles,” Maldonado said. Other times, a temporary paper license plate has been used to obscure known plates.

“Exposure is not something that ICE wants,” Tim McOsker, a Los Angeles City Council member whose district covers Terminal Island, explained to me in a phone call. McOsker has been a valuable resource for the Patrollers, and his wife has volunteered with the group. “When you are engaged in a systematic, unconstitutional activity where you’re trying to grab as many people in your net as possible, you do not want cameras.” The agents flowing through Terminal Island seem to agree. According to the Peace Patrol, after three months and dozens of confirmed vehicles and plates, certain cars are known to the Patrollers and have nicknames, like Christopher Columbus, Big Red, and Jammer. The federal agents have become aware of the Patrollers, too. Some agents will attempt to hide their faces as they pass—what the patrollers have dubbed the shy shoulder. Others will try to disguise their unmarked cars with things like a “COEXIST” bumper sticker (nickname: “Captain Coexist”) or Teddy bears on the dashboard. Still others will get aggressive. “We’ve been swerved at, we’ve had cars rip down the street at seventy, eighty miles per hour,” said Cait Bartlett, another former L.A. public-school teacher. Not long after, a large pickup truck known to the group rolled by, its horn blaring at the patrollers as the driver flashed his middle finger. “They’re trying to be intimidating,” Bartlett continued. “So, there is a little bit of nervousness attached to it, but I know the work that we’re doing is important.”

A month earlier, that intimidation had boiled over. On the morning of August 8th, two masked men leaving the federal complex exited their vehicle and targeted one of the Patrollers, Amanda Trebach, who was photographing cars and holding a protest sign. She was pinned to the ground, handcuffed, and thrown into a van. Then, as Trebach recounts, the agents drove her into the complex, where she was detained for several hours. Later, she was moved into a second vehicle by masked, armed men (including one of the men who had arrested her), where a special agent from the Department of Homeland Security questioned her. From there, Trebach was moved to a federal detention facility in downtown Los Angeles, where she was held until later the next day.

When reached for comment, Tricia McLaughlin, the D.H.S. Assistant Secretary for public affairs, alleged that Trebach jumped in front of a Border Patrol vehicle leaving the federal complex, causing the driver to swerve, then “hit the car with her signs and fists while yelling obscenities at agents.” McLaughlin further alleged that Trebach blocked agents of Customs and Border Protection from carrying out their duties, and that led to her arrest. (Trebach has not been charged with a crime.)

“None of that happened,” Trebach told me, when reached by phone. D.H.S. is “very frustrated and angry that we’re out there filming them, but we’re standing on public property.” She also said that her cellphone was confiscated while in detention, and it remains in the possession of D.H.S. As a result, Trebach, an I.C.U. nurse, worries about the additional personal information that agents may have accessed and could use to continue targeting her. “I’m scared every night when I come home that they’re going to take me away,” she said.

For Suzuki Daniels, the Peace Patrol co-founder, video of Trebach’s arrest is still challenging to watch. “I have a physical reaction to it,” she said. “The only reason that it’s not getting national outcry is that, right now, we’re being inundated with so many crimes in our communities and across the United States. I think we’re kind of stunned, and in a freeze-trauma response.”

Roughly two hours after Trebach was taken away, a group of masked agents returned to her unlocked car, rummaged through her belongings, “and held three of our Patrollers at gunpoint,” Maldonado, who was present that morning, recalled. In the Peace Patrol’s video of the confrontation, a Port Police cruiser is visible passing by, twice. Maldonado still doesn’t understand why they didn’t stop and intervene: “The federal agents never identified themselves. They’re masked. You don’t know if they’re vigilantes. You don’t know who they are. Port Police just cruised by and pretended they didn’t see it at all.”

I reached out to Thomas Gazsi, the chief of the Los Angeles Port Police, about the incident, and about the role of his department in upholding the rights of the Peace Patrollers to assemble on a public road. Gazsi confirmed that someone from his department was present the morning Trebach was detained, but clarified that it was a port-security civilian officer, not a police officer. Still, should the security officer have, at the very least, stopped to witness the incident with the gunmen, and called it in to the department? “She reported to her supervisors, which was reported to our department,” Gazsi responded. “By the time our police officers arrived out there, everybody was gone.”

The incident highlights the hollowness of the anti-Trump rhetoric of local politicians in Los Angeles. The city’s mayor, Karen Bass, has repeatedly decried the federal government’s incursion into the city (calling it an “assault” and “un-American”), and saying ICE’s relentless immigration raids are a “reign of terror” that must end. In July, she issued an executive directive that bolstered a 2017 city ordinance prohibiting city resources, including the L.A.P.D., from being used in immigration-enforcement activities, “unless required by federal or state law.” Yet, in multiple videos supplied to me by Unión del Barrio, the L.A.P.D. is present at immigration-enforcement activities, not impeding the federal agents but in what appears to be an accessory role.

In a video from June 24th, immigration agents are seen actively detaining individuals on the street, while L.A.P.D. officers stand in front of them, hands perched over their gun holsters or wielding batons, as they push back a crowd that has formed to intervene. In another video, from August 13th, an L.A.P.D. officer stands a few yards from an active Homeland Security Investigations operation as a person off camera asks “why L.A.P.D. is working with Homeland Security.” The officer responds that L.A.P.D. “provides security” for the agency, and that the department has worked with H.S.I. on “many occasions.”

This difference between what politicians promise and what actually happens has become more pronounced, of late, for anyone aligned with the Democratic Party. For Suzuki Daniels, the failure of Democrats to stand up against rising right-wing authoritarianism has left her feeling jaded about the entire political system. “No politician is going to save us,” she said. After years of canvassing for political candidates, signing petitions, and making phone calls for campaigns, “everything I do for the next four years is going to be direct action and mutual aid,” she said. “I am not pleading with politicians to save me or save the people I care about. There are masked men riding around my town trying to kidnap people.”

This ethos harks back to another era of resistance in the Los Angeles harbor. Back on Terminal Island, a little after 7 A.M., Gina, another member of the group, who declined to give her last name, asked if she could show me the statue in the middle of the Japanese fishing-village memorial. She told me that her grandfather had been a Sicilian immigrant who fished in San Pedro Bay, and that he had learned how to catch tuna with longline poles—a technique introduced by Japanese immigrants, many of whom had lived on Terminal Island. During the Second World War, as the U.S. government razed Furusato, “there was a lot of protection” from the non-Japanese community, Gina, said. “There was a lot of backlash, because what [the government] did was such a dirty thing.” She choked up as she continued, “This is white supremacy, once again, trying to take a foothold—it’s full fascism. Just like what happened to the Japanese Americans.” She turned to show me the statue of two Japanese fishermen, one looking out at Los Angeles, the other staring back at the federal complex, “watching them come and go,” as if they were part of their own peace patrol. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68d2e1a1d84c9f738cea23e0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Tomas_ICE_bleed.png",N,,2025-10-07 16:58:53.739609

The plaintiffs are urging the court to protect the First Amendment rights of protesters to peacefully demonstrate around the facility and of journalists to “observe, record, and report on the federal agents’ activities and the public’s demonstrations against them.”

The suit — which was filed by the newsroom Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Headline Club, local labor unions representing Chicago-area journalists and a group of individual journalist and protesters — lists specific incidents in which they say agents targeted the press, including instances where they allege six journalists were hit with either pepper balls or tear gas despite wearing visible press credentials.

They also list eight examples of protesters and residents who they said were harmed or injured by ICE officers’ “violent presence” — including a minister for a local Presbyterian Church who allegedly was struck by the pepper balls and sprayed with tear gas while trying to offer prayers to the crowd.

Videos show agents firing pepper balls and tear gas at crowds as demonstrators attempted to block ICE vehicles from the facility. A reporter for CBS News Chicago said a masked ICE agent shot a pepper ball at her car, burning her face.

“The federal officers’ brutality is not a response to the violation of any previously given order to disperse or to desist,” the lawsuit states. “Rather, the brutality described in the prior paragraphs is deployed solely to silence dissent, to intimidate, and to instill fear.”

Trump plans to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Chicago this week to quell the clashes outside ICE centers and crack down on crime in the city. Illinois and Chicago also moved to sue the Trump administration on Monday in an attempt to block the deployment, but the judge assigned to the case said she wouldn’t act on the litigation until Thursday.

The White House and ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin claimed federal officers have faced increased assaults at the protests in Chicago, saying the First Amendment protects “speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting.”

“We remind members of the media to exercise caution as they cover these violent riots and remind journalists that covering unlawful activities in the field does come with risks — though our officers take every reasonable precaution to mitigate those dangers to those exercising protected First Amendment rights,” she said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F4f%2F36%2Fae8ad5144365a4b1229edb3e3dcc%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2235818598,N,,2025-10-07 15:56:46.166973

Over the weekend, larger crowds gathered outside the facility and federal agents fired tear gas.","CHICAGO (AP) — Illinois leaders went to court Monday to stop President Donald Trump from sending National Guard troops to Chicago, escalating a clash between Democratic-led states and the Republican administration during an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the nation’s third-largest city.

The legal challenge came hours after a judge blocked the Guard’s deployment in Portland, Oregon.

The lawsuit in Chicago also raised the stakes after a violent weekend: Authorities said a woman was shot by a federal agent when Border Patrol vehicles were boxed in and struck by other vehicles. The city’s police superintendent rejected suggestions that his officers were on the government’s side in volatile situations like that one.

The Trump administration has portrayed the cities as war-ravaged and lawless amid its crackdown on illegal immigration. Officials in Illinois and Oregon say military intervention isn’t needed and that federal involvement is inflaming the situation.

The lawsuit alleges that “these advances in President Trump’s long-declared ‘War’ on Chicago and Illinois are unlawful and dangerous.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said a court hearing was scheduled for Thursday.

“Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation’s cities,” Pritzker, a Democrat, said.

Governor: Federal wave is an ‘invasion’

Pritzker said some 300 of the state’s guard troops were to be federalized and deployed to Chicago, along with 400 others from Texas.

Pritzker said the potential deployment amounted to “Trump’s invasion,” and he called on Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to block it. Abbott pushed back and said the crackdown was needed to protect federal workers who are in the city as part of the president’s increased immigration enforcement.

Abbott posted a picture on the social platform X on Monday night of Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, but didn’t specify where they were going.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson confirmed in a weekend statement that Trump authorized using Illinois National Guard members, citing what she called “ongoing violent riots and lawlessness” that local leaders have not quelled.

The sight of armed Border Patrol agents making arrests near famous landmarks amplified concerns from Chicagoans already uneasy after an immigration crackdown that began last month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Monday that he signed an executive order barring federal immigration agents and others from using city-owned property, such as parking lots, garages and vacant lots, as staging areas for enforcement operations.

Mayor limits protest hours at ICE site

Protesters have frequently rallied near an immigration facility outside the city, and federal officials reported the arrests of 13 protesters Friday near the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview. Mayor Katrina Thompson, citing safety and other factors, said she was limiting protests to 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The ACLU of Illinois on Monday sued Trump, Department of Homeland Security, ICE, Border Patrol and national and local leaders at several agencies, accusing them of unleashing a campaign of violence and intimidation against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of demonstrations outside that facility. The lawsuit alleges that federal agents used “indiscriminate” and “violent force,” including tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper balls and flash grenades, interfering with First Amendment rights.

DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in response to the lawsuit that “the First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting.”

Elsewhere, DHS acknowledged that agents shot a woman Saturday on Chicago’s southwest side. The department said it happened after Border Patrol agents patrolling the area were “rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said it’s reasonable for agents to use force if they believe they’re being ambushed. He noted officers were redeployed from other parts of the city to assist the agents and that 27 were affected by tear gas.

“We cannot become a society where we just decide to take everything in our own hands and start to commit crimes against law enforcement,” Snelling said.

He said it’s difficult to “toe the line” between not helping federal immigration agents and maintaining public safety.

Portland says no crime crisis there

In Portland, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut on Sunday granted a temporary restraining order sought by Oregon and California barring the deployment of Guard troops to Oregon from any state and the District of Columbia.

Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, seemed incredulous that the president moved to send National Guard troops to Oregon from neighboring California and then from Texas on Sunday, just hours after she had ruled against it the first time.

“Aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order?” she said. “Why is this appropriate?”

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt criticized the decision and said the president was using his authority as commander in chief.

Portland’s ICE facility has been the site of nightly protests for months, peaking in June when Portland police declared a riot, with smaller clashes occurring since then.

In recent weeks, the nightly protests typically drew a couple dozen people — until Trump ordered the National Guard. Over the weekend, larger crowds gathered outside the facility and federal agents fired tear gas. Portland police made multiple arrests.

Since June, federal agents have charged 30 people with federal crimes related to the protests at the ICE building, including assaulting federal officers, failure to comply and depredation of government property, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Oregon said Monday.

Most violent crime around the U.S. has declined in recent years, including in Portland, where homicides from January through June decreased by 51% to 17 this year compared to the same period in 2024, data shows.

Since starting his second term, Trump has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

A federal judge in September said the administration “willfully” broke federal law by deploying guard troops to Los Angeles over protests about immigration raids.

The court has said that it will also consider whether Mr. Trump can fire heads of independent agencies.","The prime players in Tuesday’s argument are lawyers for the State of Colorado and the Christian therapist suing over its conversion therapy law. But D. John Sauer, the solicitor general for the Trump administration, also requested that his office be allowed to participate in the arguments in support of the therapist, Kaley Chiles.

Mr. Sauer’s office has been on winning streak in front of the Supreme Court. He first broke onto the national scene with what seemed like an audacious argument: A former president could be immune from criminal prosecution even if he ordered a team of Navy SEALs to kill a political rival.

When asked by a federal appeals court, he accepted that premise that former presidents could not be criminally prosecuted for actions they took in office. He won that case before the Supreme Court in July 2024, with a majority of the justices granting Donald J. Trump substantial immunity from prosecution before he was re-elected president.

Now, Mr. Sauer, a former Rhodes Scholar and Supreme Court clerk from Missouri, is the solicitor general of the United States, the voice of the Trump administration before the justices.

In his role, Mr. Sauer leads a group of lawyers within the Justice Department who decide which cases to bring before the justices on behalf of the Trump administration, shape the administration’s legal arguments and argue the cases before the court.

Tuesday’s case is being argued by Hashim M. Mooppan, a principal deputy solicitor general. Like Mr. Sauer, he was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia. Mr. Mooppan was a counselor to the solicitor general during the first Trump administration.

Mr. Sauer’s path to the second Trump administration ran through Missouri, where he served as solicitor general from 2017 to 2023 before working at a private firm. He gained a reputation as a particularly assertive litigator for conservative causes, including the opposition of same-sex marriage, access to contraception and the participation of transgender athletes in girls’ and women’s sports.

Since his confirmation, Mr. Sauer has been at the center of a whirlwind of litigation before the justices, defending Trump administration policies on several central pieces of the president’s agenda, including imposing tariffs, ending birthright citizenship and dismantling federal agencies. The pace has been frantic — Mr. Sauer has made more than two dozen requests for emergency relief — and it appears unlikely to slow anytime soon.

So far, his office has an extraordinary track record of victories, including a 6-to-3 ruling in late June that sharply curtailed the power of federal trial court judges to issue nationwide freezes on administration policies — the main tool that opponents had used to block the president’s agenda.

Since Mr. Trump returned to office in January and began issuing a blitz of presidential orders, Mr. Sauer has largely been arguing for emergency intervention by the Supreme Court, asking that the justices overturn temporary procedural rulings from lower court judges as opposed to weighing in on the substance of the policies.

This term, the solicitor general will marshal arguments directly on the merits of some of the president’s central policies, including whether a president can impose sweeping global tariffs — a case that has been fast-tracked by the court and is scheduled to be heard in November. The court has said that it will also consider whether Mr. Trump can fire heads of independent agencies.

In late September, Mr. Sauer also asked the justices to decide whether Mr. Trump has the authority to end birthright citizenship, the foundational principle stipulating that children born on U.S. soil are Americans.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07scotus-conversion-therapy-sauer-fhbm/07scotus-conversion-therapy-sauer-fhbm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:59:10.859967

Here's what Americans say in new poll - Miami Herald,Brendan Rascius,,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article312414392.html,"In the survey, most respondents said they believe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have wrongly arrested U.S. citizens and half describe their tactics as too forceful.
Most Democrats and independents — 89% and 62%, respectively — said ICE agents arrest U.S. citizens often or sometimes, while 57% of Republicans said this happens rarely or not at all.
“We have said it a million times: ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
“Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement.” Is ICE targeting criminals?
ICE tactics Lastly, respondents were asked to describe the tactics being used by ICE agents.","On the 2024 campaign trail, President Donald Trump vowed to launch what he called the “largest deportation program in American history.”

Now — nearly one year after his election — many Americans are uneasy with how this pledge is being pursued, expressing concerns about the scale and intensity of Trump’s immigration crackdown, according to a new YouGov poll.

In the survey, most respondents said they believe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have wrongly arrested U.S. citizens and half describe their tactics as too forceful.

It comes as ICE arrests have dramatically increased in recent months and as a record-breaking number of people have been placed in detention centers, according to an analysis from NBC News.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in September that 400,000 non-citizens have been deported since January, with 1.6 million more having self-deported, putting the administration on pace to “shatter historic records.”

Many Republicans have applauded the immigration crackdown, crediting Trump with following through with his campaign promises. House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X, “House Republicans are united behind our brave ICE officers and all those on the frontlines of the largest deportation effort in history.”

Meanwhile, numerous Democrats have attacked recent enforcement measures, with Rep. Rashida Tlaib accusing ICE of “ripping people out of the arms of their family members, terrorizing our communities, and turning our country into a fascist police state.”

ICE arresting US citizens

In the poll — which sampled 2,295 U.S. adults on Oct. 6 — respondents were asked: “How often do you think ICE wrongly arrests U.S. citizens?”

A majority, 60%, said immigration agents arrest American citizens often (35%) or sometimes (25%). Half that share said they detain citizens rarely (24%) or never (6%). An additional 11% said they were not sure.

This question resulted in a significant partisan divide. Most Democrats and independents — 89% and 62%, respectively — said ICE agents arrest U.S. citizens often or sometimes, while 57% of Republicans said this happens rarely or not at all.

Since January, at least 15 American citizens have been apprehended by ICE, with some being swept away by masked agents and detained for hours, according to a September analysis by the New York Times. This figure represents a small fraction of overall detentions, though the exact number is difficult to determine since the government does not release data on such encounters.

DHS described this report as false and misleading.

“We have said it a million times: ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement.”

Is ICE targeting criminals?

The YouGov poll — which has a margin of error of 2.7 percentage points — also asked respondents: “Do you think most immigrants being arrested by ICE are people who have committed crimes beyond entering or staying in the country illegally?”

A plurality, 48%, said that they believed most of those arrested have not committed other crimes, while 29% said they have. Twenty-three percent said they were not sure.

Here, again, there were massive differences across the political spectrum.

Most Democrats and independents — 76% and 51%, respectively — said the majority of those apprehended haven’t committed crimes aside from entering the U.S. illegally. Fifty-six percent of Republicans said they had violated the law in other ways.

Trump has vowed to deport “the worst of the worst,” with a focus on “dangerous criminals,” including murderers and rapists. But, government detention data paints a different picture.

As of late June, about 58,000 people were in ICE detention facilities, according to the Associated Press. Of these individuals, 71.7% had not been convicted of a crime. About one-quarter of them had pending charges.

ICE tactics

Lastly, respondents were asked to describe the tactics being used by ICE agents.

Fifty percent said their methods are “too forceful,” while 25% said they are “about right” and 15% said they are “not forceful enough.” An additional 11% said they weren’t sure.

Most Democrats and independents — 84% and 52%, respectively — characterized ICE tactics as excessive. Meanwhile, a plurality of Republicans, 44%, said they are appropriate.

Across the country, ICE raids have sparked multiple reports of agents resorting to excessive force against detainees and bystanders, resulting in some lawsuits.

In September, an ICE officer was captured on video shoving a mother onto the floor of a courthouse in New York, according to CNN. She was hospitalized and the officer was “relieved of his current duties.”

In California, a 79-year-old U.S. citizen claimed he was tackled to the ground by ICE agents, resulting in broken bones and signs of brain injury, according to the Associated Press. He filed a $50 million lawsuit against the government.

In response, a DHS spokesperson accused him of impeding an ICE operation.

“If you lay a hand on our law enforcement, we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X on Sept. 19.

Each day, we’re seeing neighbors kidnapped from our streets, detained in unsafe and inhumane conditions, and deported without due process to countries they’ve never known.

If there’s one silver lining, it’s this: The more Americans see of this agenda, the less they like it. And the more immigrants tell their stories, the better people understand why they belong.

Over 15 percent of Americans are immigrants. If you live here, there’s a good chance you know one. Since the late 1800s, we’ve called on immigrants to work in industry, health care, hospitality, agriculture, and other essential jobs. Immigration is a core to our story about who we are.

Immigrants contribute greatly to our culture and economy. They work jobs, pay taxes, volunteer in churches and schools, support American sports teams, and eat American foods. In 2022, immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes — more than many big name corporations.

At the root of why immigrants come to this country is the promise of a better life — a better job, a better education for their children, a chance to reunite with family. It’s not an easy choice to pick up and leave, and the journey is often perilous. But it’s often the only choice for migrants facing violence, death threats, climate disasters, or extreme poverty.

Against all odds, on average a few million have made their way here each year for the past five years. And generally speaking, the American people want them here — over 60 percent of Americans now disapprove of Trump’s cruel treatment of immigrants.

It turns out that deporting people to unsafe “third countries” they’ve never been to, building concentration camps like Alligator Alcatraz, attempting to end birthright citizenship, and deputizing local and state police as immigration enforcement are all unpopular.

Immigrants without a criminal conviction now make up the largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE. Yet the GOP’s Big Ugly Bill provided $170 billion to enact Trump’s unpopular mass deportation agenda.

Immigrant advocates like Jeanette Vizguerra are fighting back. The cost can be great — but the American people are listening.

Jeanette is a mother of four, an undocumented worker, and long-time immigrant rights activist currently in ICE detention despite having no criminal record. She founded the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition and, in 2017, was named one of TIME Magazine’s 100 most influential people.

On March 17, ICE agents detained Jeanette outside the Target store where she worked. She’s fighting her case in court, arguing that the Trump administration targeted her for her activism. Hundreds of union members, friends, and supporters have rallied outside the Aurora, Colorado detention center where she’s being held.

Also crucial to the movement are groups fighting immigration enforcement and detention. The Detention Watch Network works with local members across the nation to shut down detention facilities and block ICE expansion, urges lawmakers to cut enforcement and detention funding, and educates the public about the impact of immigration policy on ordinary people.

Both Jeanette and Detention Watch Network strive to shift from an immigration approach that emphasizes punishment to one built on dignity and freedom. Together, they’ve been awarded the 49th Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award by the Institute for Policy Studies, my organization, for their ongoing bravery and commitment to protecting our neighbors and loved ones.

The immigrant rights movement continues to fight for the human right to move and stay — and for dignified lives for all. And even with little support among mainstream politicians or the media, they’re making a huge impact in this dangerous time: Nearly 80 percent of Americans now say immigration is good for this country — a record high.

It’s time for our lawmakers and politicians to listen to their constituents. Immigration should remain a vital part of the U.S. past, present, and future.",https://otherwords.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_2640297729.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:57:33.593630

A Second Chance On The 2020 Immigration Rule The Trump administration’s new H-1B rule will likely incorporate elements of its unsuccessful 2020 regulation.
In December 2024, the Biden administration published a final H-1B rule that addressed some of the issues in the Trump administration’s rule.
After a judge blocked the October 2020 interim final H-1B rule, the Trump administration posted online (but did not publish) a “final rule” in mid-January, together with a Department of Labor memo.
A New Immigration Rule To Restrict Employment-Based Green Cards DHS will also propose a rule that could affect employment-based immigrants.","The Trump administration plans to publish a new H-1B rule expected to propose additional immigration restrictions on how employers use the visa and who qualifies for it. Shortly before the White House announced a $100,000 fee on many H-1B visa holders, the Department of Homeland Security published its regulatory agenda. The agenda includes a rule to change the H-1B visa category.

The summary for the upcoming rule “Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program” states: “DHS will propose to reform the H-1B program by revising eligibility for cap exemptions, providing greater scrutiny for employers that have violated program requirements, and increasing oversight over third party placements, among other provisions. These changes are intended to improve the integrity of the H-1B nonimmigrant program and better protect U.S. workers’ wages and working conditions.” The regulatory notice lists December 2025 as a possible publication date for the rule.

H-1B temporary visas are important since they typically are the only practical way for a high-skilled foreign national to work in the United States long term and eventually gain permanent residence (a green card). The H-1B annual limit is 65,000, with a 20,000 exemption for individuals with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. university. At U.S. universities, international students account for 73% of full-time graduate students in electrical and computer engineering. Under U.S. law, in addition to government fees often exceeding $6,000, employers must pay the higher of the actual or prevailing wage paid to U.S. professionals with similar experience and qualifications. Research indicates that H-1B visa holders are paid the same or higher salaries than U.S. workers with comparable levels of education and experience.

During Donald Trump’s first term, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services implemented policies that resulted in historically high H-1B denial rates, until lawsuits and a subsequent legal settlement led to the agency’s reversal of these practices. However, the Trump administration failed to publish a final rule to change the H-1B visa category. The rule was published late in the president’s term, on October 8, 2020, and a judge blocked the H-1B rule on the grounds that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act. By starting the process early in Trump’s second term, administration officials seeking to impose new H-1B restrictions hope to avoid the fate of their 2020 rule.

A Second Chance On The 2020 Immigration Rule

The Trump administration’s new H-1B rule will likely incorporate elements of its unsuccessful 2020 regulation. The rule published in October 2020 had two main goals: 1) To make it more challenging for high-skilled foreign nationals to qualify for H-1B status, and 2) to prevent H-1B visa holders from working at customer sites.

In December 2024, the Biden administration published a final H-1B rule that addressed some of the issues in the Trump administration’s rule. However, Biden officials decided on those issues in ways the business community viewed more favorably.

In the first version of its rule, which was a proposed rule, the Biden administration used the phrase “directly related specific specialty,” stating a position must require “A U.S. baccalaureate or higher degree in a directly related specific specialty or its equivalent” to enter the occupation. That phrase also appeared in the Trump administration’s October 2020 rule and would have narrowed the positions considered specialty occupations.

After attorneys and companies warned that the wording would prevent many foreign-born professionals from working in America, the Biden administration modified that section in its final rule. Although DHS retained the ‘directly related’ requirement in the definition of ‘specialty occupation,’ it added language clarifying that “directly related means there is a logical connection between the degree or its equivalent, and the duties of the position.” DHS added, “The specialty occupation definition also clarifies that although the position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, each of the fields must be directly related to the duties of the position.”

Kevin Miner of Fragomen noted at the time that the original language could have prevented adjudicators from allowing the H-1B category to account for emerging technologies and degree fields. “The final rule solves this concern by noting that ‘directly related’ just means that there is a ‘logical connection’ between the education and the H-1B role, which should help the H-1B category continue to evolve with technology and new kinds of jobs as they develop,” said Miner in an interview.

The Trump administration could revise this language to make it more restrictive. However, the Supreme Court decision to end Chevron deference (to federal agencies) may limit its ability to go beyond what the statute permits on this and other measures. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Loper Bright Enterprises et al. v. Raimondo: “The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, and courts may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous; Chevron is overruled.”

The Trump administration could revisit areas that employers supported in the Biden H-1B final rule. For example, employers and university groups favored the extension of “cap-gap” protection for international students to prevent disruptions to students’ status and work authorization. Employers and university groups also supported provisions in the final rule that allow more organizations to qualify as H-1B cap-exempt nonprofit research institutions and greater leeway for H-1B visa holders to become entrepreneurs.

The Biden final rule also eliminated the application of the “itinerary requirement” to H-1B visa holders working at different locations. Employers argued that requiring a detailed itinerary of where and how long an H-1B professional works conflicted with modern work practices.

Trump’s 2020 Immigration Rule Restricted H-1B Visa Holders Working At Customer Locations

For much of Donald Trump’s first term, Trump officials sought to make it infeasible for an employer to send an H-1B visa holder to work at a customer’s location. A 2018 “Contracts and Itineraries” memo imposed new H-1B restrictions. When companies wanted to send H-1B employees to work on customer sites, USCIS often limited the approval period, sometimes to a single day. (The October 2020 rule would have limited H-1B visa holders working on customer sites to approvals lasting only one year.) Court losses and a legal settlement led to the agency ending the practices.

In rulemaking, Trump officials attempted again to make working in H-1B status at a customer’s location far more challenging. They adopted a controversial definition of what qualified as an employer-employee relationship, changing the long-held Department of Labor meaning. After a judge blocked the October 2020 interim final H-1B rule, the Trump administration posted online (but did not publish) a “final rule” in mid-January, together with a Department of Labor memo.

Although the measures did not take effect, attorneys argue that they represented a radical interpretation of labor and immigration law. Trump officials believed they could prevent companies from employing H-1B professionals who fulfill contracts at customer locations by shifting the legal obligations onto customers. In January 2021, via the unpublished final H-1B rule and DOL memo, the Trump administration sought to require not only information technology and professional services companies to submit H-1B petitions and labor condition applications but also their customers. That would have made the customers, in effect, employers of the H-1B visa holders rather than the recipients of services.

To give a mundane example, picture a landscaping company telling a homeowner they need to assume immigration obligations for the company’s employees who mow the homeowner’s lawn or trim the bushes. Few, if any, customers will assume immigration or other legal obligations for individuals they cannot hire or fire.

The Trump administration’s rule blocking IT and other services at customer sites would have affected not only suppliers but also the companies that receive services. A similar provision in a future rule could also affect productivity. University of California-Davis’ Giovanni Peri and Kevin Shih and Colgate University’s Chad Sparber concluded that the presence of foreign STEM workers accounts for approximately 30% to 50% of the aggregate productivity growth in the United States between 1990 and 2010. A percentage point increase in the share of foreign STEM workers in a city's employment mix “increased the wage growth of native college-educated labor by about 7 to 8 percentage points,” according to the research.

According to industry experts, IT services provided today, particularly those delivered by more established companies, are specialized and often involve substantial contracts worth several hundred million dollars or even $1 billion. The contracts typically provide skills, services or knowledge that U.S. companies do not possess in-house, or that may not make practical or financial sense to staff in-house, particularly for project-oriented work. Examples include incorporating AI throughout a healthcare provider’s network, providing technical support for a clothing company’s hardware and software across multiple platforms and initiating digital solutions to improve the operations of a pharmaceutical company.

Analysts note that by entering into expensive contracts to receive these services, companies demonstrate that they view these expenditures as necessary to compete, which means they improve the productivity of U.S. companies. H-1B visa holders are not the only professionals to service these contracts, but industry experts consider these types of technical services essential, given how the U.S. and global economy function today. (In FY 2025, there were entries for 442,000 unique beneficiaries in the H-1B registration process, according to DHS, which indicates that if no major companies that provide information technology services had received approved new H-1B petitions in FY 2025 as in previous years, the agency still would not have selected more than 300,000 H-1B beneficiaries due to the 85,000 annual limit. That indicates the most significant problem in the H-1B category for employers seeking high-skilled foreign nationals is the low yearly limit relative to the demand in a technology-driven economy.)

A New Immigration Rule To Restrict Employment-Based Green Cards

DHS will also propose a rule that could affect employment-based immigrants. According to the abstract, the proposed rule will, among other things, “update provisions governing extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers; modernize outdated provisions for individuals of extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers; clarify evidentiary requirements for first preference classifications, second preference national interest waiver classifications, and physicians of national and international renown.” The regulatory notice lists ​January 2026 as a possible publication date.

Attorneys believe the proposed rule may be the Trump administration’s opportunity to eliminate the Biden administration’s efforts to clarify and expand eligibility for O-1A visas and national interest waivers.

On January 21, 2022, the Biden administration announced new guidance that encouraged more employers and high-skilled foreign nationals to use the O-1A visa category and national interest waivers.

“O-1A [are for] individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry),” according to USCIS. Receiving a national interest waiver allows individuals and employers to avoid the costly and time-consuming PERM process when filing for an immigrant visa in the employment-based second preference category.

After the new guidance, O-1A applications rose from 7,710 in FY 2021 to 10,010 in FY 2023, and the approval rate remained above 90%. There is no annual limit on O-1A visas.

Receipts for national interest waiver requests increased by 51% from FY 2021 to FY 2022 (14,610 to 21,990), according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. For FY 2022 to FY 2023, receipts for national interest waiver requests rose by 81%, from 21,990 to 39,810, although the approval rate declined.

Efren Hernandez, until recently a supervisory policy analyst at USCIS and now the founder of EH3 Immigration Consulting, believes DHS may make it harder for individuals to qualify under the employment-based first preference, also known as EB-1. He pointed out in an interview that to demonstrate “extraordinary ability” under the EB-1 category, a green card applicant must “provide evidence of a one-time achievement (i.e., Pulitzer, Oscar, Olympic Medal)” or to meet at least 3 of 10 criteria, such as “evidence of your authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media.” DHS could raise that bar, for example, by requiring an applicant to meet 5 of 10 criteria or not allowing reasonable alternatives in fields that don’t have annual awards or that match the examples USCIS cites.

In recent research, economists Exequiel Hernandez (UPENN Wharton School), Britta Glennon (UPENN and NBER) and Jens Friedmann (Erasmus University Rotterdam School of Management) concluded that the more restrictions a company encounters on hiring foreign-born talent, the more acquisitions it will subsequently make. “In terms of immigration policy, our findings challenge the narrative that constraining immigration creates more opportunities for native workers,” according to the authors. “An acquisition is a very strong, costly commitment—both in terms of the purchase price and in the organizational adjustments required to make such a transaction work. It is unlikely that firms would be responding to immigration restrictions through acquisitions unless the need for the foregone talent were real.”

Exequiel Hernandez said in an interview that the research shows policymakers harm U.S. competitiveness when they restrict high-skilled immigration. “I think the paper is one more drop in the ocean of evidence that high-skilled immigration policy in the U.S. cannot be based on the assumption that there’s a readily available pool of U.S.-born workers firms would hire if we restrict visas for foreign-born workers.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/687dbd442ceeab75a457a29e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-07 17:58:00.892479

As of October 6, 2025, federal courts remain open and are drawing on non-appropriated funds to continue operations. But the federal judiciary has warned that if it exhausts those funds, it may have to reduce operations to essential functions.

The Administrative Office of the US Courts released a statement indicating that existing funds will last until at least October 17. After that, should the shutdown remain in effect, impacts on the judicial system may grow and will likely vary by jurisdiction.

In prior shutdowns, disruptions were kept to a minimum, but that is because most shutdowns did not last significant amounts of time. During the 2018–19 shutdown (the longest in history, at 34 days), courts ultimately shifted to essential-only staffing, which caused additional delays at the district court level.

If this shutdown persists beyond mid-October and courts furlough non-essential staff, civil cases could similarly face broad delays as resources tighten.

For now, most litigants should expect business as usual in the nation’s courthouses, at least in private civil matters. The judiciary has not broadly paused proceedings or deadlines, and the electronic filing system is still operational.

However, parties in civil cases involving the federal government may see efforts from government lawyers to pause proceedings. Government counsel, representing federal agencies and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in civil cases, have been told to seek delays in most matters. It is within a court’s discretion to pause or delay proceedings, and we anticipate that a substantial percentage of such requests will be granted. If a court denies a request for a delay, federal parties will likely comply with that ruling, subject to staffing restraints from the shutdown. The federal government has indicated that it will not seek to delay criminal prosecutions or extraditions.

How courts react to the federal shutdown will vary on a district-by-district, and even judge-by-judge, basis. In the US District Court for the District of Columbia, for example, Chief Judge James Boasberg unilaterally extended all deadlines in civil cases involving government lawyers for the duration of the shutdown given the high volume of cases involving government attorneys.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15361_4613.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:57:59.835582

The move by the Republican administration was widely seen as a strongarm tactic — a way to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, now in the seventh day of a federal shutdown.
While federal workers — as well as service members of the military — have often missed paychecks during past shutdowns, they are most always reimbursed once government reopens.
Instead, the memo says, repaying the federal workers would have to be part of legislation to reopen the government.
The OMB analysis draws on language familiar to budget experts by suggesting that the 2019 bill created an authorization to pay the federal workers, but not the actual appropriation.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration is warning Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been longstanding policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House.

Trump signed legislation into law after the longest government shutdown in 2019 that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.

The move by the Republican administration was widely seen as a strongarm tactic — a way to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, now in the seventh day of a federal shutdown.

“That should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson at a press conference at the Capitol.

Johnson, a lawyer, said he hadn’t fully read the memo but “there are some legal analysts who are saying” that it may not be necessary or appropriate to repay the federal workers.

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington blasted the Trump administration as defying the law.

“Another baseless attempt to try and scare & intimidate workers by an administration run by crooks and cowards,"" said Murray, who is the ranking lawmaker on the Senate Appropriations Committee. “The letter of the law is as plain as can be — federal workers, including furloughed workers, are entitled to their backpay following a shutdown.”

Refusing retroactive pay to the workers, some of whom must remain on the job as essential employees, would be a stark departure from norms and practices, and almost certainly would be met with legal action.

While federal workers — as well as service members of the military — have often missed paychecks during past shutdowns, they are most always reimbursed once government reopens.

In a single-page memo from Trump’s Office of Management and Budget under Russ Vought, first reported by Axios, the office's general counsel seeks to lay out a legal rationale for no backpay of federal workers.

The memo explains that while the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 says workers shall be paid after federal funding is restored, it argues the action is not self-executing. Instead, the memo says, repaying the federal workers would have to be part of legislation to reopen the government.

The OMB analysis draws on language familiar to budget experts by suggesting that the 2019 bill created an authorization to pay the federal workers, but not the actual appropriation.

Congress, it says, is able to decide whether it wants to pay the workers or not.

For now, Congress remains at a standstill, with neither side — nor the White House — appearing willing to budge. Democrats are fighting for health care funds to prevent a lapse in federal subsidies that threaten to send insurance rates skyrocketing. Republicans say the issue can be dealt with later.

A prominent face on the daily Palestinian solidarity demonstrations outside the Bourse, a major city square, Farajalah was arrested three months ago after one such protest and placed in immigration detention, according to activists.

Farajalah’s mother had recently died in Gaza, but he had been denied permission to leave the detention facility to mourn her, according four sources with knowledge of the situation, including Anas Hamam, a Moroccan detainee who had met Farajalah in the “127 Bis” detention center but was transferred to another facility a month ago.

How Farajalah’s mother passed remains unclear.

Hamam told The Intercept by phone, “He was such an incredible person, the kindest and the most thoughtful person who I ever met in that center.”

Around eight Palestinians are thought to have been held in Belgium’s detention camps, according to activists. Many were arrested by plainclothes police officers after Bourse demonstrations.

Last week, Amnesty International called for an investigation into Belgium’s harsh crackdowns on the protesters. Riot police had used tear gas and water cannons on demonstrators in Brussels against Israel’s interdiction of an aid flotilla to Gaza last week.

Belgium’s migration and asylum service confirmed Farajalah’s death, but spokesperson Dominique Ernould declined any further comment citing confidentiality and the privacy of the family.

“The situation is calm in the center,” Ernould said. “The necessary support is being provided to the center’s residents and staff members.”

Asylum Denied

Two sources, including Hamam and a pro-Palestine activist who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said that Farajalah had recently had an asylum claim turned down.

“He didn’t have papers,” the activist said. “Belgium denied him access to international protection.”

As word of Farajalah’s death spread, Palestine solidarity organizers called for a protest of “fire, rage, noise” outside the detention center on Saturday.

“He had lost his mother,” organizers wrote on an Instagram post. “He had asked to be released so he could mourn. He had written. He had pleaded. The administration ignored him. The system crushed him. Silence killed him.”

A group calling itself “Getting the Voice Out” sent The Intercept a statement saying that other detainees in the facility were outraged by the death.

“They are starting a hunger strike at the center and have made a flag with his name on it,” the statement said. “They tell us, ‘Today it’s Mahmoud, tomorrow it’s someone else. Security is laughing at us. We have to do something.’”

Activists and a former detainee at “127 Bis” said people held there were routinely denied phone calls and internet access, among other charges.

Ernould, the migration authority spokesperson, denied claims by activists and Palestinian detainees — one of whom has talked to The Intercept — of mistreatment in the detention camps.

“Residents in closed centers are not mistreated,” she said. “They receive all the necessary care: medical and psychological.

U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is expected to visit the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland on Tuesday. Noem's visit is the latest event in the Trump administration's ongoing push to send National Guard troops into Portland.

Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden strongly condemned Noem's visit.

""Kristi Noem is cosplaying as a public official,"" Wyden said in a statement to KGW. ""In reality, she's been sent by Trump to incite violence. Don't tar and feather her as Speaker Johnson suggested for Governor Newsom. The best response to her playacting as cop? Ignore her and keep supporting the members of our community.""

In a joint statement, the city of Portland and the Portland Police Bureau said they had been notified of Noem's visit, but had not received full details of her agenda.

""In the interest of public safety, Portland Police will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary,"" the city and PPB said in a statement. ""This protects our community, by making sure our roads and public spaces stay safe.""

In a social media post, PPB warned that roads may be impacted ""around the Portland area,"" with possible temporary closures in the South Waterfront. On Tuesday morning, officers blocked off a one-block radius around the ICE facility in South Waterfront to both vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and could be heard on a loudspeaker warning people to back up.

The city and police statement reiterated that under Portland's sanctuary city status, local police will not assist with federal immigration enforcement activities.

""We urge Portlanders to continue to remain safe,"" the city and PPB said. ""Recent court decisions have affirmed that Portland does not need federal military intervention, and that our local public-safety approach stands on firm legal ground.""

The administration has argued that the troops are needed to help protect the ICE office in Portland's South Waterfront neighborhood, where for several months a small group of demonstrators has gathered outside, leading to occasional clashes with federal agents guarding the building. This week, President Donald Trump described the city as a ""burning hellhole."" Local officials have said the administration is grossly exaggerating the scale of the incidents.

Since nightly protests began in June, Portland police have made 37 arrests. The Portland FBI office said it has made 149 arrests, though many have not led to charges.

The creation of this new office restructures and consolidates affirmative litigation into a specialized branch to “hold powerful actors accountable, protect public health and safety, and enforce critical national policies.”

What DOJ Is Changing

The Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch will house two sections:

The Enforcement Section will bring suits under a variety of statutes including the Controlled Substances Act, federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and Federal Trade Commission Act. The stated focus includes protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, defective consumer goods, and false or misleading claims about drugs and dietary supplements.

The Affirmative Litigation Section will bring suits “against states, municipalities, and private entities that interfere with or obstruct federal policies,” with the stated aim of ensuring nationwide compliance with the U.S. Constitution and federal law.

The creation of the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch does not expand the Department’s statutory powers but reframes certain priorities that are likely to receive sustained attention under the current administration. It coincides with the winding down of the Consumer Protection Branch, with its civil affirmative work absorbed into the Enforcement Section, indicating that DOJ intends to centralize certain consumer protection matters.

Identified Priorities: Gender Transition and Immigration

The press release announcing the new Branch expressly identifies two priority areas:

Gender Transition: DOJ notes that the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch will “[protect] women and children” by targeting “pharmaceutical companies, health care providers, and medical associations profiting off of false and misleading claims related to so-called gender transition.”

Immigration: DOJ also highlights that the Branch will focus on ending sanctuary jurisdiction laws, policies, and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.

These priorities track with broader administration initiatives. For example, in Executive Order 14187 (Jan. 28, 2025), the White House directed DOJ to prioritize investigations and actions addressing alleged deception and FDCA violations concerning gender affirming care for minors. Related legislation was introduced in Congress on September 18, 2025. The legislation, H.R. 5483 and S. 2907, would codify Executive Order 14187.

Enforcement Context: Focus on FDA/HHS Actions on Drug Advertising

The DOJ announcement regarding the new Branch arrives alongside a visible pivot by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on pharmaceutical promotion. On September 9, 2025, FDA announced a “crackdown” on deceptive drug advertising, with particular attention to disclosures, social media influencer campaigns, and direct-to-consumer telehealth marketing. The same day, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission issued its Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy, urging increased interagency oversight of DTC advertising—explicitly citing FDA, HHS, FTC, and DOJ.

The DOJ announcement says little about the Affirmative Litigation Section, simply that entities interfering with or obstructing federal policies, or failing to comply with the U.S. Constitution or federal laws, should expect enforcement activity. The emphasis on litigation against states and municipalities indicates that the DOJ is seeking to enforce the administration’s policies nationwide. Whether this litigation will focus on gender transition, immigration, and discrimination, or whether it could be used to compel states to conform in other areas, remains to be seen.

Practical Takeaways for Health Care and Regulated Entities

Expect coordinated scrutiny on advertising and promotion. The creation of the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch aligns with recent FDA/HHS actions earlier this month. Companies should reassess direct-to-consumer and influencer-driven campaigns, promotional claims, and risk disclosures, including those tied to telehealth marketing.

No expansion of statutory powers. The DOJ’s move does not expand statutory powers on its own; rather, it reorganizes how affirmative enforcement is prioritized and executed. The choice to centralize and name specific targets (g., gender transition and sanctuary policies) suggests both a legal and political through line. If pursued vigorously, expect litigation testing federalism boundaries, administrative law theories, and speech-related issues.

False Claims Act (FCA) risk remains elevated. Although the DOJ’s announcement regarding the new Branch does not expressly mention the FCA, its 2025 initiatives make clear that recipients of federal funds (health systems, plans, universities, contractors, and grantees) should assume ongoing emphasis on FCA enforcement, particularly where alleged civil rights or consumer protection issues intersect with federal dollars. DOJ has repeatedly stated that it will deploy the FCA against “entities that receive federal funds but knowingly violate civil rights laws” (June 20 blog post). DOJ also launched the new Civil Rights Fraud Initiative in May (May 22 blog post) and, in July, established an FCA Working Group focused on six priority areas in the health care space (July 3 blog post).

Potential state-federal collision. The Affirmative Litigation Section contemplates suits against states and municipalities that “interfere with or obstruct federal policies,” signaling potential expansion of federal challenges on topics ranging from immigration to health policy implementation.

But she warned that immigration levels were too high, adding that ""if people come in too quickly, it's impossible to integrate"".
Badenoch defended his comments, and said they were made during the bin strike in Birmingham.
In addition to reducing levels of immigration, Badenoch also said the government needed to be ""making sure people understand what our values are"".

The Conservative leader said the UK had ""taken for granted the fact that we have been a fairly cohesive society"" but warned ""things are fragmenting"".

But she warned that immigration levels were too high, adding that ""if people come in too quickly, it's impossible to integrate"".

She also defended remarks made by shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick who said Handsworth in Birmingham was ""one of the worst-integrated places"" he had ever been to.

In a recording reportedly made in March during a dinner and published by the Guardian, the shadow justice secretary said he had not seen ""another white face"" in the hour and a half he spent in Handsworth filming a video about litter.

He went on: ""I want to live in a country where people are properly integrated.

""It's not about the colour of your skin, or your faith, of course it isn't. But I want people to be living alongside each other, not parallel lives.""

Asked about the comments, he told the BBC's Chris Mason: ""There are numerous parts of our country now where the same story is happening, and at the extreme levels, a lack of integration leads us into a very dark place as a country.

""We're here in Manchester today, a week on from a terrible terrorist attack where a man who lived in our country for 30 years clearly wasn't well integrated, clearly didn't share British values because he went on to murder British Jews.""

His earlier comments have provoked criticism from opposition politicians.

Badenoch defended his comments, and said they were made during the bin strike in Birmingham.

""Rubbish piled up in the streets and what were the politicians focusing on - airports in Pakistan and Gaza,"" she said.

""We need people to have their eyes focused on what is going on in this country.""

Badenoch told the BBC's political editor Chris Mason that immigration was something her party ""got wrong"" in government and that was why she was coming up with ""tougher"" policies including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights and a plan to deport 750,000 illegal immigrants in five years.

In addition to reducing levels of immigration, Badenoch also said the government needed to be ""making sure people understand what our values are"".

In a friend-of-the-court brief filed on Monday, the media coalition highlights the threat posed by the White House’s decision earlier this year to exclude the AP from covering certain White House events after the news service chose not to follow President Trump’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico. The brief asks the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to affirm a lower-court ruling in favor of the AP, emphasizing the White House press pool’s historic function as an “independent chronicler of the presidency” that is essential to the free flow of information to the public about the nation’s highest office.

The White House presumably hopes that “under threat of retaliatory ejection, questioning will be friendlier — that outlets will face pressure to pull their punches, to gloss over mistakes or unartful remarks, to avoid pressing for answers,” the brief argues. “And were it to succeed, the core function of the pool — to offer a complete, candid record of the presidency — would atrophy.”

The brief is the latest showing of broad support for the AP among news and media organizations. In February, the Reporters Committee led a media coalition of more than 30 news organizations in sending a letter to the White House, which noted that “[a]ll news organizations covering the White House are negatively affected when one peer outlet is singled out in a manner that crosses a constitutional line.”

The Reporters Committee then filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the AP after the news service sued the White House in federal district court. In April, U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden sided with the news service and ordered the White House to re-admit AP journalists into the pool.

“[U]nder the First Amendment, if the Government opens its doors to some journalists — be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere — it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints,” Judge McFadden wrote in his 41-page order. “The Constitution requires no less.”

That order has been stayed by the D.C. Circuit while the Trump administration’s full appeal is taken up by the appeals court.

The government has made clear that it will not restore refugee family reunion rights in its previous form and has indicated that the current path to settlement for refugees may also be under threat.

This statement followed hot on the heels of an announcement by the Home Secretary of the introduction of a new “contribution-based settlement model” for those in the immigration system. There is not much new in the announcement which was trailed in the immigration white paper a few months ago. The lack of detail has caused a huge amount of concern with those potentially affected, in particular because the government continues to provide mixed messages about whether or not any changes will apply to those already here.

Last week the inquest into the death of Leonard Farruku on the Bibby Stockholm concluded that the move to the barge was not the reason for his death. However, unsurprisingly to those with any experience of Home Office safeguarding, the coroner also identified failings including a total lack of response by the Home Office to an email from Clearsprings raising urgent concerns about Mr Farruku’s mental health.

On Free Movement, in today’s post Ross Kennedy looks at the doubling in sponsor licence revocations over the past year and sets out what immigration lawyers need to understand about enforcement in this context. Last week we updated our briefing on Hamid hearings, to include some up to date examples including the recent case of the barrister who misused AI in an immigration appeal.

There were also case write ups including a successful challenge to certification of a human rights claim of a gay Indian man, meaning he will now be able to appeal the refusal. In another case, a grandmother deported from the UK over 20 years ago, whose family live in the UK, has lost her challenge to the refusal to revoke her deportation order.

Despite the short length of the court’s earlier order, “there was no need for speculation” about its reasons, Sauer claimed.
To Barrett, emergency docket decisions are rushed.
In another short decision in this case, the justices signaled that their emergency docket orders do sometimes control later stages of a dispute.
Justices Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the government’s request.","Immigration Matters is a recurring series by César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández that analyzes the court’s immigration docket, highlighting emerging legal questions about new policy and enforcement practices.

As the Supreme Court uses its emergency docket more frequently in disputes over high-profile policies, tension over the effect of decisions issued from that fast-paced process is brewing in public. Ten days after Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Sonia Sotomayor publicly described the emergency docket’s limitations, the Justice Department took to the emergency docket in Noem v. National TPS Alliance to ask the court to treat a three-paragraph order as binding in a case over Biden-era legal protection from deportation for Venezuelans that the Trump administration is trying to end. On Friday, the court sided with the government.

Unlike cases that reach the court’s merits docket, which involve lengthy fact-finding and legal argumentation over years, emergency docket cases move relatively quickly. Often, the court issues a decision within months of the lawsuit being filed in a federal district court. Most emergency docket decisions are short pronouncements. Since they often focus on a specific procedural matter, it isn’t unusual for the justices to recycle sentences and fail to explain their reasoning.

Issuing a decision quickly is valuable, but it comes at a cost. Last month, Barrett explained the downside of the emergency docket’s truncated decision-making process. “There’s no opportunity for percolation” of legal arguments in the lower courts, she told Sarah Isgur from SCOTUSblog and David French of The New York Times in an interview on the Advisory Opinions podcast (published by The Dispatch, which owns SCOTUSblog). “We might be writing sooner than we want to be or with less information than we want to be,” Barrett added. To get a decision out quickly, the justices can’t hear multiple perspectives on the legal issues as they normally do for cases on the court’s merits docket. “You don’t have the time to go back and forth if you’re actually going to dispose of these things quickly,” Barrett explained.

Appearing on Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show” in early September, Sotomayor explained the importance of written opinions, which certainly applies in the context of the emergency docket. Sotomayor noted that persuasion is the court’s only weapon, and written opinions are how the court tries to persuade the public. “We don’t have the power of the purse, so we can’t threaten people with money. We don’t have an army,” she said. “We have the power of persuasion and so we write in the hopes of convincing all of you, the public, that there’s a reason for why we’re ruling the way we are.”

After the justices issue their written opinions, Barrett and Sotomayor have each suggested that the public needs to do its part to inform itself. “Read the opinion,” Barrett said in 2022. Echoing her last month, Sotomayor stated, “read the decisions.” Responding to Colbert’s questions, Sotomayor said that orders in which the justices don’t provide their reasoning don’t have the same effect as decisions in which the justices explain themselves. When the court doesn’t explain its reasoning, an emergency docket order “doesn’t control,” Sotomayor said.

Recent litigation over legal protections for citizens of Venezuela illustrates the emergency docket’s speed and the lack of explanation in its rulings. In National TPS Alliance v. Noem, a group of Venezuelans who had been granted Temporary Protected Status, along with an organization that advocates on behalf of TPS recipients, sued Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on Feb. 19, claiming that she failed to follow the required procedures to terminate their legal authorization to live in the United States.

A federal district court agreed on March 31, concluding that Noem likely violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution’s equal protection clause. After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit refused, less than a month later, to put the district court’s order on hold while the government appealed, the Justice Department turned to the emergency docket on May 1 to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. Three months after the lawsuit began, on May 19, the justices granted the government’s request, pausing the district court’s order.

As is common in emergency docket decisions, the justices did not explain why they put the lower court’s order on hold. The court’s decision includes six sentences spread across three paragraphs. One of those paragraphs consists of a single sentence noting that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson disagreed with her colleagues, but it does not say why. Another paragraph consists of four sentences, three of which describe the process by which the case reached the court’s emergency docket or the process that will follow. This generic process explanation is identical to statements made in other emergency docket orders.

Only the remaining paragraph, which consists of one sentence, refers to the specific legal issue at stake in the case. Even then, the justices don’t address their reasoning. The justices noted that their order shouldn’t “prejudice” any legal challenge to Noem’s attempt to strip Venezuelans of work permits and legal authorization to continue living in the United States. Except for Jackson, we can’t even be sure whether all the justices voted with the majority.

Since the Supreme Court issued its decision in May, the legal fight over TPS has returned to the lower federal courts. In a 69-page opinion issued in September, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen noted that the Supreme Court “did not provide any specific rationale for its decision” but did permit the legal challenge over the required procedure to move forward. For that reason, Chen described in detail Noem’s decision-making process, then concluded that she failed to comply with federal law. Chen ordered Noem to postpone the decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined the government’s request to pause Chen’s order, prompting the Justice Department to again request intervention by the Supreme Court.

In its ongoing legal fight to end TPS for Venezuelans, the Justice Department prompted the justices to downplay Barrett’s worry about the front end of the emergency docket process and disagree with Sotomayor’s claim about its future impact. Since the court had already blocked implementation of the lower court’s decision once, it should do so again, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the government’s most recent request to the Supreme Court in this case. Despite the short length of the court’s earlier order, “there was no need for speculation” about its reasons, Sauer claimed. The justices “evidently concluded that the government was likely to succeed,” he added. For that reason, the court’s prior order “squarely controlled” the current round of litigation, Sauer wrote. The 9th Circuit’s refusal to stay Chen’s September order was “indefensible” and a “needless afront to stare decisis,” the principle that courts should follow earlier rulings about similar legal issues, Sauer added.

Sauer’s application to stay Chen’s order invited the justices to clarify what to make of the typical emergency docket decision. Should lower courts and lawyers assume that decisions are meant to have lasting impact even if they number no more than a handful of sentences? To Barrett, emergency docket decisions are rushed. To Sotomayor, decisions in which the justices don’t explain their reasoning, as is true in National TPS Alliance, should have limited influence on future legal proceedings.

In another short decision in this case, the justices signaled that their emergency docket orders do sometimes control later stages of a dispute. The majority decision, released late Friday, numbers three paragraphs, most of which recite basic facts about the process this case has followed. In two sentences of one three-sentence paragraph, the majority announced that they see little difference in the strength of arguments made by the parties now and in May. Since “the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not” changed, the majority announced, “[t]he same result that we reached in May is appropriate here.” They did not explain why.

As is common in emergency docket cases, the majority opinion is unsigned. Justices Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the government’s request. Writing for herself, Jackson lamented the majority’s willingness to use its power to contradict “reasoned and thoughtful written opinions” by lower court judges while failing to write an opinion explaining themselves. Neither Sotomayor nor Kagan explained their reasoning.

Having agreed with the Justice Department despite the concerns that Sotomayor and Barrett raised, the court has once again put lower courts and lawyers in a position to attempt to divine meaning out of sparse text. And instead of reading thoughtful reasoning, as Barrett and Sotomayor implore, it has left ordinary people to read the judicial equivalent of tea leaves. Neither is likely to help courts, lawyers, or the public make sense of why the court does what it does.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 11:58:05.904707

Who controls the National Guard?
The National Guard serves in three types of capacities.
""As soon as the federalized National Guard deploys to Portland, the state of Oregon will suffer an injury to its sovereignty,"" she wrote Saturday in her order.
It's unclear how a federal judge in Illinois will rule regarding the Trump administration's effort to deploy guard members there.","President Trump is bucking tradition and legal precedent in pushing to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-led cities such as Portland, Ore., and Chicago due to what he says is rampant crime and to support his crackdown on illegal immigration.

On Monday, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to the state — arguing that the administration has exceeded its authority under Title 10, the statute that allows the president to bring the guard into federal service.

Legal experts say Trump is testing the limits of presidential authority by using the rarely used statute to deploy federal troops to American cities without state approval. And the legal tactic is getting mixed results in federal court.

Oregon and Portland officials successfully delayed efforts to send troops there. But by Monday evening, a federal judge in Illinois declined the request to immediately block the deployment.

Portland and Chicago are just two of the latest cities where Trump has threatened to send troops. He sent hundreds of troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., over the summer and the National Guard has also been ordered to Memphis — a move supported by Tennessee's Republican governor.

Who controls the National Guard?

The National Guard serves in three types of capacities.

""State active duty"" is when troops are under state command and state funded. Title 32 — which is how the guard is being deployed in Memphis — is when troops are under state command but federally funded. Then, there's Title 10, which is when guard members are both federally controlled and funded.

According to the provision, the president can deploy the National Guard into federal service when the county is under an invasion, a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or the president is unable with the ""regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.""

In federal court, the Trump administration has claimed that it is unable to ""execute the laws of the United States"" as it relates to immigration enforcement due to protests in these cities.

""This law hasn't been used in this way before, by any previous president,"" said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.

Generally, the National Guard has been federalized and deployed domestically to respond to civil unrest in extreme circumstances, where state and local law enforcement were completely overwhelmed, Goitein said.

Critics of the troop deployments argue that the situations in Portland and Chicago do not rise to the level of a rebellion. They also say that for troops to be federalized, their governor of each state still needs to approve a Title 10 order.

Goitein said, ""It's not about whether the federal government should have this authority at all. It's about whether the federal government should be able to use these authorities based on what really appear to be completely contrived claims about the situation on the ground.""

Could Trump use the Insurrection Act?

One way that a sitting president has deployed the guard domestically without a state's consent was through the Insurrection Act — a set of laws meant to address major civil unrest. It also allows federal troops to take part in law enforcement activities like searches and arrests.

It's only been invoked a handful of times in U.S. history, with the last instance being over 30 years ago during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

""For better or for worse, I think the insurrection Act has been a third rail politically for much of its history,"" said Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center.

In his second term, Trump has floated the idea of using the Insurrection Act. On Monday, when asked by a reporter under what circumstances he would invoke it, Trump said, ""If people were being killed and courts were holding us or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure I'd do that.""

Vladeck doesn't think Trump invoking the law is out of the question. He said, ""I think that the administration understands that that would be an even more dramatic escalation.""

How are courts responding?

For the most part, federal judges in California and Oregon have expressed wariness and skepticism over the troop deployments.

In California, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer, who has presided over the state's challenge to the guard deployment, strongly criticized the Trump administration over the move, calling it illegal and asserting that federal officials did not follow proper protocol for federalizing troops.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California, however, has previously argued that ""a great level of deference"" had to be given to the president's assessment that a situation required military intervention.

In Oregon, after temporarily blocking the federalization of the state's National Guard members, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the facts just could not be supported that a military intervention was needed — even if deference was given.

""As soon as the federalized National Guard deploys to Portland, the state of Oregon will suffer an injury to its sovereignty,"" she wrote Saturday in her order.

It's unclear how a federal judge in Illinois will rule regarding the Trump administration's effort to deploy guard members there. On Monday, U.S. District Judge April Perry declined to immediately block a troop deployment and gave the administration until the end of Wednesday to respond to the lawsuit filed by state and city officials.

Vladeck believes it will be up to the courts to check presidential authority on this issue.

And, he said, ""sooner or later"" the Supreme Court will have to weigh in on what circumstances support military intervention in American cities.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2250+0+209/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdc%2F85%2Fe6a5a9f0439d96e684ea464234ff%2Fgettyimages-2218877782.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:57:00.177950

The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is challenging a Michigan Court of Appeals decision from last year that dismissed its case because the deadline to file had passed.

The lawsuit says the state has been improperly denying injured worker benefits to people without legal status.

“If we want work conditions that are dignified, fair and healthy, we must ensure that workers’ compensation system is administered as intended to protect all workers,” said MIRC attorney Anna Hill Galendez. “The reality is many employers gladly hire workers who don’t have work permits because they can pay them less and get away with more.”

Part of MIRC’s case is the not-for-profit law firm must continue to expend resources filing workers' compensation lawsuits against the state.

Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s administration argues there was a one-year window to file a lawsuit or a notification that one was on the way and the plaintiffs missed that deadline. It argued in its brief asking the Supreme Court to refuse the case that it was complying with the law.

In September, Prime Minster Salam said that “the children of Lebanon, regardless of origin or circumstance, must never be deprived of their right to learn.” Both have emphasized that education is a national priority needed to revitalize the country.

But in a disappointing move, on September 30, the government restricted access to education for many refugees. It continued last year’s mandate requiring that non-Lebanese students show valid residency permits or a valid ID issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in order to register for “second shift” classes in Lebanon’s public schools for the 2025-2026 school year. Generally, Palestinian refugee children, including those from Syria, attend UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) schools rather than public schools.

According to a spokesperson from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), last year at least 28,000 non-Lebanese children were effectively barred from public education because of the legal residency requirement.

Portland's protests have tended to be smaller and more focused on one specific ICE facility in the southern part of the city, though groups of several hundred gathered occasionally. At times, these demonstrators have used barricades, caused property damage, set small fires, and clashed with federal officers. There has been occasional violence that has led to multiple arrests.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have arrested a slew of Chicago’s ""worst-of-the-worst"" offenders, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Monday.

The statement came as violence and unrest engulfed parts of the city which is suffering from mounting street violence and protests against federal operations.

The DHS statement, titled ""Despite Multiple Vehicle Attacks by Domestic Terrorists, DHS Law Enforcement Arrests Worst of Worst"" listed several suspects taken into custody.

Among them was Wilmer Alexander Gonzalez Garaban, an alleged member of Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang with a criminal history of theft and resisting an officer.

Ricardo Gervasio-Gervasio was included as a repeat offender convicted of drug crimes and DUI.

Jorge Mario Ramirez-Lopez, a criminal illegal immigrant from Guatemala, was also listed and has a conviction for larceny.

Ricardo Gervasio-Gervasio, from Mexico, who has convictions for cocaine possession, driving under the influence of liquor and dangerous drugs was also referenced.

Officials cited other individuals who were apprehended for assault, fraud, illegal reentry, and aggravated assault.

Secretary Kristi Noem praised agents and officers' persistence in the statement and said their efforts were despite violent resistance.

""We will not let violence by domestic terrorists and lawless rioters in Chicago slow us down from fulfilling the President’s mandate to arrest the worst of the worst,"" Noem declared.

DHS claims that Operation Midway Blitz, launched in early September, has already led to over 1,000 arrests statewide, representing a major escalation in federal enforcement.

One of the most dramatic incidents occurred on October 4 in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood, where agents were reportedly surrounded by several vehicles, one of which rammed a federal car.

Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.

His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump’s aggressive use of the National Guard.

At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump’s use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.

“What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. “Will he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?”

An expanding role for the National Guard not seen before

Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump’s attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Control over a state’s National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor’s objections. Otherwise, it’s up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.

Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He’s called Portland “war ravaged” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.”

However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America’s long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.

Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I’d do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” He added: “We have to make sure our cities are safe.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America’s cities safer.

″You guys are framing this like, ‘The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,’” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.”

U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.

While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it’s typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.

One result is that governors like California’s Gavin Newsom and Illinois’ JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.

The situation is far different from President John F. Kennedy’s move to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama in a standoff with Gov. George Wallace. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security.

The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. “So it’s more symbolic than helpful.”

Legal challenges set up a clash over Trump’s deployments

Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge’s decision to block the deployment in Portland.

Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it’s the courts that have ignored constitutional limits.

“A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump’s immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.”

Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump’s orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.

Trump’s opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power.

With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm.

“The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. “That’s our backstop. That’s what we have in the United States to keep our democracy on the rails.”

Trump’s attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon is a “clear violation of the law” and a flagrant attempt to circumvent the judge’s weekend ruling, according to Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on presidential powers.

Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

“What the military is trained to do is to fight and destroy enemies of the United States. The president of the United States wants soldiers to practice this battle training in the streets of American cities,” she wrote on a social media.",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/trump-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:57:52.542865

The mayor said the order is needed to balance the constitutional rights of protesters with the needs of Broadview residents and businesses.
Protests outside the ICE facility have repeatedly grown heated, with ICE agents firing projectiles and using tear gas at times.
Illinois and Cook County officials said they have set up a temporary unified command to coordinate public safety efforts outside the ICE facility in Broadview.
Crews installed new concrete barriers Thursday night establishing the designated protest zones and restricted area outside the ICE facility.","Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson on Monday announced an executive order setting fixed protest hours outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in the village in Chicago's west suburbs.

Thompson's order limits protests outside the ICE facility at 1930 Beach Street and the designated protest area at 2000 S. 25th Av. to between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

According to the order, the mayor decided to set a limit on protest times ""due to the recent escalation of violence by ICE"" outside the facility, including ""needlessly deploying tear gas, pepper spray, mace, and rubber bullets at individuals and reporters, thereby injuring Village residents, Village police officers, and Village firefighters.""

The mayor said the order is needed to balance the constitutional rights of protesters with the needs of Broadview residents and businesses.

""People have to go to work, they have to get their children ready for school, our businesses have to serve their customers, and our residents with developmental disabilities, who have sensory issues, have suffered emotional meltdowns because of the chaotic environment when protests get disruptive,"" said Thompson. ""I have repeatedly said that I intend to defend the protesters' constitutionally protected free speech rights. I support their cause. But the repeated clashes with ICE agents in our town are causing enormous disruptions in the quality of life for my residents whose rights I have taken an oath to protect. We live here. Our residents live here and deserve dignity and respect.""

CBS News Chicago legal analyst Irv Miller predicted, if the mayor's order faces a court challenge, it would be ruled unconstitutional.

""The First Amendment doesn't say it can only be done during business hours, and I think that that order will be struck down by a judge somewhere along the line, because it's clearly unconstitutional,"" he said.

Protests outside the ICE facility have repeatedly grown heated, with ICE agents firing projectiles and using tear gas at times.

Tensions between protesters and ICE agents have escalated multiple times in recent weeks. The majority of those clashes have taken place in the streets outside the ICE vehicles have been leaving or arriving at the facility, and protesters have tried to block their path.

On Thursday, state and local officials established a designated protest zone outside the ICE facility.

Illinois and Cook County officials said they have set up a temporary unified command to coordinate public safety efforts outside the ICE facility in Broadview.

Illinois State Police, the Cook County Sheriff's Office, the Cook County Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency have set up designated areas for protesters outside the facility, while leaving the street open for vehicles.

Crews installed new concrete barriers Thursday night establishing the designated protest zones and restricted area outside the ICE facility.

""The goal of the Unified Command is to protect the health and safety of all individuals, including nearby Broadview residents and businesses, and enable the peaceful expression of First Amendment rights. The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law,"" Illinois State Police said.

Thompson said that, on Saturday night, a ""very aggressive crowd of protesters"" got out of control, and shut down 25th Avenue outside the ICE facility, and tried to block the nearby Eisenhower Expressway as well.

""We had over 60 state troopers helping and we had to seek additional assistance from other local police departments who rushed to Broadview to help. And Broadview residents had to suffer through that mayhem,"" Thompson said.

Demonstrators and residents express concerns over limited protest times during village board meeting

During a village board meeting on Monday evening, protestors and residents voiced their concerns, saying the order to protest between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. infringes on First Amendment rights. The mayor fired back, saying this is needed to help people who live in Broadview feel safe and return to some sort of normalcy.

""This order, while well-intentioned, goes too far,"" Anjali said. ""It silences working residents that can only gather after 6 p.m.""

Some say that it is not free speech, but Mayor Thompson said that's not her intention.

""Let me be clear, I will always support the First Amendment and right of people to peacefully protest, but as Mayor I must also balance the right with the safety and well-being of Broadview residents and the businesses.""

At the meeting, Thompson also addressed the video showing Secretary Kristi Noem attempting to use the village hall bathroom on Friday before she was turned away.

""Let me be clear. I've never known an individual to bring a videographer and a photographer to a bathroom break,"" she said.

Thompson said there must be an urgent public health matter inside the Broadview facility. She now wants authorities to check on the people and plumbing inside.

""I am calling on all federal elected congressional officials, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, to inspect the facility immediately.""

As for the nine-hour time limit for protestors, Thompson said the village needs this as they do not have the resources to pay first responders' overtime.

She's not sure if protestors will abide by the order, but she says police will follow protocols.

""It's not in their community. When they leave Broadview, guess where they get to go back, to a safe, calm environment,"" Thompson said.

There will be a hearing in federal court on Tuesday morning, where the village is fighting to get the fence down around the ICE facility that was put up a couple of weeks ago to keep protestors back.

The detainee, Willian Alberto Giménez González, has been active at St. Paul and the Redeemer Episcopal Church on Chicago’s South Side since Fall 2023. The church is hosting a prayer vigil Oct. 7 for González – and for all “our immigrant neighbors” – as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conduct raids and detain residents across the Chicago area.

“We believe that Willian’s detention is unjust, and that his immediate release would benefit not just Willian and his family but also our community and our country,” St. Paul and the Redeemer said in a written statement, which noted that González is an asylum-seeker who had recently received a work permit. “Yet ICE arrested him anyway and quickly moved him across state lines.”

González was taken into custody Sept. 12 during an ICE traffic stop. His attorney told an American Prospect reporter that González, at the time of the incident, was taking his wife to get a haircut in a largely Latino neighborhood southwest of downtown Chicago. After being held briefly at an ICE facility in suburban Chicago, he was taken to a different ICE facility in Baldwin, Michigan, north of Grand Rapids.

“ICE is circumventing laws and processes to create terror in communities of people seeking a better life, and we are joining with Christians and others who feel spiritually compelled to call for justice and mercy,” St. Paul and the Redeemer said in its statement.

ICE has taken an increasingly aggressive approach toward immigration enforcement in Chicago, the United States’ third largest city, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to ramp up arrests and deportations and fulfill a campaign promise of sharply reducing both legal and illegal immigration.

Early last month, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was launching a major immigrant enforcement action in Chicago that it dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.” Since then, local officials, Democratic state legislators, immigrant advocates and residents have accused the Trump administration of heavy-handed tactics that have sometimes involved detentions of people with no criminal records or immigration violations.

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested in Chicago in the past month, including 37 on Sept. 30 in an early-morning ICE raid that targeted one apartment building on Chicago’s South Side. Residents reported fearing they were under siege by a military-style operation. Agents reportedly landed on the building from helicopters, then went door to door making arrests.

President Donald Trump has vowed to further escalate the crackdown by sending troops, including the Texas National Guard, into Chicago and other Democrat-led cities, saying reinforcements are needed to protect federal property and employees. After federal agents shot and injured a woman in Chicago on Oct. 4, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Chicago a “war zone.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has accused the Trump administration of manufacturing a crisis and then making it worse. The ICE agents in Chicago were indiscriminately “picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials,” Pritzker said in an Oct. 5 interview with CNN. “They are the ones that are making it a war zone.”

The Diocese of Chicago has been active in helping immigrant communities and their supporters across northern Illinois respond to the presence of ICE and threats of arrest. A statement released Sept. 10 by a group of diocesan ministry leaders affirmed that Episcopalians in Chicago were “standing in solidarity with immigrants and asylum-seekers.”

“We urge all diocesan churches, clergy, and laity to get involved as we redouble our efforts to welcome the stranger, protect the vulnerable and respect the dignity of every human being,” they said. They referenced an earlier pastoral letter from Chicago Bishop Paula Clark calling on Episcopalians to support “our immigrant siblings.”

“Anxiety and apprehension are rampant in our communities, especially those of people of color, who are affected by these threats. People are afraid to go to church, the grocery store, or even to work,” Clark said in her Aug. 1 letter. “This is not merely about immigration – it is about justice, dignity, and the soul of our diocese.”

The diocese has invited all members to join the prayer vigil at St. Paul and the Redeemer, which starts at 7 p.m. Oct. 7, in support of immigrants like González, the parishioner being held by ICE in Michigan.

González “is a faithful participant in our worship and gives financially to the church every week. He has helped cultivate the earth in our food garden and shared dinners in our homes. We pray and sing together,” the congregation said in its written statement protesting his detention. “Every Sunday we receive the sacrament of Holy Communion together recognizing that we are God’s beloved children created in God’s image, and all have a place at God’s Table.”

The National Day Laborer Organizing Network has raised $5,800 to support González through a GoFundMe campaign. The Diocese of Chicago also worked with the Diocese of the Great Lakes in Michigan to arrange for González to receive a pastoral visit with a priest at the facility.

His next immigration court date is Oct. 8.

“I find myself surprised by all you have done to support me,” González said in a written statement released by the diocese. “It fills me up with hope and I ask God to help me get out of this place. I’m grateful to the church, from the bottom of my heart.”",https://i0.wp.com/episcopalnewsservice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ENS_100625_Chicago.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-07 10:56:42.388181

So far, Congress’s Republican leaders have refused to negotiate over their demands until government funding is restored.
“We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things,” Trump told reporters.
Several recent polls have shown Democrats with a narrow edge in the public’s opinion of a shutdown.
Johnson reiterated that he would not call the chamber back into session until government funding is restored.","The US government shutdown entered its second week as the Senate again rejected rival bills to restart funding and Donald Trump suggested he might be open to negotiating with Democrats over the healthcare subsidies they have put at the heart of the stalemate.

A fifth Senate vote to advance a Republican-written bill that would reopen the government failed on a 52-42 tally – well below the 60-vote threshold needed for advancement. The Democrats’ proposal was defeated in a 50-45 party-line vote. No lawmakers changed their votes from recent days, though there were a handful of absences.

Many agencies and departments closed their doors and told employees to stay home last Wednesday, after Congress failed to approve legislation to continue the government’s authority to spend money. The Trump administration warned it was prepared to move forward with plans to slash the federal workforce.

“After five failed votes, Republicans should understand that they cannot go forward unless we come to a bipartisan agreement to address the healthcare crisis,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement after the afternoon votes.

Democrats have refused to back any bill that does not include an array of healthcare-centered concessions, among them, an extension of premium tax credits for people covered by Affordable Care Act health insurance. So far, Congress’s Republican leaders have refused to negotiate over their demands until government funding is restored.

But Trump, speaking from the Oval Office on Monday, said he might be willing to strike a deal with Democrats on the ACA subsidies, though he also echoed the conservative claim that “billions and billions” of dollars are being wasted.

“We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things,” Trump told reporters. “And I’m talking about good things with regard to health care.”

Schumer denied any outreach from the president, and the top House Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries, said the White House has been “radio silent” since a meeting with the president last week.

“Trump’s claim isn’t true – but if he’s finally ready to work with Democrats, we’ll be at the table,” Schumer said in a statement. “For months, Democrats have been calling on Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to come to the table and work with us to deliver lower costs and better healthcare for the American people.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that if the shutdown stretched on, a program thats pays for food for low-income mothers and children would exhaust its funding, while government employees would miss a paycheck, though federal law entitles them to back pay. She also reiterated the Trump administration’s threats to fire federal workers.

“We don’t want to see people laid off. But, unfortunately, if this shutdown continues, layoffs are going to be an unfortunate consequence of that,” Leavitt said.

In the days since the shut down began, Russ Vought, the director of the White House office of management and budget, has cancelled funding for energy projects in several states, as well as transportations developments in Chicago and New York – all of which are areas governed by Democrats.

But though he warned before funding lapsed that he would use it as an opportunity to deepen cuts to the federal workforce, those have largely not yet taken place.

Asked about when layoffs may be announced, Leavitt replied: “We’ll see how the vote goes tonight.”

Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress have shown no signs of budging from their demands in the days since the shutdown began. Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House on recess for a second straight week, in a bid to pressure Senate Democrats to provide the roughly eight votes the Republican funding bill is expected to need to advance in the upper chamber.

“The ball is in the court of the Senate Democrats. There’s only a handful of people in the country who can solve this problem,” Johnson told a press conference.

The Democratic minority has largely stuck to their demands that any legislation to fund the government includes an extension of the ACA tax credits. Created under Joe Biden, the credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and costs for 20 million enrollees of the plans will rise if they are not extended.

The party has also included in their funding bill a reversal of the Republican cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance to the poor and disabled, as well as a restoration of funding for public media outlets like PBS and NPR, and a prohibition on Donald Trump’s use of a “pocket rescission” to undo congressional appropriations.

Senate’s Republican majority leader John Thune has vowed to continue holding votes on the parties’ bills. No Republicans have supported the Democratic proposal, while only three members of the minority – John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King of Maine – have backed the GOP bill.

Several recent polls have shown Democrats with a narrow edge in the public’s opinion of a shutdown. A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll found that 53% of respondents held the GOP responsible for the shutdown, as opposed to 47% who blamed the Democrats. Seventy percent of those surveyed opposed the shutdown overall.

Johnson reiterated that he would not call the chamber back into session until government funding is restored. He has also said he will only swear in newly elected Democratic representative Adelita Grijalva once the House returns to work.

Grijalva is set to be the 218th lawmaker to sign a petition that will force a vote on a bill to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson and Trump oppose releasing the files, and Thomas Massie, an iconoclastic Republican representative who has led the charge to make the documents public, accused Johnson of keeping the House out of session to delay that vote.

“Why are we in recess? Because the day we go back into session, I have 218 votes for the discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files,” Massie said, adding that Johnson “doesn’t want that to be the news”.

""Children were not specifically targeted — they were considered lower priority for enforcement removal because of their age,"" DeCosmo said.","Gina DeCosmo and Jeffery DeCristofaro say the mood is tense in Camden, New Jersey, for many of the families they represent.

""This is something that popped up mid-to-late last week,"" DeCosmo said. ""So those letters could be arriving this week or next.""

They say their concern comes as word that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is allegedly sending letters to teenagers about returning to their home countries.

The staff at Camden Center for Law and Social Justice writes that the ICE notifications, which they say the community has labeled ""Freaky Friday Letters,"" might contain financial offers or strong and threatening language.

""They started being given to youth already in immigration detention starting last Tuesday or Wednesday. They may actually be mailed out now,"" DeCristofaro said.

CBS News Philadelphia also obtained a letter from the Camden School District. Officials there are trying to clear up confusion, recommending families still send their children to school, and in the event they receive a letter from ICE, consult a trusted adult, an advocate or a lawyer.

""Now they're going to be getting letters saying we want you to give up these protections and return home, and those will be frightening for these kids,"" DeCristofaro said.

Attorneys say they haven't seen one of the letters yet. CBS News Philadelphia reached out to a spokesperson for ICE. They responded in part, ""These allegations are categorically false. The anti-ICE activists have made up a ridiculous term, 'Freaky Friday,' to instill fear and spread misinformation.""

The agency went on to explain it is, in fact, offering a voluntary option for unaccompanied children, it says, who were smuggled into the country to return home to their families. CBS News Philadelphia has learned the offer will be made first to 17-year-olds.

ICE says this will allow them to make an informed decision about their future. ICE added any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin.

But staff at the Camden public interest law firm responded that in the statement from ICE, the agency doesn't dispute they're reaching out to those under 18 with an offer.

Members of the law firm explained that this appears to mark a policy change.

Durbin lamented National Guard members being “used as political pawns for the political theater of President Trump,” adding to CNN he believes their deployment isn’t necessary for law and order in his home state of Illinois.

The senator also pointed to the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 federal law prohibiting the use of the US military for domestic law enforcement without explicit congressional authorization.

“These men and women in the guard are not trained in law enforcement, because the law does not allow them,” he told John Berman on “CNN News Central.” “Is not fair to them. It’s certainly not fair to the legitimate law enforcement in our state.”

>> What is the Insurrection Act?

The role of local law enforcement is to protect peaceful protesters and their First Amendment rights by “standing between” them and federal officers, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker suggested, “so that ICE and CBP are not firing at them and that we’re doing our best to protect them.”

Federal agents “are creating an environment in which they’re inciting people to do something more than just peacefully protest,” the Democratic governor said Monday during a news conference in his state’s most populous city.

At the request of police in suburban Broadview – where an ICE facility has drawn protests for weeks – and with the help of the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, the state “sent backup” to protect protesters and residents “who have had ICE and CBP operating in their neighborhoods in an aggressive fashion and interfering with their daily lives,” Pritzker said.

Forty local governments and many of their leaders are asking a federal appeals court to keep National Guard troops out of Portland as the panel decides whether to block a lower court’s order.

On Saturday, District County Judge Karin Immergut blocked the Trump administration from federalizing the Oregon National Guard and sending troops to a Portland immigration facility that has been the site of protests for months.

When the administration responded by trying to move active-duty California National Guard troops to Portland, Immergut expanded her order to prohibit any National Guard deployment in Oregon for two weeks.

Included in the list of officials who signed the amicus brief is Steve Mulroy, the District Attorney of Shelby County, Tennessee. His district includes Memphis, where the Trump administration launched a crime task force of federal law enforcement agents alongside members of the Tennessee National Guard deployed by Republican Gov. Bill Lee.

As of Saturday, 227 arrests had been made by that task force, according to US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Local prosecutors will struggle to handle the surge in cases, Mulroy said, telling CNN affiliate WMC that the county needs an immediate funding increase to pay for more court hearings.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Monday blasted the Trump administration for orchestrating a “military-style raid” in Chicago last week, making the argument that the Trump administration uses military assets as “political props.”

The governor pointed to an ICE raid in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, where Black Hawk helicopters and swarms of federal agents in full tactical gear descended on an apartment building.

“In the dead of night and seemingly for the cameras, armed federal agents emerged from the Black Hawk helicopters rappelling onto the roof of that apartment building,” Pritzker said during a news conference, claiming the operation was filmed with high-definition cameras and later posted on social media by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The governor tied the raid to what he described as a broader strategy by the Trump administration to “cause chaos, create fear and confusion, make it seem like peaceful protesters are a mob by firing gas pellets and tear gas canisters at them.”

Pritzker delivered the comments hours after his state and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit to block the deployment of federalized National Guard troops. The governor alleged during the news conference that the Trump administration’s strategy is meant to “create the pretext” for sending troops to the city.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement disputing Pritzker’s claims, accusing him of spreading “hateful rhetoric” and failing to protect law enforcement in Chicago.

“President Trump has the authority under the Constitution to deploy troops, wherever they’re stationed, to defend federal facilities from attacks,” the DHS said.

In a hearing Monday, US District Judge April Perry in Illinois gave the Trump administration until the end of the day Wednesday to file arguments on why she should not block President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Chicago.

Perry was nominated to the federal bench in the Northern District of Illinois last year by President Joe Biden.

A year earlier, Biden had nominated her to serve as the US Attorney for the same district, but that nomination was among those held up by then-Ohio Senator JD Vance, who was blocking Justice Department nominees to protest a federal indictment against Trump brought by former Special Counsel Jack Smith, according to Reuters.

Perry previously served as an assistant US attorney in Illinois’ Northern District for 12 years. Before her 2024 nomination, she worked as the senior counsel of global investigations and fraud and abuse prevention at GE HealthCare in Chicago.

Perry earned her law degree in 2003 from Northwestern University, where she also earned her bachelor’s degree.

President Donald Trump suggested yesterday he could invoke the Insurrection Act if courts continue to block deployments of troops to cities nationwide, raising the prospect of using the centuries-old law to bypass unfavorable rulings.

“So far it hasn’t been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that.”

Officials in Illinois and Oregon are waging legal battles against Trump’s efforts to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago and Portland.

Illinois and Chicago sued the administration yesterday, asking a federal court to halt the federalization of National Guard troops from that state and from Texas, calling the move “patently unlawful.”

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard members to Portland for the second time, but the Trump administration has asked an appeals court to pause the judge’s order.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2239242013.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-07 08:57:35.903167

Most of the vehicles spotted by the ICE watchers over the past month have been unmarked Dodge Chargers and Durangos or Ford Explorers.
In front of the Milford courthouse, several ICE watchers said a female agent had just rushed out and crossed the street.
Mirella told the ICE watchers Jesus had the gas money she needed to drive home.
Tamburello said the ICE watchers provide ""an important service.""","At 5:30 a.m., the sky was pitch black in downtown Framingham. Five unmarked vehicles — some black, others gray — roamed around with tinted windows and Texas plates.

A group of people who monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were out watching for activity.

One of the observers followed a car she suspected contained federal agents. She recorded a video that showed an officer turning his attention to her, telling her it's dangerous to follow agents at work.

“I'm free to drive around and record in the country,” the woman protested.

“And we are free to find out who you are,” the agent said. “May I see your passport?”

The woman — a U.S. citizen originally from Brazil who we’re identifying by her first initial, A. — presented her passport. The agent ran her name, then told her she could leave.

Immigration advocates say ICE arrests have been surging in Massachusetts since early September, when the Department of Homeland Security announced a renewed enforcement effort in the state. Reports have flooded social media of people arrested at courthouses, during traffic stops and on their way to work.

Connected through a community group called LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, activists — like the ones gathered early in the morning in Framingham — are documenting arrests throughout the state. LUCE volunteers operate a hotline and monitor social media for reports of ICE activity, then dispatch local observers to the scene. Once they get information, they report back to the larger group, and keep notes of everything they see.

According to LUCE, there are hundreds of “ICE watchers” at work, recording the names of those arrested to make sure they’re accounted for. Volunteers canvass neighborhoods in the wake of ICE activity. They say federal agents often arrest family breadwinners, leaving spouses and children in need of help, and LUCE tries to connect them with resources.

LUCE says it’s been getting about 100 calls a day since early September. The wee hours of the morning are often the most active, and MetroWest is one of several hotspots in eastern Massachusetts.

WBUR agreed to use only the first name or initial of the people interviewed for this story — they’re concerned that they or family members could be targeted based on their immigration status.

M. is a British-born U.S. citizen who has lived here for 25 years. And he said he was never an activist until now.

“ICE can just show up and start asking people for their papers,” M. said. “That's not the country that this is supposed to be. That's Eastern Europe in the ‘80s. I don't want us to go to that.”

The agency didn’t respond to questions for this story; ICE has said previously that agents are in Massachusetts arresting “rapists, child abusers, drug traffickers, and other violent thugs.”

But the agency provides almost no details on the people agents arrest. During the last enforcement surge in Massachusetts in May, ICE announced about half of the 1,500 detainees had “significant criminal convictions or charges,” either in the U.S. or abroad. Federal data show that ICE classified the vast majority of men in detention in Massachusetts as not a ""threat.""

M. said it’s understandable that the government wants to hold immigrants accountable to the country’s laws. But he said communities are being uprooted and it’s hard to make sense of why.

“The government has turned a blind eye to people living here 20, 30, 40 years — and then suddenly [is] just rounding them up,” he said. “They're clearly contributing to the community in really big ways.”

He said two days earlier, nine landscapers were arrested in the town of Hopedale, outside of Framingham.

The ICE watchers were on edge this Friday morning in late September — two days before, there was a deadly shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas — and the observers know the ICE officers were probably on edge, too.

The top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts, U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, has warned that impeding an arrest or assaulting an agent can be a criminal offense.

M. said the group’s role is to bear witness, not interfere.

Driving around Framingham, he listened to voice messages in a group chat about the latest ICE sighting.

He explained the agents seem to travel in groups of five or six vehicles. One agent who wears a cowboy hat is referred to as “El Vaquero de Marlborough,” the cowboy of Marlborough; the ICE watchers call another agent “Sooner,” an agent who apparently told observers she comes from Oklahoma.

Most of the vehicles spotted by the ICE watchers over the past month have been unmarked Dodge Chargers and Durangos or Ford Explorers. Many have out-of-state plates, mostly from Texas, but also Pennsylvania, Vermont and New Hampshire.

Rumors of ICE sightings are rampant. One report claimed there were agents inside Waltham district court, but they turned out to be local cops. Someone else said a large number of federal agents were gathering at a hotel, but ICE watchers found it was some kind of police conference.

Then, M. got a call that sounded legit.

“ICE is at the Milford courthouse,” the caller said, adding two other details: blue Nissan Rogue and the officer was in plain clothes.

M. headed for Milford — a half hour south of Framingham — a town the ICE watchers say has been swarmed by immigration police in recent weeks. In front of the Milford courthouse, several ICE watchers said a female agent had just rushed out and crossed the street.

Three unmarked vehicles surrounded a small Ford. The ICE watchers ran over with their phones out, recording. Agents were pulling a man out of the car and handcuffing him. He shouted his name out.

The agents moved fast, pushing the man into their vehicle before speeding off.

A woman left in the driver’s seat of the Ford Focus looked shocked. She said her name is Mirella and she’d driven her friend Jesus up from Baltimore for a court date.

“ That was my first time ever experiencing that and seeing that,” Mirella said. “That is insane.”

Jesus' lawyer asked WBUR to use just his first name because she fears he could face retaliation by ICE. Court records show Jesus was facing charges for domestic violence and witness intimidation; the case was dismissed right before ICE grabbed him.

Mirella said she was waiting in the car when Jesus walked out of court. She said the agents seemed to be after someone else.

“They asked him if he was a completely different person,” she said. And “they just took him instead.”

ICE didn’t respond to questions about the arrest.

Mirella told the ICE watchers Jesus had the gas money she needed to drive home. One of them took up a collection, then handed Mirella a stack of 20s. It was enough for tolls and gas, plus a couple meals on the way to Baltimore.

But there was more work to be done. That afternoon, the ICE watchers got ahold of Jesus’ mother and sent her video of his arrest. That’s how his lawyer, Baltimore-based Hayley Tamburello, found out he was in custody.

Tamburello said he was flown to an ICE facility in Buffalo, and then to another in Natchez, Mississippi.

On Monday morning, 10 days after the arrest, Tamburello said neither her, nor Jesus' mother, has received a call from him. She doesn't know if that's because he can't make a phone call, or because he doesn't have their numbers memorized.

Tamburello said the ICE watchers provide ""an important service."" If it hadn’t been for them, she said, she doesn’t know how they would have found out what happened to Jesus.

""I wouldn't have known,"" Tamburello said. ""I can tell you that.""",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0926_ice-fram-3-1000x667.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 10:56:54.084693

“On Saturday, he was released,” said Constanza Segovia of Victor Sanchez Sr., who was arrested last month at a routine immigration check-in.

Segovia said Sanchez was ordered to leave the country within 30 days, but “we're going to keep fighting.”

She read a statement provided by Sanchez in both Spanish and English.

“I am so happy to be back with family and the community,” Segovia read. “I went to Mass yesterday, and when they saw me, they hugged me, and the priest said, ‘Oh my God, I can't believe you're here.’ I want to share this, because miracles can happen through unity and our community coming together.”

Sanchez’s was one of several recent arrests, as ICE activity in Connecticut has increased since the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term in January.

Faith leaders speak out

Monday’s demonstration began with a vigil outside the Abraham A. Ribicoff Federal Building in downtown Hartford, which houses a federal courthouse, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, and other federal offices. Participants then marched to the state Capitol, chanting “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.”

The Rev. Josh Pawelek of the Unitarian Universalist Society East in Manchester said the crowd gathered in opposition to federal immigration policy and actions. Pawelek is a member of the steering committee for the Greater Hartford Interfaith Action Alliance, which organized the rally along with Connecticut For All.

“Immigrant communities are under attack,” Pawelek said. “The current federal administration is reveling in cruel, violent, racist assaults on the dignity and humanity of immigrants in this country.”

ICE has consistently claimed to be targeting “the worst of the worst.” NPR reported in July that tens of thousands of those arrested by ICE lack a criminal record.

“They are intentionally creating suffering, terror, trauma and chaos in some of our most vulnerable communities,” Pawelek said. “It is racist, it is un-American, it is unacceptable.”

The Rev. Jocelyn Gardner Spencer said her faith impelled her to speak out against what she sees as federal policies that fly in the face of her religious teachings.

“Every person facing the racist, cruel, violent actions of ICE enforcement that my tax dollars and yours are paying for is somebody's baby, as deserving of protection and love and care as mine,” she said. “And every time somebody's baby is harmed, it breaks not only human hearts, it breaks God's heart, too.”

“We will pray and we will march and we will speak truth to power, and we will show up as many times as it takes until our leaders do what is right and not what is easy, what is faithful and not what is expedient,” Spencer said.

Four demands for state lawmakers

Pawelek and others called on Gov. Ned Lamont to call a special session to strengthen protections under state law for undocumented residents. Pawelek listed four main demands.

“One is: safeguard the personal data of Connecticut residents, such as those with drive-only licenses or HUSKY health care or in-state tuition,” Pawelek said. “Two, protect access to our justice system by prohibiting ICE enforcement actions in state courthouses.”

“Three, close loopholes that allow state and local resources to indirectly support federal immigration enforcement, and finally, maintain funding for HUSKY so that no one loses coverage.”

Asked for a response to the demonstrators’ demands, Lamont spokesperson Kevin Rivera did not directly indicate whether or not the governor was considering such a special session.

“Governor Lamont’s focus continues to be on making sure all Connecticut residents feel safe in our schools, places of worship, and elsewhere,” Rivera said. “Just a few weeks ago, the Governor along with Supreme Court Chief Justice Mullins announced additional protections in our courthouses to prevent warrantless arrests and banning the use of masks.”

“Governor Lamont will continue to work towards keeping our communities safe, including members of our immigrant community who are focused on creating a better life for themselves and their families,” Rivera’s statement concluded.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8989794/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7772x4080+0+1101/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fba%2Fd1%2F13b17bd8449b84fcdd09961fe29a%2F251006immigrantrightsrally-mmd1625.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 10:56:31.552551

The action followed a protest against Chinese employers on Oct. 4 and 5. Police intervened to control the protest on Oct. 6 and detained the demonstrators, who were reportedly staying and working in the city without proper documentation.

The detainees include 216 Pakistanis, 68 Bangladeshis and six Nepalis.

The protest reportedly stemmed from racist remarks made by Chinese supervisors toward workers’ religions at the workplace.

The Conservative Party is now proposing to effectively undo the creation of the Judicial Appointments Commission and the Judicial Conduct Investigation Office.

Mr Jenrick said judicial appointments should again be made directly by the justice secretary, supported only by a new “vetting board” to “scrutinise their background for any sign of bias, of whichever political hue”.

He also claimed that a reformed conduct regime would mean “biased judges will be sacked automatically”, while Westminster could “invoke its ancient power to remove judges from the senior courts” if necessary.

“These reforms aren’t radical; they restore the position we had in this country before Blair’s constitutional vandalism,” he said.

“But to members of the judiciary who object, let me say this. If you had kept your house in order, there would have been no need for these reforms.

The county enters the final year of its contracts with ICE and the GEO Group as the Trump administration has intensified efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.

Moshannon — which had already been accused of physical and psychological abuse, inadequate health care, and poor conditions — has also come under increased scrutiny over the past several months after the hanging death of Chaofeng Ge, a Chinese citizen who was detained at the facility near Philipsburg.

Local advocates have protested, called for Moshannon’s closure, and pressured county commissioners not to renew the contracts for the detention center.

Abigail Grimes-Haldiman, who is part of Indivisible Mayday, told Spotlight PA that no amount of money justifies the facility staying open. Indivisible Mayday is a grassroots organization that protests what it deems to be right-wing agendas.

“We don’t have to evoke human suffering in order to make money for the county,” Grimes-Haldiman said.

In September 2021, the Clearfield County commissioners voted to enter into a five-year intergovernmental service agreement with ICE “to provide detention services for detainees,” according to the agreement.

The commissioners also approved a services contract with GEO Group, an international company based in Florida that owns and operates correctional and detention facilities around the globe. It “requires GEO to perform all duties and accept all responsibilities incumbent upon” the county under its agreement with ICE, according to the contract.

The ACLU sued the commissioners after they signed the contracts with ICE and GEO Group, alleging commissioners violated the state’s open meetings law.

Also under the contract, GEO Group agrees to pay the county an administrative fee of $200,000 per year “in recognition of [county] costs in time and resources.”

That $200,000 yearly payment accounts for less than 0.5% of Clearfield County’s annual budget. The county projected revenues of $41.7 million in 2025.

The administrative fee goes into the county’s general fund and isn’t earmarked for any specific purpose, Clearfield County Commissioner Dave Glass told Spotlight PA.

USA Today reported that GEO Group billed the federal government $4.5 million in December, which was about on par for most of the other months in 2024. But in 2025, those monthly payments have been on an upward trajectory, reaching $5.3 million in May.

That money essentially passes from ICE to Clearfield County to GEO Group.

The contract “helps GEO to circumvent onerous federal contracting requirements that exist when a private company directly contracts with the federal government,” according to an August 2024 report from Temple University’s Sheller Center for Social Justice.

The detention center contracts run through the end of next September, and Clearfield County commissioners will decide next year whether they will be renewed.

“All things being equal, I anticipate my advocating a renewal of the contract as I do not believe that the resident detainees’ civil rights are being violated at GEO and I do believe that they are receiving all other protections afforded to them by American law on the part of the institution,” Commissioner John Sobel told Spotlight PA.

Commissioner Tim Winters told Spotlight PA that he didn’t see a reason not to renew the contract.

While Glass said he’s generally happy with GEO Group, he has concerns about the way ICE agents have been conducting themselves and said they would give him pause before voting to renew contracts for the Moshannon facility.

Glass told Spotlight PA he understands deporting known criminals or individuals with criminal connections who have had due process.

“But rounding people up who have been upstanding members of American communities for years — in some cases decades — makes no sense to me and seems like a serious overreaction,” Glass said.

According to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, as of mid-September the most recent average daily population numbers for Moshannon are 1,404 — up from 1,171 when Trump was inaugurated.

(TRAC is a nonprofit that tracks federal agency data, including on immigration.)

The facility has a capacity of 1,876, according to GEO Group’s website.

It was previously owned and operated by GEO Group as a federal prison until March 2021, when former President Joe Biden signed an executive order banning private prison contracts.

The prison employed 300 people before it closed, WPSU reported.

Eight months later, the facility reopened as an ICE immigration detention center.

Sobel said in 2021 that the move would offer “well-paying, family sustaining jobs” to many of the former prison employees, according to the newsroom.

He told Spotlight PA that Moshannon Valley Processing Center “has a great economic impact.”

According to Winters, the facility employs 407 full-time GEO Group employees and about two dozen full-time ICE employees. He said it also pays property taxes that go to the Philipsburg-Osceola Area School District and fund “essential services” in Decatur Township.",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNS8xMC8wMW1lLTg0YzctYm1nai14ZnFkLmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 04:56:40.342413
