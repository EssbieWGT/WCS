Allegations of children fighting adults for clean water, distraught children and a protracted medical response first surfaced during the summer while the federal government asked a federal judge to end a policy protecting immigrant children.
The policy limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires safe and sanitary conditions.

The details are part of a lawsuit where the government is attempting to end protections for children. Declarations from families held at the facility in Dilley, Texas, which was reopened in March, described persistently cloudy water, delayed medical attention and long periods of time children are being detained.

Allegations of children fighting adults for clean water, distraught children and a protracted medical response first surfaced during the summer while the federal government asked a federal judge to end a policy protecting immigrant children.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles, who presides over the case, heard arguments from the government, which wants to end the Flores Settlement agreement. The policy limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires safe and sanitary conditions.

After Gee told the government last month to provide detention times, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that the number of children in custody over 72 hours decreased from an average of six days to five days in June and July, respectively. The “vast majority” spent less than 72 hours in CBP custody, the report stated.

Attorneys representing the children reviewed the report and said some children are still being held for several weeks or months and often without justification.

About 65 families spoke to attorneys since Dilley opened.

“A huge percentage of families at Dilley are being apprehended from across the country as they dutifully appear for their immigration court hearings and ICE check-ins,” Leecia Welch, the deputy legal director at Children’s Rights who spoke with families, told The Associated Press in a statement.

The tap water is cloudy, smells strange and upsets stomachs, the families told their attorneys. The hand soap the facility provides for showers has been causing rashes, the families said. Children also struggle eating the food, like the snacks of graham crackers, apples, juice and milk.

Detainees are allowed to buy staples like bottled water for $1.21 from the commissary.

""I have never heard until now of children having to buy water,” said Welch, who has been visiting children in custody of CBP and the Office of Refugee Resettlement for eight years.

Families face costs as high as $5.73 for deodorant, $1.44 for soap, and $2.39 for toothpaste, Welch said in court documents. A single dose of Tylenol costs $1.30, she said.

A child with a stomachache waited six hours for a nurse and wasn't taken to a hospital with appendicitis until he vomited, court documents said. Another child fell on his arm and it wasn't until two hours later that the staff drove him to a hospital for an X-ray.

Parents said there are no organized activities for the children and only an hour of instruction from workbooks.

A woman's son told her that he ""doesn’t believe in God anymore because he prays to him but we still haven’t been able to get out of here,” according to her declaration, provided by Welch.

Some families are being released only to be detained again, Welch said. One family released after about 60 days in federal detention was asked to check in with ICE only to be detained at their appointment.

Ahead of the Subcommittee hearing, Padilla and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) requested an oversight hearing on ORR’s mass child deportation efforts and apparent lies under oath.
Key quotes from Senator Padilla’s opening remarks are below: “Too often, their stories of unaccompanied children go unheard until a horrific story about their mistreatment shocks the conscience of our country.
Earlier this year, Senator Padilla led seven Senators in sounding the alarm on troubling reports that ORR unlawfully granted expanded access to sensitive data on unaccompanied children and their sponsors to ICE.
In March, Padilla blasted the Trump Administration’s stop work order to organizations that provide legal services for unaccompanied children and demanded they protect Congressionally mandated legal representation for these children in the immigration system.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, criticized Senate Republicans’ hypocrisy in convening a hearing focused on the Biden Administration’s management of unaccompanied children as multiple recent reports emerge about the current Administration’s cruel mistreatment of unaccompanied children, ongoing family separations, and disregard for child safety and the rule of law. During his opening statement at the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing, Padilla called on his Republican colleagues to join him in pushing for oversight and accountability over this Administration’s flagrant violations of unaccompanied migrant children’s rights.

Padilla slammed the Trump Administration for attempting to unlawfully deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children in the middle of night over Labor Day weekend despite their ongoing immigration proceedings and fear of returning to Guatemala. Despite the Trump Administration’s claims to the contrary, a whistleblower disclosure yesterday alleged that at least 30 unaccompanied Guatemalan children the Administration attempted to deport without due process were flagged in the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s (ORR) database as having indicators of trafficking or child abuse if they were to be removed to Guatemala. Ahead of the Subcommittee hearing, Padilla and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) requested an oversight hearing on ORR’s mass child deportation efforts and apparent lies under oath.

He also highlighted reporting from the Washington Post uncovering that the Trump Administration’s mass deportation agenda has reignited forced family separations, including a recent incident in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ripped a 35-year-old Honduran mother from her twin 14-year-old daughters despite her maintaining a work permit, a pathway to a visa, and a pending asylum claim.

Key quotes from Senator Padilla’s opening remarks are below:

“Too often, their stories of unaccompanied children go unheard until a horrific story about their mistreatment shocks the conscience of our country. And it’s not just a matter of past tense. It is not just a matter of what happened during the Biden Administration or in prior years. One of these stories broke out just a few weeks ago.”

“On Sunday, August 31st — at about 1 or 2 in the morning — 76 children in Texas shelters were jolted awake. In the middle of the night, with no warning, they were instructed to pack their bags, and immigration officials led them to an airport to be deported. Without a hearing, without due process, and without proper vetting to see if they would be safe back in Guatemala, these kids, as you can imagine, were terrified.”

“Now it’s on us to do the right thing and bring ORR officials before this committee to demand the truth. Now, Mr. Chairman, we are the committee of jurisdiction with an obligation to conduct oversight over ORR. So I don’t just ask you, I urge you: let’s work together to schedule an oversight hearing with ORR to get to the truth.”

“Every single one of us here has a responsibility to stand up for the children in our immigration system, whether it’s because of trafficking, physical or sexual abuse, child labor, or violations of their due process. And this is a responsibility that I don’t take lightly, none of us should take lightly.”

“The reality is, the Trump Administration officials should be the ones in the seats in front of us to field our questions and to answer our questions about their, in many ways, cruel and unlawful policies, especially after this whistleblower disclosure.”

“If we truly want to improve our immigration system and protect unaccompanied children, we’d be exercising our oversight authority to ask about the real harm currently happening to children because of the indiscriminate mass deportation policies that this Administration is carrying out. There has to be real oversight of this Administration and their dangerous treatment of minors.”

“So don’t lecture me about kids, and then at the same time grab defenseless children in the middle of the night to haul them off to a country when we know they will be in danger. Don’t lecture me about kids, but then refuse to call out this Administration when they deprive them of representation. And don’t lecture me about kids and then refuse to speak out when we hear parents are being forced to decide whether to be deported with their children or let them be sent to ORR shelters, as we learned just this morning.”

“Not a single child benefits from political theater. So today, it’s my hope that this hearing doesn’t devolve into just a competition of who can praise Trump the most or who can bash Biden the best. Because regardless of which party is in the White House, or which party is in the majority in Congress, keeping children safe should be a bipartisan concern.”

“Everybody in this hearing room and everybody watching at home: Democrats demanded accountability from the Biden Administration on what happened to children under their watch. And I invite our Republican colleagues to join us in demanding the same accountability from the Trump Administration about what’s happening to children under theirs.”

Video of Senator Padilla’s opening statement is available here and be downloaded here.

On Monday, Padilla, Durbin, and Representatives Jamie Raskin (D-Md.-08) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.-07) demanded answers from senior Administration officials on this cruel effort, including information on their compliance with due process and confidentiality obligations under asylum law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, and other statutory protections afforded to unaccompanied children by law.

Earlier this year, Senator Padilla led seven Senators in sounding the alarm on troubling reports that ORR unlawfully granted expanded access to sensitive data on unaccompanied children and their sponsors to ICE. The Senators raised serious concerns that ICE could misuse this confidential information to enact mass deportations and detain immigrant families and demanded DHS Secretary Noem and HHS Secretary Kennedy immediately cease this misguided practice. In March, Padilla blasted the Trump Administration’s stop work order to organizations that provide legal services for unaccompanied children and demanded they protect Congressionally mandated legal representation for these children in the immigration system.

Under the Biden Administration, Padilla co-chaired a hearing in which he condemned the labor exploitation of migrant children in the United States and called on the federal government to enforce the law and hold employers accountable for unlawfully exploiting migrant children.

The federal district court’s separate orders, prohibiting the government from deporting or detaining Mr. Khalil as his federal court case proceeds, remain in effect.
The letter to federal court explains that the immigration judge’s decision is further evidence of retaliation and that Mr. Khalil will be pressing ahead in federal court to prove these charges are pretextual and unlawful.
Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” said Mahmoud Khalil.
After this ruling, the government shifted its justification for Mr. Khalil’s detention to false, retaliatory charges about purported misrepresentations on his green card application.","NEWARK, N.J. – Following the Trump administration’s latest effort to weaponize the immigration system to silence Mahmoud Khalil for his advocacy in support of Palestinian human rights, Mr. Khalil’s legal team today submitted a letter to the federal court in New Jersey overseeing his civil rights case. The letter to Judge Michael Farbiarz explains that Mr. Khalil will challenge a Sept. 12 decision made by the immigration judge in Louisiana that denied Mr. Khalil a waiver of removability, bringing him one step closer to a final order of removal, because of baseless, pretextual “misrepresentation” charges the government added after his detention.

As the letter notes, the immigration judge rushed to a decision without providing a hearing on the evidence as due process requires, engaging in multiple procedural irregularities, and choosing to believe the false charges made after the fact by the government. The letter also states how rare it is for an immigration judge to deny a waiver against a lawful permanent resident with a U.S. spouse and child, and no criminal record.

The federal district court’s separate orders, prohibiting the government from deporting or detaining Mr. Khalil as his federal court case proceeds, remain in effect. The letter to federal court explains that the immigration judge’s decision is further evidence of retaliation and that Mr. Khalil will be pressing ahead in federal court to prove these charges are pretextual and unlawful.

“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” said Mahmoud Khalil. “When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide. Such fascist tactics will never deter me from continuing to advocate for my people’s liberation.”

In June, the federal court ruled that the government’s original justification for Mr. Khalil’s detention based only on Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s say-so was likely unconstitutional and blocked his detention and deportation on that basis. After this ruling, the government shifted its justification for Mr. Khalil’s detention to false, retaliatory charges about purported misrepresentations on his green card application. As Mr. Khalil’s legal team thoroughly outlined in court filings, these after-the-fact charges are meritless and retaliatory.

“The Trump administration will stop at nothing to try to silence Mr. Khalil, including by denying him, his family, and his supporters the right to testify in immigration court, in complete contravention of the U.S. Constitution,” said Johnny Sinodis, partner at Van Der Hout LLP. “We have witnessed a constant lack of humanity and allegiance to the law throughout proceedings in this farcical Louisiana immigration court, and the immigration judge’s September 12 decision is just the most recent example of what occurs when the system requires an arbiter that is anything but neutral to do the administration’s bidding. As with other illegal efforts by the government, this too will be challenged and overcome.”

“When the immigration prosecutor, judge, and jailor all answer to Donald Trump, and that one man is eager to weaponize the system in a desperate bid to silence Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. permanent resident whose only supposed sin is that he stands against an ongoing genocide in Palestine, this is the result,” said Ramzi Kassem, co-director of CLEAR. “A plain-as-day First Amendment violation that also puts on sharp display the rapidly freefalling credibility of the entire U.S. immigration system.”

Mr. Khalil is represented by Dratel & Lewis, the Center for Constitutional Rights, CLEAR, Van Der Hout LLP, Washington Square Legal Services, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the ACLU of New Jersey, and the ACLU of Louisiana.

She said hearing about Villegas-González’ death last week was particularly unsettling because she often goes to Franklin Park.","MELROSE PARK — Chants of “Justicìa!” rang out Tuesday as a planned Mexican Independence Day march evolved into a protest over last week’s fatal shooting of a man immigration agents sought to arrest after he dropped his children off at school.

Marchers held photos of Silverio Villegas-Gonzáles — the 38-year-old man fatally shot by an immigration agent in nearby Franklin Park Friday — during an afternoon procession through Melrose Park Tuesday.

“[ICE] assassinated a hard-working man, a father that only wanted to drop off his kids, go to work and then come back … but he never came back home,” said Nancy Salgado, director of organizing for the Melrose Park-based immigrant rights nonprofit PASO West Suburban Action Project. “Today, we stand in solidarity with his family.”

Organizers of Tuesday’s march, attended by about 50 people and originally designed to protest the growing presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the Chicago area, dedicated the event to Villegas-Gonzáles’ family upon learning of Friday’s shooting Salgado said. The event unfolded as elected officials such as Gov. JB Pritzker continue to call for an investigation into the shooting and for ICE to provide more information about what led to the fatal shots being fired.

State Rep. Norma Hernandez, D-Melrose Park, who also attended the march, confirmed that Villegas-Gonzáles was the father of two young sons, a 7-year-old and a 3-year-old.

Villegas-Gonzáles was his family’s sole provider and worked long hours as a cook, she said. The Friday morning shooting in a suburb just south of O’Hare Airport occurred soon after Villegas-Gonzáles dropped his children off at school, Hernandez said.

Franklin Park School District 84 Superintendent David Katzin confirmed Villegas-Gonzáles’ 7-year-old son attended nearby Passow Elementary School.

A GoFundMe has been set up to raise money for Villegas-Gonzáles’ family, and more than $45,000 had been raised as of early Tuesday evening.

“Silverio passed away after ICE agents shot him fatally, leaving behind not only loving family and friends, but also a legacy of warmth, resilience and deep compassion. He was someone who always extended a helping hand, shared his smile freely, and showed up for those he loved — no matter the circumstances,” wrote Lily Rivera, the fundraising campaign’s organizer.

The Elgin-based group Vecinos Unidos is also holding a community drive this weekend to collect food and toiletry donations for Villegas-Gonzáles’ family. Learn more about the donation drive here.

A memorial featuring photos, cards, candles and flowers now marks the Franklin Park intersection where Villegas-Gonzáles was killed.

The Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago confirmed that Villegas-González was a Mexican national. Reyna Torres Mendivil, the consul general of Mexico in Chicago, told the Sun Times that Villegas-González’s family has requested that his remains be sent back to Mexico.

ICE Has Released ‘Very Little’ Information On What Happened

According to a statement released by ICE, agents stopped Villegas-González in Franklin Park Friday while he was driving and he “refused to follow law enforcement commands” before driving his car at officers.

ICE wrote that one officer was hit and dragged and “fearing for his own life, the officer fired his weapon.”

Surveillance video from a nearby business, according to CBS2, shows two officers stop and approach a Subaru driven by Villegas-González. One officer walks to the passenger side and the other to the driver’s side. The officer on the passenger side appears to try to open the door before Villegas-González starts backing up and drives away. The officer at the driver’s side window — whom ICE said was dragged — cannot be seen in the footage as Villegas-González drives away. Two gunshots can be heard in footage from another business. Footage of the officer being dragged and later shooting Villegas-González has not been produced. ICE agents involved in the fatal shooting were not wearing body cameras during the incident, the Sun-Times reported Tuesday.

Hernandez said that as soon as she heard about the shooting on Friday, she reached out to local rapid response networks to try to gather more information.

“We had people on the ground going to businesses to try and get footage because we know that we cannot trust the federal government,” she said.

Pritzker said his office asked ICE for all the information around Villegas-González’ shooting but said the agency has “given very little” detail, according to the Sun Times

“This is the most unusual situation I’ve seen in my entire lifetime, where we have no transparency and the federal government is not policing itself. Even the offices of inspector generals are being dismantled under this administration. So we may never really know what the truth is,” the governor said.

The Franklin Park Police Department referred all questions about the shooting to the FBI. In a statement, the FBI confirmed the agency responded to the shooting and assisted law enforcement on-scene. The FBI would not confirm whether the agency was investigating the incident further. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions.

“The Department of Justice’s media policy prohibits the FBI from confirming or denying investigations, but as a general matter, we examine the facts with consideration of federal criminal statutes. We then proceed as appropriate, whether by investigating or referring the matter to the relevant partners,” an FBI spokesperson wrote.

ICE has increased its presence in the Chicago area in recent days, announcing Operation Midway Blitz last week. On Tuesday, Customs and Border Protection officials — a sister agency — traveled to Chicago for a separate campaign dubbed Operating At Large.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to CBS2. Noem posted a video on X of immigration arrests that appeared to show an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid Tuesday in Elgin, CBS reported.

Claudia Galvàn, who is originally from Mexico but has been living in Melrose Park for more than 30 years, said she usually celebrates Mexican Independence Day but “can’t this year because of all the things happening.”

She and her son joined the march as they were headed to the store Tuesday. She said hearing about Villegas-González’ death last week was particularly unsettling because she often goes to Franklin Park.

“It’s scary,” she said. “It could happen to anyone.”

Grace Clear, 75, traveled from Elmhurst to join the march. She’s part of a group of residents called Progressives for Change that has been protesting President Donald Trump’s administration by rallying outside the Elmhurst City Hall every Saturday since February.

“It’s just so senseless,” Clear said of Villegas-González’ death. “ICE feels they have the right to murder someone over a traffic stop.”

Salgado said PASO, the Melrose Park immigrants’ rights group, will be organizing more marches in the coming weeks, including one in Franklin Park. March updates will be posted on Facebook.

Tuesday’s march was about showing power and unity in the face of intimidation, Hernandez said.

“This is our way to fight back, to be joyful, to celebrate our culture and to highlight the wrongful death of Silverio,” she said. “Because we can’t let this one go, we have to make sure this doesn’t happen again, that there isn’t another murder by this agency.”

Hernandez said she will be meeting with Villegas-González’ family later this week to offer support and discuss next steps, including potential legal action.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5117-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 16:57:37.013640

The Trump administration has faced some legal roadblocks in its funding freeze attempts.","WASHINGTON — Labor unions, faculty and students in the University of California education system sued President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday over the freezing of federal funds and other actions that they say aim to stifle academic freedom.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, seeks to forbid the government from using financial threats against the system that it said were harmful and unlawful. It also aims to restore funding already suspended.

“(The administration) has attempted to implement a playbook to threaten colleges and universities,” the coalition that filed the lawsuit said. It added that those threats were based on disdain for the institutions’ curriculum, expressive activity on campuses, and initiatives for diversity, equity and inclusion.

The University of California system and the White House had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.

The government has launched probes into universities’ handling of alleged antisemitism during student protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza, and has frozen funds over that and other issues, including climate initiatives and DEI programs.

Civil rights advocates say the Trump administration is attempting to make universities more aligned with his political agenda, while critics also see such attempts as threatening free speech and academic freedom.

University of California Operates One of the Largest Higher-Education Systems

The University of California operates one of the largest higher-education systems in the country, with 10 main campuses and nearly 300,000 students, as well as 265,000 faculty and staff.

The Trump administration had proposed to settle its probe into the University of California, Los Angeles – part of the university system – through a $1 billion payment from the institution. Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom called that an extortion attempt.

UCLA said in August the government froze $584 million in funding before a judge ordered the Trump administration to restore some of that money. The University of California, Berkeley, another campus in the system, said on Friday it provided information on 160 faculty members and students to the government as part of an investigation.

University of California President James Milliken said on Monday the institution was facing one of the gravest threats in its history due to the federal government’s actions, noting that it receives more than $17 billion each year in federal support.

The Trump administration has faced some legal roadblocks in its funding freeze attempts. A federal judge ruled earlier this month that it had unlawfully terminated more than $2 billion in grants for Harvard University.

The government alleges universities allowed antisemitism during campus protests. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, have said the government is wrongly equating their criticism of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories with antisemitism, and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism.

Human rights advocates have noted a rise in antisemitism, anti-Arab bias and Islamophobia due to conflict in the Middle East, although the Trump administration has not announced probes into Islamophobia.

The administration has settled its investigations with Columbia and Brown universities.

The report, created in collaboration with the International Justice Clinic at UC Irvine School of Law and Northeastern University School of Law Center for Global Law and Justice, highlights how daily county work implements fundamental human rights principles.

""This report gives the public a clear look at how we are working to protect human rights every day in Los Angeles County,"" said Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger. ""It's a responsibility we take seriously—it's part of our core mission to serve every community with fairness and respect.""

The report demonstrates how LA County departments share a core mission to improve quality of life with integrity, inclusivity, compassion, customer orientation and equity. It connects this local work to broader international human rights commitments, serving as a resource for officials, advocates and community members.

""Los Angeles County remains steadfast in its commitment to lead with integrity, inclusivity, and compassion, and to protect the rights of all Angelenos,"" said Chair Pro Tem Hilda L. Solis. ""In these unprecedented times, amid recovery from devastating wildfires and growing fear in our communities due to ongoing immigration actions, we stand united in our promise to build a stronger, more inclusive County for all.""

Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell noted that four years ago, the Board approved her motion to incorporate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination into county ordinance. ""Now is the time to double down on that commitment—together—for all residents, including women, immigrants, and our most vulnerable communities,"" she said.

The report references twelve key international instruments that promote specific rights and freedoms, all sharing the commitment that government respects, protects and fulfills rights without discrimination.

This assault should alarm anyone who values constitutional governance and the personal freedoms we so often take for granted.
There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy.
The Constitution establishes a clear civil-military divide because the founders understood that when the military becomes a tool of domestic control, constitutional democracy dies.
Today, the danger is not from foreign invasion or civil war, but instead the methodical dismantling of constitutional governance by a president sworn to uphold it.","In 1952, seven years after the end of the Second World War, Congress established Constitution Day to celebrate our country’s sacred foundational document. In the more than 70 years since, most Americans have taken for granted the fundamental freedoms this day honors. There are no parades, no barbecues, and no mattress sales for Constitution Day. In many ways, this low profile is a sign of strength.

But this year, that complacency feels perilous. Fundamental pillars of our democracy are under assault, and the situation is more dire than many realize. That’s why we can no longer assume the Constitution will simply survive through benign neglect.We must fight to protect and strengthen it.

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought.

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought. As our country has evolved and expanded rights and advanced democratic reforms, this framework – through its many iterations and amendments – has remained true to its core throughout. Through civil war and depression, world wars and social upheavals, through the peaceful transfer of power across generations and parties, Americans have been able to count on the Constitution being there.

Today we are facing a new type of threat. There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy. This assault should alarm anyone who values constitutional governance and the personal freedoms we so often take for granted.

Alarmingly, we’re witnessing the intrusion of military force into civilian life. Earlier this summer the president deployed Marines and National Guard units to crack down on protests in Los Angeles and has thousands of Guard members patrolling the streets of Washington D.C. The administration has signaled that this is just the start, with plans to deploy more troops onto American streets in Chicago and possibly elsewhere.

There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy.

This violates a founding principle of American governance, enshrined in the Posse Comitatus Act, that military forces should not police civilians. The Constitution establishes a clear civil-military divide because the founders understood that when the military becomes a tool of domestic control, constitutional democracy dies. Immigration detention centers under construction on military bases echo some of the darkest chapters in our history and represent a dangerous conflation of military and civilian authority.

As we saw in Los Angeles, the deployment of troops is a fear tactic meant to silence opposition and criminalize dissent. But the attacks on the First Amendment are not isolated to targeting peaceful protest. The Trump administration has ushered in a new McCarthy era, sending a clear message that if someone disagrees with our government, they will be punished.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened.

Just look at this administration’s actions. Federal agents have repeatedly detained or arrested public officials conducting legitimate oversight, including Newark, New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka,Congresswoman LaMonica McIver, andSenator Alex Padilla, who was tackled and detained for asking Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions. Students, including green card holders, have been detained and threatened with deportation for writing op-eds or expressing views that deviate from what the administration deems acceptable.

The administration is not content with silencing critics — it rejects the very concept of legitimate political opposition. Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller recently declared ""The Democrat party is not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization."" Coming from an administration that’s literally prosecuting a democratic congresswoman on invented felony charges stemming from her oversight of an ICE facility, this explicit rejection of political pluralism is chilling.

Perhaps most dangerously, the Trump administration is ignoring the rule of law and corrupting justice itself. The president has targeted law firms whose attorneys investigated him, stripping their security clearances, barring attorneys from federal buildings, and terminating government contracts unless firms agree to coercive demands for ""pro bono"" services. He excoriates judges who issue unfavorable rulings, calling them ""radical left lunatics"" and ""deranged,"" while encouraging calls for impeachment or worse. Ominously, the Justice Department is now seeking financial sanctions against immigration attorney Joshua Schroeder for filing emergency motions to halt his client's deportation — the first case under a new Trump directive to personally target lawyers who challenge administration policies.

Military forces now police civilians. Members of Congress are arrested for doing their jobs. The president's top adviser declares the opposition party illegitimate. Judges and lawyers face threats for upholding the law. This is the systematic dismantling of constitutional governance.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened. Today, the danger is not from foreign invasion or civil war, but instead the methodical dismantling of constitutional governance by a president sworn to uphold it. At a moment when we are seeing political violence escalating — claiming lives and threatening the very free discourse our Constitution protects — we must choose peaceful democratic engagement over dehumanization and violence. The power ultimately lies with the people, and as a country we must decide whether we will defend our Constitution or let it fall.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/09/defend-the-constitution-s.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 16:57:34.213067

The family says their son, who attends Milford High School, was later released by ICE and very shaken up over the incident.

ICE released a statement saying in part, ""At the time of the detainment, ICE had no knowledge of the individual's age. Upon determining that the illegal alien is a juvenile, ICE called his parents to come pick him up. His parents refused to come get him, so ICE drove him home.""

“What’s particularly jarring about these cases is that these clients screamed for help,” said Decker, who filed the complaints with DHS and ICE.
Decker said that while Reyes is central to the complaints, she believes the problems at detention facilities like the one in Basile go much deeper.
The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is, like many ICE facilities, run by an outside contractor — the GEO Group, a multinational private prison corporation and ICE’s largest detention contractor.
“I filed complaints and grievances.","Current and former detainees at the South Louisiana ICE Detention Center in Basile, Louisiana have filed multiple complaints through immigration rights groups on Monday (Sept. 15) against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging repeated sexual harassment, sexual abuse, physical abuse, coerced labor and neglect of urgent medical and mental health care at the facility.

Three organizations, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the ACLU of Louisiana and the National Immigration Project filed the complaints on behalf of four people — two who have been deported and two individuals who remain in custody at the facility, but who are in imminent risk of deportation, according to Sarah Decker, a staff attorney with RFK Human Rights. One of the deported individuals has since reentered the country and is now in criminal custody, Decker said.

The complaints allege that a former assistant warden, Manuel Reyes, at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center repeatedly sexually abused, threatened and punished one of the complainants, who is referred to as “Jane Doe” by her attorneys. The complaints further allege that Reyes ran an off-the-books late-night work scheme that coerced transgender detainees into physically and psychologically painful labor. Reyes could not be reached for comment.

“What’s particularly jarring about these cases is that these clients screamed for help,” said Decker, who filed the complaints with DHS and ICE. “They filed grievances. They filed [Prison Rape Elimination Act] complaints. They called the [Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General] hotline. They spoke to ICE officers face-to-face and told them what was happening. So this was an open secret in the facility, and ICE definitely knew about this.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs filed claims of personal injury against DHS and ICE, seeking financial compensation, on behalf of their clients. Separately they filed a civil rights complaint with offices at DHS. The Southeast Dignity Not Detention Coalition joined the other legal groups in filing the civil complaint.

Decker said that while Reyes is central to the complaints, she believes the problems at detention facilities like the one in Basile go much deeper.

“There’s much more going on than even we as advocates who represent people know about. There’s a deep underbelly of abuse that we haven’t fully uncovered yet,” she said.

The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is, like many ICE facilities, run by an outside contractor — the GEO Group, a multinational private prison corporation and ICE’s largest detention contractor. The GEO Group has repeatedly faced allegations of negligence and abuse at the immigration facilities it oversees. The company did not respond to requests for comment on the newest complaints.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, responded on behalf of DHS and ICE, calling the accusations false, characterizing them as a “hoax.” McLaughlin said the assistant warden did not perpetrate or enable sexual harassment or assault and that no one was forced into coerced labor or physically abused.

“The media is clearly desperate for these allegations of inhumane conditions at this facility to be true,” McLaughlin wrote. “All of these allegations are investigated by (the) ICE Office of Professional Responsibility, and none were found to be true.”

Decker disagreed with McLaughlin’s categorization of the incidents in the complaints.

“The documentation that we’ve done for years at these facilities and the stories of these clients prove otherwise, and it’s not surprising that DHS is once again failing to take accountability for the mistreatment and abuse of those entrusted to their care,” she said.

McLaughlin also said that ICE detainees receive proper meals and medical treatment.

“This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she said.

Decker pointed to the results of a 2024 ACLU study, in which medical experts reviewed records for 52 of 53 reported deaths in ICE custody from 2017 to 2021. They found that of those 52 people, roughly 95% were “preventable or possibly preventable,” had appropriate medical care been provided.

“The assertion that people in ICE custody are receiving high quality medical care is simply false,” Decker said. “What we’ve found is the exact opposite, that the medical care at these facilities is so poor and so abusive that people are dying in government custody and are suffering from life threatening and potentially permanent medical consequences as a result of this mistreatment.”

The woman identified as Jane Doe is from the Dominican Republic and lived in Maryland for 10 years, according to the complaint. She landed in the Basile ICE center by way of the women’s Federal Correctional Institution in Aliceville, Alabama, according to her lawyer.

The woman’s complaint says that she suffers from epilepsy, and it alleges that she was first sexually harassed and then finally repeatedly sexually abused at the detention center. It also states that she was denied medical attention and put in solitary confinement and threatened. Decker said those threats are central to why the woman identified as Jane Doe wants to remain anonymous. As her abuse in the facility continued, Doe’s physical health deteriorated, the complaint states.

“I begged the U.S. government to help me,” the woman identified as Jane Doe said in a press statement. “I filed complaints and grievances. I told ICE officers and medical staff. But they did nothing. I want people to know what happened to me and what continues to happen to people detained in these facilities.”

Three transgender detainees were also subject to physical and psychological abuse, according to their individual complaints.

One complainant, Mexican national Monica Renteria-Gonzalez, who was still in ICE custody as of this week, is a transgender man. The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is used primarily to hold women, but ICE assigns people to detention centers based upon their sex assigned at birth instead of their gender identity. Renteria-Gonzalez has been detained since roughly May 2023 at the facility, according to his complaint. Renteria-Gonzalez began working during the late-night hours alongside other transgender people for as little as $1 per day, the complaint states.

Renteria-Gonzalez’ complaint details difficult manual labor, allegedly without protective equipment, resulting in physical injury.

“Our rights are being violated everyday. This is a privately run facility that profits from our suffering. They are using us to make a profit but denying us medical care, food, even the most basic things like proper clothes and mattresses,” Renteria-Gonzalez said in a press release.

Two other transgender people detained at the facility — Mario Luisa Garcia-Valenzuela, a transgender man who is still in custody, and Kenia Campos-Flores, a nonbinary/transgender person who is no longer at the facility — had similar allegations in their complaints.

The complaints also allege that solitary confinement was used against the detainees as a means of punishment for complaints they issued about the behavior of the people running the facility.

The civil rights complaint filed with DHS is calling for the release of the detainees mentioned in the complaint, a full investigation of the allegations and financial penalties for GEO Group, should wrongdoing and mismanagement be found, as well as the termination of the contract with GEO to run the facility.

“These facilities are incapable of housing people humanely, and there’s no solution outside of shutting down these facilities and ending the use of immigration detention,” Decker said.

Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Monica Renteria-Gonzalez’ name. That’s been corrected.

As families hole up in homes — afraid to leave and risk detainment — advocates are reporting an increased presence of unmarked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles sitting in parking lots and other public areas throughout immigrant communities, where agents appeared to target work vans. One man captured a video of three landscapers who were working on the Saugus Town Hall property being arrested after agents smashed their truck window.

Just north of Boston, the city of Everett canceled its annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival after its mayor said it wouldn't be right to ""hold a celebration at a time when community members may not feel safe attending.”

The actions have been praised by public officials like New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who signed legislation this year banning sanctuary city policies in her state, vowing not to let New Hampshire “go the way of Massachusetts."" ICE this summer began utilizing a New Hampshire airport about an hour from Boston to transport New England detainees.

However, others argue that ICE's presence in Massachusetts is doing more harm than good.

“This is really increasing the fear in communities, which is already incredibly high,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.

Cities like Boston and Chicago — where Mayor Brandon Johnson has also condemned the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown, calling it an example of “tyranny” — have become targets for enforcement in recent days. Trump also threatened to potentially deploy the National Guard to Chicago, though he had wavered on a military deployment last week.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Sept. 4 filed a lawsuit against Mayor Michelle Wu, the city of Boston and its police department over its sanctuary city policies, claiming they’re interfering with immigration enforcement. In response, Wu accused Trump of “attacking cities to hide his administration’s failures.”

Now, ICE has launched an operation it called “Patriot 2.0"" on the heels of a May crackdown where nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in Massachusetts. Its latest operation came days before a preliminary mayoral election, where incumbent Wu won easily. The mayor has become a frequent target over her defense of the city and its so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Boston surge would focus on “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” living in Massachusetts.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but protect them at the peril of law-abiding American citizens,"" she said in a press release early last week, which detailed the arrest of seven individuals by ICE, including a 38-year-old man from Guatemala who had previously been arrested on assault-related charges.

The agency did not respond to requests from The Associated Press about the number of immigrants detained since “Patriot 2.0” began.

ICE has contracts to detain people at multiple correctional facilities across New England, including county jails as well as the federal prison in Berlin, New Hampshire, and a publicly-owned, privately operated prison in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

Volunteers monitoring flights carrying detainees from New Hampshire’s Portsmouth International Airport at Pease have documented the transfer of more than 300 individuals since early August, with at least five flights per week transferring people from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts. All of the detainees have been in shackles, said David Holt, who has been organizing regular protests at Pease.

Protesters gathered at venues like the ICE office in Burlington, where three participants were arrested on trespassing charges.

Luce, the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, staffed its hotline with interpreters who speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin, and Haitian Creole to collect information about ICE sightings. The organization put out a call for volunteers who speak languages like Cape Verdean Kriolu, Nepali and Vietnamese to help manage the influx.

Kevin Lam, co-executive director with the Asian American Resource Workshop, a community group that works on immigration and other issues, said they have seen a “spike” in ICE activity, including five Vietnamese residents from a Boston neighborhood who were detained last week.

He and other advocates said many immigrants have expressed fear about everyday tasks like picking up their kids at school and riding on public transportation. However, he said many are still attending work, with some willing to risk being detained because they are the primary breadwinners for their families.

""Many of them are like, ‘Yeah, it is a risk every day when I step out, but I need to work to be able to provide for my family,’” he said.

Republican Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Leah Foley said she is “100% supportive” of ICE's latest operation in the state and that her office will not hesitate to prosecute immigrants without legal status who commit crimes. Noncriminals have also been swept up in raids that ICE calls “collateral arrests.”

""We stand ready to charge individuals who violate all federal laws, including those who enter our country without authorization after being deported and those who assault federal law enforcement officers or impede or interfere with federal officers doing their jobs,"" she said in a statement to the AP.

Advocates like Lam pushed back on claims that ICE agents are only targeting criminals, saying that with fewer protections for asylum-seekers and others who are here legally, the strategy seems to be going well beyond “bad immigrants” with records.

Alexandra Peredo Carroll, director of legal Education and advocacy at the Boston-based Mabel Center for Immigrant Justice, said the Trump administration is ""trying to fit folks into this narrative of being illegal or having broken the law, when in fact, many of these are individuals who are actually going through the legal process.”

“I think you’re going to see more and more how families are going to be torn apart, how individuals with no criminal history, with pending forms of relief, pending applications are just going to be rounded up,” she said.

The raid, carried out on September 4 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has provoked outrage in South Korea. Officials in Seoul say they received no prior notice of the operation, despite South Korea’s commitments to the US in trade and investment. The country has pledged close to half a trillion dollars in US energy purchases and manufacturing investments, particularly in the electric-vehicle sector.

REPORTS OF MISTREATMENT

The repatriation of 316 South Koreans on Friday heightened the controversy. A number of them claimed to have been mistreated while in the US custody. During the raid, detainees claimed they were shackled, made to sleep on mouldy beds, kept in temporary detention cells with as many as 70 people, and refused access to interpreters.

According to South Korean media, workers alleged that they had not been informed of his Miranda rights. These testimonies have sparked anger that US authorities mishandled the raid and violated basic legal protections.

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry and Justice Ministry, working with employers of the former detainees, are now investigating whether human-rights violations occurred in the detention centre and whether South Koreans were unfairly targeted because of their jobs at the site.

""If the probe confirms that violations occurred, the government will submit a formal complaint to the United States,"" a South Korean official said as per the Wall Street Journal. The official added that the enquiry is expected to conclude within weeks.

US OFFICIALS RESPOND

During a visit to Seoul on Sunday, Christopher Landau, the US Deputy Secretary of State, expressed regret over the detention of South Korean nationals.

According to a local poll, nearly 60 percent of South Koreans believe the raid was excessive and voiced disappointment with Washington’s handling of the incident.

ICE confirmed that around 475 workers were detained in what has become the largest single-site immigration raid ever carried out in the US. According to the search warrant, the operation initially targeted four Hispanic workers suspected of entering the country illegally or violating visa terms.

SOUTH KOREA WANTS CHANGES TO US VISA SYSTEM

South Korea is pressing Washington to ease visa rules after the immigration raid. Businesses say restrictive US visas make it difficult to send skilled staff, forcing some workers to operate in legal grey areas.

Foreign Minister’s talks in Washington this week included plans for a joint working group to explore a new visa category for Korean nationals.

Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hoon-sik said the raid had harmed ""innocent people of Korea,”"" stressing that Seoul expects fair treatment. ""The standard changes every time, and there constantly has to be deal-making,"" he told reporters.

The dispute comes as both countries negotiate a trade pact tied to a $350 billion investment fund for US strategic industries.

The details are part of a lawsuit where the government is attempting to end protections for children. Declarations from families held at the facility in Dilley, Texas, which was reopened in March, described persistently cloudy water, delayed medical attention and long periods of time children are being detained.

Allegations of children fighting adults for clean water, distraught children and a protracted medical response first surfaced during the summer while the federal government asked a federal judge to end a policy protecting immigrant children.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles, who presides over the case, heard arguments from the government, which wants to end the Flores Settlement agreement. The policy limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires safe and sanitary conditions.

After Gee told the government last month to provide detention times, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that the number of children in custody over 72 hours decreased from an average of six days to five days in June and July, respectively. The “vast majority” spent less than 72 hours in CBP custody, the report stated.

Attorneys representing the children reviewed the report and said some children are still being held for several weeks or months and often without justification.

About 65 families spoke to attorneys since Dilley opened.

U.S. & World

“A huge percentage of families at Dilley are being apprehended from across the country as they dutifully appear for their immigration court hearings and ICE check-ins,” Leecia Welch, the deputy legal director at Children’s Rights who spoke with families, told The Associated Press in a statement.

The tap water is cloudy, smells strange and upsets stomachs, the families told their attorneys. The hand soap the facility provides for showers has been causing rashes, the families said. Children also struggle eating the food, like the snacks of graham crackers, apples, juice and milk.

Detainees are allowed to buy staples like bottled water for $1.21 from the commissary.

""I have never heard until now of children having to buy water,” said Welch, who has been visiting children in custody of CBP and the Office of Refugee Resettlement for eight years.

Families face costs as high as $5.73 for deodorant, $1.44 for soap, and $2.39 for toothpaste, Welch said in court documents. A single dose of Tylenol costs $1.30, she said.

A child with a stomachache waited six hours for a nurse and wasn't taken to a hospital with appendicitis until he vomited, court documents said. Another child fell on his arm and it wasn't until two hours later that the staff drove him to a hospital for an X-ray.

Parents said there are no organized activities for the children and only an hour of instruction from workbooks.

A woman's son told her that he ""doesn’t believe in God anymore because he prays to him but we still haven’t been able to get out of here,” according to her declaration, provided by Welch.

Some families are being released only to be detained again, Welch said. One family released after about 60 days in federal detention was asked to check in with ICE only to be detained at their appointment.",https://media.nbcdfw.com/2025/09/AP25260012484530.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-17 14:57:31.893645

“The proximity of the enforcement activity to the school raises serious questions about its justification, its impact on the school community, and whether appropriate oversight and approvals were secured,” wrote Pingree, whose district includes Portland.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper Friday that he is being held at Cumberland County Jail.

Chellie Pingree is seeking answers after a parent was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school last week.

“It is difficult to imagine any circumstance that could justify staging enforcement activity when children are arriving to learn,” Pingree wrote to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons Tuesday. “Beyond the harm it causes the community at-large, these actions have caused irreparable damage to the family, who is already dealing with difficult circumstances.”

According to a letter sent to parents from Portland Superintendent Ryan Scallon, on the morning of Sept. 11, unidentified agents in unmarked vehicles wearing vests marked “police” detained a parent on a Gerald E. Talbot Community School access road after dropping off their child.

“The proximity of the enforcement activity to the school raises serious questions about its justification, its impact on the school community, and whether appropriate oversight and approvals were secured,” wrote Pingree, whose district includes Portland.

She went on to cite research that found such actions trigger “measurable harm: lower attendance, diminished academic performance, increased anxiety and depression, and lasting trauma for students and families – including those not directly targeted,” adding that district officials have already reported a drop in attendance since the incident.

Pingree also raised concerns about the fact that the arresting officers were unidentifiable and said the action caused confusion among local law enforcement who were not informed of the activity.

According to the district, an administrator “approached the officers to inquire about their presence” and the officers “did not state what agency they represented.” The district later confirmed with the Portland Police Department that they were not local officers. The police department also assured the district “that if they learn of any proposed enforcement action planned at a school, they will work to ensure that it does not occur there,” Scallon wrote.

Portland police later told the Portland Press Herald that the parent, a Honduran immigrant, had earlier been arrested by local officers on an accusation of a Class D domestic violence assault and was released on bail one day before he was detained by ICE outside the school. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper Friday that he is being held at Cumberland County Jail.

“ICE had to make this arrest at large in the community because Portland authorities do not cooperate with ICE,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.

Pingree’s letter concluded with a demand for “a full accounting of this operation, including which agencies were involved, what coordination occurred between those agencies, and the justification for selecting the school as a location for enforcement activity.”

She also asked for “a written explanation of any review or retraining that occurs from this incident; a description of the guidance used to determine whether enforcement activity at schools is absolutely necessary; and a list of protocols adapted to minimize harm done to the community while practicing said enforcement activity.”

I was 16 when Governor Jan Brewer signed Senate Bill 1070 in 2010. I remember the fear in our communities. I remember the silence in neighborhoods, the way people stopped gathering at the park, the way families disappeared overnight. I remember the protests, the heartbreak, and the resilience. Arizona became a national symbol of racial profiling and anti-immigrant policy.

Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration (Published 2010)

Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill aimed at identifying, prosecuting and deporting illegal immigrants.

www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html

Now, 15 years later, the Supreme Court has reopened that wound.

Last week, the Court lifted restrictions on federal immigration agents, allowing them to resume “roving patrols” — sweeping operations that permit stops based on appearance, language, or location. The ruling, which temporarily overturns a lower court’s decision, echoes the darkest chapters of Arizona’s immigration history. It’s déjà vu for those of us who lived through SB 1070.

Supreme Court said ICE can stop you based on race, accent, job and location. What we know.

A group of Latino California residents and related organizations sued the government, saying they were being subject to illegal stops.

www.usatoday.com

The decision permits agents to detain individuals outside places like Home Depot, car washes, and bus stops — simply for speaking Spanish or appearing to seek day labor. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her powerful dissent, warned that this ruling “poses a threat not just to undocumented foreigners but to Americans of Hispanic descent.” She’s right. That threat is not theoretical. It’s personal. It’s the fear of being stopped while buying groceries. It’s the anxiety of walking your child to school. It’s the trauma of being treated like a suspect in your own home.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has rightly stated that the 9th Circuit’s ruling, which blocked these tactics, remains binding in our state. But legal nuance doesn’t always translate to lived experience. When federal agents are empowered to act on stereotypes, immigrants and people of color suffer — regardless of citizenship status. We’ve lived it.

SB 1070 left scars on everyone. It led to widespread fear, family separations, and a chilling effect on civic participation. It took years of organizing, litigation, and advocacy to push back against these efforts. And now, we must do it again.

This ruling is a test — not just of our legal system, but also of our moral compass. Will Arizona repeat its mistakes, or will we lead with compassion and courage?

If this ruling unsettles you, don’t stay silent. Call your representatives. Demand that Arizona uphold protections against racial profiling. Support local immigrant rights organizations. Show up at city council meetings. Share your story. Speak out when you see injustice.

Arizona is more than its past. We are a place of resilience, of diversity, of people who refuse to be silenced. We know this story too well. And this time, we won’t just fight back. We’ll lead forward.

Judge Kaplan’s order on Aug. 12 directed ICE to hold fewer people in the cells, allow migrants to call their lawyers, and provide medical and hygienic care.","A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Wednesday to continue improving conditions for migrants being held in a Manhattan federal building, writing that he was intervening to protect detainees from potentially “unconstitutional and inhumane treatment.”

The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, had already ordered the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency on Aug. 12 to improve conditions at the building, 26 Federal Plaza, where migrants were being held in squalid and cramped conditions, according to a lawsuit filed by a migrant detained there.

On Wednesday, Judge Kaplan issued a longer-lasting order known as a preliminary injunction, requiring ICE to continue addressing the poor conditions, such as overcrowding and a lack of basic hygiene. While the injunction is not the final decision in the case, the judge said that the evidence was strong enough to merit a temporary order while the lawsuit moves toward a conclusion.

In his 84-page decision, Judge Kaplan provisionally certified the lawsuit, originally filed on Aug. 8 by a Peruvian immigrant, as a class action, expanding its scope to include any ICE detainee held at 26 Federal Plaza for 12 hours or longer.

He also said that the plaintiffs were “very likely to succeed on the merits of the claims” that the conditions in the holding cells violated the First and Fifth Amendments.

“We aspire to treat all Americans — and those among us — with humanity,” he wrote. “We are legally and morally bound to adhere to the Constitution and laws of the United States with respect to everyone within our borders.”

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency has previously cast the allegations in the lawsuit as false.

The 10th-floor holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza have emerged as a defining flashpoint of President Trump’s immigration crackdown in New York City. The cells, typically meant to hold a small number of people for just a few hours, became crowded this year as ICE accelerated arrests at nearby immigration courts, detaining dozens of people a day.

Migrants soon began complaining about being held in the cells for days, and even up to three weeks. They said they were forced to sleep on the floor or sitting upright, and were deprived of showers, sufficient medical care and legal representation. Video recorded by a migrant who sneaked a cellphone into the cells in July prompted Democratic lawmakers to escalate their demands to inspect the facilities, only to be denied access by ICE.

Judge Kaplan’s order on Aug. 12 directed ICE to hold fewer people in the cells, allow migrants to call their lawyers, and provide medical and hygienic care.

The agency has argued that the cells are used only for short-term confinement and that most detainees are transferred to other detention facilities within 72 hours, offering some data to that effect in legal filings.

But Judge Kaplan wrote on Wednesday that the arguments and statistics the agency had provided were “unpersuasive” and that they “obscure more than they illuminate.”

The judge concluded that the improvements made by ICE had resulted from his previous order in August, and that there were no assurances that those improvements would continue without the preliminary injunction he issued on Wednesday.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/22/multimedia/22met-migrant-video-bztg/22met-migrant-video-bztg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 13:57:18.927135

In the wake of media coverage of conditions at the field office, the Burlington Select Board and Building Department sought entry to the building.
""It got to the point where sometimes you couldn't even sit down.” Pineda spent two days at the Burlington field office, uncomfortable and hungry.","Hundreds of people detained at ICE's New England Regional Headquarters in Burlington were held there for multiple days over the spring and summer, despite the agency's admission that the facility is not designed to house detainees for extended periods.

Between Jan. 20, when President Trump returned to office, and the end of July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement booked in more than 2,700 people, according to a WBUR analysis of information from the Deportation Data Project.

Of those, nearly half, or 1,338 people, were transferred out of Burlington within 12 hours. Another 353 were moved within a day. But 1,005 were held for multiple days, and in several cases, for more than a week.

Through July, at least 176 people were held in the Burlington field office for three days or more. In one case, a Brazilian man was held for 20 days.

These long stays appear to exceed even ICE's new detainment standards. According to a July 24 letter from ICE to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the agency issued a temporary waiver in June so that ""aliens may be housed in a holding facility for up to, but not exceeding, 72 hours, absent exceptional circumstances.""

ICE did not respond to WBUR's questions about the longer Burlington detentions.

In a statement, Warren said, ""ICE’s responses are insufficient and don’t match the reality on the ground.""

""The reports coming out of ICE field offices continue to be deeply concerning,"" she said.

The ICE letter said the agency inspects conditions at its holding room facilities ""through a formal self-inspection program, and that it's committed to ""safe, secure, and humane environments"" for those in its custody.

But people detained in Burlington have told a very different story, from a Milford High School volleyball player held for six days in a crowd of men to women held for days without sanitary products.

""Immigrants are imprisoned here in overcrowded cells,"" said Rev. Andrew Harris, a minister at the nearby Burlington United Church of Christ, during a recent protest outside the ICE facility. Harris, who helps organize a weekly demonstration there, pointed to the squat, two-story building, recounting what former detainees have said publicly about the conditions inside.

""There are no beds, so people sleep on concrete floors,"" Harris told a crowd of about 500 people. ""There are no clocks, no showers, no soap, no medicine,"" he said; people held there also have complained about sharing a toilet with large numbers of people and no privacy.

ICE has refuted some of these claims and said detainees are given ""ample food, regular access to phones, showers and legal representation as well as medical care when needed.”

The field office is a 42,000-square-foot building in a busy office park near the Burlington Mall. The facility is primarily an administrative site, where people go for routine check-ins with immigration officials. It also serves as a regional intake center, where ICE takes people after arresting them.

Most people are transferred quickly to detention centers like the Plymouth County jail or facilities out of state. But as ICE launched ""Operation Patriot"" in the spring, a highly publicized increase in immigration enforcement and patrols in Massachusetts, hundreds of arrestees got stuck waiting in Burlington.

The number of people held at the Burlington office fluctuates day to day, but during the weeks around the May surge, agents booked about 40-50 people per day. In one day, they brought 101 people in; on another, 107.

And now with the launch of ""Patriot 2.0"" — a new immigration enforcement operation in Massachusetts — many more people are likely to spend time inside Burlington in the coming weeks.

""This latest enforcement 'surge' will inevitably cause overcrowding, denial of due process, and any number of other violations of the legal and human rights of detainees,"" said Matt Cameron, a Boston immigration attorney.

Very few outsiders have been allowed into the ICE field office in recent months, but in early June, U.S. Reps. Seth Moulton and Jake Auchincloss got a rare look inside.

""This is supposed to be a processing facility where people stay for six to 12 hours,"" Moulton told reporters at the time. ""It's obviously completely inappropriate — I would say, inhumane — for long-term detention.""

The two congressmen had gone to the facility to meet Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, the 18-year-old volleyball player from Milford who had just been released after six days in detention. Da Silva had not been the intended target of immigration agents; they’d been looking for his father. But they picked him up anyway, in what immigration enforcement officials refer to as a ""collateral"" arrest.

ICE had claimed Marcelo was ""an exceptional case,"" Auchincloss said, and that most people were booked in and out of the field office in a matter of hours.

Until now, that's been difficult to verify. Neither reporters nor members of the public have been permitted inside, and immigration lawyers haven't been allowed into the secure holding area in the back of the building. The agency also has denied Burlington town officials access to inspect the building.

In the wake of media coverage of conditions at the field office, the Burlington Select Board and Building Department sought entry to the building. When ICE refused, the town petitioned the decision in district court. But that request also was recently denied, leaving the town with no option to appeal, according to Select Board Chairman Mike Espejo.

""I’ve probably put more time and thought into this issue than any other during my seven years in town government,"" Espejo wrote on Facebook last week. ""This is all about ensuring that all of our buildings in town are used in the manner in which they are designed and permitted and ensuring that anyone that enters the Town of Burlington is treated ethically and fairly.""

An ICE spokesperson told WBUR in an email, ""We never intend for anyone’s stay at Burlington to be an extended one."" There are occasions when it happens, the statement continued, and ""these instances are a rarity.""

Yet that's not what the data shows.

While ICE wrote in its letter to Warren that a March 31 ""self-inspection"" found no detainees in custody at that time had been held for more than 12 hours, the Deportation Data Project reveals that at least 50 people were held for longer than that in the preceding ten days.

Most of the extended stays in Burlington coincided with the May arrest surge, but at least 38 more occurred in June and July, according to the data analyzed by WBUR.

The data also shows that while ICE has said it's pursuing the ""worst of the worst"" in its immigration arrests, about half of those detained in Burlington had no criminal history, just civil immigration violations. According to the data, 508 people booked into Burlington had some criminal conviction; another 937 had pending charges.

""ICE facilities like Burlington’s are being forced into roles they were never meant to play, because of the Trump Administration’s chaotic and inhumane decisions,"" Moulton said in an email after WBUR shared the results of the new data analysis.

""If the data being reported is accurate, it is unacceptable that people are being held there for days — or even weeks — without adequate medical care, access to showers, or beds,"" he said, noting that the latest ICE surge in the station “will only make these problems worse.""

The dataset includes a hold that lasted 34 days, and another that lasted 55 days. ICE did not respond to questions about whether these extreme outliers are accurate or the result of a data entry error.

José Pineda, an East Boston resident, was stopped by five ICE agents on May 27 while driving to work. Pineda was born in El Salvador but has temporary protected status, which gives him the right to live and work in the U.S. He's lived in the country for 30 years and has a 12-year-old daughter who was born here.

Pineda said he gave the agents his driver's license and explained his legal status, but they arrested him anyway.

""They said, 'Those who aren't born here don't have rights,' "" he recounted in Spanish.

Pineda was brought to Burlington, where he said he was placed in a crowded room with 40 to 50 other men.

""After a couple of hours, they moved me to another room that was a bit emptier,"" he said. But soon, many more men arrived. ""It got to the point where sometimes you couldn't even sit down.”

Pineda spent two days at the Burlington field office, uncomfortable and hungry. He slept on a concrete floor with only a mylar blanket, and was fed ""a sour and inedible pudding"" on the first day and a ""cup of oats and a small burrito"" on the second, according to a complaint his lawyers filed with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE.

Pineda said he'd never been detained or spent time in jail before. Other men held there at the time told him a jail cell was ""more comfortable than these little rooms packed with people.""

After two days, Pineda was released. He said he's still having nightmares about the experience, but his detainment has taken an especially hard toll on his daughter, Michelle Valentina Pineda, according to the complaint.

""I don't want any more separations of families,"" Michelle said at a community listening event hosted by Rep. Ayanna Pressley earlier this summer. ""Family belongs together and I don't want any kid to know what I've been through and what happened to me.""

Mirian Albert, a senior attorney with Lawyers for Civil Rights and one of Pineda's lawyers, said ICE's new surge is hitting immigrant communities like New Bedford and Chelsea hard.

""Families and communities are living in fear again,"" she said. ""Many of them are paralyzed in many of their daily activities.""

And as happened during the spring surge, she expects Burlington will soon be crowded with people stuck there for days at a time.

The new operation differs from Midway Blitz in that it will look more like the LA effort, with more indiscriminate raids, sources said.
While neither immigration enforcement operation in Illinois is relying on National Guard troops, President Trump on Tuesday renewed his threat to send troops to Chicago to fight crime.","The Trump administration has launched a second immigration enforcement operation in the Chicago area, with a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection sweep that began on Tuesday.

The dual operations are similar, but each with their own mission and their own personnel, neither of which includes local police agencies or federal troops.

Both efforts involve federal agents arresting criminal and non-criminal immigrants in deportation sweeps.

The immigration sweeps are both statewide efforts, not merely focused on Chicago and the suburbs.

The first, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement initiative dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" began earlier this month.

The new initiative, dubbed ""Operation At Large"" was announced Tuesday on social media by Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who led controversial immigration enforcement raids in southern California this summer.

U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-IL) – whose 14th Congressional District includes several western and southwestern suburbs, including Aurora, Joliet, Naperville, and DeKalb – was briefed about ""Operation Midway Blitz"" on Monday by ICE leaders who shared precisely who they are looking for.

""Anyone who has been arrested and booked, charged, or convicted, and then released by local law enforcement and is not a lawfully present U.S. person is eligible for their enforcement operation,"" she said. ""So far they have told me that 250 people have been arrested.""

Anyone found in the U.S. illegally – even non-criminals – can be taken in.

Newly deputized agents on loan from other federal agencies are being used for Midway Blitz.

""Officials from the Department of Justice; to include U.S. Marshals, DEA agents – Drug Enforcement Agency agents – and ATF,"" Underwood said.

Midway Blitz will not include raids of Home Depots and car washes. When will it end?

""They would not give me a termination date, and said that the director of ICE would be notified by the Trump administration,"" Underwood said.

The second immigration sweep, ""Operation At Large,"" started on Tuesday, according to CBS News sources, and is being led by Bovino, who headed the border patrol's effort to target immigration in Los Angeles this summer.

The new operation differs from Midway Blitz in that it will look more like the LA effort, with more indiscriminate raids, sources said. Bovino's team has a history of targeting Home Depots and car washes.

Notably, neither effort is using the National Guard, as they have not been mobilized in Illinois.

Nonetheless, it leaves Underwood's constituents unsettled.

""They're scared that this is going to come to their block, their cul-de-sac, then a knock on their door,"" Underwood said.

Underwood says those being arrested are being taken to Wisconsin and Indiana for holding as their cases get sorted out.

ICE officials insisted to Underwood that they don't pursue people – meaning, if the target does not make themselves immediately available to detainment, ICE won't engage in a high-speed chase.

She said that flies in the face of what's actually happened on the ground, pointing to the fatal shooting in Franklin Park last week, when an ICE agent shot a man during an arrest, after he allegedly drove at agents, and dragged one of them with his car.

While neither immigration enforcement operation in Illinois is relying on National Guard troops, President Trump on Tuesday renewed his threat to send troops to Chicago to fight crime.

""If they lose less than six or seven people a week with murder, they're doing a great job in their opinion. Chicago is a death trap, and I'm going to make it just like I did with D.C., just like I'll do with Memphis,"" he said.

Gov. Pritzker responded to the president on Tuesday morning, saying, ""you can't take anything that he says seriously,"" noting Mr. Trump has repeatedly reversed course on possible plans to deploy the National Guard in Chicago.

""When he said that he wasn't coming to Chicago, I didn't trust that. When he says he is coming to Chicago, it's hard to believe anything he says,"" Pritzker said.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/09/17d35935-e033-4212-bce8-a340544a389b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/e33e2ba56d459d64f8a1540824335eec/gettyimages-2223407537.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 15:57:08.823877

NEW YORK – A U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction today that would improve conditions for people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at 26 Federal Plaza. Notably, the order grants class certification and prohibits ICE from detaining people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person. The order also requires ICE to improve access to hygiene, provide sleeping mats and access to adequate soap and other hygiene products, and ensure people detained can make free, unmonitored, and confidential calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained.

In August, the court granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from holding people in abusive conditions at 26 Federal Plaza after the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union, Make the Road New York, and Wang Hecker LLP filed a class action lawsuit.

The temporary holding facility has come under fire in recent months, after ICE held more than 100 people, sometimes for weeks, in inhumane and unsanitary conditions without beds, showers, or adequate medical support. The government also banned in-person legal visitation, any confidential phone or video communication, and confidential exchange of written documents, in violation of people’s First and Fifth Amendment rights.

Quotes from co-counsel are as follows:

“Today’s ruling is an important win for immigrants’ rights and affirms what we’ve known all along: ICE’s conduct at 26 Federal Plaza is inhumane, illegal and a direct violation of the Constitution,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel with the ACLU’s National Prison Project. “No person should be denied medical care, access to a lawyer, or basic dignity when they are held in government custody – and we’ll continue to fight to hold ICE accountable.”

“The cruel policy of subjecting individuals to degrading treatment and inhumane conditions is deeply disturbing. And now, the court has made it abundantly clear that it is also illegal,” said Harold Solis, Co-Legal Director of Make the Road New York. “As always, we’ll remain vigilant to ensure the government complies with today’s decision.”

“Today’s order rightly affirms that ICE cannot hold people in the dehumanizing, abusive conditions at 26 Federal Plaza,” said Bobby Hodgson, Assistant Legal Director at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “We’ll continue to fight to hold the Trump administration accountable and end ICE’s unconstitutional detention practices at 26 Federal Plaza for good.”

“The Court today sent a clear and much-needed message: ICE cannot flagrantly disregard the constitutional rights and basic human needs of the immigrants it detains at 26 Federal Plaza,” said Heather Gregorio of Wang Hecker LLP. “This order is an important step in the ongoing fight to hold the government accountable.”

County supervisors voted Tuesday to approve a motion, introduced by Supervisor Hilda Solis, to beef up oversight of data gathered by law enforcement devices known as automated license plate readers.

It’s already illegal in California for local law enforcement agencies to share information gleaned from license plate readers with federal agencies such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement without a warrant.

But after a summer of ramped-up deportations, the county supervisors decided to impose more transparency on who’s requesting license plate data from the Sheriff’s Department — and when the agency provides it.

The change will create a clear policy that the data cannot be “disclosed, transferred, or otherwise made available” to immigration officials except when “expressly required” by law or if they have a warrant.

“In a place like Los Angeles County, where residents depend on cars for nearly every aspect of daily life, people must feel safe traveling from place to place without fear that their movements are being tracked, stored, and shared in ways that violate their privacy,” the motion states.

Supervisor Kathryn Barger cast the sole no vote. Helen Chavez, a spokesperson for Barger, said the supervisor voted against the motion because it calls for the county to support a bill that would limit the amount of time law enforcement can keep most license plate data to 60 days. Law enforcement has opposed that bill, she said.

Across the country, law enforcement agencies use cameras to collect data on millions of vehicles, poring over the records for clues to help find stolen vehicles, crime suspects or missing persons.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement it has roughly 366 fixed licensed plate readers from Motorola Vigilant and 476 from Flock Safety in contract cities and unincorporated areas. An additional 89 mobile systems from Motorola are mounted on vehicles that patrol these areas.

The department said its policy already prohibits it from sharing data from plate readers, known as ALPR, with any entity that “does not have a lawful purpose for receiving it.”

“LASD shares ALPR data with other law enforcement agencies only under an executed inter-agency agreement, which requires all parties to collect, access, use, and disclose the data in compliance with applicable law,” the statement read. “LASD has no current agreements for ALPR data sharing with any federal agency.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that the agency has multiple resources at its “fingertips to ensure federal law is enforced in Los Angeles, and throughout the entire country.”

“These sanctuary politicians’ efforts to stop the Sheriff’s Department from cooperating with ICE are reckless and will not deter ICE from enforcing the law,” McLaughlin said.

Southern California law enforcement departments — including LAPD and authorities in San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties — have been accused of routinely flouting state law by sharing license plate data with federal agents. A recent report from CalMatters cited records obtained by the anti-surveillance group Oakland Privacy that showed more than 100 instances in a single month when local police queried databases for federal agencies.

“When you collect this data, it’s really hard to control,” said Catherine Crump, director of UC Berkeley’s Technology & Public Policy Clinic. “It’s no different from once you share your data with Meta or Google, they’re going to repackage your data and sell it to advertisers and you don’t have any idea which of the advertising companies have your data.”

Even with the board cracking down on data sharing, advocates say it’s nearly impossible to ensure federal agents are barred from license plate data in L.A. County.

Dave Maass, the director of investigations for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said private companies that operate in California still collect and sell data that ICE can use.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection also has its own license plate readers around Southern California, he said.

Maass said even if a county bars its local sheriff’s department from sharing data with ICE, it’s difficult to guarantee the rule is followed by the rank-and-file. Immigration officers could informally pass on a plate number to a deputy with access to the system.

“Maybe they run the plate,” Maass says. “Unless there’s some public records release from the Los Angeles side of things, we just really don’t know who accessed the system.”

Under the motion passed Tuesday, the sheriff department would need to regularly report what agencies asked for license plate data to two county watchdogs groups — the Office of Inspector General and the Civilian Oversight Commission.

“Having somebody who is somewhat independent and whose role is more aggressively overseeing reviewing these searches is actually quite a big deal,” Maass said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9800f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3800x1995+0+269/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fzbk%2Fdamlat_images%2FLA%2FLA_PHOTO_SELECTS%2F2014_05%2F1862760_FI_0506_lawenforce_RL_003.JPG,N,,2025-09-17 13:56:58.965916

Firouzeh Firouzabadi was able to hug her son, Reza Zavvar, in their driveway on Saturday, just feet from where he was arrested by federal agents while walking his dog this summer.

“It’s amazing,” Zavvar said. “I’m glad it’s over.”

He also had an emotional reunion with his beloved dog, Duke.

Days after his happy homecoming, the 52-year-old recounted the morning of June 28.

“When I saw the first ICE agent exit his car and walk towards me with his hand on his weapon and asking if my dog is friendly, I said ‘Yes he is friendly,’"" he said. ""My heart kind of, like, sank — like, I can't believe this is happening.”

Zavvar sat down with News4 on Tuesday to reflect on the 77 days he spent in federal detention.

“Unnecessary, inhumane, corrupt,” he said.

Zavvar said he came to the U.S. from Iran legally as a student when he was 12 and eventually got his green card.

Years after a misdemeanor for marijuana possession in the late 1990s, he was stopped while reentering the country in 2004, which started the deportation process, according to his attorney.

His attorney said that case was resolved in 2007 when he was granted a ""withholding of removal order"" to Iran.

“Saying that you can stay here as long as you don’t get in trouble, that you stay clean and just stay here, work, pay taxes, and that’s what I was doing,” Zavvar said.

But nearly two decades later, ICE agents surrounded him in his quiet Gaithersburg neighborhood.

Zavvar said after he was picked up in June, he was first taken to a facility in Baltimore, where he spent five days in a holding cell. The cell had 30 to 40 people sleeping on a concrete floor, he said.

He was then transported to a detention center in Texas, according to online ICE detention records.

He said he was next sent to Ohio, back to Baltimore and eventually landed in Louisiana.

In July, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement, ""Zavvar had almost 20 years to self-deport and leave the U.S. The Trump administration will not ignore the rule of law […] criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.”

“I really didn't think that it would be to this extent and the types of people that they’re apprehending and the way that they’re going about doing it,” Zavvar said.

Loved ones said the government gave orders to deport him to Romania or Australia. However, with the help of family, friends and coworkers rallying around him and raising more than $50,000 for his legal fees, a judge ordered his release last week.

“I’m getting to that point that I’m believing right now because I can touch him, you know,” Zavvar's mother, said.

Now that he’s getting back to his routine, Zavaar said he isn't out of the woods. He's waiting for an immigration judge to be assigned to his case.

“We’re going to argue that the laws that were used to initially deport me based on my marijuana conviction in 1998, that those laws no longer exist, and to get my green card back and apply for citizenship, which I partly blame myself for that because I should have done that a little while ago,” he said.

And while he waits for his next day in court, his mother said this ordeal has taught her a valuable lesson:

(KOIN) – After Marion County filed a federal lawsuit seeking clarity on Oregon’s sanctuary state law, several Oregon counties are signing on to a letter in support of the litigation.

Marion County’s lawsuit was filed in August — seeking a federal court’s opinion on whether the county has the authority to turn over parole records of four alleged undocumented immigrants under Oregon’s sanctuary law.

Marion County’s lawsuit comes after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents served subpoenas to the county on August 1, requesting the records of four people on parole for crimes including multiple rape convictions, multiple sexual abuse convictions and convictions for kidnapping/robbery. According to court documents, a fifth subpoena was served for an individual whose identity was not clear at the time.

Federal authorities gave the county a deadline of August 18 to turn over the records, including information about the individuals’ criminal charges, home address, phone number, name of employer or school, driver’s license number and country of birth, court documents claim.

In the lawsuit — filed against Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons — the county argues that Oregon’s sanctuary law conflicts with state public records law and federal immigration law.

Now, a handful of Oregon counties are supporting the lawsuit, as reported by OPB.

In a draft letter to Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Marion County Board wrote, “Legal uncertainty harms everyone and benefits no one. It is currently unclear how Oregon’s Sanctuary Promise Act, Oregon’s Public Records Act, and federal laws interact and apply due to apparent conflicts, including in situations where a local government is served with an administrative subpoena.”

According to the draft, the counties that have signed the letter in support of the lawsuit include Baker, Clackamas, Columbia, Crook, Deschutes, Jefferson, Klamath, Linn, Malheur, Marion, Polk, Tillamook and Union counties.

The letter — which was shared with KOIN 6 News — goes on to say that the counties are encouraging the state to ask the federal court for a detailed opinion that will help local governments comply with local, state and federal laws.

A spokesperson for the Marion County Board told KOIN 6 that other Oregon counties are considering signing the letter and expect more signatures in the coming weeks.

In response to Oregon counties showing support for Marion County’s lawsuit, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said, “Oregon’s sanctuary law has already been upheld by the courts, including the Ninth Circuit, which made clear it does not conflict with federal law. My office has also been clear with Marion County and others, Oregon sanctuary law allows officials to produce information in response to a judicial warrant, but an administrative subpoena from ICE is not a judicial warrant.”

Rayfield continued, “For immigrant communities, these legal battles can create fear and confusion. My office will vigorously defend Oregon’s sanctuary law, so families feel safe reporting crimes, sending their kids to school, and living their lives without fear of being targeted unfairly.”

Spokespeople for Gov. Kotek and U.S. Attorney General Bondi declined to comment on the pending litigation.

Oregon counties are not the only group showing support for Marion County’s lawsuit.

In late August, 34 out of 36 Oregon sheriffs came out in support of the lawsuit — also seeking clarity on ICE enforcement.

The two sheriffs who did not join that letter were Washington County Sheriff Caprice Massey and Multnomah County Sheriff Nicole Morrisey O’Donnell.

In a statement shared with KOIN 6, Sheriff Massey explained her reason for not signing the letter in support of Marion County’s lawsuit.

clarification and guidance from federal courts regarding any conflicts between federal

immigration and Oregon sanctuary laws. Of note, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office has

not recently received administrative subpoenas like those described in the Marion County

lawsuit. Those subpoenas were directed to individuals on parole or probation. In Washington

County, the Department of Community Corrections is a separate county department and not

under the Sheriff’s authority,” Washington County Sheriff Massey wrote.

Meanwhile, Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Deputy John Plock told KOIN 6, “Sheriff Morrisey O’Donnell supports efforts to seek legal clarity from the courts regarding the intersection of Oregon’s sanctuary laws and federal requests for information. However, she did not sign the OSSA letter because the administrative subpoenas at the center of the Declaratory Judgement Complaint filed by Marion County were not directed to the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office. Instead, they were sent to the Multnomah County Department of Community Justice (DCJ), which is a separate county department.”

Deputy Plock continued, “Out of respect for that separation and in recognition that DCJ—not the Sheriff’s Office—is the entity directly involved, Sheriff Morrisey O’Donnell chose not to speak or act on behalf of another department.”

Since 1987, Oregon has been a sanctuary state and was the first state in the nation to pass a statewide law stopping state and local police from aiding federal authorities with immigration enforcement.

Marion County’s lawsuit points to the Federal Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which gives federal immigration officers broad authority to enforce immigration laws, including the use of subpoenas to request records.

“Federal Immigration Law authorizes states and localities to cooperate with the federal government in the identifications, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States,” the lawsuit explains.

The complaint also points to conflicts with Oregon law, explaining that under state law, a public body cannot disclose certain information, such as an individual’s address, work or school schedules, or social media information for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement.",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/immigration_ice_12062025_AP25157540699407_04dfc5-e1755451111380.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-17 13:57:28.288268

Cambriae W. Lee, media@aclupa.org, 215-671-6832

Bucks County, Pa. — Community advocates rallied today outside the Bucks County courthouse preceding a preliminary injunction hearing challenging Sheriff Fred Harran's illegal decision to enter a 287(g) agreement with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The lawsuit, Make the Road Pennsylvania, et al. v. Harran, brought by the ACLU of Pennsylvania and the Community Justice Project, argues the sheriff acted unilaterally by entering the agreement without county approval, which is against the law.

Advocate leaders at the morning rally expressed their concerns:

""Every single person has a right to live safely, but 287(g) agreements like this one do the opposite. They spread fear, erode trust between communities and their government, and drive people into the shadows. So let’s talk about what this is really about: It’s about expanding the tentacles of Washington, D.C., into every corner of our country and our communities. It’s about giving some people free rein to target, profile, and arrest anyone they deem a threat. If today it’s immigrants, tomorrow it’s you,"" stated Diana Robinson, co-executive director of Make the Road Pennsylvania.

""The Welcome Project PA stands in solidarity with immigrant communities in Bucks County and beyond, affirming that our communities are safer and better when immigrant communities have access to safe due process and legal assistance,” said Josh Blakesley, executive director of The Welcome Project PA. “This program divides our communities and causes more fear and uncertainty. Residents of Bucks County do not want this, and neither do we!”

""The brunt of these 287(g) agreements is always felt by Black and brown communities, who become the targets of the unlawful racial profiling and harassment they manufacture. Families are in fear, worrying that their loved ones may not return home when they leave — no one should live like that. All Bucks County residents deserve to be treated with humanity and dignity. And, their taxpayer dollars should be spent on vital services, not tearing families apart in order to carry out the federal administration's destructive deportation plan against our immigrant neighbors,” said Danitra Sherman, deputy advocacy and policy director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania.

“It would have put cameras on all 6,200 deportation officers,” Houser said.
Although ICE’s budget has skyrocketed during Trump’s second term, the official confirmed body cameras haven’t been distributed to officials across the agency carrying out the president’s immigration enforcement agenda.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration discontinued its four-year body camera program.
Despite the lack of ICE body camera footage from the Franklin Park shooting, Houser said he believes there will still be a “robust” investigation into whether it was proper.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents weren’t wearing body cameras during the deadly shooting of a Mexican immigrant last week in the suburbs because a program requiring them was scrapped by the Trump administration.

In late 2021, ICE launched a $25 million body camera pilot program that was discontinued soon after President Donald Trump took office, Jason Houser, chief of staff for ICE from 2021 to 2023, said in an interview Tuesday.

“It would have put cameras on all 6,200 deportation officers,” Houser said. “So if they would have carried through with the timeline we had in place, they would all be wearing them.”

Two ICE agents weren’t wearing body-worn cameras when one of them fatally shot Silverio Villegas González in a traffic stop Friday in Franklin Park, according to a federal official who asked not to be identified.

Although ICE’s budget has skyrocketed during Trump’s second term, the official confirmed body cameras haven’t been distributed to officials across the agency carrying out the president’s immigration enforcement agenda.

Chicago cops and suburban officers have long been required to wear the devices. Earlier this year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration discontinued its four-year body camera program. The status of other federal agencies’ programs is unclear. A Trump executive order ended a mandate for federal agents to wear the devices.

Although ICE agents aren’t now required to wear body cameras, Houser pointed out they’ve been used in isolated situations this year, including a protest at an ICE facility in May in New Jersey where Newark’s mayor was arrested and ICE body cam video was used in a trespassing case against him.

Despite the lack of ICE body camera footage from the Franklin Park shooting, Houser said he believes there will still be a “robust” investigation into whether it was proper.

Under ICE policies, agents are instructed not to shoot at cars unless they’re in fear for their lives and have taken the safety of bystanders and other officers into account.

“There’s discretion in those tactical moments,” Houser said.

Houser questioned why the officers were assigned to that particular mission in the first place.

“When you have an administration that’s seeking quotas and media hits,” he said, “that puts officers at risk.”

Houser also said the Trump administration’s surge of immigration agents in Democrat-run cities like Chicago is leaving cities where the agents came from understaffed and unable to keep up with their work there.

The FBI, DEA, ATF and IRS have more agents working on immigration enforcement than ICE — depleting their core missions of fighting other types of crime, Houser said.

“Standing on a street corner in Franklin Park, stopping every other car, the percentage of you’re going to find somebody that then leads to a removal is extremely low,” he said. “None of this has to do with going after that 2% of people that have taken advantage of the immigration system that are convicted criminals — rapists, murderers — or the 1.5 million that have final orders of removal.”

Houser said the U.S. immigration system has been broken for decades and both parties are to blame.

“We can also question what went on in the Biden administration, right?” Houser said, referring to policies that “created surges and incentivized recidivism at the border.”

“We need to wake up and understand that we need [immigration] pathways for our economy to grow and for our communities to grow, and that has always been foundational to the American experience,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security, which operates ICE, has said Villegas González, a Mexican national described as a devout family man, fled a traffic stop and dragged an ICE agent “a significant distance with his car.” The agent “sustained multiple injuries,” DHS said.

A witness, Sergio, has told the Sun-Times he witnessed part of the deadly encounter and didn’t see an ICE agent being dragged by Villegas González’s car, adding that videos posted online appear to disprove the official narrative.

“If things don’t stop, it’s only going to be a few more days before people start fighting back,” said Sergio, who said he legally immigrated from Mexico and only wanted to be identified by his first name.

On Monday, Gov. JB Pritzker said he was frustrated at what he believes is a lack of transparency about how Villegas González’s death is being investigated. And it’s still unclear who exactly is handling it.

In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tracy McLaughlin said, “All shootings are initially reviewed by the appropriate federal, state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency principally charged with first response to the incident. Following a review of the incident by the appropriate investigative agency, ICE will conduct an independent review of the critical incident.”

McLaughlin said assaults on ICE agents are up “1,000%.”

According to a 2021 ICE firearms and use-of-force handbook obtained by the Sun-Times, an ICE firearms committee reviews shootings to see if they complied with the agency’s guidelines, and if any policies need to be changed. If necessary, the committee can refer the case to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility for an additional review.

The bulletin noted: “ICE employees involved in a critical incident should anticipate an investigation by local authorities. They may be interviewed by local police or subpoenaed to a local grand jury or court proceeding.”

Dawn Catanzaro, a spokesperson for the village of Franklin Park, said, “the FBI Chicago field office is in charge of the investigation,” referring questions to that agency. An FBI spokesperson said the FBI responded to the shooting and assisted law enforcement on the scene, but wouldn’t comment on involvement in an ongoing investigation.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff85821/2147483647/strip/true/crop/969x553+15+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0d%2F5bcfcd5159b68d7e7030d036aac6%2Fpolicebodycamera-1.png,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:23.286867

Johnson said he taking proactive steps to protect the rights of people to publicly demonstrate in light of the recent ICE operations in and around Chicago.

The mayor kept his cool as he responded to reporter's questions on Tuesday. However, when he was asked about whether federal troops could help make Chicago's streets safer, it touched a nerve.

""The fact of the matter is, no one has asked me to send federal troops into this city to make it safe. It has never come up. It never came up during the campaign. It's never come up in the first two years,"" Johnson said.

The mayor's fiery comments comes as President Donald Trump once again flip flopped on sending the National Guard to Chicago.

""If they lose less than six or seven people a week with murder, they're doing a great job in their opinion,"" Trump said. ""Chicago is a death trap, and I'm going to make it just like I did with DC just like I'll do with Memphis.""

Mayor Johnson bristled at that plan, noting the city's reduction in violent crime this year.

""We're not going to allow the president United States of America, or any of his ilk, look at the work that we're doing across this country. And then now we're experiencing some level of reprieve, and now he wants to put his name on our paper. No, not going to tolerate it,"" Johnson said.

Johnson signed an executive order to reaffirm protections for people who want to demonstrate against any federal action in Chicago.

He cited a recent clash at the ICE processing facility in Broadview as an example of why the order was important.

""This President is so unhinged, we just don't know what his directives are going to be. The point is, is that there's something very fundamental about our country, and that's the ability to be able to peacefully assemble and petition its government,"" the mayor said.

29 “Warren Questions ICE About Reports of Misuse of Solitary Confinement at Immigration Detention Facilities,” U.S.","Executive Summary

The Crisis

The United States maintains the world’s largest immigration detention system, detaining an average daily population of nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention.¹ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detains people in a network of facilities across the country where they often endure inhuman conditions, including solitary confinement.² Solitary confinement is the practice of isolating people in small cells without meaningful human contact for 22 hours or more per day.³

Over the past decade, the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention has risen at an alarming rate, with unprecedented numbers of immigrants held in isolation.⁴ Congress recently authorized a significant increase in funding to expand immigration detention, which will likely exacerbate this widespread, prolonged use of solitary confinement as detention capacity increases.⁵

The effects of prolonged solitary confinement can be lethal, as in the case of Charles Leo Daniel, who died after spending more than 13 years of his life in solitary confinement in various detention settings, including almost four years in solitary confinement in ICE detention.⁶ The adverse health effects of solitary confinement are well-established, extensively researched, and thoroughly documented across decades of literature,⁷ including post-traumatic stress disorder, self-harm, elevated suicide risks, lasting brain damage, and hallucinations.⁸ These effects often persist beyond the confinement period, resulting in enduring physical and psychological disabilities, especially among people with preexisting medical and mental health conditions.⁹ Vulnerable populations, including those with medical and mental health conditions, are often subjected to solitary confinement at high rates despite ICE’s own directives mandating its use as a last resort.¹⁰

Key Findings

This report, “Cruelty Campaign: Solitary Confinement in U.S. Immigration Detention,” authored by faculty and students from Harvard Law School’s Empirical Research Services and the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program (HIRCP), the Peeler Immigration Lab, and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), provides an updated analysis of solitary confinement in U.S. immigration detention with an additional regional focus on facilities in New England. It builds on the February 2024 report, “‘Endless Nightmare’: Torture and Inhuman Treatment in Solitary Confinement in U.S. Immigration Detention,” by the same authors.¹¹

Based on publicly available ICE data and records obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, “Cruelty Campaign” reveals alarming trends in the use of solitary confinement:

Over a span of just 14 months, from April 2024 to May 2025, more than 10,500 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigration detention centers across the United States.

In the first four months of the second Trump presidency, the monthly increase in the use of solitary confinement was twice the rate observed between 2018 and 2023, and more than six times higher than during the end of the previous administration.¹²

On average, during the first three months of 2025, solitary confinement placements involving people with vulnerabilities lasted more than twice as long as they did in the first fiscal quarter of 2022, when ICE began reporting statistics on the solitary confinement of vulnerable populations.¹³ This increase is evident in both the average consecutive days per placement (38 days in early 2025 compared to 14 days in late 2021) and the average cumulative days per person (44 days in early 2025 compared to 20 days in late 2021).¹⁴

Detailed analysis of facilities in New England shows that between 2018 and 2023, nearly three out of four solitary confinement placements lasted 15 days or longer, the threshold that UN human rights experts consider to be torture.¹⁵ On average, people spent about a month in solitary confinement, and some were isolated for more than a year.¹⁶

Where mental health status was reported, almost half of the solitary confinement placements in immigration detention in New England involved individuals with reported mental health conditions,¹⁷ contrary to ICE directives requiring its use only as a last resort for vulnerable populations.¹⁸

Notably, the average number of vulnerable individuals subjected to solitary confinement nationally increased by approximately 56 percent per quarter in fiscal year 2025 compared to 2022, with increasing numbers of individuals experiencing multiple placements.¹⁹

Individual case analysis in New England reveals systemic use of solitary confinement for arbitrary and retaliatory purposes, including punishing people for filing grievances; requesting basic needs like showers; sharing food; or reporting sexual assault, practices that violate international prohibitions on arbitrary detention independent of duration.²⁰

Data Shortcomings

This analysis is constrained by fundamental flaws in ICE’s data collection and reporting systems.²¹ Recent independent analysis has found significant mathematical discrepancies in ICE detention data, and unexplained facility count changes.²² These systematic reporting failures mean that the findings in this report, while based on the best available data, may still underestimate the true scope of solitary confinement abuses, adding another layer to the transparency and accountability failures that advocates have documented for over a decade.

Sounding the Alarm for Years

This report adds to over a decade of persistent advocacy and research by PHR,²³ the National Immigrant Justice Center,²⁴ Solitary Watch,²⁵ whistleblowers,²⁶ and others; investigations, inquiries, and reports by government oversight bodies,²⁷ independent journalists,²⁸ and members of Congress;²⁹ briefings to high-level government officials;³⁰ and multiple congressional hearings focused on solitary confinement.³¹ The 2024 findings presented in “‘Endless Nightmare’: Torture and Inhuman Treatment in Solitary Confinement in U.S. Immigration Detention” revived congressional inquiries, media investigations, and urgency about ICE’s use of solitary confinement.³²

Leaders at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE faced pressure to end solitary confinement altogether or, at the very least, make major changes to reduce its use, particularly among the most vulnerable people in ICE detention.³³ In December 2024, ICE introduced new reporting requirements,³⁴ representing a modest transparency improvement.

Trump Administration Escalation

Rather than implementing recommendations to protect vulnerable people and end solitary confinement, the Trump administration has doubled down on the use of detention. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed on July 4, 2025, more than quadruples ICE’s detention budget, which amounts to $45 billion through 2029.³⁵ This massive expansion of resources for a system already characterized by torturous conditions,³⁶ combined with little to no oversight, creates the conditions for catastrophic human rights violations on an unprecedented scale.

ICE’s continued lack of transparency hinders a comprehensive assessment of solitary confinement practices in immigration detention because granular data specific to each placement is not publicly reported.³⁷ While the new reporting requirements shed additional light on the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention, publicly released national data from April 2024 to May 2025 still omit key details, including circumstances and duration of each solitary placement.³⁸

Abuse in New England Facilities

Furthermore, the analysis of New England facilities demonstrates that county and state-run facilities are critical sites for intervention by state policymakers and advocates.³⁹

This regional focus exposes harmful practices and equips policymakers and advocates with actionable insights to dismantle systems of abuse.

Immediate Action Required

ICE’s use of detention has only increased under the current administration.⁴⁰ Given ICE’s planned continued expansion of detention and escalating use of solitary confinement, immediate action is required at all levels of government.

This report presents comprehensive recommendations across multiple levels of government to end solitary confinement in immigration detention. Given significant obstacles to federal reform, state and local action has become essential. The authors make the following recommendations:

State and local governments should renegotiate contracts with ICE to assert stronger control over detention standards and accountability measures.

Federal Government:

ICE must publicly commit to ending solitary confinement entirely through a binding directive that includes presumptive release for vulnerable populations.

The president should immediately halt immigration detention expansion at a minimum and eliminate solitary confinement in all immigration facilities.

Sign the UN Optional Protocol Against Torture to enable international oversight.

Congress must defend its constitutional oversight authority against ICE’s unprecedented obstruction by passing emergency legislation to restore unannounced inspection rights, strengthen civil rights oversight mechanisms, and ratify international monitoring protocols.

State and Local Government:

States should pass legislation eliminating or reducing solitary confinement in facilities within their borders.

States should increase procedural protections for those placed in isolation.

State Attorneys General should conduct regular unannounced inspections.

On average, from April to November 2024 (before ICE changed its policy on reporting), the number of individuals reported in solitary confinement increased by one percent each month. From February to May 2025 (following the presidential inauguration), this rate increased sixfold, reaching 6.5 percent. By comparison, between September 2018 and September 2023, the number of solitary confinement placements increased by an average of 3.4 percent per month.

The 25-year-old was due to be returned on Wednesday under the ""one in, one out"" returns pilot scheme agreed in July between the UK and France.
Science Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the ruling was ""an interim judgement on one individual"" which would not halt the deal.
The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.
Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France.","An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK by small boat has won a last-minute legal claim to temporarily block his removal to France.

The 25-year-old was due to be returned on Wednesday under the ""one in, one out"" returns pilot scheme agreed in July between the UK and France.

In the first legal challenge against the deal, in the High Court in London, his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed.

Science Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the ruling was ""an interim judgement on one individual"" which would not halt the deal.

""It will not stop this really important deal from going ahead, a deal that says if you come to this country illegally, you can and you will be deported,"" Kendall said.

She said ministers never claimed the deal would be ""a silver bullet to tackle all of the problems"" but insisted the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was determined to make sure it worked.

The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.

Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings.

But during the hearing, it emerged that while the home secretary's own officials had rejected his claim that he was a victim of slavery, they had also said in a letter today that he had a right to make further representations – and they would not expect him to do that from France.

Mr Justice Sheldon, who rejected the man's claim that he would be left homeless and destitute in France, said that he would nevertheless have to temporarily block the man's departure in light of that development.

""There is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner,"" he said.

""If there was a reasonable suspicion that he was trafficked - and that does not mean trafficked in or from France - that would amount to a statutory bar to removal for at least a short period of time.""

The judge said the man's lawyers must do all that is possible to make further representations within 14 days, so that his case can be finalised at a future hearing.

A spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC that the government expected the first returns to take place imminently and that the interim ruling would not prevent delivery of the wider policy.

But Danny Shaw, a former Home Office adviser, said the government appeared to have selected people for removal who had ""very recently arrived on small boats in the UK and because of that, there hasn't been a lot of time to investigate the background of those individuals"".

Shaw said that was what had happened in the case of the Eritrean man, in which the judge ruled he needed 14 days to investigate whether he had been trafficked.

Imogen Townley, a solicitor at Wilson LLP who has represented asylum seekers, said there seemed to be ""quite an arbitrary and chaotic approach to selecting people arriving on small boats"".

She said while she accepted legal claims holding up removals would be frustrating for the government, it was ""worth it to have due process and a fair system"".

""It's not realistic to think that individuals caught up in the scheme do not have individual circumstances [preventing their removal],"" Townley said.

She said she did not think the UK-France deal had been scuppered because there was not an ""overarching problem"" with the scheme's design.

Kemi Badenoch responded to news of the injunction with ""we told you so"".

Speaking to LBC, the Conservative leader called for ""some tough laws"" and said ""we are basically turning our country into a refuge for anyone who may have even the slightest bit of unhappiness in any other country"".

Reform leader Nigel Farage said that even if the policy worked, it would not lead to lower migration numbers as ""one in, one out, and with another one in, still means plus one for everyone that crosses the Channel"".

Papers logged at the High Court show that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left Ethiopia for Europe two years ago, arriving in Italy in April 2025.

A month later, he left for France where he was assisted by charities including the Red Cross, before his mother paid $1,400 (£1,024) to smugglers for his Channel crossing to the UK.

More than 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.

It is the earliest point in a calendar year this figure has been passed since data on crossings was first reported in 2018.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dd92/live/93f892f0-930b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:09.228393

Family members said that the man was released from the hospital after he said he was tased in the face while being taken into federal custody.

The only problem—he was born in Chicago.

Although his father is undocumented, they all ended up in ICE custody.

Federal agents pulled out weapons around 9:30 Tuesday morning. They boxed in a landscaping truck just as a father and his two sons exited the 7-Eleven store at Ballard and Potter Roads in Des Plaines.

Edgar Ruiz said he came out first and jumped in the passenger seat. His brother, Adrian, was second—yet when his father, Rigoberto Ruiz, left the store, surveillance showed ICE agents moved in.

One agent was seen coming from the front of the truck and went to the passenger side, where Edgar sat.

The truck was shown reversing as more agents moved in. That's when Edgar could be seen running across the busy road—ICE agents followed.

The second brother, Adrian, ran down the block. Their father, who is undocumented and has lived in the United States for 30 years, did not run.

""In the past couple of weeks and months, we've seen the Latino community as a whole under attack, that means even if you're a U.S. citizen, you've got to carry your passport,"" said Berto Aguayo, policy co-chair of the Latino Leadership Council.

The two brothers are U.S. citizens.

Edgar said that when the agent originally came to the passenger door, he tried holding the door closed, preventing him from opening it. He said at that time he and his family had no idea who was at the vehicle, and everyone was scared.

When the agent tried opening the door, Edgar said he was tased in the face. That's when he told everyone in the truck to run for their lives. Despite being a U.S. citizen, he said they ran out of fear.

Those are the concerns the Latino Leadership Council is worried about as ""Operation Midway Blitz"" continues.

""The death xxx last week at the hands of ICE and the situation in Des Plaines, we must demand full accounts of what's happening in these incidents because they are too common and too frequent, and no one is above the law here in the U.S.,"" Aguayo said.

This is not about safety. This is an engineered crisis

Edgar said he was detained for about two hours in a facility in Lombard, Illinois. Once released, his family took him to get medical attention. The father remains in ICE custody.

And despite the administration’s apparent indifference to public opinion, public sentiment is not irrelevant in the broader political and legal ecosphere.
Moreover, there’s a reason courtroom dramas continue to find their place on your favorite streaming service: Legal cases are rich with characters, narratives, and conflict.
A strong litigation communications strategy also opens the door to a win-by-losing approach, something many organizations should consider or even plan for.
Whether you win or lose in the near-term, couple your legal strategy with a communications strategy so that you make the “what’s at stake” and “who is impacted” of your work better known.","In the first year of the second Trump administration, more than 350 cases have been filed to date in response to its actions, a record for any president over such a short period of time. There’s no reason to expect this deluge to stop. But because it remains an open question how much the administration actually intends to comply with the many court orders issued in response to its actions, litigation can only be part of a larger strategy to respond to what the administration is doing.

Take, for example, a recent court order restricting immigration stops, stemming from a case filed jointly by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Public Counsel, which barred authorities from stopping or arresting people based solely on racial profile (and then from detaining them without legal representation or due process). Last Monday, the Supreme Court lifted the lower court’s restrictions. But while the administration was appealing the order, it had not ceased the immigration raids, as the court had ordered. A purely legal strategy, in such a situation, is clearly inadequate for the work we are doing.

Pressure must be applied outside the courtroom as well as inside it. And despite the administration’s apparent indifference to public opinion, public sentiment is not irrelevant in the broader political and legal ecosphere. Even in the president’s case, there is evidence that he cares what certain people think, as exemplified by the now infamous TACO trade on Wall Street, and a stated openness to finding ways to legally employ migrant farm workers, to list two examples.

Moving the needle on public opinion can ultimately build a base of support for cultural and policy change that can stand the test of time. For this reason, litigation in an information vacuum not only represents a missed opportunity for advocates, but seeing litigation as one part of a larger storytelling campaign can change hearts and minds for the long term, across social groups and identities.

A central challenge is that while many public interest cases have significant, direct impacts on millions of Americans, the legal process is designed to be inaccessible, using its own language, having its own processes and rules, and operating in very insular ways. Especially for those who believe in accessible and transparent justice, pairing litigation with communications is therefore not only the best way to address the problem of the moment, but an opportunity to engage, educate, and mobilize citizenry.

So much of the communication around major cases starts with the law and then goes to the facts, but it should be the other way around. After all, legal principles gain their meaning from what happens to real people, with whom the public can empathize. By translating what is happening in a case and why it matters, you create pathways for folks to engage, learn, and ideally mobilize in your or your issues’ favor.

Moreover, there’s a reason courtroom dramas continue to find their place on your favorite streaming service: Legal cases are rich with characters, narratives, and conflict. At its best, litigation communications is about augmenting often-arcane legal arguments with messaging centered on the shared values at play, the lives impacted, and the personal stakes for those who may otherwise feel distant from the case (or where the impacts may not be immediately clear).

Take, for example, the case of Daniel Ramirez Medina, a DACA recipient who was unlawfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) just weeks into President Trump’s first term, and represented by Public Counsel. ICE’s actions were based in falsely claiming Mr. Medina was a gang member, among other things, and held him without regard for his legal rights. As the first DACA recipient to be arrested and held, Mr. Medina’s case became the blueprint for how to respond to the Trump administration’s overreach, providing a playbook of sorts for lawyers and advocates alike. Along with countering the administration’s legal arguments, this included executing a relentless communications effort to counter the government’s aggressive portrayal of Mr. Medina as a criminal, by showing Daniel for who he was (and is): A longtime, law-abiding resident, a committed father and partner, and a hard-working individual who was no different from the more than 500,000 DACA recipients living lawfully across the country.

At Public Counsel, we framed Daniel’s story as a cautionary tale of the harm that broad, unchecked agency power can have on protected families and American citizens living in the United States. We shared that story across broadcast and local television, radio, print, and social media platforms, with members of Congress and other officials, and with the immigration advocacy community broadly. In 2018, a federal judge barred the government from revoking Medina’s DACA status, reinforcing the legitimacy of his legal right to remain. Public opinion also shifted as other components of the administration’s approach to immigration prompted public outcry, with more Americans in 2020 viewing immigration positively.

We are using a similar approach to counter the ongoing immigration raids now randomly sweeping up health and childcare workers, food service and construction teams, field hands and contributors to the American economy. Here we have focused on the connection between the folks being apprehended and the increased cost of goods and services, which are costs the American electorate shares a deep concern about. Moreover, as was true in the Medina case, there is a clear distinction to be drawn between hard working folks contributing positively to their community and the murderers, drug dealers, and rapists (real or imagined) the administration promised to focus on. The former enjoy broad public support, and connecting their fate to the administration’s disregard for any reasonable legal boundaries has fueled growing opposition to its hardline approach, with the potential power to influence future policy.

Why do so many organizations litigate but don’t communicate? With most resources being dedicated to the cost and time associated with a lawsuit, communicating about an active case can be tricky. And yet litigation under the cover of darkness and away from the public spotlight is only a half measure when fundamental rights are at stake. Even if a litigation-only approach may result in a legal victory, moving public opinion and the politics of the moment may be what is actually needed for the illegal activity to cease (or for a legal outcome to be durable).

This has been most evidently the case where it relates to marriage equality, where a broad and persistent communications campaign helped move public opinion. The campaign certainly benefited from the positive portrayal of same-sex couples on television, and Harvey Milk’s legacy in bringing the gay and lesbian community out of the shadows, but everything about the advocacy campaign was precise and intentional: We leveraged every filing and hearing to engage the media, every plaintiffs’ anniversary, birthday, or personal milestone to build community on social media, and every piece of testimony to build a narrative that showed how baseless the opposition to marriage equality really was. Between 2010 and 2015, public opinion on marriage equality shifted 25 percent, and even now, public support remains strong despite some pullback from Republican voters.

A strong litigation communications strategy also opens the door to a win-by-losing approach, something many organizations should consider or even plan for. Especially when courts are not reliable, a near-term legal defeat can still be offset by an evolution in public perception. This has certainly been true of recent environmental cases, where not all cases have been won but where 61 percent oppose the president’s actions on this issue. Between 2017 and 2020, a period of extreme environmental litigation, public sentiment around climate change shifted by 11 percent.

For foundations that litigate, or that might themselves be forced to litigate, the takeaway here is both-and: Fund the best legal teams to develop the best legal theories and pursue litigation where necessary. But don’t only do that part of the puzzle. Whether you win or lose in the near-term, couple your legal strategy with a communications strategy so that you make the “what’s at stake” and “who is impacted” of your work better known. Doing so builds a more durable base of support.

The judicial branch of government provides a unique and valuable platform to tell a critical and compelling story. But it is a platform you have to seize and take advantage of. The story won’t write itself.",https://ssir.org/images/blog/legal-advocacy-storytelling-737x737.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 09:56:23.966114

She currently works at the Latin American Youth Center, where she oversees compliance for programs that support homeless and unstably housed youth. This program facilitates access to education, employment, and housing services as part of a holistic approach to long-term stability and self-sufficiency.

The United States government continues to undermine migrants’ constitutional rights in the name of immigration enforcement. This disturbing truth has been brought to light after the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on March 15, 2025. Abrego Garcia is a Salvadorian man who had legal protection from deportation under U.S. immigration law. Under a legal system that claims due process for all, including non-citizens, Abrego Garcia was deported without a hearing, warning, or regard for court orders. While his story has gained headlines, sadly he represents countless immigrants who are routinely denied their right to due process via detainment or deportation. His case reveals a growing reliance on militarized policies that erode fundamental rights and endanger human dignity for noncitizens within the United States.

A Legal and Moral Failure

The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no person, citizen or non-citizen, can be deprived of life, liberty, or property without fair legal procedures (due process). Due to life-threatening gang violence in El Salvador, Abrego Garcia exercised this right in 2019 when he was granted legal protection against deportation. Despite this protection though, in March 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported Abrego Garcia disregarding federal court orders. In fact, a lawyer for the federal government admitted that Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador was a mistake, acknowledging that he had been wrongfully removed despite having legal protection. Only with Supreme Court intervention was Abrego Garcia safely returned to the United States.

With the U.S. federal government’s blatant disregard for legal safeguards in immigration enforcement, a clear corrosion of due process exists. Policies like ""Remain in Mexico"" and ""expedited removal"" have normalized immigration procedures that disregard basic due process protections by denying individuals the opportunity to be heard in court. While immigrants do not have a constitutional right to government-funded legal representation, they are permitted to bring legal counsel when hearings occur. However, in cases like Abrego Garcia’s, no hearing was granted at all, stripping him of even the chance to defend himself.

These practices undermine the basic right of due process by denying individuals the opportunity to present their asylum cases or challenge government mistakes. Even those with a court order barring removal, like Abrego Garcia, are regularly denied legal protections as immigration enforcement chooses efficiency over true justice. This is dangerous to all people in the United States, regardless of citizenship, because once one group of people’s rights are violated, everyone’s rights are at risk.

Militarizing the Border, Dismantling Rights

The degradation of immigrant rights is fundamentally tied to the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border. Over the last two decades, administrations on both sides of the aisle have transformed the Southern border into a pseudo-warzone with policies such as “prevention through deterrence”. As the Brennan Center notes, this militarization has become an “opaque and extralegal security apparatus” that avoids congressional oversight and threatens constitutional protections.

This strategy, intended to close off border entry, actually funnels migrants onto more dangerous routes, increasing their need for smugglers and risk of death. Migrants are simultaneously criminalized for using illicit channels while being denied access to legal ones. This manufactured danger not only justifies further enforcement spending but also shifts public perception by framing migration as a threat rather than a humanitarian issue rooted in global inequality and displacement.

Under pressure from the U.S. government, Mexico has also engaged in militarization by deploying their National Guard to the Southern border. The Oxford-published study The Militarization of Mexico’s Border and Its Impacts on Human Rights details how the “use of military tactics, strategy, technology, equipment and forces” to control migration undermines human rights protections and pushes migrants toward more dangerous, life-threatening paths.

Militarized Borders, Civilian Consequences

Border militarization has created a dangerous environment that blurs the lines between immigration enforcement and military policing. Under these policies, everyone, including U.S. citizens, is at risk of racial profiling, unwarranted stops, and unconstitutional surveillance. Particularly, Latinx residents near the border are disproportionately targeted, as the U.S. border enforcement turns its dehumanizing practices onto its own people.

These practices not only violate domestic law, but also disregard binding international agreements. The principle of non-refoulement under the 1951 Refugee Convention prohibits returning individuals to countries where they face serious harm. As such, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly condemned U.S. and Mexican border militarization as incompatible with basic human rights norms. In doing so, the U.S. and its partners have built a border regime that treats human rights as optional, a dangerous model with consequences that extend far beyond immigration policy.

A Path Forward through a Broken System

While Americans may wish to classify Abrego Garcia’s case as unique, doing so misses the deep systemic failures and institutional compromises of human rights happening within our borders. The U.S. government has incrementally legitimized a border regime which diminishes migration to criminality and prioritizes deterrence over justice. The Trump policies accelerated this trajectory, but the Biden administration has also not been able to fully reverse it. As the highest court in the country, the most recent decision by the Supreme Court affirming that deportations without hearings violate constitutional rights should be irrefutable. However, as the treatment of immigrants in the U.S. shows, having rights on paper means little without real enforcement and accountability.

Moving forward, migration policy must center human rights by upholding due process, expanding legal pathways, and decreasing harmful border militarization. This involves investing in immigration courts, ceasing expedited deportations, and ensuring that the principle of non-refoulement is not a mere formality but an effective legal protection. It also demands holding the highest-level officials responsible for unauthorized removals, regardless of whether there is Democratic or Republican leadership.

Conclusion

Legal protections do not stop at the border. In the United States, regardless of citizenship, people are entitled to dignity, justice, and protection of human rights. The unconstitutional deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a human rights failure. While due process is being reaffirmed by the courts, policymakers must confront the larger system that perpetuated this violation of basic human rights. Constitutional rights cannot coexist with militarized borders. So, to honor its legal and moral obligations, the United States will have to choose principle over fear by dismantling a border regime that treats human dignity as negotiable.",https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/meta_open_graph/public/2025-09/viber_image_2025-06-11_07-02-36-478.jpg?itok=ZrZq9yZl,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:13.990135

""On August 28, ICE arrested Nathaniel Rojas, a criminal alien from the Dominican Republic.","U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joined federal immigration agents during an early morning operation in Elgin, Illinois, on Tuesday that resulted in multiple people being led away in handcuffs, and two U.S. citizens being briefly detained.

A CBS report said that five people had been arrested during the raid, including two U.S. citizens, before being released after showing their official documentation. But when asked by Newsweek, DHS denied that two U.S. citizens were arrested and said they were held briefly and subsequently released.

""No U.S. citizen was arrested, they were briefly held for their and officers' safety while the operation in the house was under way. This is standard protocol,"" a DHS spokesperson told Newsweek.

DHS said that five people were arrested as part of the raid, all of whom were illegal immigrants.

The raid—which Noem posted footage of on X—was part of a broader Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enforcement effort called ""Operation Midway Blitz"" that targeted criminal noncitizens in the Chicago area, according to officials.

Why It Matters

Noem's presence on an early morning enforcement action underscores the heightened federal focus on immigration enforcement in the Chicago metropolitan area and the political salience of those operations. The homeland security secretary has become the face of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, making numerous public appearances and frequently attending ICE raids around the country.

The White House has floated a goal of 3,000 daily ICE arrests, raising concerns among advocates who say such quotas encourage indiscriminate enforcement practices and undermine due process protections.

What To Know

DHS said that five illegal immigrants were arrested in the Chicago area, including an individual convicted of a DUI with a child passenger, an individual convicted of violent assault, and an individual arrested for domestic violence, harassment, obstruction, and felony stalking.

""President Trump has been clear: if politicians will not put the safety of their citizens first, this administration will,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. ""Just this morning, DHS took violent offenders off the streets with arrests for assault, DUI, and felony stalking. Our work is only beginning.""

Video posted by Noem on X shows agents in tactical gear leading people away in handcuffs. It is unclear if those handcuffed included the two U.S. citizens.

DHS said the operation was part of a multi-week enforcement push targeting what the department described as ""criminal illegal aliens"" who have come to Illinois, particularly Chicago.

Local witnesses described helicopters, bright spotlights, tactical vehicles and what one neighbor called the ""drone of a helicopter"" overhead.

The Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history and has conducted numerous ICE raids since taking office in January.

ICE reported more than 66,000 arrests and 65,000 removals in the administration's first 100 days, with the daily detention population swelling to 55,000 people, well above pre-inauguration levels.

While officials have stressed that dangerous criminals are being targeted, federal data show that many detainees have no criminal record at all.

Last month, ICE agents detained the boyfriend of a New York City official though he had legal status.

""On August 28, ICE arrested Nathaniel Rojas, a criminal alien from the Dominican Republic. His criminal history includes convictions for felony grand larceny, felony aggravated DUI with a child passenger less than 16 years old, identify theft, and retail theft. This criminal alien is in ICE custody pending removal proceedings,"" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Newsweek.

What People Are Saying

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X alongside footage of the operation: ""This week, a brave ICE officer was dragged many yards by a car after a criminal illegal alien resisted arrest. His life was put at risk and he sustained serious injuries. President Trump has been clear: if politicians will not put the safety of their citizens first, this administration will. I was on the ground in Chicago today to make clear we are not backing down. Just this morning, DHS took violent offenders off the streets with arrests for assault, DUI, and felony stalking. Our work is only beginning.""

Joe Botello, a U.S. citizen from Texas detained in the raid, told the Chicago Sun-Times: ""I told them I was a U.S. citizen, that my ID was in my wallet.""

Illinois state Senator Cristina Castro, addressing Noem directly, told CBS Chicago: ""She can go to hell. Don't come into my community.""

What Happens Next

DHS has signaled that the operation will continue for several weeks across the Chicago area, with federal agencies participating in enforcement actions. CBS reported that the broader federal presence included ICE, U.S. Marshals, the FBI and Customs and Border Protection.

The lawsuit comes weeks after the Trump administration fined the University of California, Los Angeles $1.2 billion and froze research funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus and other civil rights violations. It was the first public university to be targeted with a widespread funding freeze. The administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges, including Harvard, Brown and Columbia.

According to the lawsuit, the Trump administration has made several demands in its proposed settlement offer to UCLA, including giving government access to faculty, student, and staff data, releasing admissions and hiring data, ending diversity scholarships, banning overnight demonstrations on university property and cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of the UC system's president.

Stett Holbrook, a spokesman for the University of California system, said that while the university is not involved in the lawsuit, it is part of numerous legal and advocacy efforts to restore and maintain funding.

“Federal cuts to research funding threaten lifesaving biomedical research, hamper U.S. economic competitiveness and jeopardize the health of Americans who depend on the University’s cutting-edge medical science and innovation,” he said in a statement.

The coalition that sued is led by the American Association of University Professors union, or AAUP, and represented by Democracy Forward, a legal group that has brought other lawsuits against the Trump administration over frozen federal funds.

“The blunt cudgel the Trump administration has repeatedly employed in this attack on the independence of institutions of higher education has been the abrupt, unilateral, and unlawful termination of federal research funding on which those institutions and the public interest rely,” the lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco said.

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has launched dozens of federal investigations also targeting K-12 school districts.

University of California President James Milliken said on Monday that the federal government has also launched investigations and other actions against all of the UC’s 10 campuses, but he offered no details in a statement.

“This represents one of the gravest threats to the University of California in our 157-year history,” he said, adding that the university system receives more than $17 billion each year in federal support, including nearly $10 billion in Medicare and Medicaid funding, and funding that goes toward research and student financial aid.

The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.

This summer, Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government’s allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws.

Among those arrested by ICE on Tuesday was a 37-year-old alleged gang member, according to ICE spokespeople.

Aldo Salazar Bahena was also arrested Monday in Elgin and was convicted of murder in 2005, according to Homeland Security spokespeople. Illinois law prohibits prison officials from honoring ICE detainer requests and Bahena was released from Stateville Prison in Crest Hill on Friday, only to be arrested again Monday.

ICE also released details on the arrest of another man, whose criminal history is said to include arrest for DUI, resisting a police officer and vehicular burglary.

The news follows Tuesday’s formidable show of strength by federal agents near 87th Street and the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chatham.

“The way they rolled up on them like they were looking for straight up criminals, jumping out of Range Rovers, jumping out of pickup trucks,” general contractor Lorenzo Stacy, who saw the ICE operation in Chatham, said.

“Operation Midway Blitz,” as it’s described by the federal government, converged on a group of day laborers at around 9 a.m. in the parking lot of the Home Depot located on 87th Street near the expressway.

Stacy said it was a heart-wrenching scene with day laborers trying to evade capture. At least one injury was reported and required an ambulance, according to paramedics with the Chicago Fire Department.

According to Stacy, federal agents even made a military helicopter helping them.

“Targeting these people like they’re animals. Go after the bad guys, go after the gang bangers, go after the killers. These guys are just trying to work, that’s all,” Stacy said.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted videos of ICE arrests in Elgin Tuesday morning, saying she’s on the ground to make it clear the department isn’t backing down.

“Just this morning, DHS took violent offenders off the streets with arrest for assault, DUI, and felony stalking,” Noem wrote on social media.

The scene woke some neighbors up at around 5 a.m. Tuesday.

“It was a military helicopter and I woke him up and I said, ‘Something’s going on,’ and the search light was going. Drones were up in the air. I saw a second helicopter kind of duck off to the side, so they were working in tandem,” Elgin resident Angie Hurst said.

Some emotional video from Little Village recorded Monday shows ICE arresting a man despite pleas from his wife that he’s in the United States legally.

“The people they are targeting are our mothers, our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors. Every day working class people whose only fault is to believe the American Dream,” Berto Aguayo of the Latino Leadership Council said.

The Latino Leadership Council spoke out as deportation efforts expand. The Border Patrol’s head of Operation at Large announced that operation, which began in Los Angeles, has officially arrived in Chicago. That’s in addition to the ongoing “Operation Midway Blitz.”

“Let me be clear, this is not about safety. This is an engineered crisis, a spectacle for headlines, not safety,” Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said.

ICE spokespeople in a written statement criticized what happened Monday in West Chicago, which included State Sen. Karina Villa (D-25th District) and others confronting ICE agents.

ICE called them “agitators” for allegedly inserting themselves into law enforcement efforts and, according to ICE, endangered the public.

It comes amid a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and Colombia’s first leftist president.

Colombia’s decertification comes as cocaine production skyrockets in the South American country.
“There has been a difficult relationship” between the Petro and Trump administrations, she explained.","BOGOTA, Colombia — Colombian president Gustavo Petro on Tuesday lashed out at the U.S. government after it added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in three decades.

In a message on his X account, the leftist leader accused the United States of seeking to “participate” in Colombian politics and looking for a “puppet president” as the country prepares for presidential elections next year.

“The Colombian people will reply if they want a puppet president…or a free and sovereign nation” Petro wrote, adding in another message that he would not let his nation “kneel” to U.S. interests and allow peasants who grow coca to get “beaten up.”

On Monday, the Trump administration designated Colombia as a country that is failing to meet its international commitments to fight drug trafficking and blamed the Colombian government for a lack of progress in the fight against the cocaine trade.

The designation, known as decertification, is a stunning rebuke for a traditional U.S. ally. It comes amid a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and Colombia’s first leftist president.

Even as the U.S determined that Colombia has failed to comply with international anti-narcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts.

On Tuesday, the charge d’affaires at the U.S. embassy in Bogota, John McNamara, said that consular services, humanitarian projects and defense cooperation would not be affected by Colombia’s decertification.

“We are going to do everything we can to fight with the Colombian people against the global threat” of drugs, McNamara told Colombian radio station Blu.

Colombia’s decertification comes as cocaine production skyrockets in the South American country.

The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests as well as criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.

The Colombian president has also said that whisky kills more people than cocaine, and claimed that the reason wealthy countries like the United States want to crack down on cocaine is because its produced in Latin America.

Sandra Borda, an international relations professor at Bogota’s Los Andes University said that Colombia’s decertification is unlikely to affect efforts to take on drug traffickers in Colombia, because military cooperation is expected to continue.

However she expects tensions between the governments of the U.S. and Colombia to increase, as Petro uses Colombia’s decertification to tap into anti-American sentiment and rally his supporters ahead of next year’s elections.

“There has been a difficult relationship” between the Petro and Trump administrations, she explained. “You have statements and declarations that are not friendly and I think what you are going to see is an escalation of that.”

In the Presidential Determination submitted to Congress on Monday, the Trump administration mostly blamed Petro for the rise of cocaine production in Colombia, describing his efforts to negotiate peace deals with “narco terrorist groups” as a failure.

The report said that Colombia’s security institutions and municipal authorities have shown “skill and courage” in confronting drug traffickers, but said that “the failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also commented on Colombia’s decertification on Tuesday.

“Colombia has been a great partner historically,” Rubio told reporters. “But they have a president now who in addition to being erratic has not been a very good partner when it comes to taking on drug cartels.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250916-Bogota-colombia-Gustavo-Petro-ac-946p-2c392d.jpg",N,,2025-09-17 08:56:57.167375

The letter, sent to the military services and provided to The Associated Press, comes two weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges. It is part of the steps the Trump administration has taken to use the military in broader ways than previously seen, particularly in its immigration crackdown, including sending the National Guard into American cities and deploying active duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.

“These military officers would serve under the command and control of the Attorney General and would execute administrative determinations at the direction of the Attorney General,” according to the letter signed by 12 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It added that “these actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces.”

“We remain extremely disturbed about the impacts on readiness of using military personnel to perform what are traditionally Department of Justice functions,” the letter says.

The nation’s immigration courts — with a backlog of about 3.5 million cases — have become a key focus of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration enforcement efforts. Since Trump returned to office, dozens of immigration judges have been fired, while others have resigned or taken early retirement.

The senators' letter, sent to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services on Monday, is asking the Pentagon to say where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and for insight into what legal analysis the military has conducted into whether the move would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. That law prevents the military from conducting law enforcement outside of extreme emergencies.

A Pentagon memo that described the plan said the lawyers should not be detailed for longer than half a year. The memo also showed that Pentagon officials were cognizant of the possibility for conflict with that law and said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring that the military lawyers do not violate it.

The Democratic senators said they were “deeply concerned” that pulling those lawyers away would have an impact on service members who are going through the military’s judicial system.

“These reassignments come at a time only shortly after Congress completely overhauled how the military investigates and prosecutes serious ‘covered’ criminal offenses … by establishing the Offices of Special Trial Counsel (OSTCs) in each of the Services,” the letter read.

Those offices were set up by Congress in 2022 as part of an effort to reform the military justice system by moving decisions on the prosecution of serious military crimes, including sexual assault, to independent military attorneys, taking that power away from victims’ commanders.

The offices began taking cases at the end of last year.

The letter asks the Pentagon what it will do to “preserve the OSTC’s progress in building specialized trial capacity” and what the services will do to “ensure that diversion of OSTCs, trial counsels, and defense counsels does not create delays or diminish quality in court-martials.” The senators say that the plan is a demonstration of how “the Trump administration views skilled personnel as pawns to be traded between agencies, rather than as professionals essential to their core missions, in order to advance misguided immigration policies.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lnOYX9Os93Tt2R5PbXlGvw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/c8c7891705cb3e754d76faa93ca8583c,N,,2025-09-17 13:56:44.851934

“We remain extremely disturbed about the impacts on readiness of using military personnel to perform what are traditionally Department of Justice functions,” the letter says.

The nation’s immigration courts — with a backlog of about 3.5 million cases — have become a key focus of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration enforcement efforts. Since Trump returned to office, dozens of immigration judges have been fired, while others have resigned or taken early retirement.

The senators' letter, sent to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services on Monday, is asking the Pentagon to say where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and for insight into what legal analysis the military has conducted into whether the move would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. That law prevents the military from conducting law enforcement outside of extreme emergencies.

A Pentagon memo that described the plan said the lawyers should not be detailed for longer than half a year. The memo also showed that Pentagon officials were cognizant of the possibility for conflict with that law and said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring that the military lawyers do not violate it.

The Democratic senators said they were “deeply concerned” that pulling those lawyers away would have an impact on service members who are going through the military’s judicial system.

“These reassignments come at a time only shortly after Congress completely overhauled how the military investigates and prosecutes serious ‘covered’ criminal offenses … by establishing the Offices of Special Trial Counsel (OSTCs) in each of the Services,” the letter read.

Those offices were set up by Congress in 2022 as part of an effort to reform the military justice system by moving decisions on the prosecution of serious military crimes, including sexual assault, to independent military attorneys, taking that power away from victims’ commanders.

The offices began taking cases at the end of last year.

The letter asks the Pentagon what it will do to “preserve the OSTC’s progress in building specialized trial capacity” and what the services will do to “ensure that diversion of OSTCs, trial counsels, and defense counsels does not create delays or diminish quality in court-martials.” The senators say that the plan is a demonstration of how “the Trump administration views skilled personnel as pawns to be traded between agencies, rather than as professionals essential to their core missions, in order to advance misguided immigration policies.""",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/21d46521-a56d-4e3f-bc2e-23555d51960c/wirestory_a34c89929ff098e423d49a3a5460a2aa_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-17 06:56:40.402911

Connecticut is banning ICE from making arrests in state courthouses without a judicial warrant or order issued or signed by a judicial officer.","This story has been updated.

Connecticut officials announced a new rule on Tuesday that seeks to ban federal agents from making immigration-related arrests inside the state’s courthouses without a judicial warrant or signed order. But the state leaders acknowledged there will be little to no way to enforce that policy if officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement continue apprehending people at the state properties.

Raheem Mullins, chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, announced the new policy at a press conference on Tuesday where he was joined by Gov. Ned Lamont and Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, co-chair of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee.

The issuance of the new policy is a response to the aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that have been employed by President Donald Trump’s administration and several high-profile arrests that were made by federal immigration officials inside Connecticut courthouses, including an instance at Stamford Superior Court where masked agents broke a bathroom door in order to take two men into custody.

More than 20 Democratic state senators cited that episode in a letter they sent to Mullins earlier this month, and they implored the chief justice to take steps to prevent ICE agents from using the public spaces inside courthouses to make arrests.

Mullins, who leads the state’s judicial branch as the chief justice, said the new policy was not arrived at “haphazardly.”

“Judges, staff, litigants, members of the public — they all must be able to conduct their business in our courthouses without fear of disruption,” Mullins said. “The due administration of justice requires that courthouse security be protected.”

The written policy, which went into effect Tuesday, specifically prohibits any arrest from taking place “inside the public areas of a courthouse,” unless the officers have a “judicial warrant.”

That’s an important distinction because most ICE arrests are made based on an administrative warrant, which doesn’t have the same legal force as a warrant issued by a judge.

At the same time, the new policy seeks to ban federal ICE agents from wearing masks inside Connecticut courthouses, unless the mask is “medically necessary.”

Lamont, who is in his second term as governor, called the new judicial policy a “modest step” and said he hopes it can withstand potential court challenges.

Mullins, who was confirmed as chief justice at the beginning of this year, said he was hopeful ICE would honor the court’s policy. But Mullins and Stafstrom both recognized that court employees and the judicial marshals, who maintain security at Connecticut’s courts, would be unable to stop federal agents from conducting arrests if they forced the issue.

“Court employees are not to interfere or assist,” Mullins said. “So that is the guidance that they get.”

“I think we need to be realistic,” Stafstrom added. “What we are enacting here is a policy change. It is a policy that says that we would appreciate if ICE would honor our request for them to conduct their activities — their lawful activities that they are charged to do under federal law — outside the presence of the courthouse.”

Stafstrom, a Bridgeport Democrat who was first elected to the legislature in 2015, said the new policy is necessary in order to keep Connecticut’s courts accessible to people.

He pointed out that people need to access the courts for more than just criminal cases, and he said some people including victims and witnesses of crimes could become hesitant to visit courthouses if masked ICE agents continue to apprehend people inside the state properties.

“Justice should not depend on one’s immigration status,” Stafstrom said. “If you are a victim of a crime, if you are someone who believes you’ve been taken advantage of by an unscrupulous creditor, if you believe you are someone who is wrongly being evicted from their house, if you are someone who seeks a divorce from an abusive spouse, you should be able to enter a courthouse in this state free of fear that when you try to achieve justice an masked, unmarked individual is going to grab you and pull you out of the courthouse.”

In a statement, Stephen Harding, Connecticut’s Senate Minority Leader, did not take issue specifically with the new policy implemented by the courts. But he used Tuesday’s press conference to criticize Connecticut’s Democratic majority for being too soft on crime and undocumented immigration.

Harding, R-Brookfield, specifically criticized the state’s Trust Act, which has been amended in recent years to prohibit police, correctional officers and other state employees from turning over people to ICE unless they’ve been convicted of more serious crimes in the state.

“The Judicial Branch made this decision in consultation with ICE in an attempt to ensure the safety and security of courthouses and those that visit them,” Harding said. “That’s their right to do, but this action highlights multiple glaring issues here in Connecticut.”

Maintaining order and open access to the courts is something that federal judges in Connecticut are also worried about as the Trump administration continues to ramp up immigration arrests nationwide.

In August, Michael Shea, the chief judge for the U.S. District Court of Connecticut, issued an order limiting where and when ICE agents could make arrests inside the three federal courthouses in the state.

Connecticut is not the first state that has sought to regulate ICE activity in local courthouses, either through new rules or legislation.

Court officials in Oregon and New Jersey previously issued directives and orders seeking to limit ICE arrests in state courthouses during Trump’s first term in 2019.

Meanwhile, other Democratic-led states like Colorado and New York have also passed laws seeking to ban ICE arrests in state courthouses — though Trump’s Justice Department is now challenging some of those laws in federal court.

Stafstrom said Tuesday that the General Assembly should consider enacting similar legislation in Connecticut.

The Constitution and its core citizenship concepts will need to be defended by Congress and the American public, too.","Constitution Day, observed each year on September 17th, commemorates the day in 1787 when the delegates to the Constitutional Convention gathered in Philadelphia to sign what would become the original articles of our national charter. Of course, when we celebrate the Constitution today, we celebrate not only the document signed centuries ago, but the whole Constitution, which has been amended numerous times by We the People, making our nation incrementally freer, fairer, and more inclusive. Constitution Day’s full name, according to statute, is “Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.” This year, both the Constitution and core concepts of citizenship are under attack, and they deserve our attention and protection more than ever.

Beginning in the first Trump administration, President Trump mused about limiting the Constitution’s birthright citizenship provision through executive order. Then, as now, legal experts have described why such an attempt would be at odds with the Constitution’s text and history. Nonetheless, in January 2025, President Trump issued an executive order purporting to limit birthright citizenship to children who have at least one parent who is a citizen or is lawfully admitted for permanent residence. This ignores the Fourteenth Amendment text, which states “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” As the Constitutional Accountability Center, for which I work, explained in an amicus brief we filed on behalf of an ideologically diverse group of constitutional law and immigration scholars in litigation challenging the Trump executive order, the Fourteenth Amendment’s enactment history makes clear that the Amendment means exactly what it says. Indeed, its Framers were well aware that the provision would grant citizenship to children whose parents were not citizens, including parents who were either in the country unlawfully or who did not intend to stay permanently.

While the Trump administration has attempted to whittle away citizenship in one context, it has fallen over itself to deploy citizenship to try to limit other constitutional rights. For instance, in the context of mass deportation plans, multiple Trump administration officials have opined that unlike citizens, noncitizen immigrants are not entitled to constitutional due process. The Constitution says no such thing. The Due Process Clause of both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments does not limit its protections to citizens, saying that “no person” shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Even one of the most widely criticized shadow docket rulings from the Supreme Court—issued in the context of removals pursuant to President Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act—took care to note that every detainee has a right to meaningful notice and the chance to challenge one’s detention and removal before a judge.

President Trump has also tried to graft citizenship onto unrelated constitutional provisions, such as those relating to the Census. The first Trump Administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census was halted in 2019 by the Supreme Court. Now Trump has announced that he has instructed the Commerce Department to work on a new Census, and has reportedly suggested in social media posts that the new Census would exclude undocumented immigrants. It’s unclear whether this would be for the 2030 Census or some unprecedented, irregularly timed Census to take place before 2030. What is clear is that any such alteration would fly in the face the Fourteenth Amendment requirement that the Census count the “whole number of persons in each state.” Equally clear is the Constitution’s assignment of significant Census decisions to Congress, not the President, something that even some high-ranking Trump administration officials have conceded.

And of course, these are only a few examples. Needless to say, if you care about the Constitution and citizenship, you should be concerned. Constitutional concepts of citizenship lie at the heart of who is considered part of the American family and how they participate in our democracy. When the Constitution’s text and its embedded concepts of citizenship aren’t protected, all Americans—irrespective of immigration status, citizenship, or political party affiliation—are harmed. The lower courts have had a strong record of halting some of the most egregious examples of unconstitutional Trump administration policies. This effort in the courts is essential, but it might not be sufficient. The Constitution and its core citizenship concepts will need to be defended by Congress and the American public, too. Our future depends on it.",https://www.acslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Birthright-.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 13:57:31.885387

That would make them eligible for harsher sentences and adult prisons — a policy change Mr. Trump has called for.
The move blindsided and infuriated House Democrats, who had voted unanimously against the bill.
When Jonathan Karl of ABC News asked Mr. Trump about Ms. Bondi’s hate speech comments, he went after Mr. Karl.
“We’ll probably go after people like you,” Mr. Trump said, “because you treat me so unfairly — it’s hate.”","“Economic data must be free from partisan influence,” she said.

Ms. McEntarfer voiced her fears during a speech at Bard College in New York, her alma mater, more than one month after Mr. Trump dismissed her over his widely condemned claims that federal hiring data had been “rigged.” The report that month showed the economy had added about 250,000 fewer jobs this summer than the government first estimated, a revision that the president claimed — without evidence — had been manipulated to hurt him politically.

Ms. McEntarfer on Tuesday steered clear of addressing Mr. Trump directly, saying at one point she generally did not want to “speculate on what the plan is or the intentions of the administration are.”

But she repeatedly emphasized the risk in allowing politics to infect the work of B.L.S., whose reports inform policymakers, investors, businesses and others that require dependable economic data to make decisions. And she called attention to what she described as steep and persistent shortfalls in the agency’s staff and budget. Those gaps, she said, further complicated Washington’s task to reliably track the labor market, the ebb and flow of prices, and the nation’s overall growth.

“Markets have to trust the data are not manipulated,” Ms. McEntarfer added. “Firing your chief statisticians for releasing data you do not like, it has serious economic consequences. The list of countries that have gone down this route, it’s not a good list.”

Ms. McEntarfer drew a parallel between her work at B.L.S. and “live traffic updates,” the absence of which could make it harder for policymakers to address strains on workers, businesses and consumers.

“The reason my firing was big news is because nobody thinks it’s going be good for our economy if we start messing with those traffic lights,” she said.

Ms. McEntarfer’s comments essentially served as a counterpoint to the steady stream of attacks from the White House. At a moment when the economy is starting to show real signs of strain under Mr. Trump, the president and his top aides have continued to discredit the government’s top labor statistics agency as unreliable, arguing it is in need of a substantial shake-up.

To carry out that agenda, Mr. Trump last month nominated E.J. Antoni, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation, to serve as the next B.L.S. commissioner. Mr. Antoni, whose appointment requires Senate confirmation, previously criticized the bureau, its methods and reports, which led some economists to question whether he could be politically neutral in the role.

Ms. McEntarfer, who was confirmed by the Senate in 2024 on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, did not address her replacement in the speech, even as she unfurled new details about her sudden ouster in early August.

She said that the day before the jobs report was made public, the labor statistics office had briefed administration officials about the substantial jobs revision. That briefing is a customary practice. She said that she did not get a sense at the time that the White House might fire her.

Later, in a briefing with top officials at the Labor Department, Ms. McEntarfer said she described the steep revision as an “unusual event,” but not “an unprecedented one.” She said it “typically occurs when the labor market slows suddenly,” citing downward pressure on hiring, given the uncertainty around the president’s tariffs and immigration policies.

Hours after the revisions were made public, Mr. Trump said he was firing Ms. McEntarfer. She said she first learned of her firing after receiving an email about it from a reporter, and initially did not believe it, given the president’s attacks on other government officials. But she soon noticed a “short note” had arrived in her email inbox from the presidential personnel office, which informed her of the dismissal.

Ms. McEntarfer said that she had left behind a statistics office that had struggled mightily at times in the face of chronic underfunding and, more recently, the cuts demanded by the Department of Government Efficiency, the team of young aides led at the time by tech mogul Elon Musk. She said that the push by D.O.G.E. to reduce the federal work force resulted in a 20 percent reduction in staff at B.L.S., compared to the start of the year.

“We were scrambling, trying to figure out operationally how we were going to get through the next week,” she said, as she described a period earlier this year when she was “praying nothing terrible was going to happen” to the agency’s data.

In doing so, Ms. McEntarfer sketched out her view of the office and its role, describing its ability to produce reliable data as essential to helping policymakers avert recessions, control inflation and stimulate growth.

She later said of the political dynamic: “The best hope is that interference stops with firing me.”

Mr. Patel, who has embraced President Trump’s attack-the-attacker style with bellowing brio, had no intention of being lured into traps set by Democrats, or conceding major error, or sometimes even furnishing answers to their informational queries.

He was there to brawl, perhaps to convince Mr. Trump he still had the attributes that endeared him to the president’s inner circle in the first place — that unique hybrid of public defiance and personal compliance demanded of those placed in positions of power.

“I’m not going anywhere!” Mr. Patel declared near the start of the periodic F.B.I. oversight hearing before the committee, presaging more than four hours of attack and counterattack in a half-full marble-lined committee room.

The Republicans on the panel rallied to his side, offering at most only faint chiding that masked the serious grievances against Mr. Patel of some Trump allies since Mr. Kirk’s death. They defused questions for now over whether a larger rebellion against Mr. Patel might be brewing, allowing the proceedings to fall into a familiar partisan groove that played to the F.B.I. director’s pugilistic instincts.

As much as Democratic senators like Cory Booker of New Jersey and Adam B. Schiff of California tried to match his tone and volume, Mr. Patel refused to cede much ground. He has never been a decorous congressional guest, but on Tuesday, he abandoned any pretense of courtesy beyond calling his targets “senator.”

His targets were not much more polite.

“Here’s the thing, Mr. Patel: I think you’re not going to be around long,” Mr. Booker said, taunting the director about reports that senior White House officials were unsatisfied with his job performance. “Because as much as you supplicate yourself to the will of Donald Trump and not the Constitution of the United States of America, Donald Trump has shown us in his first term and in this term, he is not loyal to people like you.”

Mr. Patel glared at Mr. Booker and barked that the senator was an “embarrassment,” and the two began shouting over each other.

Mr. Schiff called Mr. Patel an “internet troll” during a scrap over the Epstein files.

The witness quickly responded by calling the senator “an utter coward,” a “political buffoon” and “the biggest fraud to ever sit in the United States Senate.”

In a lawsuit filed last week, former top bureau officials described Mr. Patel as an out-of-his-depth neophyte, a cartoonish figure who cared more about handing out oversized challenge coins and hyping everything he did on social media than digging into investigations.

But he seemed to gain his footing in the committee room, with Republicans remaining in line and Democrats lining up to wrestle. He has a second chance to spar on Wednesday, when he is set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee.

Whether his performance before Congress matters is another story.

Even if Mr. Patel’s job is safe, as Mr. Trump has said, the White House recently installed Andrew Bailey, the former Missouri attorney general and a more experienced law enforcement official, to help run the day-to-day operations of the bureau.

All of the conflict on Tuesday obscured the fact that Mr. Patel either flatly refused, or evaded, tough questions about the state of the bureau’s work force, particularly the loss of up to 5,000 experienced field agents driven out through purges or retirements.

He forcefully denied that those losses had affected the F.B.I.’s effectiveness, and also pushed back on claims, made in the lawsuit, that he had fired agents under orders from the White House as part of a retribution campaign against the teams that investigated Mr. Trump, his allies and Jan. 6 rioters.

Mr. Patel’s fluent, albeit unabashedly combative, appearance on Capitol Hill was a stark reminder that he has always been relatively comfortable in the arena of political warfare, a role he played in his guise as a congressional staff member and as a podcaster after he left government service.

But his agility in front of the committee stood in contrast to his halting performance during the recent manhunt for Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old man arrested in the Kirk shooting. Hours after the killing last week, Mr. Patel suggested that the F.B.I. had taken a main suspect into custody, only to admit that the person had been released a few hours later.

When Mr. Robinson finally turned himself in to local law enforcement, Mr. Patel spoke at a news conference in Utah. He opened by thanking Mr. Trump — which struck current and former law enforcement officials as inappropriate — and finished with a bizarre vow to see Mr. Kirk, a Christian and charismatic Trump ally Mr. Patel considered a friend, in the pagan afterlife of Valhalla.

At Tuesday’s hearing, Mr. Patel defended his actions during the Kirk investigation, reiterating claims that he had personally instructed agents to conduct operations often regarded as routine, including the distribution of photos of the gunman and the gathering of evidence.

That did not stop Democrats from attacking his handling of the investigation.

In perhaps the sharpest blow, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the committee, said Mr. Patel had violated a cardinal rule of criminal inquiries: Do not upstage your subordinates on the ground.

“Shut up and let the professionals do their job,” Mr. Durbin said.

A close adviser to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Means rose to prominence with a biography that included a successful academic career toward becoming a surgeon. She has said she left the medical profession out of frustration, asserting in public appearances and in her book that the health care system puts patients on a treadmill of surgeries and treatments without addressing the root cause of their illnesses.

In a newsletter and in social media channels, the financial documents show, she has monetized her worldview through payments from companies that sell supplements, home-delivered meals and other products. Dr. Means shares Mr. Kennedy’s critical stance toward the medical establishment and appreciation for supplements and other wellness items, even though they tend to undergo little federal scrutiny for effectiveness.

Dr. Means reported newsletter sponsorship payments over an 18-month period of $46,000 from Pique, a maker of tea, supplements and elixirs; $27,000 from Pendulum Therapeutics, Inc., which makes probiotic products; about $27,000 from Energybits, an algae supplement company; and about $16,000 from Florasophy, a fiber supplement company. In several such deals, Dr. Means also was paid fees for sales of products promoted in her newsletter.

Dr. Means reported more than $100,000 and less than $1 million in royalties for her book, “Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health.” The government forms generally require people to disclose fees or income within a range, which can be broad.

She also received about $79,000 in newsletter sponsorship and $55,000 in book tour fees from Amazentis, a Swiss company that said it was working on therapies aimed at “modulating mitochondrial function.”

Though a date has not yet been set for her confirmation hearing before the Senate health committee, Dr. Means may face heated questioning, given the increasing bipartisan criticism of Mr. Kennedy’s actions undercutting vaccine policy.

In a newsletter outlining her “wish list” just before the election, Dr. Means called for reforming the 1986 law that protects vaccine makers from civil liability. The law enacted the provisions for a special court system that was meant to quickly compensate families after a vaccine injury. In that post, she criticized the current list of vaccines that tend to be given to young children.

“There is growing evidence that the total burden of the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule is causing health declines in vulnerable children,” she wrote. “This needs to be investigated.”

Child health experts say that the recommended immunizations have copious safety data and that curtailing the vaccine schedule could trigger outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases.

In her disclosure records, Dr. Means said she would divest of stock valued at between $15,000 and $50,000 in Altria Group, which owns the Marlboro cigarette brand, and of stock in the same value range in Philip Morris International, which markets the IQOS heated tobacco products and Zyn nicotine pouches. A spokesman from the Department of Health and Human Services said the tobacco stocks were purchased by her husband before they were married.

The surgeon general’s office plays a prominent role in tobacco policy through its annual reports on smoking and tobacco use. On the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast last year, Dr. Means and her brother, Calley Means, called out the tobacco company Philip Morris, saying that its tactics were adopted for food formulations that led people to become addicted to ultraprocessed snacks.

Dr. Means’s ethics agreement said that she would also resign her position and sell her stock in Levels Health, a company that she has said she co-founded. Levels provides continuous glucose monitors to people so they can track how their diet affects blood sugar levels. The monitors link to a company app that gives people information about their health.

The program is not aimed at the monitor’s traditional customers who have diabetes. Rather, the company suggests that the service will help people eat nutritious food and maintain steady levels of blood sugar. The company charges about $184 per month for a glucose monitor that can link to the app.

Dr. Means also pledged to divest her financial interest of $15,000 to $50,000 in True Medicine, a wellness company co-founded by her brother, a close adviser to Mr. Kennedy and an influential figure in the Make America Healthy Again movement.

A special government employee, Mr. Means has not had to disclose the details of his own financial holdings or how they touch on government health policies. True Medicine helps people buy items like red-light masks, Peloton bikes and $8,000 saunas with money not subject to federal income taxes. The company could benefit from Trump administration plans to make more people eligible for such spending.

Dr. Means also said she would divest her interest in Function Health, a company owned by Dr. Mark Hyman, a wellness influencer who is also close to Mr. Kennedy. Dr. Means reported drawing nearly $60,000 in income from the company for newsletter sponsorship and partnership fees. Function sells subscriptions for blood tests that inform users about a range of health measures, including lead levels and sexually transmitted diseases.

According to the filings, her spouse is the founder and chief executive of MagicLinks, an influencer marketing firm that connects people to companies that will pay them for endorsing products. In her ethics filing, she said she would not participate in any matter that could have an effect on the company’s finances.

The surgeon general’s role has been empty since the departure of Dr. Vivek Murthy, who held the post under former President Joseph Biden. Dr. Murthy had previously been paid millions of dollars as a consultant to major companies, including Carnival Corporation’s cruise lines, on Covid policy.

Dr. Means was chosen after Mr. Trump withdrew the nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a New York medical director and a former Fox News contributor who also sold vitamins online.

Dr. Means received her medical degree from Stanford University and then trained as an otolaryngologist and head and neck surgeon. She dropped out of her surgical residency in 2018, turning to entrepreneurial work, founding Levels and promoting dozens of health and wellness products.

One measure would lower the age at which children accused of certain violent crimes can be charged as adults, from 16 years old to 14 years old. That would make them eligible for harsher sentences and adult prisons — a policy change Mr. Trump has called for. Several states have similar provisions, and eight Democrats joined Republicans to pass the measure by a 225-to-203 vote.

The other would roll back a local law that allows judges to give more lenient sentences to people younger than 25, by lowering the limit on that law to 18 years old and requiring judges to adhere to mandatory minimums for youth offenders. Dozens of Democrats joined Republicans to pass the bill, 240 to 179.

Later this week, the House is expected to vote on two other measures that would remove restrictions on vehicular police chases and give the White House a freer hand when choosing judicial picks for D.C. courts, by abolishing a local commission to recommend them.

All four bills may face challenges in the Senate, where they will require the support of Democrats in order to bypass a filibuster and be considered for a vote. But Republicans have long turned to crime as a wedge issue, particularly during campaign season, and Democrats have at times joined them in imposing the federal government’s will on D.C.

The House’s package of bills also comes as Mr. Trump undertakes a federal crackdown on crime in Washington that appears to be the largest infringement on the city’s autonomy since the 1973 law that gave the District’s residents limited authority over their own affairs.

Even as violent crime in Washington has steadily declined over the last year, Mr. Trump last month deployed thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of federal law enforcement officers to the city. On Monday, he signed an order to authorize sending the National Guard to Memphis, and he has suggested similar surges in Chicago and New Orleans.

But unlike other cities, the District of Columbia is subject to significant federal oversight that allows Congress to review its legislation and rewrite its laws. The roughly 700,000 residents of the District, many of whom are Black, do not have a vote in Congress but are represented by a nonvoting House delegate, Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, who can serve on committees but cannot vote on bills.

Republicans have proven eager to exercise their authority in recent years. On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee, the panel that oversees Washington, will question D.C.’s mayor, attorney general and city council chairman over the city’s crime policies.

The panel’s Republican chairman, Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, framed the bills passed on Tuesday as a necessary corrective to “D.C.’s soft-on-crime policies” that he said had “failed to keep D.C. residents and visitors safe.”

But Democrats framed the legislation as aggressive interference by lawmakers who did not represent the city.

“Local leaders should be empowered to solve local problems without Congress interfering,” Representative Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said on the House floor. “I have said this many times: If Donald Trump wants to run D.C., he should resign as president and run for mayor.”

The measures that the House passed on Tuesday both target youth crime, a frequent focus of Mr. Trump and his allies as they deliver broadsides against Democrats in Washington and elsewhere for policies that they describe as overly lax. Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney in D.C., has frequently complained about laws that limit the prosecution of young offenders.

Local officials in Washington have long been focused on crimes committed by teenagers, and the issue became particularly resonant amid a spate of carjackings during the coronavirus pandemic.

But lawmakers in the city have also tried to balance calls for a tougher stance on juvenile crime with an effort to address the socioeconomic problems that many experts say are the root causes of youth crime.

It came after Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, tried to surprise Republicans with a bid to block the president’s tariffs on Brazil. His measure was swiftly defeated, and within hours, G.O.P. leaders moved to head off a similar vote. That effort, tucked into a routine procedural measure, passed on Tuesday afternoon almost entirely along party lines.

It was the latest instance in which House Republicans, many of whom have spent much of their career opposing tariffs as a matter of principle, have given up their power over trade. In March, Republicans pushed through a similar procedural measure that made it impossible for lawmakers to use a law governing presidential emergencies to challenge Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. The next month, they did so again. On Tuesday, they attached one to a measure needed to debate a series of bills to impose stricter criminal penalties in the District of Columbia.

In all three cases, Republicans have used an arcane legislative maneuver to avoid tariff votes. It involves declaring the calendar frozen until a given date, which effectively renders useless a law that allows any lawmaker to insist on a quick floor vote on a proposal to end an emergency declared by the president.

Republicans defended their strategy to short-circuit any such vote, making the case that Mr. Trump’s trade policies were working.

“Access to the American economy is a privilege, not a right,” said Representative Nick Langworthy, Republican of New York. “President Trump is using tariffs as leverage to reduce reciprocal barriers, safeguard our national security and level the global playing field for American producers and manufacturers. And it’s working.”

But some Republicans clearly were uncomfortable with the move. A handful of them briefly revolted over the measure and voted no, bringing the chamber to a standstill as leaders rushed to corral the votes necessary to pass it.

Among those who initially opposed the measure but were persuaded to change their votes was Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, who said he initially did so “because Article One of the Constitution grants Congress authority over tariffs, and tariffs are a tax on American consumers.”

But he said his decision to change his vote came after receiving commitments from Republican leaders over how the chamber would handle tariff policy going forward, including a new working group on tariffs and changes to an upcoming vote on the matter.

Democrats have repeatedly denounced the drive by Republicans to avoid tariff votes, pointing to it as another instance in which they are willingly ceding authority to the White House.

“I’m continually disappointed in some of my colleagues who so often talk about the importance of Congress reasserting its role in trade, but when the cards are down, give Trump unchecked power to impose tariffs for whatever reason he wants without so much as a vote in Congress,” said Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee.

Representative Kevin Kiley of California, one of the three Republicans who joined all Democrats in opposing the measure, criticized the move as an abdication of congressional authority.

“If we’re saying that Congress is not going to be able to assert itself on this issue, that in my view is a problem,” Mr. Kiley said after the vote. Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana also voted no.

Representatives Jay Obernolte and Tom McClintock, both California Republicans, initially voted no but flipped to support the measure.

Democrats in the Senate, where the minority has more tools at its disposal, have made more headway in forcing tariff votes through the national emergencies statute. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, intends to bring forward two resolutions in the coming days to terminate the emergencies Mr. Trump declared to justify tariffs on Canada and Brazil.

He is joined by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of a handful of Republicans who have broken with their party to support previous Democratic-led attempts to challenge Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

“I have been opposed to rule by emergency, no matter who the president is, Republican or Democrat,” Mr. Paul said in an interview.

Mr. Paul says his Republican colleagues had “faded into the woodwork” on trade, and that they may feel differently under a Democratic administration. “I think it’s good to be consistent no matter who the president is,” he added.

“It is time to end President Trump’s senseless trade war with Canada, one of our closest allies and top trading partners,” Mr. Kaine said. “It is our responsibility as Congress to step in when the president abuses their authority.”

Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, another backer of the resolutions, warned that Mr. Trump’s tariffs were having an outsize influence on her home state’s economy.

“The president cannot abuse his power to continue an unjustified trade war with one of our strongest allies,” she said. “Canada is Minnesota’s top trading partner, but the president’s tariffs are jeopardizing that relationship, and adding costs for Minnesota families.”

In April, four Republicans — Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Mr. Paul — joined Democrats in voting to terminate the emergency declaration underpinning Canadian tariffs.

That measure passed the Senate but stalled in the House, where Republican leaders have declined to bring it up and changes like the one made on Tuesday give rank-and-file lawmakers no ability to force the matter to the floor.

Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday released a temporary spending bill that would keep funding flowing largely at current levels until just before Thanksgiving, while boosting spending on security for federal officials. He is aiming for a vote on the House floor by Friday.

That set up a replay of a scuffle over government funding that played out in March. Senate Democrats at the time allowed Republicans’ stopgap measure to move forward, arguing that blocking it would only cede more power to Mr. Trump to steer federal funding however he saw fit during a shutdown.

The move blindsided and infuriated House Democrats, who had voted unanimously against the bill. It also drew a fierce backlash from the party base, which had demanded lawmakers shut down Mr. Trump’s government.

Increasingly angry at the Trump administration’s efforts to trample congressional spending power and facing a base that is spoiling for a spending fight, top Democrats appear determined not to go down the same road again.

Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, both minority leaders, said their members would not support a spending bill that extends current funding levels unless it also includes concessions from Republicans on health care. They have not yet specified what those might be.

In a joint statement on Tuesday, they suggested that they were demanding that Republicans add to the package an extension of Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.

“The House Republican-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming health care crisis,” Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries said. “At a time when families are already being squeezed by higher costs, Republicans refuse to stop Americans from facing double-digit hikes in their health insurance premiums.”

While Republicans have signaled a growing openness to extending the subsidies, Mr. Johnson said on Tuesday that there was “zero chance” he would do so as part of the temporary spending legislation.

“Predictably and unfortunately, there are some Democrats who are openly pining for a government shutdown,” Mr. Johnson said.

Democrats are facing a dilemma in the spending showdown, still stung by their voters’ fury earlier this year at the decision to go along with Mr. Trump’s funding package. At the same time, some are wary of wading into a politically unpopular shutdown that would be difficult to reverse, and for which they could shoulder considerable blame.

As early as last month, as he held town halls in his San Diego district, Representative Mike Levin was already fielding questions from constituents about how his party planned to approach the looming government funding deadline.

The message, he said, was that his constituents were looking for an acknowledgment that “what we’re seeing from the administration is fundamentally different.”

Mr. Levin, who sits on the Appropriations Committee tasked with doling out federal dollars, had himself been frustrated for months over Mr. Trump’s efforts to unilaterally dictate government spending in defiance of Congress. He voted against the stopgap bill in March and believed Senate Democrats should have done the same.

“I was advocating for us to stand up for our values,” he recalled. “I thought that there’s a time for us to stand and fight against what we know to be wrong. A lot has happened since then, but the pattern of behavior has only gotten worse.”

Top of mind for Democrats is the White House’s use of a rare maneuver to skirt a vote and cancel nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funding that lawmakers had already approved. Weeks before that, Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, had infuriated Democrats when he said that the appropriations process “has to be less bipartisan.”

“How are we Democrats supposed to trust any funding deal going forward?” Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, wrote in an op-ed in The Bulwark. “Why would anyone bother negotiating a deal that could be undone in a fit of political convenience?”

Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, acidly noted Mr. Trump’s comments suggesting Republicans did not need to negotiate with Democrats.

“Shutdowns are terrible and they should be avoided,” said Mr. Schatz, one of the Democrats who in March joined Mr. Schumer in helping Republicans bring their stopgap spending bill to a vote. “Donald Trump may or may not know that the only way to avoid a shutdown is to work with both parties. And yesterday morning, he said, ‘I don’t need to deal with the Democrats.’ And so, godspeed.”

Mr. Schumer, who bore the brunt of the backlash in March when he corralled enough Democrats to let the government stay open, has experienced firsthand the perils of either choice currently before members of his party.

In recent days, Senate Republican leaders have resurrected the term “Schumer Shutdown,” referencing a three-day lapse in funding in January 2018, after Mr. Schumer led Democrats in blocking a spending bill. They did so after Republicans refused to cut a deal to provide permanent protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.

But with Republicans hammering him by name for the shutdown, Mr. Schumer quickly retreated, cutting a swift deal to reopen the government after winning a commitment from the G.O.P. to hold a vote on protecting those immigrants, known as Dreamers. Ultimately, votes on three immigration-related proposals were scheduled, and the Senate rejected all three.

This year, Mr. Schumer took a different tack, arguing in March that Republicans’ stopgap spending bill was “a terrible option,” but that “allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.”

“There is no off-ramp,” for a government shutdown, Mr. Schumer said at the time. “The off-ramp is in the hands of Donald Trump and Elon Musk and DOGE. We could be in a shutdown for six months or nine months.”

The backlash was swift and furious.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, declined to rule out challenging Mr. Schumer in a primary, saying there was “a deep sense of outrage and betrayal” about his decision. Protesters gathered outside his Brooklyn home. Indivisible, the progressive activist group, called on him to step down.

This time, Mr. Schumer said on Tuesday, “the situation is much different.”

“Republicans are in a much weaker position now than they were then; the B.B.B. bill, which they have passed, is highly unpopular with the American people,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump’s domestic policy legislation that was signed into law in July. “Democrats are unified. We have been strong on the same message for a very long time, which is: We need to help the American people lower their costs, particularly on health care.”

Megan Mineiro contributed reporting.

Filed to Congress by the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower protection group, the report said at least 30 of the 327 children the government cleared for imminent removal had “indicators of being a victim of child abuse” in Guatemala, based on the government’s own findings.

The children, who came to the United States as unaccompanied minors in recent years and have been living in shelters or foster care under government supervision, were hastily targeted by the Trump administration over the Labor Day weekend. Upon learning that the children were being loaded onto flights to be sent back, lawyers from the National Immigration Law Center sued to block the removals and a federal judge ordered the government to halt until the case could be argued.

The Trump administration has said it was exercising an authority to reunify unaccompanied children with their parents abroad, claiming that it was acting at the behest of the children’s families and with the children's well-being in mind.

But the report on Tuesday was the second time that notion had been called into question.

Ms. Salazar filed the declaration in her capacity as the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services that maintains custody over minors who enter the United States alone.

It stated that her office had reviewed the cases of all 327 children using a “best interests framework” that included considerations such as whether her office was “assured the child will not be trafficked upon their return” or whether the children had been known to have faced abuse in the past. It added that the government had completed the review and deemed all the children eligible to be sent back to Guatemala, where most or all have parents residing.

But the whistle-blower report countered that the available data about the children made it clear that around 10 percent of them, and possibly more, should not have been eligible under the government’s criteria.

The report stated that as recently as Sept. 5 — the day before the government filed Ms. Salazar’s declaration in federal court — analyses run by her office had returned results showing that many of the children faced dangers in Guatemala or had expressed fear of being sent there. It added that Ms. Salazar “knew or should have known of the inaccuracies in her declaration,” based on the data on hand.

“These whistle-blowers’ disclosures evidence violations of law, rules and regulations, abuse of authority and substantial and specific danger to public health and safety on a matter of urgent, and potentially life and death, importance,” it said.

Lawyers for the Government Accountability Project sent the report on Tuesday to Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Alex Padilla of California, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Border Security and Immigration subcommittee.

“The allegations in the whistle-blower complaint are shocking,” Mr. Padilla said in a statement.

“Sending children back into danger is a betrayal of our moral and legal obligations,” Mr. Padilla’s statement said. “And we’re going to hold them accountable for endangering children.”

A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

After the children were nearly flown out over the Labor Day weekend, a judge intervened on an emergency basis, halting the government’s effort. The case was then transferred to Judge Kelly to manage the rest of the proceedings, and he extended the order blocking the government from making further attempts to remove the children until 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday.

During a hearing last week to determine how to proceed, Judge Kelly grew skeptical about the government’s position, pressing for details about its claim that the children’s parents had asked for their return.

He homed in on a memo prepared by the Guatemalan government, which was filed as evidence in the case, in which officials tried to contact and survey the children’s parents. Of those they were able to track down, none had asked for their children’s return, with more than half explicitly refusing to authorize any attempt to have their children forced out of the United States.

Asked by Judge Kelly to reconcile the competing claims, a lawyer from the Justice Department conceded that the government had no reason to believe that the parents had asked to have their children returned.

It is not clear under what authority Ms. Bondi planned to bring “hate speech” cases when the First Amendment provides sweeping protections for free speech that does not directly incite violence. She seemed to back away from a broad interpretation of her remarks on Tuesday morning, writing on social media that “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It’s a crime.”

Ms. Bondi was roundly pilloried for her initial remarks by a slew of conservative pundits, authors and lawmakers on social media within minutes of delivering them on two right-wing media outlets, after avoiding expansive public discussion beyond expressing outrage over the killing and support for Mr. Kirk’s young family.

Many of her critics pointed to a May 2024 social media post by Mr. Kirk himself, laying out clearly that while “ugly speech,” “gross speech” and “evil speech” existed, there was no such thing as hate speech under the Constitution.

“Someone needs to explain to Ms. Bondi that so-called ‘hate speech,’ repulsive though it may be, is protected by the First Amendment,” Brit Hume, the longtime Fox News host, wrote on social media.

“She should know this,” he added.

Ms. Bondi’s comments came as other top Trump administration officials — among them Vice President JD Vance — have called on ordinary people across the country to seek vengeance against those who have criticized Mr. Kirk by calling their employers in an effort to get them fired.

The naming-and-shaming campaign has led to countless people from various walks of life — teachers, medical personnel and members of the armed forces — being dismissed from their jobs or placed on suspension.

While some Republicans have called out violence committed by people on both sides of the nation’s left-right binary, the president and many in his administration have blamed the violence solely on their opponents.

In an interview on Fox News’s “Hannity” late Monday, Ms. Bondi suggested that she might direct the Justice Department’s civil rights division to “prosecute” businesses if they turned away customers who wanted to print pictures of Mr. Kirk for memorial vigils, citing the case of an Office Depot employee in Michigan who was fired for rejecting such an order.

“Businesses cannot discriminate,” she told Mr. Hannity, saying she had referred the Office Depot case to Harmeet K. Dhillon, the head of the civil rights division.

“We can prosecute you for that,” she added.

Ms. Bondi’s assertion that the Justice Department might seek charges against a business for refusing to serve customers for political reasons could run afoul of a Supreme Court decision that barred state authorities from punishing a Colorado baker for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.

A senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to relay internal discussions, said Ms. Bondi’s comments, while expansive, were intended to address only the Office Depot incident and did not signal a broader effort to go after noncompliant businesses.

Earlier on Monday, in a podcast interview with Katie Miller, the wife of the top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, Ms. Bondi suggested there might be limits on anti-Kirk speech after his killing during an informal debate with supporters, and critics, at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.

“There’s free speech and then there’s hate speech, and there is no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society” for hate speech, Ms. Bondi said.

Ms. Miller followed up by asking if Ms. Bondi would like to see “more law enforcement going after these groups who are using hate speech and putting cuffs on people.”

The attorney general responded by saying, “We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech — and that’s across the aisle.”

“Get rid of her. Today. This is insane,” wrote Matt Walsh, a right-wing influencer with nearly four million followers on X. “Conservatives have fought for decades for the right to refuse service to anyone. We won that fight. Now Pam Bondi wants to roll it all back for no reason.”

Despite the cascade of criticism, President Trump seemed to defend Ms. Bondi’s remarks in comments to reporters, twisting and personalizing them into a self-serving attack on the media.

When Jonathan Karl of ABC News asked Mr. Trump about Ms. Bondi’s hate speech comments, he went after Mr. Karl.

“We’ll probably go after people like you,” Mr. Trump said, “because you treat me so unfairly — it’s hate.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/16/multimedia/16trump-news-promo830p-fcbg/16trump-news-promo830p-fcbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 02:59:16.736531

But on Tuesday, London’s High Court granted him an interim injunction preventing his removal, pending a full hearing of his trafficking claim.

Judge Clive Sheldon ruled: “I am going to grant a short period of interim relief. The status quo is that the claimant is currently in this country and has not been removed.

“So, I make an order that the claimant should not be removed tomorrow at 9am, but that this matter should come back to this court as soon as is reasonably practical in light of the further representations that the claimant … will make on his trafficking decision.”

“The removal takes place against the backdrop of the recently signed agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the French Republic.

“It seems to me there is a serious issue to be tried with respect to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner.”

The case follows a decision by the UK’s National Referral Mechanism (NRM) – which identifies and assesses victims of slavery and human trafficking – asking the man to submit further evidence in relation to his claim.

The ruling is a setback for Prime Minister Starmer, who has made stopping small boat crossings central to his government’s agenda.

His approach has drawn criticism from rights groups, who accuse him of bowing to pressure from the far right following attacks on asylum-seeker accommodation.

The UK-France scheme is also seen by analysts as part of the government’s attempt to blunt the growing support of the anti-immigrant Reform UK party, which has been climbing in opinion polls.

Under the plan, people arriving in Britain would be returned to France, while the UK would accept an equal number of recognised asylum seekers with family ties in Britain.

Downing Street has defended the plan, calling it a “fair and balanced” system designed to reduce irregular migration.

It insisted it expects deportations to begin “imminently”, with the prime minister’s official spokesman saying “for obvious reasons we’re not going to get into a running commentary on operational details before that”.

“We live here, but we’re Mexican,” he said.
“Long live the immigrant community!” Yescas shouted, to raucous cheering from the crowd.
“Long live the sons and daughters of immigrants!
Long live Arizona!”","While Mexican Independence Day events were cancelled in some cities for fear of federal immigration officials targeting participants, the Arizona Capitol was alive with music and cheering on Monday night in a celebration that emphasized the presence and belonging of immigrants in the country.

The annual celebration occurred against a backdrop of aggressive immigration enforcement. President Donald Trump, who ran on a promise to oversee the largest deportation effort in history, has sought to weaponize multiple federal agencies, including the IRS, the postal service and even the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to identify and expel undocumented Americans. The focus on ramping up deportations has led to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents being swept up in raids.

The majority of immigrants in Arizona are from Mexico. In 2021, there were approximately 481,500 people who were born in Mexico but called Arizona home. And despite a spate of immigration enforcement activity across the Valley, hundreds of people with Mexican heritage refused to miss out on the city’s celebration.

Magdalena Marín, who is from Michoacán, Mexico, has lived in Phoenix for 27 years. Marín said the crowd was smaller than in past years, and while she said she empathized with people who were afraid to attend, she wasn’t nervous — rather, she was determined to celebrate in spite of the ongoing hostility from the federal government.

“We have to raise our voices and show that we aren’t afraid,” she said. “We’re an important resource for this country — they stand to lose without us. We need to show that we’re here and we’re not leaving.”

Nearly 400 people filled the plaza in front of the Capitol building, flanked by the two legislative chambers, many waving Mexican flags or donning them as capes. Others wore Mexican soccer jerseys or traditional guayabera shirts with colorful embroidered flowers. The historic state Capitol building was illuminated in green, white and red lights to represent the Mexican flag.

Some attendees made an effort to honor both their cultural heritage and U.S. residency. Veracruz native Guillermo carried a large flag that combined both countries’ flags into one and swung it in long, back-and-forth arcs, even when he sat down to rest from the 95-degree heat. The 50-year-old, who was uncomfortable sharing his last name, said that he wanted to acknowledge all that the U.S. has given him since he moved to the country 30 years ago. The two countries are a part of him, he said.

“We live here, but we’re Mexican,” he said. “And the United States has given us many opportunities that we’re grateful for.”

Claudia, who similarly declined to share her last name, also carried a half Mexican, half U.S. flag.

“It represents my heart, which is divided in two,” she explained. “It’s the love and respect I have for both countries.”

Local elected officials and advocates expressed support for the state’s immigrants amid the Trump administration’s crackdown. Rep. Mariana Sandoval, D-Goodyear, reflected on the legacies of U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva and former state senator Alfredo Gutierrez, both of whom died this year. In addition to being the sons of immigrants, both championed immigrant rights. Sandoval urged the crowd to look to Grijalva and Gutierrez for proof that it is possible to make a positive difference.

“Hope is stronger than fear,” she said. “And the strength of our community is based on solidarity, perseverance and resilience.”

Karina Ruiz, a longtime advocate for immigrant rights in Arizona who now serves as the first Dreamer in the Mexican Senate, praised the attendees for keeping their culture alive, and called on them to remain optimistic about the future.

“Tonight, as we shout ‘Viva Mexico!’ let’s do so with pride for being the heirs of a history of struggle and with hope for a future in which every Mexican man and woman, regardless of where they live, can be respected,” she said. “That’s important now, because we’re going through a really difficult time. I know, I can see it. I see that my people are afraid, but I also see that we are a community which is brave, dignified and humanist and in the end, that will be recognized.”

Known as El Grito, Mexico’s Independence Day festivities are marked by a series of shouts that emulate the call to arms made during the start of the country’s war for independence. In Phoenix, those shouts are performed by the city’s Mexican consul general, Jorge Mendoza Yescas, who, along with mentioning the leaders of Mexico’s independence movement, also celebrated Arizona’s immigrant community.

The expanded deportation campaign in Chicago was announced Tuesday with a social media post from Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino.
The Supreme Court’s order last week officially blocked an earlier ruling from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong in Los Angeles.
Even Sotomayor noted “it is entirely unexplained” — and part of a growing trend with the court.
“Particularly if the court is not prepared to provide a reasoning on such a fundamental constitutional right in their emergency decision.”","The U.S. Supreme Court last week allowed federal agents to continue stopping people based on race, language and other factors in California amid the same immigration campaign that expanded Tuesday into Chicago — but it did so in an “entirely unexplained” order.

So while the high court seemed to be sending a signal about its position on racial profiling, it’s not clear that the law actually changed with the Sept. 8 order that revolved around “Operation At Large” and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

A National Immigrant Justice Center official told the Chicago Sun-Times his organization is “working from the position that the law is what it is … unless and until the Supreme Court majority provides better guidance.”

For now, the public only has access to writings from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who cited “common sense,” and from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal who found the majority’s decision “unconscionably irreconcilable with our Nation’s constitutional guarantees.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote.

The expanded deportation campaign in Chicago was announced Tuesday with a social media post from Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem also appeared to have joined agents in Tuesday’s local operation.

The Supreme Court’s order last week officially blocked an earlier ruling from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong in Los Angeles. She wrote in July that federal authorities could “not rely solely” on four factors, “alone or in combination,” to form reasonable suspicion for an investigative stop during “Operation At Large” in California.

The factors included a person’s “apparent race or ethnicity,” whether they spoke Spanish or English with an accent, the type of work they do, or their presence at a location like a car wash, tow yard or “day laborer pick up site.”

But the Supreme Court stayed the order, pending the outcome of an appeal. The majority gave no explanation. Instead, Kavanaugh issued a 10-page concurring opinion, and Sotomayor offered a 21-page dissent.

Sotomayor was joined by liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Kavanaugh cited multiple reasons he thought the Trump administration might prevail. Among them were technical questions about whether the people who’d sued the federal government had legal standing to do so.

Kavanaugh went on to write that “apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion.” But he said it can be a “relevant factor,” and he cited other circumstances that included the “extremely high number … of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area” who “tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work” and “do not speak much English.”

“Under this court’s precedents, not to mention common sense, those circumstances taken together can constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote.

He added that “the interests of individuals who are illegally in the country in avoiding being stopped by law enforcement for questioning is ultimately an interest in evading the law.”

Sotomayor countered that the Trump administration — as well as Kavanaugh — had “all but declared that all Latinos, U.S. citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents’ satisfaction.”

“Allowing the seizure of any Latino speaking Spanish at a car wash in Los Angeles tramples the constitutional requirement that officers ‘must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity,’” Sotomayor wrote.

Much has been made of Kavanaugh’s writing. But Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center, noted it amounts to the reasoning of one justice. It’s not clear why other justices decided to block the lower court’s order.

So Fleming, who is based in Chicago, said he doesn’t believe the law has changed.

Fleming also made note of a reference by Kavanaugh to the experiences of U.S. citizens who are stopped and questioned by immigration authorities. Kavanaugh wrote that, if such a person is lawfully in the country, they’ll “be free to go after the brief encounter.”

“The reality on the streets, that I have seen, is that ICE comes with overwhelming force and only figures it out after they have already placed the person under arrest,” Fleming said.

Sergio Perez, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law Foundation in California, said attorneys in Chicago might benefit from seeing how things played out in the California courts. “They are aware now of some of those landmines,” he said.

But the Supreme Court’s unwritten order also left many to speculate about the justices’ ultimate intentions. Even Sotomayor noted “it is entirely unexplained” — and part of a growing trend with the court.

“This is another reason why, perhaps, we shouldn’t be getting these kinds of monumental decisions in this sort of rapid-fire way,” Fleming told the Sun-Times. “Particularly if the court is not prepared to provide a reasoning on such a fundamental constitutional right in their emergency decision.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be381ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5239x2991+0+251/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5b%2Fef%2Ffedfa1676b5b858cc2935988a260%2Fsupreme-court.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 01:56:25.402281

The lawsuit comes weeks after the Trump administration fined the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) $1.2bn and froze research funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus and other civil rights violations. It was the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze. The administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges, including Harvard, Brown and Columbia.

According to the lawsuit, the Trump administration has made several demands in its proposed settlement offer to UCLA, including giving government access to faculty, student and staff data; releasing admissions and hiring data; ending diversity scholarships; banning overnight demonstrations on university property and cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of the UC system’s president.

The coalition is led by the American Association of University Professors union, or AAUP, and represented by Democracy Forward, a legal group that has brought other lawsuits against the Trump administration over frozen federal funds.

“The blunt cudgel the Trump administration has repeatedly employed in this attack on the independence of institutions of higher education has been the abrupt, unilateral, and unlawful termination of federal research funding on which those institutions and the public interest rely,” the lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco said.

The US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has launched dozens of federal investigations also targeting K-12 school districts.

University of California president, James Milliken, said the federal government has also launched investigations and other actions against all of the UC’s 10 campuses but offered no details in a statement on Monday.

“This represents one of the gravest threats to the University of California in our 157-year history,” he said, adding that the university system receives more than $17bn each year in federal support, including nearly $10bn in Medicare and Medicaid funding, and funding that goes toward research and student financial aid.

The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that Trump decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.

This summer, Columbia University agreed to pay more than $200m as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government’s allegations that the school violated federal anti-discrimination laws. The agreement also restored more than $400m in research grants.

A. from unreasonable, prolonged Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention, the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights filed a habeas petition in the Western District of New York demanding his immediate release. The groups argue that due process does not permit the government to detain noncitizens like J. M. A. indefinitely, without any opportunity to seek bond.

Fleeing political persecution in Cuba for his anti-Communist beliefs, J. M. A. came to the United States in 2023, through the CBPOne App. He applied for lawful permanent residence status under the Cuban Adjustment Act, and received work papers, and a social security number. But in February 2025, J. M. A. was falsely accused of a petty crime—the charges have since been dismissed—and was turned over by local police to ICE, in violation of state law. He has been locked in the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility (Batavia) ever since, despite the fact that he is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community.

“It is unconstitutional and profoundly harmful for ICE to arbitrarily detain J. M. A. in Batavia — a facility long criticized for its cruel, inhumane conditions — for months, with no due process and no end in sight,” said Thomas Munson, Staff Attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “J.M.A. has done exactly what the government asked of him while pursuing a legal pathway to citizenship. For ICE to subject him or anyone else to prolonged detention without any justification is a blatant violation of the constitutional rights afforded to every person in this country.”

“J.M.A. came to the United States to escape an oppressive government in Cuba,” said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. “He did everything that was asked of him, from filing applications and attending court hearings to securing a job. But instead of granting the humanitarian protection that he is legally entitled to, the U.S. government traded one form of oppression for another. J.M.A.’s prolonged detention isn’t just unlawful and unnecessary – it’s reflective of a broken system that punishes people even when they follow the rules.”

Over the past few months, ICE officers have tracked, arrested, and detained thousands of immigrants in New York’s detention facilities. As of September 8, ICE has trapped over 52,000 immigrants in facilities in New York — and the numbers are only climbing.

Representative Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, filed an amendment to eliminate the measure from his department of state policy provisions act, a bill meant to reform the state department in the Trump administration’s image, after widespread criticism from civil liberties advocates, according to the Intercept.

The original language would have given Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, the power to deny or revoke passports for individuals the department determines have provided “material support” to terrorist organizations. Given similar language employed by the Trump administration in other contexts, it is believed to have been intended to target pro-Palestinian activists specifically.

Since Rubio became secretary of state, he has overseen efforts to deport pro-Palestinian international students and deploy an AI-powered “Catch and Revoke” system to target foreign nationals government authorities allege support Hamas. The US also recently announced it will look for “anti-American” views when assessing visa applications.

But the new measure would have significantly escalated these efforts by targeting US citizens. Mast had initially defended the broader legislation, saying it “ensures every dollar and every diplomat puts America First and is accountable to the president’s foreign policy” when the House foreign affairs committee introduced the package last week.

However, a committee spokesperson told the Intercept the committee would not allow the passport revocation amendment to “overshadow the bipartisan effort to restore command and control of the State Department to the Secretary”.

A committee spokesperson did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on Mast’s decision to remove the provision.

Among other provisions, the bill package also includes a proposal to create a new “state sponsor of unlawful or wrongful detention” designation to penalize foreign governments that detain US nationals and require stronger accountability measures in those cases.

The episode unfolded as Rubio wrapped a trip to Israel, Qatar and the UK to discuss Israel’s war in Gaza, ahead of the UN general assembly meeting in New York next week.

PORTSMOUTH – The chair of the Pease Development Authority board said he would have legal counsel explore the idea from former U.S. Senator Gordon Humphrey, R-NH, that it has the option to declare Pease a “sanctuary” airport and refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities at Tuesday’s meeting.

Humphrey said the PDA could declare non-cooperation with the federal government in such flights.

“You have the option. I plead with you to use it,” Humphrey said of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation and transfer flights out of Pease International Airport.

Steve Duprey, chair of the PDA board, said he would have legal counsel look into that possibility. “We are not unsympathetic” with Humphrey and the overflow crowd of ICE detention and deportation opponents who came from across the state to its 8:30 a.m. board meeting to demand a halt to future flights.

Opponents of ICE at the meeting said volunteers have watched and filmed from the gate and counted as many 407 people shackled and marched on to airplanes. They have not been given any due process and are being taken away from their families and essential work, the PDA board was told.

They also said PDA has given them access to the tarmac to board planes. Duprey said that is the extent to which the PDA employees have been involved.

Duprey cited a memo which was circulated from the board’s legal counsel which he said explained the board’s legal options to prohibit ICE flights and spoke of counsel’s identification of “limitations” and impacts which could be “extraordinarily severe.”

While he noted public comments that there is a negative economic impact to losing essential workers through ICE detentions, Duprey said there would also be a negative economic impact if the airport was to be closed by federal officials.

Many speakers addressed the moral and ethical concerns of such deportations and questioned the legality of the actions under the Constitution.

A letter from the Council of Churches was read identifying the “deep moral concern,” for the actions which began in July and have now ceased, which some theorized perhaps only temporarily, due to the reopening of Hanscom Field airport in Bedford, Mass.

Whether or not the Trump Administration is watching public activism around these flights is not known but it may not be coincidental that public activism in Massachusetts led to the relocation of flights to Pease.

On Sept. 15, WBUR in Boston reported ICE flights had returned after being halted in July.

WBUR said “Human Rights First, a nonprofit that tracks ICE flights, has logged at least five trips to Hanscom over the past week. The activity comes two months after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it stopped using the airport, located 20 miles northwest of Boston.”

An ICE spokesman confirmed to WBUR that the agency has restarted the flights in Hanscom.

“Flying aliens out of Hanscom allows ICE to move detainees quickly from the intake center at Burlington to a detention center once they have been processed,” the spokesman, James Covington, said in a statement.

The Boston public radio station said The Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates Hanscom, has previously said ICE does not need the state agency’s permission to use the facility and does not alert the airport when it lands flights there.

At the monthly meeting of the Pease Development Authority board Tuesday, Kendra Ford said that the last flights out of Pease that volunteers could verify was on Sept. 4.

She said volunteers watched from the airport gate as the shackled individuals boarded a white painted plane with no identifying markers and saw “more than 400 humans torn away” from families and work in flights out of Pease on Aug. 5,7,9,12,14,16,19,21,23,26,28 and September 2 and 4 when there were two flights.

David Holt of Occupy Seacoast said there are economic factors which are one of the Pease board’s most important charges “we are losing people who are doing essential work.”

Both Occupy NH Seacoast, and Mount Washington Valley Resistance, in the Conway area are working on the “ICE Out of Pease” campaign, which is led by the American Friends Service Committee and includes Veterans for Peace, 350NH, NH Youth Movement, Southern New Hampshire Indivisible, Southern NH Democratic Socialists of America, the Kent Street Coalition, and residents from across New England.

In a press statement, Sarah Cornell of Portsmouth said, “We have seen first-hand the abuse and transfer of at least 407 individuals by ICE agents using flights in and out of Pease. Commercial operators of ICE flights from Pease are GlobalX, Eastern Air, and Avelo, which have moved people from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts to far-flung parts of the United States.”

The release noted the “Stop Avelo” campaign continues in Manchester, where Avelo still operates commercial flights.

On Aug. 19 another monthly Pease meeting found board members confronted with angry residents and a petition opposing the flights signed by more than 2,000.

Since August 8, there have been regular “ICE Out of Pease” demonstrations around Portsmouth, including a two-day demonstration during the “Thunder over NH” air show September 6-7.

On September 5, the press release said ICE contract flights resumed at Hanscom Air Field and have continued daily carrying an estimated more than 400 individuals to date.

The release noted opposition groups in Massachusetts are re-mobilizing and a Hanscom Advisory Committee meeting is also today, Tuesday at 7 p.m.

Humphrey, a consistent presence at “ICE Out of Pease” demonstrations and a nationally known conservative Republican, has said the Constitution of the United States makes clear that the states are not servants of the federal government, and the PDA is completely at liberty to refuse services of its employees to assist ICE.

“Surely ICE doesn’t show up unannounced,” Humphrey told the PDA board Tuesday. “Surely they email and call and say ‘hey we’re on the way,’ to your employees. Your employees need not talk to them. Let ICE do its dirty work by itself, give them an electronic key to the gate and let them do everything they think they need to do but don’t be part of it,” the former Senator said. “Please.”

He reminded the PDA board they are sworn to the Constitution and should uphold it.

“You’re sworn, as officers of the state,” he said, and should, “Stand up to federal agencies that are denying constitutional rights.”

State Sen. David Meuse, D-Portsmouth, posted on Twitter Tuesday: “Pushing back this morning on ICE operations out of Pease. Every peaceful protest and honest conversation we have with our neighbors about these issues helps. Every time we do something, it means something. Be the sand in fascism’s gears, people.” #ICEOutOfPease #NHPolitics

Decades later, Presidents Reagan and Clinton issued national apologies and reparations to survivors.

In March, the Trump administration invoked the AEA to disappear more than 130 men to a mega-prison in El Salvador without due process. For months, their loved ones had no sign of life from their fathers, brothers, and friends. Since being returned to Venezuela in a prisoner exchange, the men have reported verbal, physical, sexual, and psychological abuse in the mega-prison, including beatings and sexual assault by guards.

While relieved they are no longer languishing in a prison notorious for torture, their safety is far from guaranteed. Many fled persecution in Venezuela – and the United States just delivered them back to danger.

More on the Alien Enemies Act: The Alien Enemies Act is the last remaining law of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. It grants the president sweeping power to detain and deport immigrants based on nationality during declared war, invasion, or predatory incursion. The law applies to any immigrant regardless of length of residency, refugee status, or military service.

The Trump administration has weaponized the AEA to disappear immigrants under the guise of national security. Officials allege its invocation was necessary to deport Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members, but the vast majority of those disappeared have no ties to the gang or criminal records, and a federal appeals court found there is “no invasion or predatory incursion.” This use of the AEA abused its original purpose–and now, President Trump has even floated the idea of sending U.S. citizens to the mega-prison in El Salvador.

Now is the time to take action: Passing the Neighbors Not Enemies Act would prevent future presidents from detaining or deporting people without evidence or the chance to be heard in court. Urge your Members of Congress to cosponsor the Neighbors Not Enemies Act today to protect due process and prevent future human rights abuses.

Kennedy Human Rights organization, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, the National Immigration Project and the Southeast Dignity Not Detention coalition, is on behalf of several detainees who say they experienced sexual assault, forced labor, denial of medical care, and retaliatory solitary confinement while awaiting deportation at the Evangeline Parish facility.

The organizations claim that the female-only facility, which also holds detainees of various gender identities and is operated by GEO Group Inc., violated civil and human rights, national standards and several ICE directives. The complaint says the practices were ""part of a systemic pattern of abuse that those in authority at the facility cannot or will not correct.""

South Louisiana ICE Processing Center administration, ICE New Orleans Field Office officials, and GEO Group were not immediately available for comment on the complaint.

The complaint accuses a former assistant warden, Manuel Reyes, of separately approaching four detainees to participate in an unsanctioned ""night shift cleaning crew."" The complaint claims no official record of the program exists, and that Reyes targeted LGBTQ+ detainees.

Reyes is accused of stalking, verbally harassing and sexually assaulting and harassing the four while coercing other detainees into sexual acts. One detainee, identified as Jane Doe, claimed Reyes groped her breasts and forced her to perform oral sex after he threatened her and her family.

The sexual abuse occurred on a near-daily basis over four months, Doe told the organization.

A RFKHR attorney, Sarah Decker, said Doe approached her last year during a bimonthly legal training session for those being held in the facility. Doe told Decker about the alleged sexual abuse happening at the hands of the Reyes. Doe would later connect the attorney with other detainees.

""(Reyes) was using this program to intentionally punish people on the basis of their gender identity."" Decker said. ""The people who were involved in this were all either trans men or masculine-presenting LGBTQ people.""

Official Prison Rape Elimination Act complaints filed by the detainees were left unanswered or deemed unsubstantiated by ICE, while grievances and Office of the Inspector General hotline calls were ignored, according to the civil rights complaint.

When accusations were reported, detainees were met with retaliation following minor or made-up infractions — often placed in solitary confinement for days or weeks, according to the complaint. Officers, under the command of Reyes, would beat at least one detainee after asking to submit a complaint.

""The more we learned, the more apparent it became that this was a really heinous situation,"" Decker said.

Two of the detainees said they were denied medical care, according to the filing. One said he didn't ask for treatment for chemical burns he received during the work program due to fear of retaliation.

Doe and he, both of whom suffer from epilepsy, were denied consistent treatment. Doe was allegedly denied seizure medication, neurologist care, and emergency care after several seizures.

Reyes left his position as assistant warden in July 2024. Decker said Reyes is no longer at the Basile facility. It is unknown if he is still employed by GEO Group.

In August 2024, the FBI interviewed several detainees regarding allegations of sexual and physical abuse at the facility, according to the organizations' complaint.

Three detainees said they faced retaliation after the interviews. Two currently remain in ICE custody.

While the complaint was filed on behalf of four individuals, Decker suggested the issue is a larger, more pervasive problem within the system nationally and that ICE has attempted to cover up allegations.

The human rights organizations are calling for the release of all detainees in the ICE processing facility and the termination of its agreements with the federal agency. Following the facility's closure, the organizations called for a full investigation into the alleged violations.

In 2024, the ACLU of Louisiana called for an independent probe of the ICE New Orleans Field Office to address a 108-page document that described inhumane conditions across the state's nine detention facilities.

A crowd soon forms nearby, and members of the Milford Police Department help with crowd control and traffic.
She added that ICE called his parents to pick him up, but when they “refused to come get him,” ICE drove him home.
Caroll said these incidents sow fear and distrust in the institutions that make America great, such as the immigration court system.
“The trauma that he and his family have endured as a result of ICE’s actions will be difficult to overcome.”","The teen’s family is still waiting for a decision on their asylum case.

A routine after-school stop for a snack turned into a traumatic encounter on Friday when a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer reportedly tackled 16-year-old Gustavo Enrique De Oliveira in Milford, threatened to shoot him, and briefly detained him.

According to his lawyers, the Milford High School student, who has no criminal history, was held for about an hour and ordered to report to ICE’s Burlington office this week. ICE released him after he checked in on Monday.

Lawyers from the Mabel Center, which is providing the family with pro bono legal support, say the unexpected detention has caused “fear” and “anxiety” for the family, who are awaiting a decision on their asylum case and were facing additional scrutiny from ICE on Tuesday.

“It was heart-wrenching to speak with (his mother) and see the suffering, the uncertainty, the anxiety,” said Alexandra Peredo Carroll, the director of legal education and advocacy at the Mabel Center. “This did not need to happen — other than to terrorize.”

Caroll said the incident started when Gustavo was a passenger in his friend’s car and a masked individual approached him — and he ran out of fear. He stopped when the officer threatened to shoot him, she said.

Gustavo’s family told NBC10 Boston that ICE agents then grabbed Gustavo, pinned him to the ground, put him in a car, and took him away.

The teen was taken a few blocks away down Main Street in a dark SUV, which the Milford Police Department caught on camera pulling in front of a white car to question someone in front of the police department.

The video footage shows a passerby stopping and then starting to take footage. He appears to interact with ICE agents. A crowd soon forms nearby, and members of the Milford Police Department help with crowd control and traffic.

The Milford Police did not provide a comment on the incident.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin released a statement stating Gustavo was not the target.

“ICE does NOT target juveniles or children,” her statement said.

During a targeted enforcement operation, McLaughlin said that two “illegal aliens” fled from a car on foot, and one of the suspected targets escaped.

During the operation, she said ICE briefly detained a 16-year-old Brazilian to “determine his identity and if he was a potential safety threat.”

McLaughlin said ICE was unaware of the teen’s age at the time of the detainment. She added that ICE called his parents to pick him up, but when they “refused to come get him,” ICE drove him home.

“He isn’t a public safety threat, and he never should have been arrested,” Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement in response to the incident. “These arrests by ICE aren’t about public safety; they are designed to sow fear and intimidation in our communities, and they make us all less safe.”

Community support

The community has come out to support the family, holding a rally on Sunday supporting immigrant rights near the corner where ICE officials detained Gustavo.

In a Facebook post, photos show signs saying, “Kids need parents, not prison,” “Education, not deportation,” and “Keep families together.”

The rally came as this is the second teenager in the town to be detained by ICE this year. Earlier in the summer, Marcelo Gomes da Silva, 18, was detained on his way to volleyball practice. A judge later released him on bond.

This most recent incident follows ICE’s new operation “Patriot 2.0,” which follows May’s crackdown, where nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in the state.

Caroll noted, “Mildford has had enough with what is happening in their community.”

She pointed to alleged inaccuracies in McLaughlin’s statement that encouraged immigrants to “take control of their departure” using the CBP Home app. The app offers a $1,000 stipend to fly home while preserving the option to return the “legal way and live the American dream.”

The family members are going through the legal process of asylum, which requires them to be in the U.S. to apply. She said the detention is throwing a “wrench” in that process.

Caroll said these incidents sow fear and distrust in the institutions that make America great, such as the immigration court system.

“People have the right to not go through this,” Caroll said. These actions are eroding everybody’s protections, she said.

Caroll said that whether Gustavo will return to school is hard to answer. “The trauma that he and his family have endured as a result of ICE’s actions will be difficult to overcome.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4TO4DG7EMI643BOJBLQB26D5N4-68c9b7d11ee69-768x432.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 19:57:28.758867

President Donald Trump has continually been challenging who gets to be American. His administration has removed thousands of predominantly Black and brown immigrants, and revoked visas and eliminated legal pathways that for decades have allowed people from around the world to visit, live, and work here. Now, his administration has found a new avenue to attack in order to make it harder for immigrants hoping to establish a life in the U.S.: The citizenship test.

“I am declaring war on fraud,” Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said at an event in Washington this month. “I am declaring war on anyone that is coming to this country and wants to get a benefit, but doesn’t want the responsibility of what it means to actually be a U.S. citizen.”

Edlow claimed the current version of the U.S. citizenship test is “just too easy” and that the U.S. government needs a better way of assessing “whether someone has a true attachment to the Constitution, as required by the statute.” The process of becoming a U.S. citizen is called naturalization, and only a select few are eligible: those who have been given lawful permanent resident status—known as a green-card holder—for at least five years, those married to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for three years, U.S. military service members, or a child of a U.S. citizen. Once an applicant satisfies one of these requirements, they must pay a handsome filing fee, clear extensive background checks, and pass the citizenship test, which consists of an English proficiency test and a civics exam.

This test has mostly stayed the same since the 1980s, with educators and scholars advising the federal government on an appropriate test that’s based on a level of knowledge of American history and civics that an average native-born American would have. Cases of fraud are relatively uncommon, though the Trump administration has directed the Department of Justice to prioritize denaturalization cases to strip people of their American citizenship. Now, it seems, they want to target the test itself.

To understand how the U.S. citizenship test was created and how the Trump administration’s plans to make it harder could actually play out, I spoke with Doris Meissner. She was director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under Bill Clinton’s administration, where she worked on reforms to the naturalization process. She’s currently a senior fellow and director of U.S. immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Slate: So there is an English language component to the citizenship test and a civics section. Who created this and why?

Doris Meissner: The written test that we’re talking about is the civics test. There hadn’t been a standardized citizenship test until about 1986, and prior to that time, when people had their citizenship interview, they were all interviewed by an immigration adjudicator, who were previously called examiners. The adjudicator speaks to the person in English so they can demonstrate their English language capability through conversation. The civics test, prior to 1986, was informal, with immigration officers all over the country asking questions about the American system of government: Do we elect our president? Who is our current president? What is the first line of “The Star Spangled Banner”? They asked these types of questions at random, and it could be different in any office and among every adjudicator. It was up to the adjudicator to verify that the person had an understanding of the American system of government. This informal process changed to a standardized test process in 1986, and it’s taken various forms since then, but basically followed a similar format.

Generally, over the years, it’s been a list of 100 questions which serve as a study guide for the naturalization applicant, and it is all questions that have to do with the American system of government. What we would consider middle-school civics curriculum is the type of questions the applicant has to study in advance. From those 100 questions, the adjudicator will typically ask 10 questions, and, for most of recent decades, a passing grade is considered anywhere between six to eight correct answers. These 10 questions are randomly selected off of this list of 100 questions, because it presumes that the applicant has studied the test questions and therefore knows the answers to many more of the questions than the ones that are actually asked.

The level of learning that it takes to understand and answer those 100 questions has not just been randomly put together. The Immigration Service has gone through a thorough process of working with educators, English language experts, and history scholars in order to determine what the range of questions should be that actually meet the statutory requirement of knowledge of civics and American government. Over the years, that level of learning has been pegged at about a sixth-grade level of understanding. That is based on a much broader set of standards in the education community about what is a level of learning and understanding that represents what most Americans understand.

The Trump administration said it plans on making the citizenship test harder, establishing a higher bar for passing and adding an essay section. Besides the shift to a standardized test in 1986, how often does this test actually change?

The tests have somewhat improved over the years. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a system where the test would be reviewed every 10 years and updated and refined to reflect constitutional amendments and those kinds of changes. When those reviews took place, test questions may have been edited or changed to a degree, but the test itself remained intact, until the first Trump administration. Instead of a 10-year review, the first Trump administration made the argument that the test was not hard enough and needed to require more answers to questions. Then with the Biden administration in 2020, it was time for the 10-year review, and the test changed again and they made it a little bit more like what the test had been prior to the first Trump administration. Now, we’re seeing, with the return of another Trump administration, that same pattern has come back: The test is not hard enough, we need to make it more rigorous, people need to demonstrate their commitment to being an American, and they need to be convincing about their loyalty and their patriotism.

I’m not sure that the federal statute actually requires this. The statute requires knowledge of the English language and of American government. I don’t know that an attachment to the Constitution is actually language that is in the statute. I would have to say that over the years, when the 100 questions are put before native-born Americans, the failure rate is quite high. If you ask a random group of Americans to answer these questions, they don’t do as well on the test as people who are applying for naturalization do; usually somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 to 91 percent pass the citizenship test. Research also shows that people who are applying for naturalization are worried far more about being able to demonstrate their English language capability than about their ability to pass the civics test, because the knowledge of American government is something you can study, and people do study hard.

How would the government implement an essay section within the current citizenship test?

I don’t think it’s practical at all. What would be the standards for judging whether an essay meets some level of scrutiny? I think that introducing an essay into a system like this would actually make it be more prone to misuse, because there would be all kinds of ways of getting ahold of template essays that have been approved by prior applicants, going to ChatGPT, using who knows what. That proposal to introduce something like an essay, I can’t see doing anything but trying to raise the level of intimidation and an effort to discourage people from naturalizing when they might otherwise be eligible.

The fact that this process, for many decades now, has been one informed by professional opinion and experienced educators gives it the “good housekeeping” feel that is more than sufficient.

The Trump administration has been pushing the idea that immigrants are bad and using that as a justification to completely upend our legal immigration system. Do you think this latest announcement about making the citizenship test harder is another way to fuel more negative sentiment about immigrants?

Yes, I agree with that, and I think that’s a very important shift. Discussing naturalization now entirely through the lens of fraud and of manipulating and misusing the system, being opposed somehow or another to Americanness—whatever that might mean—is very much at odds with what the experience has been. First of all, to apply for naturalization, there is a sizable fee. People have to not only be motivated, but have the financial means. And people who apply for naturalization want to be American, that’s why they do it. They are absolutely attached to the idea of America. This is painting a picture of people going through the naturalization process that is not representative at all of what the experience and the reality is of people who are applying for naturalization.

I think one of the things to really reflect on with all of this is that up until now, the administration has been talking about illegal immigration and being opposed to it, obviously through the mass deportations initiative and the high level of priority that the administration is giving to that. That’s one thing, but they’ve always, until now, basically said, We want people to play by the rules and we want people to use our legal immigration system. But now what’s happening is that the very people who are in fact playing by the rules, exercising their rights under the legal immigration system, are being characterized in a very negative light, and that is a big shift.

In your experience, is there actually a high level of fraud in the U.S. citizenship application process?

No. Any major system has a degree of fraud and does need to be highly vigilant and have procedures in place that detect fraud, like Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security. Immigration is also one, so fraud is always a possibility. But the naturalization system, and the immigration system overall, has had a very consistent focus on fraud detection, and the procedures that are required for people to pass background checks have gotten better and better over the years, particularly since 9/11. Federal government databases have become linked and technology has made it possible to include not only immigration information, but all of the information that the FBI has, like terrorism information—that is in the hands of the government; information from states and localities around the country, in terms of crimes that might have been committed at a local level. Now databases also allow for information on credit history and borrowing patterns. There is a tremendous amount of information that is available in the initial screening, and these are people, of course, who have been screened a number of times already because they have gotten a green card, a visa to come into the country. They’ve been screened at a number of points along the path of the immigration system to even get to the point where they have the basic eligibility to apply for naturalization now.

If one goes back over a number of administrations, I remember during the Obama administration there were some issues that were detected in the naturalization process that had to do with some fraud. There were vigorous efforts to adjust the system to prevent that. The USCIS, as an agency, and the naturalization process as a system, has always been vigilant about its screening process and about the possibilities for fraud. This is not the kind of system that lends itself to fraudsters.",https://compote.slate.com/images/79232fff-55ed-4421-8458-3523cf61a52a.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2025-09-16 19:57:15.450206

Even though Perdomo is not a merits opinion, it may foreshadow how the Court will ultimately rule on this issue.
At a minimum, it foretells a loosening of the reasonable suspicion standard in the context of immigration stops.
The concurrence allows immigration agents to meet that standard based on “specific articulable facts” which previously would likely have been deemed insufficient and potentially characterized as racial profiling.
This requirement should apply to all employees, including subcontractors and even those individuals born in the United States.","Under federal law, government agents are authorized to “interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States.” Under applicable regulations, the agents “may briefly detain” an individual “for questioning” if they have “a reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts, that the person being questioned . . . is an alien illegally in the United States.”

In June 2025, agents from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the United States Department of Homeland Security were deployed throughout Los Angeles to arrest undocumented immigrants as part of a plan called “Operation At Large,” which “federal officials have described as ‘the Largest Mass Deportation Operation . . . in History.’” Five individuals stopped during Operation At Large and four interested associations challenged the constitutionality of the agents’ tactics, filing a class action against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and other immigration officials.

In July, a federal district court in California entered a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the government from basing reasonable suspicion for a stop “solely” on certain factors, whether “alone or in combination”:

“Apparent race or ethnicity;”

“Speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent;”

“Presence at a particular location (e.g., bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, etc.);” or

“The type of work one does.”

On September 8, the Supreme Court granted defendants’ application for a stay of the TRO pending appeal in the Ninth Circuit. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, concurring in the grant of the stay, wrote that it is “common sense” that in the Los Angeles area, the factors on which the district court’s TRO enjoined the government from relying can, taken together, “constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.” Justice Kavanaugh noted that under the Court’s precedent, “apparent ethnicity” is not alone enough to create reasonable suspicion but can contribute to the formation of reasonable suspicion “when considered along with other salient factors.”

In weighing the balance of harms and equities, Justice Kavanaugh stated that the interests of those in the country illegally in avoiding interrogation or detention is “not . . . especially weighty,” and opined that when individuals legally in the U.S. are stopped by immigration officials, questioning “is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after,” clarifying that they are either U.S. citizens or otherwise legally present in the country. Writing on behalf of the dissenting justices, Justice Sonia Sotomayor deemed the harm to U.S. citizens and documented immigrants significantly greater than Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence recognized and argued that the Court’s decision removes Fourth Amendment protection from “arbitrary interference by law officers” for individuals with a certain appearance and manner of speech who are employed in certain low-wage jobs.

Even though Perdomo is not a merits opinion, it may foreshadow how the Court will ultimately rule on this issue. At a minimum, it foretells a loosening of the reasonable suspicion standard in the context of immigration stops. The concurrence allows immigration agents to meet that standard based on “specific articulable facts” which previously would likely have been deemed insufficient and potentially characterized as racial profiling.

Although Perdomo did not arise out of a worksite enforcement operation, companies operating in industries where employees of foreign descent are common should be mindful of the ruling. Even when those agents are onsite pursuant to a search warrant or consent, before Perdomo they were obligated to identify “specific articulable facts” demonstrating reasonable suspicion before detaining and questioning individual employees. Perdomo lowers the applicable standard, effectively empowering immigration agents to detain and question any employee onsite who meets the criteria listed in the concurrence — though it is unclear how many of the four listed factors must be present to create reasonable suspicion under the “totality of the circumstances.”

In this new environment, we recommend companies consider the following steps:

Develop a response plan for unannounced visits by government agents. Senior officials onsite and those employees most likely to interact with those agents initially should be trained on how to respond.

Evaluate the areas of greatest risk and adjust policies accordingly. For example, temporary staffing agencies are often a source of undocumented workers. Companies should work to ensure that individuals provided by such agencies are properly documented and terminate relationships with agencies who demonstrate insufficient attention to detail in this area.

Employees should be strongly encouraged, if not required, to carry identification and/or documentation demonstrating that they are in the country legally and are authorized to work. This requirement should apply to all employees, including subcontractors and even those individuals born in the United States. Because Perdomo validates detention and questioning based on an individual’s “apparent race or ethnicity” coupled with a factor such as “the type of work one does,” even those individuals born in the United States are subject to detention and questioning if they appear to be of foreign descent and are working certain jobs (such as agriculture, construction, or assembly line work).

Where feasible, companies should separately maintain identification information for employees, and strongly encourage subcontractors to do the same. Having such information readily at hand can serve to reduce the disorder and disruption that might otherwise result from an unannounced visit.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-09/immigration%20law%20bigstock%20140660921.jpg.webp?itok=ufPQFY-3,N,,2025-09-16 16:57:57.347607

If their conduct, which McIver’s attorneys said was “far more egregious” than anything McIver did, has been treated so gently by Trump’s DOJ, then the vigorous prosecution of McIver should be seen as politically motivated.
The trespassing charges against Baraka were later dropped, and earned the U.S. Attorney’s office a scolding from a federal magistrate judge.
Another motion filed by McIver last month demanded that the Trump administration cease making “extrajudicial statements” about her and withdraw any such prior statements.
Finally, McIver and the DOJ remain at odds on discovery.","Last month, New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark), under indictment for assault, asked a federal judge to throw out the charges against her for containing a number of supposedly fatal defects. In an 80-page brief filed yesterday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) argues that no such dismissal is warranted.

The brief also largely corroborates McIver’s own account of what happened on May 9 at the Delaney Hall immigrant detention center. McIver and two of her congressional colleagues were allowed into the facility for an oversight visit; Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was also let inside the facility’s gates, then told to leave, which he did after a tense interaction with immigration officials who threatened to arrest him; and finally, even after exiting the gates, Baraka was arrested anyways, prompting the scuffle that forms the basis of the charges against McIver.

Another detail confirmed by the brief: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents arrested Baraka after “consulting with the Deputy Attorney General,” Todd Blanche, the DOJ’s second-in-command.

In their motions last month, McIver’s defense attorneys put forward two key arguments for why the charges should be dismissed: the prosecution against her is vindictive and politically motivated by her criticism of President Donald Trump’s policies, and the charges center around official legislative business that’s protected by the Constitution’s Speech or Debate clause.

Writing for the DOJ, however, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mark McCarren and Benjamin Bleiberg work to dismantle those arguments, saying that they are an attempt to obfuscate what is otherwise a straightforward case of assault. A trial in the matter is scheduled for November 10, but the decision about whether the case will continue ultimately rests with U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper.

McIver’s claims of selective prosecution, the DOJ argues, fall apart because she provides no specific evidence that she was treated any differently from another defendant in her situation, or that the prosecution – led by controversial acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, whose authority as New Jersey’s top prosecutor remains in limbo – harbors any specific animus against her.

“[McIver’s allegation of discriminatory intent] relies primarily upon a mistaken understanding of DOJ policy, as well as out-of-context statements concerning the Administration’s well-publicized law enforcement policies and priorities,” the brief states. “In the process, McIver omits mention of evidence contradicting her claims from the very sources upon which she relies for her supposed evidence of ‘discriminatory intent.’”

McIver’s motion also rested heavily on a comparison to the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, who were subject to blanket pardons and dismissals of charges when Trump retook office this year. If their conduct, which McIver’s attorneys said was “far more egregious” than anything McIver did, has been treated so gently by Trump’s DOJ, then the vigorous prosecution of McIver should be seen as politically motivated.

The DOJ, however, calls that comparison “apples to oranges,” saying the treatment of one cannot be used as a defense of the other. Moreover, the DOJ contends that Trump’s sweeping pardons covered even January 6 defendants who had not yet been prosecuted, and a presidential pardon is “absolute.”

“McIver’s claim faces a threshold, insurmountable defect: the January 6 Defendants cannot be considered similarly situated because they all were pardoned,” the brief states. “As a consequence, their ongoing prosecutions had to be dismissed without regard to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and they could not be prosecuted for January 6th related crimes thereafter.”

Another argument McIver put forward, that the DOJ failed to consult with its Public Integrity Section (PIN), is similarly moot, the brief states, because the DOJ had already suspended its own policy requiring consultation with PIN before bringing charges against members of Congress.

Citing a Reuters article, the brief places the suspension of the policy around May 10 – right as DHS began publicly threatening action against McIver and the two other Democratic members of Congress present for the visit and ensuing fracas. Reps. Rob Menendez (D-Jersey City) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing), referred to as “Betsy” at one point in the DOJ’s brief, ultimately were not charged.

As for McIver’s claims that her conduct is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause, the DOJ acknowledges that the Delaney Hall oversight visit falls under the category of McIver’s official actions as a congresswoman, but disputes the idea that an altercation with law enforcement officials is subject to the same protections.

“Imagine, for example, that McIver, while touring Delaney Hall, smuggled in contraband that she surreptitiously slipped to a detainee,” the brief states. “Such conduct would violate a number of federal and state statutes, and it would certainly have no legitimate legislative purpose. But under McIver’s theory of immunity, she would be immune from prosecution because it occurred during an otherwise legitimate legislative act.”

“It defies logic to believe that the Founders envisioned the immunity conferred by the Speech or Debate Clause sweeps so broadly,” it continues.

According to the brief, McIver attempted to impede Baraka’s arrest twice: first when Baraka was confronted while inside the gates, and again during Baraka’s actual arrest outside the gates. The latter incident, when McIver placed her arms around Baraka to prevent the arrest and “barreled after the Mayor and the [Special Agent in Charge], making forcible contact with the SAC and one other ICE officer,” provides the basis for the charges against her.

The trespassing charges against Baraka were later dropped, and earned the U.S. Attorney’s office a scolding from a federal magistrate judge.

The brief’s summary of events appears to concede a key point that McIver has suggested: none of the federal agents involved in the scuffle actually experienced any injuries as a result. The DOJ argues, however, that “the Government does not need to show harm or injury to satisfy the elements of the offenses charged.”

Seemingly contradicted by the brief, meanwhile, are claims from DHS officials in the wake of the incident that McIver and her colleagues had “stormed” and “illegally [broken] into” Delaney Hall, rather than simply walking in for an oversight visit. The brief’s timeline of events states that McIver “entered through the front gate into the secured area of the facility,” and makes no mention of any forcible entry into the facility.

Another motion filed by McIver last month demanded that the Trump administration cease making “extrajudicial statements” about her and withdraw any such prior statements. The DOJ says in its brief that it has asked DHS to remove five of its posts that McIver found objectionable, but all five of the posts remain public on the DHS’s website or social media as of this morning.

Finally, McIver and the DOJ remain at odds on discovery. McIver’s flurry of motions last month insisted that the DOJ has not handed over a raft of important evidence; the DOJ’s brief says it is willing to grant McIver’s request for internal video of McIver’s oversight tour, but called other requests “breathtaking in [their] scope.”

The DOJ also contested McIver’s claim that some relevant body camera footage has not been released; while footage from 11 agents’ body cameras have been provided, the DOJ says other agents present for the incident were not wearing cameras at the time, including the two agents identified as “Victim-1” and “Victim-2.”

The finding is the sixth time this year the GAO has determined the Trump administration violated the Impoundment Control Act, which lays out a legal process for the president to request Congress cancel previously approved spending.

Instead of following that process, the GAO report says, the Trump administration significantly delayed issuing a notice of funding opportunity, the first step in awarding grants from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. FEMA has not issued that notice for the Shelter and Services Program.

FEMA programs provide food, shelter

GAO wrote in the 22-page report the delay in the Emergency Food and Shelter Program notice of funding opportunity “constitutes an impermissible withholding and a violation of the ICA.”

The Trump administration’s actions regarding the Shelter and Services Program “establish the intent to impermissibly defer or preclude the obligation of budget authority,” according to the report.

The Emergency Food and Shelter Program “supplements and expands ongoing work of local nonprofit and governmental social service organizations to provide shelter, food and supportive services to individuals and families who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, hunger and/or homelessness,” according to FEMA’s website.

The Shelter and Services Program is designed to provide temporary housing to relieve overcrowding in federal immigration facilities.

Congressional powers

GAO also sought to reinforce the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution in the report, explaining that Congress approves laws and that once the president signs those laws, it’s up to that branch of government to implement them.

“This process does not grant the President the authority to pass his own laws or to ignore or amend a law duly enacted by Congress. Instead, the President must ‘faithfully execute’ the law as Congress enacts it,” the GAO report states. “It follows from this that Executive Orders cannot function to repeal or undo legislation.”

Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement the latest GAO report “is another stark reminder of a fact we have known for months: President Trump is breaking the law in order to prevent communities across the country from receiving resources they have been promised, including critical funding to address homelessness.

“The same guy who says he wants to get people off the streets is blocking funding for communities to tackle homelessness. Donald Trump and Russ Vought need to immediately allow these resources to flow, and Republican lawmakers need to join us insisting every last bit of this funding gets out the door in a fair, impartial way.”

Vought is the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

The report, based on accounts of several unidentified federal employees familiar with the data, appeared to contradict a sworn statement made in a lawsuit over the children’s fate by Angie Salazar, a senior health official. She said the children had been properly screened and cleared for repatriation. It also came less than a week after the judge presiding over the case, Timothy J. Kelly, challenged lawyers from the Justice Department about the veracity of another of their central claims in the dispute: that the children’s parents had requested their return.

Filed to Congress by the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower protection group, the report said at least 30 of the 327 children the government cleared for imminent removal had “indicators of being a victim of child abuse” in Guatemala, based on the government’s own findings.

The children, who came to the United States as unaccompanied minors in recent years and have been living in shelters or foster care under government supervision, were hastily targeted by the Trump administration over the Labor Day weekend. Upon learning that the children were being loaded onto flights to be sent back, lawyers from the National Immigration Law Center sued to block the removals and a federal judge ordered the government to halt until the case could be argued.

The Trump administration has said it was exercising an authority to reunify unaccompanied children with their parents abroad, claiming that it was acting at the behest of the children’s families and with the children's well-being in mind.

But the report on Tuesday was the second time that notion had been called into question.

Ms. Salazar filed the declaration in her capacity as the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services that maintains custody over minors who enter the United States alone.

As of September 11, the average daily population at Otay Mesa was about 1,400 people, according to ICE detention data.
Several San Diego immigration attorneys who talked to inewsource said they haven’t had any clients held in solitary confinement recently.
The DOJ found that custody staff often did not conduct mental health reviews before putting immigrants in isolation cells.
The Trump administration attempted to shutter that office as well as the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, two of the main oversight bodies for conditions inside immigration detention centers, and the U.S.","The number of immigrants spending time in isolated cells inside a federal detention center in San Diego County has spiked in the last three months, according to data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Custody staff at the Otay Mesa Detention Center put 42 immigrants into “segregation” in August – eight times higher than a year prior – marking a sharp increase as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown swells detentions beyond capacity in some places.

ICE uses the term “segregation” to describe placements in one to two person cells where detainees can be held for up to 24 hours a day. National detention standards which ICE follows define segregation as “confinement in an individual cell isolated from the general population.” Human rights groups, however, widely recognize the practice as solitary confinement.

The upward trend in San Diego follows a similar one across the country, with ICE increasingly relying on the isolation cells as more than 60,000 people remain detained in immigration detention centers as of August.

More than 1,000 people have spent time in segregation in ICE detention every month since April, according to ICE data, which counts individuals who spend at least one day in segregation in a month. That’s about double the monthly number from last year.

ICE uses isolation cells as a punitive as well as a protective measure, including for vulnerable detainees, according to its policies. Between January and March, the latest time frame reported by ICE, the average time spent in isolated cells in ICE custody nationwide was 38 days. That’s more than double the amount that constitutes torture according to the United Nations.

About a third of those placements were for disciplinary reasons. The next most common reasons were protective custody followed by mental health reasons. ICE does not provide the placement reasons for specific facilities.

The use of solitary confinement broadly has been criticized by human rights groups as inhumane, especially in immigration detention, where people are held for civil immigration proceedings or while awaiting deportation. Research shows that solitary confinement has detrimental physical and psychological health effects.

As of September 11, the average daily population at Otay Mesa was about 1,400 people, according to ICE detention data. About 89% had no criminal convictions.

In February, a German tourist said she spent more than a week inside solitary confinement at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, during which she “went so insane that she started punching the walls” and got blood on her hands, the woman’s friend told a TV station. News outlets across the country have documented other cases of immigrants placed in solitary confinement.

CoreCivic, the private contractor managing the Otay Mesa Detention Center, took issue with the term solitary confinement and denied that it exists at its detention centers.

Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic, said they use “restrictive housing units” for “various reasons” and noted that some people request to be in restrictive housing. He denied that CoreCivic uses it for disciplinary action for ICE detainees and said people placed in restrictive housing units have access to “courts, visitation, mail, showers, meals, all medical facilities and recreation.”

Gustin also said the ICE data is “not reflective on how long detainees may have remained in segregation” and referred inewsource to ICE.

Spokespeople for ICE did not answer questions from inewsource except to send a link to their segregation policy from 2013.

That policy says placing someone in segregation is a “serious step” that should involve considering other options and should only happen when “necessary.” Segregation for administrative purposes should be “for the briefest term and under the least restrictive conditions practicable” and for vulnerable immigrants should only happen “as a last resort,” according to the policy.

In December, ICE released an updated policy further outlining health evaluations and guidelines for who could be put in segregation and for what reasons.

Under previous administrations, reports from government watchdogs and independent researchers have found issues with ICE’s use of isolation cells including poor record-keeping for immigrants with mental health risks and arbitrary placements for minor disciplinary issues and sometimes yearslong confinements.

One person detained at Otay Mesa spent two years in solitary confinement through the end of 2019, according to a report published last year from Physicians for Human Rights.

But the average time in isolation cells varies widely depending on the reason for the placement. For mental health placements, the average time was about 8 days. For disciplinary reasons, that number jumped to more than 30 days. For those deemed a “security threat” or placed in protective custody, which could include victims of violence, LGBTQ+ immigrants, or medically vulnerable, the averages were about 56 and 68 days, respectively.

Inside Otay Mesa, reports of overcrowding have plagued the facility for months.

“Basically everybody’s saying that it’s overcrowded. There’s people sleeping on the floor,” said Valerie Sigamani, an immigration attorney in San Diego, about her clients inside Otay Mesa.

Crystal Felix, a local immigration attorney, said recent changes to immigration bonds have meant far fewer people are eligible to be released while they pursue their cases and that detainees are “languishing” inside as a result.

Several San Diego immigration attorneys who talked to inewsource said they haven’t had any clients held in solitary confinement recently.

In the spring, the California Department of Justice released a report following its state-mandated review of immigration detention centers in the state. The DOJ found that custody staff often did not conduct mental health reviews before putting immigrants in isolation cells.

However at Otay Mesa, the state DOJ found that staff in multiple cases “approved restrictive housing placements for detainees experiencing significant mental health concerns.” That included one person who “had engaged in self-harm and been placed on suicide watch” during a nine-month stay in isolation.

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, solitary confinement increases the risk of suicide, making existing mental health issues worse and bringing on new symptoms completely, with effects that can last past the dentention period.

The DOJ found that immigrant detainees across the six detention centers they inspected had “high rates of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, increased likelihood of self-harm behavior, and negative changes in self-perception.”

The 2024 report from Physicians for Human Rights, Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic and Peeler Immigration Lab found that solitary confinement disproportionately impacted transgender people and people affected by mental illness and sometimes meant substandard medical care leading to “life-threatening conditions.”

The report also found that staff placed immigrants in solitary arbitrarily for minor infractions, such as using profanity or a “consensual kiss,” or in other cases due to overcrowding.

The Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in 2023 investigated ICE’s use of isolation cells for immigrants with mental health issues. The office said they opened more than 60 such complaints in the previous four years.

The Trump administration attempted to shutter that office as well as the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, two of the main oversight bodies for conditions inside immigration detention centers, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office. A legal battle to restore the offices is ongoing.

The letter, sent to the military services and provided to The Associated Press, comes two weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges. It is part of the steps the Trump administration has taken to use the military in broader ways than previously seen, particularly in its immigration crackdown, including sending the National Guard into American cities and deploying active duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.

“These military officers would serve under the command and control of the Attorney General and would execute administrative determinations at the direction of the Attorney General,” according to the letter signed by 12 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It added that “these actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces.”

“We remain extremely disturbed about the impacts on readiness of using military personnel to perform what are traditionally Department of Justice functions,” the letter says.

The nation’s immigration courts — with a backlog of about 3.5 million cases — have become a key focus of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration enforcement efforts. Since Trump returned to office, dozens of immigration judges have been fired, while others have resigned or taken early retirement.

The senators’ letter, sent to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services on Monday, is asking the Pentagon to say where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and for insight into what legal analysis the military has conducted into whether the move would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. That law prevents the military from conducting law enforcement outside of extreme emergencies.

A Pentagon memo that described the plan said the lawyers should not be detailed for longer than half a year. The memo also showed that Pentagon officials were cognizant of the possibility for conflict with that law and said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring that the military lawyers do not violate it.

The Democratic senators said they were “deeply concerned” that pulling those lawyers away would have an impact on service members who are going through the military’s judicial system.

“These reassignments come at a time only shortly after Congress completely overhauled how the military investigates and prosecutes serious ‘covered’ criminal offenses … by establishing the Offices of Special Trial Counsel (OSTCs) in each of the Services,” the letter read.

Those offices were set up by Congress in 2022 as part of an effort to reform the military justice system by moving decisions on the prosecution of serious military crimes, including sexual assault, to independent military attorneys, taking that power away from victims’ commanders.

The offices began taking cases at the end of last year.

The letter asks the Pentagon what it will do to “preserve the OSTC’s progress in building specialized trial capacity” and what the services will do to “ensure that diversion of OSTCs, trial counsels, and defense counsels does not create delays or diminish quality in court-martials.” The senators say that the plan is a demonstration of how “the Trump administration views skilled personnel as pawns to be traded between agencies, rather than as professionals essential to their core missions, in order to advance misguided immigration policies.”

Background:

In February 2025, Congresswoman Ramirez joined Rep Garcia in reintroducing the bipartisan American Dream and Promise Act of 2025 (H.R. 1589). The legislation would:

Protect and grant eligible Dreamers conditional permanent residence for ten years and cancel removal proceedings

Provide a pathway to citizenship for eligible Dreamers by granting full Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status

Provide individuals with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) with LPR status

Protect Dreamers and individuals with TPS or DED during their application for relief under the American Dream and Promise Act

Provide eligible Dreamers with access to federal financial aid

Allow eligible Dreamers located abroad to apply for relief

Prevent penalizing states that grant in-state tuition to undocumented students based on residency

A new law gives federal agencies $170,000,000,000 ($170 billion) for anti-immigrant enforcement, detention, and deportation. The law is called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” or OBBBA, for short. This money makes the U.S. immigration enforcement agencies richer than many nations’ entire military force. It allows the federal government to step up attacks on the rights of immigrants, especially children and families.

Where does the $170 billion go?

This money goes to federal agencies, with the largest amounts to Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), including:

$30 billion to detain and deport more immigrants, more quickly

$45 billion to build new immigrant detention facilities

$47 billion to build more border walls and other barriers

$16 billion for increased border security, including surveillance and technology

$14 billion for state and local agencies that participate in immigration enforcement

$12 billion for more Border Patrol checkpoints, vehicles, and agents

An additional $11 billion goes to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and the Bureau of Prisons for uses including immigration enforcement and detention.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement gets $330 million for extreme vetting of unaccompanied children and their sponsors.

How will the agencies use this money?

Agencies can mostly choose how and where to spend this money, but the law gives some instructions for how money should be used, including:

Fingerprinting and DNA analysis of families arriving at the border

Additional screening for people coming to the U.S.

Remain in Mexico, a policy that forces migrants to wait for their U.S. court cases in Mexico, a human rights catastrophe

Sending unaccompanied children back to their country without seeing a judge

Allowing state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws (287(g) program), and paying them for participating in immigration enforcement

Allowing more deportations without seeing a judge and using secret evidence in some cases

Physical exams of children who arrive at the U.S. border without a parent or guardian

Detaining children with their parents while the parent is prosecuted for illegal entry

Creating the “Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office,” a political tool to scare immigrants

The Department of Justice (DOJ) can use money for:

Investigating immigration-related offenses, such as unauthorized entry, failure to register, and voting by non-citizens

Crime prevention programs, including programs for immigration enforcement and deportation

Pay states and cities that put certain immigrants in jail

How does the bill expand immigrant detention?

The law provides funding for federal, state, and local authorities to detain adults and children, including new forms of family detention. The bill provides $45 billion for immigrant detention for single adults and families. It also creates a new form of family detention, where parents can be detained with their children while they are prosecuted for unauthorized entry. The funds provided to the Department of Defense and states and localities also may be used for detention-related activities.

How are immigrant children and families treated?

This law causes suffering and life-long trauma to children and families as:

Entire families (including children and babies) can be placed and kept in detention for however long their immigration cases take.

Border patrol agents can physically examine children as young as 12 (and children of any age may be examined if they are in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody). The government says they are checking for tattoos and gang-related markings.

How do state and local authorities get money to detain immigrants?

The bill gives $14 billion for state and local governments to do border and immigration enforcement, including:

Funds to DHS and to ICE for 287(g) agreements, and to pay states and local agencies for:

immigration enforcement,

criminal and gang investigations, and

jailing non-citizens convicted of certain crimes

$13.5 billion for grants to state and local governments for immigration enforcement, building border walls and barriers, detaining immigrants, and potentially for building state-run immigration jails

$450 million for Operation Stonegarden to pay state and local governments that cooperate with border enforcement

Rep. Crockett recently conducted an oversight visit to the facility as part of her ongoing efforts to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in immigration detention and to hold U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) accountable to its legal obligations.

“People detained at this facility—including immigrants—have a constitutional right to due process and the right to counsel in immigration court.

However, her office has since received reports from nonprofit and pro bono legal providers contradicting those claims. These conflicting accounts raise serious concerns about transparency, accountability, and whether ICE is meeting its legal and constitutional obligations.

In her letter, Rep. Crockett called on DHS to:

Clarify ICE’s policies regarding attorney access to clients at Camp East Montana;

Clarify ICE’s policies related to access to legal libraries and resources; and

Guarantee that individuals in ICE custody are being afforded their constitutional right to counsel and due process.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. – In another effort to expand his power and stoke fear, President Trump issued a memorandum yesterday establishing a regressive policing task force made up of various federal departments and agencies — including the FBI, ICE, and DEA — to go into Memphis. The memo also orders the Secretary of Defense to request state National Guard troops from the Tennessee governor. And it authorizes the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with additional governors to “augment” this federal task force with their own troops. This latest step makes clear that the Trump administration is claiming a sweeping mandate to patrol, arrest and detain people in Memphis, and will bring back the same failed policing tactics that caused widespread constitutional violations for decades.

“When military troops police civilians, we have an intolerable threat to individual liberty and the foundational values of this country,” said Hina Shamsi, director of American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “President Trump may want to normalize armed forces in our cities, but no matter what uniform they wear, federal agents and military troops are bound by the Constitution and have to respect our rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of speech, and due process. State and local leaders must stay strong and take all lawful measures to protect residents against this cruel intimidation tactic.”

Trump’s latest escalation comes at a time when the administration has cut millions in grants for proven strategies to reduce crime and improve safety. It escalates tensions in the community, undermines the reform efforts that Memphians are leading with local law enforcement, and encourages police practices already found to be unconstitutional.

In May, the Trump administration retracted findings from a Department of Justice report that revealed deeply disturbing patterns of local police misconduct and brutality, including police unleashing K9 units on people who were sleeping or otherwise complying with officers, training directives that instruct officers to “hurt them first and hurt them bad,” and routine use of pepper spray until people could barely breathe. Trump’s latest memorandum undermines the police and safety reform efforts that Memphians are leading.

Trump’s memo also directs federal law enforcement to work with state and local law enforcement agencies to “enforce Federal immigration law.” When combined with over-policing, this mandate is likely to escalate immigration arrests and deportations of people from traffic stops and other routine interactions with police, heightening a climate of fear for thousands of residents.

“While we all want to see a safer Memphis, flooding the city we love with hundreds of federal, state, and local agents, and threatening to send the military into our communities, is dangerous and counterproductive,” said Memphis resident Claire Gardner, community engagement director for the ACLU of Tennessee. “President Trump is only going to make things worse. He is prioritizing abusive policing tactics that will further break trust between law enforcement and the community they are meant to serve, endanger lives, and lead to violations of our civil rights and liberties. True safety comes from empowering the community, not using state power to go after our immigrant neighbors, people of color, and those who dissent against the government’s brutal policies.”

The agency ignored more than a dozen inquiries from Block Club reporters in addition to questions from other news organizations.
On May 1, Block Club sued ICE and its parent department, Homeland Security, for violating the federal FOIA.
See the data Block Club got from ICE here:","CHICAGO — Even as federal immigration officials round up more people in Chicago, they still won’t say exactly who they arrested eight months ago in the first sweeps of President Donald Trump’s second term.

As a result, what exactly happened to hundreds of people detained in January remains a secret.

Federal agents have rounded up scores of others since then, including some in the ongoing Operation Midway Blitz ordered by Trump. With a few exceptions, immigration officials won’t disclose details about who they arrested this time either.

Here’s what officials have revealed:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested nearly 400 people in Chicago and neighboring states during the 10 days after Trump’s inauguration, according to records released to Block Club Chicago — after we sued to get them.

At least 122 of those 393 arrests occurred in Illinois, including at least 53 in Chicago, the records show.

Combined with data acquired by other groups, the records show that 32 of the people apprehended in Chicago faced charges for criminal offenses, while 21 were picked up for alleged immigration violations.

Authorities arrested people all over the city during those 10 days — including at their homes, at their workplaces and at public facilities, such as Cook County jail and the federal building at 101 W. Ida B. Wells Drive, which houses an ICE field office.

The data shows that 219 of the 393 people arrested in the broader Chicago region had a “departed date” and “departure country” listed, indicating they’ve since been deported. The leading destination country was Mexico, for 119 people, followed by Guatemala (24) and Honduras (22). People were also deported to 15 other countries, from Poland to Micronesia.

But the records released to Block Club are missing other crucial information. They don’t include the names or birth dates of the people arrested, making it difficult if not impossible to determine what their backgrounds were, why they were targeted and where they are now. The records also leave out the city and state for 44 arrests and the street addresses for 155.

Lawyers for ICE cited provisions in the federal Freedom of Information Act that allow them to redact personal information out of privacy concerns.

Yet ICE regularly issues press releases revealing the names and alleged criminal histories of detainees it labels “the worst of the worst.”

Attorneys for the agency have continued to maintain they have the right to redact names and other arrest details from records released to the public. Block Club’s lawyers, from the Chicago-based firm Loevy + Loevy, have argued that some of that information should be disclosed to ensure accountability. Discussions continue, as does our fight for transparency.

ICE Regularly Ignores FOIA Requests

As Trump sends more immigration agents to Chicago, the records released by ICE offer a glimpse of the scale of its operations — and a reminder of how difficult it is for the public to track what’s going on.

In the days after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, ICE and other federal agencies launched visible — and sometimes televised — “enhanced targeted operations” in Chicago.

But ICE officials refused to provide any specifics about their raids, including basic information such as how many people were arrested, what they were charged with and where they were taken afterward. The agency ignored more than a dozen inquiries from Block Club reporters in addition to questions from other news organizations.

“Thank you for your email,” said one typical response from ICE’s media contact. “I am out of the office.”

At the end of January, I submitted a FOIA request for records showing ICE arrests and detentions in Chicago or the Chicago area from Jan. 21 through Jan. 30.

By law, federal agencies have a month to respond to FOIA requests. But in another automated email, ICE told me officials would need more time.

Over the next two and a half months, I sent the agency 10 emails asking for an update. I didn’t get any responses.

On May 1, Block Club sued ICE and its parent department, Homeland Security, for violating the federal FOIA. Block Club is represented by the FOIA team led by attorney Matt Topic at Loevy + Loevy. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.

“Plaintiff Block Club Chicago brings this suit to force Defendants … to conduct a reasonable search, issue a determination, and produce records regarding arrests and detentions in the Chicago region from a ten-day time frame” in January, Block Club’s complaint states.

It took almost two months before ICE agreed to release the arrest data from January — and even then, the agency wouldn’t provide everything we asked for, including the names of the people agents picked up.

As Block Club’s experience illustrated, ICE rarely provides specific information to the public except when the agency is sued over records requests, according to immigration experts and attorneys.

“There is no other way to get them to respond to FOIA requests, and the backlog is getting worse,” said Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance. The nonprofit represents a range of individuals and organizations seeking government transparency and safeguarding immigrants’ rights.

While the Trump administration is pouring more resources into immigration enforcement agencies, “they’re not putting it toward complying with the law, and FOIA is the law,” Realmuto said.

After receiving 59,300 FOIA requests in the 2024 fiscal year, ICE still had 22,246 pending when the year ended Sept. 30, according to an annual report from the Department of Homeland Security.

Altogether, Homeland Security agencies had 220,112 requests pending in September 2024, including 134,406 for Customs and Border Protection.

Block Club is hardly alone in seeking immigration enforcement records. Through a series of FOIA requests and lawsuits, a group of attorneys and professors put together the Deportation Data Project, which includes a library of datasets they’ve shared with the public.

Federal officials did not disclose names and other personal identifiers in that data, but it includes other details of immigration arrests and detentions across the country from September 2023 through this July. The records include the state where each arrest occurred, the individual’s country of citizenship and birth year and the status of the case.

Over the past few months, researchers, advocates and journalists have used these datasets to offer snapshots of who’s been apprehended and deported, including recent stories in the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times/WBEZ.

To update the data, the Deportation Data Project has to make new FOIA requests every month. And each time, “we have to threaten litigation again,” said David Hausman, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and one of the project’s co-directors.

Hausman said they’re working to get a court to order the regular release of data so they don’t have to go through the FOIA process each time.

“You just really can’t get any information from ICE without litigation,” Hausman said.

Earlier today, the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory said in a 72-page report that Israel’s government is responsible for four of the five acts prohibited under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The report holds three Israeli leaders responsible: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and President Isaac Herzog. Navi Pillay, who heads the commission, drew parallels between Israel’s assault on Gaza and the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

Navi Pillay: “Genocide is occurring in Gaza. … In the Rwandan genocide, the group were the Tutsis, and here the group are the Palestinians.”

The findings could be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court or the U.N.’s International Court of Justice.

Israel’s military says it has launched a major ground offensive to seize Gaza City and displace its 1 million residents. Israel’s defense minister says quote, “Gaza is burning.” Gaza health officials report at least 68 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since dawn, most of them in Gaza City. This is Fatima, an elderly resident of a tent camp close to the Al-Ghefari building in western Gaza City, which Israel bombed into rubble on Monday.

Fatima: “I cannot stand on my legs out of fear. Enough hunger, thirst and fear. When they did this, I collapsed completely. I cannot walk.”

The Palestinian Civil Defense reports Israel has blown up over 50 Gaza high-rises in recent weeks.

In Geneva, Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, said Monday Israel’s military is destroying entire neighborhoods and the remnants of buildings where people were seeking shelter.

Francesca Albanese: “It’s trying to forcibly evacuate the 800,000 Palestinians who were seeking refuge there. But the question is 'why?' Why? Because this is the last piece of Gaza that needs to be rendered unlivable before advancing the ethnic cleansing of that piece of land, and then probably they will move to the West Bank.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Doha today for talks with Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in the wake of Israel’s deadly strike last week targeting Hamas leaders in Doha. Rubio’s trip comes after leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council said Monday they had agreed to activate a mutual defense pact in response to Israeli aggression. Meanwhile, Axios reports Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed President Trump last Tuesday morning that Israel planned to attack Hamas leaders in Qatar nearly an hour before the strike took place. That report contradicts White House claims that Trump was notified only after missiles were in the air, giving him no opportunity to oppose the strike.

President Trump said Monday the U.S. had carried out a strike against a second boat he alleged was carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing at least three people on board. Trump made the announcement on social media and posted a video of an apparent airstrike, showing a speedboat erupting in flames. This follows a strike earlier this month on another boat also allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, which reportedly killed 11 people. Speaking to The New York Times, Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter, a retired top judge advocate, said, “Trump is normalizing what I consider to be an unlawful strike.” Here’s Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro speaking shortly before the second strike.

President Nicolás Maduro: “This is not tension; it is outright aggression — judicial aggression, when they criminalize us; political aggression, with their daily threatening statements; diplomatic aggression; and possible military aggression. Venezuela is empowered by international law to comprehensively confront this aggression. It is not tension; it is aggression.”

FBI Director Kash Patel says investigators have found DNA evidence linking 22-year-old suspect Tyler Robinson to the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk in Utah last week. Utah County prosecutors will formally arraign Robinson today; they’re planning to seek the death penalty.

On Monday, Vice President JD Vance vowed to dismantle institutions on the political left that he claimed were promoting violence and terrorism. Vance made the remarks while hosting Kirk’s podcast “The Charlie Kirk Show.”

Vice President JD Vance: “Of course, we have to make sure that the killer is brought to justice. And importantly, we have to talk about this incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism that has grown up over the last few years and, I believe, is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin’s bullet. We’re going to talk about how to dismantle that.”

Joining Vance’s call for retribution were White House adviser Stephen Miller, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt and Health Secretary RFK Jr. Since Kirk’s killing, scores of politicians, public figures and private-sector workers have faced firings, suspensions or investigations over their comments about the assassination — among them, The Washington Post’s last remaining full-time African American opinion columnist, Karen Attiah. In a post on Substack Monday, Attiah wrote, “Last week, the Washington Post fired me. The reason? Speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America’s apathy toward guns.”

President Trump signed an order Monday authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of a new federal task force to combat violent crime in the city. Trump’s order came just days after the Memphis Police Department reported crime is at a 25-year low, with robbery, larceny and burglary all at record lows over the past eight months. Tennessee Democrats gathered in Memphis Monday to condemn Trump’s crackdown. This is state Representative Justin J. Pearson, who represents Memphis.

Rep. Justin Pearson: “Today, it is a conversation about crime. In 14 months, it will be a conversation about protecting the vote at the vote — at the voting booth. In three-and-a-half years, it’s going to be about a presidential election and the need to protect it. And what happens when we go to the polls, and the National Guard is there, and all they’re doing is asking you, 'Are you sure you want to vote?' This isn’t just a slippery slope; this is a dangerous impediment on our democracy.”

President Trump said Monday that New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s endorsement of Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election was “a very bad one for New York City.” Trump suggested that he would consider holding back federal funds from the city if Mamdani is elected.

After headlines, we’ll look at Trump’s escalating immigration crackdown on Chicago with Congressmember Delia Ramirez. Trump has also threatened deploying U.S. troops to Chicago.

A New York Times report has revealed how a member of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates invested $2 billion in the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company just days before the UAE received access to rare artificial intelligence chips. Back in May, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan invested $2 billion into World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency startup run by the Trump and Witkoff families — Steve Witkoff is President Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East. Two weeks later, the Trump administration approved the sale of hundreds of thousands of AI chips to the Emiratis, despite concerns that the chips could be shared with China.

The Times report did not directly link the two deals, but cast suspicion on the timing. Ryan Cummings, chief of staff at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy, said, “If this is true, this is the largest public corruption scandal in the history of the United States and it’s not even close.”

The Trump administration said Monday it has reached a deal with China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, after Trump threatened to shut down the popular social media platform, saying it poses a national security concern. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says Trump will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday to finalize the deal. It’s not clear who the U.S. buyer will be, but it’s widely expected to be led by Oracle co-founder and chair Larry Ellison, who last week briefly surpassed Elon Musk as the world’s richest person.

Larry Ellison has a decades-long history with the Republican Party and has frequented Trump’s Mar-a-Lago for dinners and has met Trump in the Oval Office. He’s also an ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, donating money to Israel’s military through the nonprofit Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.

This comes just months after the Trump administration cleared the way for an $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance, which is run by David Ellison, son of Larry Ellison. According to The Wall Street Journal, Paramount Skydance is exploring a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, which would put two of Hollywood’s most powerful legacy studios under the same owner.

Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance is reportedly in talks to hire Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief or co-president of CBS News. Weiss has opposed diversity and inclusion programs and is an ardent supporter of Israel’s war on Gaza; her publication The Free Press has called widespread reporting on famine conditions there “a myth.”

Senate Republicans have confirmed one of President Trump’s top economic advisers, Stephen Miran, to the Federal Reserve Board. In an unusual arrangement, Miran will only take a leave of absence from his role as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, instead of resigning from his post. Miran says he intends to return to the White House after his term ends. The move allows Miran to attend the Fed’s two-day meeting to set interest rates, which starts today.

Meanwhile, a U.S. appeals court blocked Trump’s attempt to fire Federal Reserve

Governor Lisa Cook before today’s interest rate meeting. In an opinion, Appellate Judge Bradley Garcia wrote, “Before this court, the government does not dispute that it provided Cook no meaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations against her.” President Trump has repeatedly demanded that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates fast, and has threatened to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",https://assets.democracynow.org/assets/default_content_image-354f4555cc64afadc730d64243c658dd0af1f330152adcda6c4900cb4a26f082.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 13:57:14.668883

Federal law enforcement agencies and National Guard units from D.C. and eight states are continuing operations in the city.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to once again federalize Washington, D.C.’s police force, in what he suggested could come in response to the city’s mayor’s stated refusal to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Trump’s emergency order, which took over the local police force, expired last week. Hours before it elapsed, Mayor Muriel Bowser said that the city would not cooperate with Immigration, Customs and Enforcement in their continued operations in the nation’s capital. Earlier, she had said the city would work with other federal agencies even after the emergency order expired. In an early-morning social media post on Monday, Trump said his intervention into the D.C.’s law enforcement had improved crime in the city, a claim Bowser has backed up, though, data shows crime was already falling in Washington before the law enforcement surge began. Trump said crime could increase if cooperation on immigration enforcement ceases, in which case he would “call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!” The mayor’s office declined to comment. The White House did not say if Trump would follow through on his threat. It also did not say whether the president had considered trying to extend his previous order that placed the city’s police force under federal control. The order was not renewed by Congress and lapsed September 11. Later Monday, speaking in the Oval Office where he signed an order sending the National Guard into Memphis, Trump said they would federalize the police in Washington if they had to, “but we don’t have to anymore, because it’s in such great shape.” Bowser issued an order September 2, setting up how the local police will continue working with the federal law enforcement agencies that continue working in the city. The order listed a number of federal agencies she anticipated working cooperatively with the MPD, the local police, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Secret Service, among other agencies. Absent was ICE. Speaking September 10 at a ribbon cutting ceremony, the mayor said “immigration enforcement is not what MPD does,” referring to the local police department. She added that when the emergency order ends, “it won’t be what MPD does in the future.” Data analyzed by the Associated Press during the emergency period showed that more than 40% of arrests were immigration related, highlighting that the Trump administration continued to advance its hardline immigration policies as it sought to fight crime in the nation’s capital. Federal law enforcement agencies and National Guard units from D.C. and eight states are continuing operations in the city. The district’s attorney general filed a lawsuit opposing the use of the military in the city. On Monday, a group of former civilian leaders and retired four-star level officers weighed in on the case, highlighting what they said were the dangers of presidents deploying the National Guard for law enforcement, which they said could pose “safety concerns for servicemembers and the public alike.” Among the officers, who served during both Republican and Democratic administrations, was former National Security Agency director Michael Hayden. Trump’s threat comes the same day that the House Committee on Rules is taking up several D.C.-related bills, including a proposal to lower the age at which juveniles can be tried to 14 from 16 for certain serious crimes, as well as restricting the district’s authority over its sentencing laws and its role in selecting judges. The bills passed out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last week on a party-line vote. The district is granted autonomy through a limited home rule agreement passed in 1973, but federal political leaders retain significant control over local affairs, including the approval of the budget and laws passed by the D.C council.

“What President Trump is doing is unprecedented, unnecessary, and an affront to our city’s ability to govern itself.” – Rep. Steve Cohen

President Donald Trump has intensified his immigration crackdown, deploying National Guard troops to Memphis, threatening to federalize the District of Columbia’s police department, and ramping up deportation operations in cities like Chicago.

The moves mark the latest escalation in the administration’s nationwide enforcement campaign, drawing both support and outrage across the country as immigrant communities brace for what they describe as a new era of fear and intimidation.

In Memphis, Trump ordered the deployment of 500 National Guard troops after what he described as a surge in violent crime. His decision followed an Oval Office address in which he vowed to use federal power to restore law and order, saying he would not hesitate to intervene when local governments failed to keep residents safe.

The White House said the Guard would assist local police with patrols, checkpoints, and “community stabilization efforts.”

Local leaders expressed alarm at the militarized response, with critics warning it could erode trust in already vulnerable communities and escalate tensions rather than calm them.

The deployment comes at a moment when Trump has openly linked crime and immigration, portraying both as threats that demand extraordinary federal intervention. Supporters of the move argue that Memphis, a city with one of the highest homicide rates in the country, needs urgent help.

Critics say the deployment risks setting a precedent in which federal troops are used in domestic law enforcement far beyond their intended role, raising constitutional questions and fueling concerns about civil liberties.

Democratic leaders sharply criticized the move.

“This is not about public safety — it is about politics,” said Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat who represents Memphis. “What President Trump is doing is unprecedented, unnecessary, and an affront to our city’s ability to govern itself.”

Cohen added that the decision “ignores local solutions and community trust in favor of heavy-handed federal control.”

Trump has also threatened to take control of Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department, citing its refusal to fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. “If they don’t want to work with us, we’ll take it over,” Trump told reporters at the White House.

The threat underscored the administration’s willingness to assert federal authority over local police when immigration enforcement is at stake. The District’s mayor and city council leaders responded by saying such a move would violate the city’s limited home rule and further destabilize community-police relations at a time when trust is already fragile.

At the same time, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has launched what officials are calling Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, focusing on arrests in the heavily Mexican-American neighborhood of Pilsen.

The Department of Homeland Security said the operation has led to arrests of people accused of robbery, assault, and other violent crimes. In one incident in a Chicago suburb, an ICE officer fatally shot a man during a vehicle stop after the man struck and dragged an officer while fleeing, according to the agency.

The shooting inflamed concerns in immigrant neighborhoods, where residents said the raids have upended daily life and silenced the normally vibrant celebrations surrounding Mexican Independence Day.

The streets of Pilsen, ordinarily bustling in September with music, house parties, and food vendors, were subdued this year. Attendance at the annual Mexican Independence Day parade appeared far lower than in previous years. Many residents said they stayed indoors, fearful of raids.

“Something has got to break,” said Carlo Romano, 52, a hair colorist and naturalized citizen from Mexico City. “Democrats throw the ball to Republicans, and Republicans throw the ball to Democrats, and there’s no concrete solution to the problem.”

Other residents voiced frustration at both parties, blaming Trump’s heavy-handed tactics and what they described as Democrats’ decades of failures on immigration reform.

“He let all the immigrants come in from Venezuela, and now all these raids are the cost of that,” said Ventura Alvarez, 56, a Mexican-American born in Chicago. “And the people who are here that came from Mexico? They never got nothing.”

Some residents said the fear extended even to families with legal status, as rumors of raids spread quickly through the community.

Reyna Torres Mendivil, the consul general of Mexico in Chicago, said her office had fielded 6,000 requests in the last eight months from residents seeking dual citizenship for themselves or their children.

“The fear is general — it doesn’t matter what your status is, the whole family feels the uncertainty,” Torres Mendivil said.

In interviews, some said they felt abandoned by both major political parties. Isabel Hernandez, 50, a naturalized citizen from Mexico who grew up in Pilsen, pointed to past administrations.

“Obama deported millions of people — you just didn’t see it on television,” she said. Longtime resident Rafael Vieyra, 85, a permanent legal resident, said he had seen anti-immigrant crackdowns come and go for decades as he moved back and forth between Chicago and his native state of Guanajuato in Mexico.

“I’ve seen it all,” he said. “This is the worst period yet.”

Though many residents stayed indoors, others looked for ways to resist. At the parade earlier this month, Mexican cowboys known as charros passed out “know your rights” flyers.

People wore bright orange whistles around their necks to warn others if ICE raids unfolded. Local businesses reported steep declines in customers, with vendors waiting for crowds that never came. Some families described canceling quinceañeras or birthday parties for fear of drawing attention.

Nationwide, the Trump administration has accelerated partnerships between local police and federal immigration enforcement under the controversial 287(g) program. In Pennsylvania, the number of local law enforcement agencies signing agreements with ICE surged from 10 to 39 in recent months, including county sheriffs, district attorneys, and constables’ offices.

“The Trump administration is very aggressively seeking to sign more 287(g) agreements,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council. Opponents argue the program erodes trust and exposes local governments to legal and financial risks, while ICE insists it strengthens public safety.

The ACLU has strongly condemned the expansion.

“This is about transforming local police into a deportation force,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “It undermines community safety, it encourages racial profiling, and it strips away the protections that keep immigrant families from living in constant fear.”

The 287(g) agreements authorize local police to perform certain federal immigration functions, such as identifying and detaining people for possible deportation. ICE has promoted the program as a force multiplier, giving the agency more capacity without significantly expanding its workforce.

The Trump administration has tied new funding to the program, offering reimbursements of up to 25 percent of the salary and benefits of trained officers and quarterly performance bonuses for successful enforcement actions.

Critics, however, say the program incentivizes aggressive enforcement while exposing municipalities to lawsuits.

In Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Sheriff Fred Harran’s decision to join ICE sparked public protests and a lawsuit. County commissioners warned that employees who cooperated with ICE could be personally liable, calling the partnership an inappropriate use of taxpayer resources.

Advocacy groups warned that the arrangement would erode trust with immigrant communities and undermine public safety by discouraging victims and witnesses from coming forward.

Despite the backlash, ICE officials say more partnerships are signed every week, and in some states local law now requires them. Texas passed a measure this summer mandating county sheriffs to participate, while Florida approved a similar law in 2022 requiring police agencies that operate detention facilities to sign agreements.

Trump’s actions have sparked protests in cities and towns where residents say the administration’s tactics amount to intimidation. In Chicago, immigrant rights groups set up hotlines to track sightings of ICE vehicles.

In Pennsylvania, the ACLU and other organizations sued local sheriffs who signed agreements, arguing that some agencies lacked legal authority to join the program. Across the country, church leaders and community groups have held know-your-rights workshops and organized networks to provide food and shelter to families disrupted by raids.

Supporters of Trump’s policies insist they are necessary to restore order and protect communities. “This is about illegal immigration,” said George Rabiela, 70, a retired Chicago firefighter and naturalized citizen. “It does hurt me to see that people who have lived here all their life, they’re getting caught in the net, but they are illegal.”

For many, the crackdown has sharpened feelings of disillusionment with the political system itself. Residents in Pilsen described shifting loyalties, with some noting that support for Trump in the neighborhood ticked upward in 2024 compared to prior elections. Others said they had grown weary of Democratic promises of reform that never materialized. A generational divide was also visible, with younger activists pressing for sanctuary protections while some older residents expressed sympathy with Trump’s emphasis on security.

Trump’s actions in Memphis, Washington, Chicago, and beyond underscore a strategy of deploying military force, expanding ICE partnerships, and leveraging federal authority in pursuit of mass deportations.

For immigrant communities, the result has been fear, anger, and deepening distrust in government.

For supporters, the crackdown represents long-overdue enforcement after decades of what they view as failed immigration policies.

As the raids and deployments continue, the clash between these competing visions of law, order, and belonging is shaping the national political landscape in profound and divisive ways.

But instead, he has been at the Muscatine County Jail in ICE detention for nearly three months.","Days after he nearly died when an assailant shot him during a robbery attempt, Felipe de Jesus Hernandez Marcelo went to an Iowa police station hoping to get his belongings back.

The police in Muscatine, Iowa had his car and the cash he was carrying when he was shot and nearly killed on June 21. Hernandez, 28, recalled in court testimony that the department said he couldn’t have those items back. Instead, police arrested him on an old warrant for failing to pay a traffic ticket.

Within hours, Hernandez was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He’s been detained ever since pending removal proceedings, having entered the country illegally from his native Mexico in 2021.

Hernandez is one of a growing number of crime victims and relatives who have been arrested and indefinitely detained during the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

ICE has rescinded a policy that had shielded many victims from detention and removal. The number of people applying for visas that allow some victims and their families to remain in the country appears to have plummeted. Others are being detained as they go through the lengthy application process. Of those detained, many have been declared ineligible for release under another ICE policy change.

Critics say the outcome is not only cruel to victims and their families but is harming public safety by making those who are in the U.S. illegally unlikely to report crimes and cooperate with police.

“This type of thing is now the new normal. This scenario is happening every day in every city,” said Dan Kowalski, a retired attorney and expert on immigration law. “Any contact with any level or kind of state or federal law enforcement, civil or criminal, puts you in danger of detention by ICE.”

ICE removed protections for crime victims in January

In January, ICE rescinded a policy that called on agents to generally avoid detaining and seeking to remove immigrants who have been crime victims. It protected those carrying so-called U and T visas that allow crime and human trafficking victims and their relatives to remain in the country. The protections extended to those who had applied for such visas and were awaiting decisions, which can take years to process.

Hernandez is seeking to apply for a U visa, and would appear to be eligible as the victim of a felony assault and key witness against the two charged in the attack. But the Muscatine County prosecutor Jim Barry has yet to certify his eligibility, according to Hernandez’s attorney. Barry didn’t respond to messages.

The Biden-era policy called on ICE agents to look for signs immigrants had been victimized and to consider that as “a positive discretionary factor” when deciding whether to detain them. The goal was to avoid discouraging immigrant victims from cooperating with police in reporting and solving crimes.

But some conservatives have argued that victimization alone should not entitle immigrants to a benefit.

The new policy allows ICE agents to detain crime victims, including the U and T visa holders, as long as they check with police “to ensure criminal investigative and other enforcement actions will not be compromised.” Agents aren’t required to look for any evidence of victimization.

Applications for visas for crime victims dropped in first months of 2025

The number of applications for U visas dropped by nearly half in the quarter that ended in March, which included the first 2½ months of the new Trump administration, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Some immigration lawyers say the drop reflects concerns that an application by itself will put someone on the government’s radar for potential removal.

Immigration lawyer Bethany Hoffmann said one of her clients, whose wife had been a kidnapping victim, was arrested by ICE when he showed up to an appointment to be fingerprinted as part of the U visa application process.

“I have been practicing for 17 years and I have never seen that before,” she said, adding that the man had no criminal history but was subject to a 10-year-old removal order.

Court documents show other U visa applicants across the country have been taken into custody by ICE, including a woman detained in Maine who had been assaulted and kidnapped in 2021.

ICE is indefinitely detaining many who would have previously been out on bond

Compounding the impact is another new practice in which ICE and immigration judges have required the indefinite detention of anyone who entered the country without permission.

Over the past 30 years, immigration lawyers say many such detainees would have been able to be released pending removal proceedings as long as they were deemed not to be a flight risk or danger to the community. With a steady job, local relatives and a minimal criminal history, Hernandez would have been a candidate for release.

But instead, he has been at the Muscatine County Jail in ICE detention for nearly three months.

Hernandez has been apart from the 9-year-old son he was raising as a single father, unable attend medical appointments critical for recovering from his gunshot wounds, and unable to work the construction job that paid his family’s bills.

He said he was denied medicine for the first five days as he suffered in excruciating pain, he said.

“I was locked in a single cell for several days. It felt like forever,” Hernandez recalled this month in court testimony.

A federal judge ruled on Sept. 10 that ICE’s detention of Hernandez without a bond hearing was illegal, and ordered an immigration court to hold one within seven days. She found that he was suffering “irreparable harm” in the meantime. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",https://molawyersmedia.com/files/2025/09/AP25254551543581.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:57:31.913508

But last month, he found himself on a layover at the airport in Cairo, frantically trying to avoid boarding a flight to Moscow. The United States was deporting him alongside dozens of other Russians after rejecting his pleas.

As the Egyptian authorities boarded the final people onto the deportation flight, Mr. Vovchenko, 26, loitered in the restroom, possibly hoping he could resist, abscond or somehow be forgotten. He had no such luck.

Egyptian guards pulled him out of the bathroom and roughed him up, leaving him with an injury on his forehead. They marched him onto the flight and to the back of the cabin, tying him to a middle seat. The plane soon began gliding toward Moscow. Mr. Vovchenko cried for much of the flight. He knew what would come next.

This episode was recounted by a woman who sat near Mr. Vovchenko on the plane and spoke to The New York Times, as well as by a man on the flight whose account was posted online by a Russian human rights activist.

Mr. Vovchenko’s plight represents a new reality for Russians who are struggling to persuade American judges to allow them to stay in the United States on account of their political or religious views. As President Trump accelerates deportations, some are being sent back to Russia, despite facing imprisonment or worse at home.

“Parents are saying, ‘Well, we're leaving … we don't want to live where there's ICE on the streets, so we're leaving Chelsea,' ” Abeyta said.
Across Chelsea, the ramp-up in ICE arrests has parents on edge, according to Daniel Mojica, who runs Chelsea schools’ Parent Information Center.
The biggest portion — about half the students leaving Chelsea — are bound for other U.S. states.
That could result in a $5.7 million shortfall for Chelsea schools; the state sends the district about $19,000 per pupil.","Hundreds of students have left Chelsea public schools this year, as families exit a community — and a state — that’s become a prime target for immigration enforcement.

Chelsea superintendent Almi Abeyta said school staff tell her some parents are moving to places where there's less heat on immigrants.

“Parents are saying, ‘Well, we're leaving … we don't want to live where there's ICE on the streets, so we're leaving Chelsea,' ” Abeyta said.

Chelsea has long been a community of immigrants, some of whom have been in this country for decades. The city has among the highest concentrations of immigrants in Massachusetts, with 45% of residents born abroad. School administrators said 85% of students live in a home where English is not the primary language.

Across Chelsea, the ramp-up in ICE arrests has parents on edge, according to Daniel Mojica, who runs Chelsea schools’ Parent Information Center.

“It's got a different feeling in the air,” Mojica said. “The school year's going to be different, and I think it's going to continue on like this for the next three years.”

Chelsea doesn’t ask for students’ immigration status, but Mojica said parents worry about whether ICE can enter the schools. He tells them what he knows: Agents can't go in without a warrant signed by a judge, but he can’t control what happens outside the school doors.

Mojica oversees transfers in and out of the district. He said roughly 990 students have transferred out of the district since last October. Based on those who have submitted transfer forms that indicate where they're going, Mojica estimates a quarter are enrolling in other districts in Massachusetts. Another quarter are leaving the country for places like Honduras, Guatemala and Colombia. The biggest portion — about half the students leaving Chelsea — are bound for other U.S. states.

Mojica said one striking trend is that most of the families are moving to Republican-leaning states, including Florida, Arkansas, Alabama, Ohio and South Carolina. One day in early September, an elementary school reported four student transfers: two said they were headed for Texas and two planned to leave the country.

The district expects to lose a net 300 students from last year's 6,100 enrollees, about a 5% decline. That could result in a $5.7 million shortfall for Chelsea schools; the state sends the district about $19,000 per pupil.

The student departures won’t affect funding for the current school year, Abeyta said, but officials will likely have to start planning cuts to next year’s budget.

“We staff according to numbers, and so when we're looking at numbers, we will have too many staff” for the lower student headcount, she said.

“It's never a fun conversation when you're talking about cutting positions.”

Chelsea isn't the only district that will face hard decisions in the months ahead, said Mary Bourque, a former Chelsea superintendent who now heads the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents. Based on a meeting she had Friday with officials from urban districts across the state, Bourque said Chelsea is one of several school systems losing students from immigrant families.

“What we're seeing is certainly an exodus from our districts,” Bourque said.

Chelsea has six months to finalize next year’s school budget. Abeyta said the city could increase funding for the schools, while Chelsea School Committee member Sarah Neville said she hopes the state will help soften the blow — for example, by tapping into funds raised under the so-called ""millionaire's tax"" for investments in transportation and education.

“We might have fewer students, but we still have the same amount of school buildings and we still have the same electrical bills — all that overhead stays the same,” Neville said.",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0426_chelsea-04-1000x607.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:57:13.094759

“Anyone – regardless of immigration status – who assaults an ICE officer WILL face federal felony assault charges and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law,” the agency posted on X. Embedded in the post was an image that read “think before you resist” with a clenched fist.

The post represents a direct public threat of prosecution, and the broad language could allow prosecutors to pursue federal assault charges for actions that would traditionally be classified as resisting arrest or even protest activities.

But the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has expanded its definition of threats to include filming Ice operations. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, defined “violence” in July as “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at.”

One example of that has been the case of Spanish-language, Georgia-based journalist Mario Guevara, who was detained for more than two months after he filmed enforcement operations, despite his attorneys saying he had legal work authorization.

The message also follows the DHS’s claims in August that attacks on Ice officers have increased by 1,000%, though when pressed for examples, officials told the Prospect that incidents included trash dumped on an agent’s lawn and a profanity-laden sign targeting an agent by name. In one notable case, the FBI put out a $50,000 reward for someone who “appears to fire a pistol” at Ice during a raid on a farm in California.

Federal prosecutors have also filed assault charges against multiple protesters this year, with some cases involving actions that would traditionally fall under resisting arrest. In the suburbs of Chicago last week, an Ice officer fatally shot an individual during a traffic stop after the person allegedly dragged the officer.

Yet Ice operations appear to only be intensifying, as a supreme court ruling last week removed legal barriers that had limited agent authority in California, prompting DHS to vow it would “flood the zone in Los Angeles”.

The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31e84ac00879bff2838d6676a0836bf0b6077d1b/474_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78b80ee3225ee725bb90bf1ae1fde243",N,,2025-09-16 12:57:16.821767

It’s like a horror movie.’”

Officers at the facility, the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, La., soon placed Mr. Cortes De La Valle on suicide watch. This meant solitary confinement, where he fought off biting ants and endured black mold on the wall and feces in his cell, according to a complaint he later filed against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the staff at the detention center. The lights, kept on 24 hours a day, aggravated his seizure condition.

In November 2023 he voluntarily accepted deportation to Colombia. In his complaint against ICE officials, he said that he attempted suicide four times during his year at the Jena facility, including twice that July. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security found that ICE and its contractor had discriminated against him.

Since January, the Trump administration has been pursuing its promised campaign to deport tens of thousands of immigrants. More than 60,000 people were in detention as of August, many of them in overcrowded facilities where some detainees sleep on bare floors, eat rotten food and often cannot access the medicines they need, according to immigration lawyers. Watching from Colombia, where he now lives, Mr. Cortes De La Valle reflects on what he would tell detainees: “Don’t give in to the dark place.”

But many have thoughts of suicide, and some have taken their own lives. At least 12 immigrants are known to have died in ICE custody since Jan. 1. They include at least two people by suicide: Jesus Molina-Veya, in June at the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, and Chaofeng Ge, last month at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania.

The problem is not new. Under the Biden administration, 26 detainees died in ICE custody, of which at least four were either publicly reported as or suspected to be suicides.

Family members said that Oliveira was leaving a bakery in downtown Milford when agents approached — he attempted to get away but was caught. His father said that he was pinned to the ground and taken away in a dark SUV.

“I hope no other family and no other parents have to go through this situation,"" Itamer De Oliveira said in Portuguese. ""I want you to thank you for the support and your prayers.”

According to DHS, this was a routine operation to determine his identity and if he was a potential safety threat. They said the agents had no idea he was a minor. Once they learned that, they called his parents to come pick him up. Officials said his parents refused, so ICE drove him home.

The family's attorney said they have a pending asylum case and that the parents have no criminal history. Itamer said that he's had a work permit for more than five years.

""They're treating us like animals,"" he said. ""We're not criminals. We work, pay taxes, play nice with society — there's no problem.""

As families hole up in homes — afraid to leave and risk detainment — advocates are reporting an increased presence of unmarked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles sitting in parking lots and other public areas throughout immigrant communities, where agents appeared to target work vans. One man captured a video of three landscapers who were working on the Saugus Town Hall property being arrested after agents smashed their truck window.

Just north of Boston, the city of Everett canceled its annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival after its mayor said it wouldn’t be right to “hold a celebration at a time when community members may not feel safe attending.”

The actions have been praised by public officials like New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who signed legislation this year banning sanctuary city policies in her state, vowing not to let New Hampshire “go the way of Massachusetts.” ICE this summer began utilizing a New Hampshire airport about an hour from Boston to transport New England detainees.

However, others argue that ICE’s presence in Massachusetts is doing more harm than good.

“This is really increasing the fear in communities, which is already incredibly high,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.

Trump aims at so-called ‘sanctuaries’

Cities like Boston and Chicago — where Mayor Brandon Johnson has also condemned the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown, calling it an example of “tyranny” — have become targets for enforcement in recent days. Trump also threatened to potentially deploy the National Guard to Chicago, though he had wavered on a military deployment last week.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Sept. 4 filed a lawsuit against Mayor Michelle Wu, the city of Boston and its police department over its sanctuary city policies, claiming they’re interfering with immigration enforcement. In response, Wu accused Trump of “attacking cities to hide his administration’s failures.”

Now, ICE has launched an operation it called “Patriot 2.0"" on the heels of a May crackdown where nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in Massachusetts. Its latest operation came days before a preliminary mayoral election, where incumbent Wu won easily. The mayor has become a frequent target over her defense of the city and its so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Boston surge would focus on “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” living in Massachusetts.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but protect them at the peril of law-abiding American citizens,” she said in a press release early last week, which detailed the arrest of seven individuals by ICE, including a 38-year-old man from Guatemala who had previously been arrested on assault-related charges.

The agency did not respond to requests from The Associated Press about the number of immigrants detained since “Patriot 2.0” began.

Detainees housed in facilities across New England

ICE has contracts to detain people at multiple correctional facilities across New England, including county jails as well as the federal prison in Berlin, New Hampshire, and a publicly-owned, privately operated prison in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

Volunteers monitoring flights carrying detainees from New Hampshire’s Portsmouth International Airport at Pease have documented the transfer of more than 300 individuals since early August, with at least five flights per week transferring people from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts. All of the detainees have been in shackles, said David Holt, who has been organizing regular protests at Pease.

Protesters gathered at venues like the ICE office in Burlington, where three participants were arrested on trespassing charges.

Families in hiding as more ICE sightings reported

Luce, the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, staffed its hotline with interpreters who speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin, and Haitian Creole to collect information about ICE sightings. The organization put out a call for volunteers who speak languages like Cape Verdean Kriolu, Nepali and Vietnamese to help manage the influx.

Kevin Lam, co-executive director with the Asian American Resource Workshop, a community group that works on immigration and other issues, said they have seen a “spike” in ICE activity, including five Vietnamese residents from a Boston neighborhood who were detained last week.

He and other advocates said many immigrants have expressed fear about everyday tasks like picking up their kids at school and riding on public transportation. However, he said many are still attending work, with some at risk for detention who are also the primary caretakers of their families.

“Many of them are like, ‘Yeah, it is a risk every day when I step out, but I need to work to be able to provide for my family,’” he said.

Asylum-seekers and other legal immigrants targeted

Republican Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Leah Foley said she is “100% supportive” of ICE’s latest operation in the state and that her office will not hesitate to prosecute immigrants without legal status who commit crimes. Noncriminals have also been swept up in raids that ICE calls “collateral arrests.”

“We stand ready to charge individuals who violate all federal laws, including those who enter our country without authorization after being deported and those who assault federal law enforcement officers or impede or interfere with federal officers doing their jobs,” she said in a statement to the AP.

Advocates like Lam pushed back on claims that ICE agents are only targeting criminals, saying that with fewer protections for asylum-seekers and others who are here legally, the strategy seems to be going well beyond “bad immigrants” with records.

Alexandra Peredo Carroll, director of legal Education and advocacy at the Boston-based Mabel Center for Immigrant Justice, said the Trump administration is “trying to fit folks into this narrative of being illegal or having broken the law, when in fact, many of these are individuals who are actually going through the legal process.”

“I think you’re going to see more and more how families are going to be torn apart, how individuals with no criminal history, with pending forms of relief, pending applications are just going to be rounded up,” she said.

The rollback, say the lawmakers, threatens to weaken enforcement of existing laws, strip protections for nearly 5 million students nationwide and limit the ability of parents with limited English proficiency to make informed decisions about their children's education.

""I represent an immigrant-rich community. In South Florida — and across the nation —many of our children in schools are English learners simply trying to build their futures,"" Wilson said.

""Ripping away resources and guidance for English learners is a cruel and foolish decision,"" said Wilson, who is a former principal and Miami-Dade School Board member.

""Stripping away these English learning resources undermines the rights of millions of children, weakens our ability to help them become the English speakers the president claims to want, and betrays this nation's commitment to immigrants,"" she added. ""This decision must be reversed immediately.

In greater Washington and around the country, teams of masked officers from D.H.S.","Eight years ago, Sara Fernandez flew into Newark, New Jersey, on her way back from the Dominican Republic, where her boyfriend lived. As she was going through airport security, she heard a T.S.A. agent say to one of his colleagues, “Do I need to pick her up and put her through the scanner?” Fernandez has dwarfism; she identifies as a little person. She also happened to be a new hire in the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which oversees anti-discrimination enforcement for the Department of Homeland Security, including T.S.A. “The guy obviously didn’t know I worked for D.H.S.,” Fernandez recalled. He had made her feel “really awkward and uncomfortable,” but she didn’t want to get him in trouble, so she contacted T.S.A. and scheduled a phone call with him. “I wanted to be, like, ‘You upset me. Look at me. I’m a professional,’ ” she said. After their call, “he got some training. Moments like that can actually stick with a person more, because he got to hear it from me.”

Fernandez was raised in Pittsburgh by adoptive parents, also little people, who’d met at an annual meeting of Little People of America. Her mom’s family was “historically Republican,” in a moderate, John McCain kind of way, Fernandez told me. Her dad had emigrated from Argentina and worked as an accountant. “I have a picture of us at his naturalization ceremony, with American flags,” she said. Her parents weren’t political, but they believed in equal rights and taught their daughter not to feel limited by her stature. Still, she recalled, “as a kid, I was very reserved, observant, anxious. I didn’t want anyone to notice me.” Fernandez earned degrees in law and social work, and entered federal service through the Schedule A program, which expedites the hiring of qualified candidates with disabilities. She started at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, then went to D.H.S. in 2017, during the first Trump Administration. She married the man she’d been dating, who’s of average height, and gave birth to their son, a little person who’s now five years old.

Being in a civil-rights office, Fernandez often thought about the laws that made her career possible. In the federal government, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of “a physical or mental disability,” and requires that “reasonable accommodations,” or tweaks to working conditions, be provided to disabled employees. (In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act extended this protection to workers in state and local governments and the private sector.) D.H.S. gave Fernandez an accessible parking spot, placed step stools in common areas of the office, and brought over the customized chair she’d used at the E.E.O.C. During the pandemic, when she was dealing with an autoimmune sickness, her supervisor allowed her to work from home. “It was the best environment I’ve ever worked in,” she said.

Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had issued executive orders to improve access and opportunities for civil servants with disabilities. The first Trump Administration also “prided itself on continuing efforts around disability hiring and retention,” Daniel Davis, a disability expert who recently left the Department of Health and Human Services, told me. More than a tenth of the federal workforce identified as disabled in fiscal year 2021 (the most recent data available), including a great number of disabled veterans. In the past decade, the over-all employment rate for adults with disabilities has risen from seventeen per cent to nearly twenty-three per cent, with a big jump since 2020. The pandemic that killed more than 1.2 million Americans and caused many others to become disabled also led employers to offer flexible schedules and remote-work arrangements that made it easier for disabled people to do their jobs.

Fernandez’s office was at D.H.S. headquarters, at St. Elizabeths, a huge campus in Washington, D.C. that was once the grounds of the Government Hospital for the Insane. Not long ago, people with disabilities had been relegated to such institutions, often against their will. At the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or C.R.C.L., Fernandez was part of a team that enforced anti-discrimination and language-access laws, led equal-opportunity trainings, and reviewed requests for accommodation for D.H.S. employees. In 2023, she appeared alongside Alejandro Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time, at a conference that marked the fiftieth anniversary of the Rehabilitation Act. They posed for a photo—Fernandez wore a blue pleated dress, her hair down to her shoulders—that was later published in an agency newsletter.

C.R.C.L. also set policies for, and handled complaints from, the public. Its jurisdiction was vast, ranging from the encounter Fernandez had at Newark Airport to much graver incidents: sexual harassment in immigration detention, neglect of wheelchair users in FEMA disaster recovery, racial bullying in the Coast Guard, assault by federal security guards.

Last year a group funded by the Heritage Foundation set up a website, “DHS Watch List,” to publicize the names and photographs of immigration judges and bureaucrats it deemed “subversive.” It described C.R.C.L. as “a bastion for leftist [sic] who want to use the tools in the department to frustrate efforts to deport illegal aliens.” Fernandez was surprised by this characterization. C.R.C.L. was a law-enforcement agency within a law-enforcement department—so unprogressive, in fact, that friends in the disability community had asked how she could even work there.

Early this year, when the Department of Government Efficiency started to push large-scale layoffs, Fernandez reassured herself that, because C.R.C.L. was mandated by the founding statute of D.H.S., its hundred and fifty or so employees would be protected. In late March, she learned otherwise. Her position, according to an e-mail from Human Resources, was being eliminated as “a result of the dissolution of Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.” The entire office was found to be “non-essential or not legally mandated,” as were two smaller offices that conducted oversight of the immigration-detention system and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. A spokesperson for D.H.S. referred to the three as “internal adversaries.” Civil-rights mechanisms at Homeland Security were essentially wiped out. Fernandez would be put on paid administrative leave for sixty days, then terminated at the end of May. She packed up her office and left.

One way to parse Donald Trump’s approach to disability is on the basis of his public comments. At a campaign rally in 2015, he mocked the hand movements of a disabled reporter. In his first term, he told aides that he didn’t want to appear with military amputees because “it doesn’t look good for me.” In 2020, according to a memoir by Trump’s nephew, who has a disabled son, the President said, of people with serious disabilities: “The shape they’re in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.” And this year, after his second Inauguration, he said that Biden’s recruitment of “individuals with ‘severe intellectual’ disabilities” were partly to blame for an aircraft collision over the Potomac River that killed sixty-seven people.

Fernandez had been so rattled by the general chaos in the Administration that her layoff initially came as a relief. Her husband, their five-year-old son, eight-year-old stepdaughter, and four dogs kept her more than occupied, especially when school let out for summer break. “Do you want some kids to live with you?” she joked to me one day, by text. “Mine are available.” After bedtime, she would go online to browse and exchange messages about crystals and rocks, which she’s collected her whole life. She posted closeups of blue lace agate and pink sugar amethyst on Instagram.

But the relief soon curdled into worry. Her family relied on her salary and health insurance; her husband, who is Dominican and has a green card, took irregular freelance gigs as a construction worker, a personal trainer, a dance instructor, and an Uber driver. She would have to find a new job soon, but where? She had only ever been in the public sector, and by choice. “I want to do good work, but also, I want to move the world forward,” she said.

Across the federal government, the kind of work she’d done at C.R.C.L. seemed increasingly in peril. The Department of Housing and Urban Development cancelled grants that go to poor people with disabilities. (A spokesperson told me that HUD continues to serve “Americans who are not able bodied or able minded.”) At the Department of Health and Human Services, a division that helps disabled people and seniors live at home had its staff cut in half. Trump’s trillion-dollar reduction in Medicaid spending, meanwhile, could make it harder for disabled people to access long-term care. The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education laid off nearly fifty per cent of its personnel, though some staff have since been rehired. According to a lawyer there, disability discrimination complaints were “our bread and butter, the bulk of our caseload.” Now, “the agency is just not carrying out its statutory function. They’re dismissing thousands of cases.” The Department of Labor withdrew a plan to establish a minimum wage for workers with disabilities and abolished wage protections for the home-health aides who assist millions of seniors and disabled people. “Prior to this year, there was such a hope that the needle had moved,” Verlencia Somuah, a former employee of D.O.L. who is legally blind, told me. “Now, I’m looking for employment. Do I even say I’m a person with disabilities?”

Disabled government employees have struggled to obtain accommodations that were once routine. The Administration’s mandate to return to full-time, in-person work spurred “huge influxes in requests for telework,” Anupa Iyer Geevarghese, who crafted disability policies during the Biden Administration, told me. “With civil-rights offices being gutted, how are agencies going to process these requests?” (Twenty-eight per cent of federal employees currently have a hybrid-work arrangement, compared with fifty-one per cent for employees over-all.)

Civil servants I spoke with reported backlogs and waits of up to five months for a decision. Some resorted to filing union grievances or complaints with their agencies; requests that languished or were denied could be appealed to the E.E.O.C. Disabled workers at the E.E.O.C. were themselves fighting to get, or keep, their accommodations. In addition to telework, employees needed flexible hours to fit medication schedules, standing desks for bad backs; those with autism or A.D.H.D. needed key dates and instructions in writing. Two former E.E.O.C. employees told me that the agency’s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, had taken the unusual step of reviewing more than a year’s worth of approved and pending accommodations requests. (The E.E.O.C. did not respond to a request for comment.) The Department of Veterans Affairs announced plans to reëvaluate existing accommodations. “Everyone is on edge, wondering, is your accommodation safe?” Somuah, the former D.O.L. employee, said. Another federal employee, who has chronic pain and a condition that requires the use of a wheelchair, had previously worked on a hybrid schedule. The new Administration, she said, required her to apply for a formal accommodation and submit extensive medical records, even though her need for hybrid work was obvious to her supervisors. Her request was still pending when she resigned. (A White House spokesperson told me, “The Trump-Vance administration values the contributions of government employees with disabilities and believes they should be recognized and rewarded based on the merit of the work.”)

Fernandez said that she was “worried for employees with disabilities that are still working at D.H.S. If they aren’t getting what they need, it’s going to make it seem like they can’t do their job.” In April, civil-rights groups filed a federal lawsuit against D.H.S. over its closure of C.R.C.L. and the two ombudsman offices. D.H.S. told the court that all three offices were in fact still open. C.R.C.L. was apparently being run by two people; there were plans to recruit around twenty more. “The staffing numbers would be just a tiny fraction of what the office was before,” Karla Gilbride, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told me. As of August, only two full-time employees had been added. A group of fired workers submitted a separate whistle-blower letter to Congress. C.R.C.L., they said, can no longer perform its duties, including investigating “allegations of disability discrimination and deaths in custody.” They estimated that “approximately 550 open complaint investigations and hundreds of allegations pending review” had been abandoned. A representative for D.H.S. would not answer my questions, but told me that “C.R.C.L. is performing all legally required functions.”

This summer, I met Fernandez at a strip-mall Starbucks near her home in Virginia. We ran into a FedEx deliveryman she knew from her frequent crystal shipments. A woman at the next table kept staring and butting into our conversation. Was she eager to pick up gossip about the federal bureaucracy? Or was it because Fernandez was a little person? “People take videos of us all the time,” Fernandez told me. We moved to a table outside, despite the extreme heat.

Three months had passed since her firing. Soon she would have to start paying more than two thousand dollars a month to keep her family on health insurance. Her biggest concern, though, was her husband’s safety. In greater Washington and around the country, teams of masked officers from D.H.S. were raiding courthouses and patrolling immigrant neighborhoods. Though it had never been Fernandez’s job to weigh in on immigration policy, she’d had faith that even people taken into custody had rights, and could submit complaints to C.R.C.L. Now, she had no one to call if something happened to her husband, who has a dark complexion and speaks halting English. “In this atmosphere, I’m always worried about speaking Spanish in public,” she explained. “What if he gets pulled over for nothing?”","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68bee2f29add9884161b4dfe/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/IMG_3596.jpeg",N,,2025-09-16 11:57:56.594010

Similar protests have cropped up throughout the Chicago area during the Trump administration’s so called “Operation Midway Blitz,” including last week, when Mayor Daniel Biss and Kat Abughazaleh (who are both running to represent Illinois’ 9th Congressional District) joined anti-ICE protesters outside of a Department of Homeland Security processing facility in Broadview.

Abughazaleh has spoken out against ICE and in support of immigrants, posting on X that she was “so glad” to be joined by Biss in Broadview and calling for other candidates and elected officials to protest.

Both Biss and Abughazaleh were once again in attendance at Monday’s protest, which was organized by the Pink Poster Club.

On Sept. 10, the Evanston Police Department confirmed that Homeland Security personnel arrested a suspect in a “criminal matter” the week prior near Church Street and Brown Avenue, after they were present in the same area conducting a criminal investigation.

“This is dark,” Biss said, addressing the crowd. “The attacks that we are seeing are outrageous. They are coming for LGBT people, and they are minutes away from coming for all of us, and in this moment, we have to stick together.”

With a City Council meeting scheduled to begin immediately after the protest, a few other elected officials were also in attendance, including Shawn Iles (3rd Ward), Jonathan Nieuwsma (4th), Juan Geracaris (9th) and City Clerk Stephanie Mendoza.

“Evanston believes deeply in our role as a welcoming city, and our City Council has been preparing for this awful moment, passing what is one of the strongest welcoming city ordinances in the country before Donald Trump took office in January,” Biss said, “to make sure that our police will not collaborate, not only with ICE, but with anyone else doing civil immigration enforcement on behalf of the federal government.”

Emily Miller, co-founder of the Pink Poster Club, led protestors in chants and introductions throughout the hour-long demonstration.

Another rally is in the works for Sunday, Oct. 5, according to Miller.

Miller helped form the Pink Poster Club after President Donald Trump began his second term, she said. Since then, the group has distributed thousands of flyers and posters across the country.

“We’re just getting started. I think flyering is very fun again. I encourage you to join us, but it also has become secondary to our mission, which is building community and community resiliency in a face of a rising authoritarianism,” she said on Monday.

“And I think it’s been clear this past year, and this past week especially, that no one’s coming to save us. So it’s up to us. It’s up to me and you, moms and teachers, journalists, photographers, musicians, artists, cashiers, everyone and anyone who’s brave enough to take a stand.”

By 5 p.m., about a hundred people were in Fountain Square with their own posters, including Kevin, who declined to give his last name out of concern for his safety.

“I’m a child of immigrants, so for me it’s very important to come to these events whenever I can and wherever they are,” he said. “The least I can do for my family, my heritage, is to rise up and show that we deserve to be here, and I hope this continues.”

He said the diverse crowd who spent a Monday afternoon protesting ICE “filled his heart with hope to see people of different cultures, different races, come out and support people like my family.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3076-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 11:58:19.723854

BOSTON (AP) — Immigrants are being detained while going to work, outside courthouses, and at store parking lots in Metro Boston as President Donald Trump targets so-called sanctuary cities in his effort to ramp up immigration enforcement.

As families hole up in homes — afraid to leave and risk detainment — advocates are reporting an increased presence of unmarked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles sitting in parking lots and other public areas throughout immigrant communities, where agents appeared to target work vans. One man captured a video of three landscapers who were working on the Saugus Town Hall property being arrested after agents smashed their truck window.

Just north of Boston, the city of Everett canceled its annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival after its mayor said it wouldn’t be right to “hold a celebration at a time when community members may not feel safe attending.”

The actions have been praised by public officials like New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who signed legislation this year banning sanctuary city policies in her state, vowing not to let New Hampshire “go the way of Massachusetts.” ICE this summer began utilizing a New Hampshire airport about an hour from Boston to transport New England detainees.

However, others argue that ICE’s presence in Massachusetts is doing more harm than good.

“This is really increasing the fear in communities, which is already incredibly high,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.

Trump aims at so-called ‘sanctuaries’

Cities like Boston and Chicago — where Mayor Brandon Johnson has also condemned the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown, calling it an example of “tyranny” — have become targets for enforcement in recent days. Trump also threatened to potentially deploy the National Guard to Chicago, though he had wavered on a military deployment last week.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Sept. 4 filed a lawsuit against Mayor Michelle Wu, the city of Boston and its police department over its sanctuary city policies, claiming they’re interfering with immigration enforcement. In response, Wu accused Trump of “attacking cities to hide his administration’s failures.”

Now, ICE has launched an operation it called “Patriot 2.0″ on the heels of a May crackdown where nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in Massachusetts. Its latest operation came days before a preliminary mayoral election, where incumbent Wu won easily. The mayor has become a frequent target over her defense of the city and its so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Boston surge would focus on “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” living in Massachusetts.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but protect them at the peril of law-abiding American citizens,” she said in a press release early last week, which detailed the arrest of seven individuals by ICE, including a 38-year-old man from Guatemala who had previously been arrested on assault-related charges.

The agency did not respond to requests from The Associated Press about the number of immigrants detained since “Patriot 2.0” began.

Detainees housed in facilities across New England

ICE has contracts to detain people at multiple correctional facilities across New England, including county jails as well as the federal prison in Berlin, New Hampshire, and a publicly-owned, privately operated prison in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

Volunteers monitoring flights carrying detainees from New Hampshire’s Portsmouth International Airport at Pease have documented the transfer of more than 300 individuals since early August, with at least five flights per week transferring people from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts. All of the detainees have been in shackles, said David Holt, who has been organizing regular protests at Pease.

Protesters gathered at venues like the ICE office in Burlington, where three participants were arrested on trespassing charges.

Families in hiding as more ICE sightings reported

Luce, the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, staffed its hotline with interpreters who speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin, and Haitian Creole to collect information about ICE sightings. The organization put out a call for volunteers who speak languages like Cape Verdean Kriolu, Nepali and Vietnamese to help manage the influx.

Kevin Lam, co-executive director with the Asian American Resource Workshop, a community group that works on immigration and other issues, said they have seen a “spike” in ICE activity, including five Vietnamese residents from a Boston neighborhood who were detained last week.

He and other advocates said many immigrants have expressed fear about everyday tasks like picking up their kids at school and riding on public transportation. However, he said many are still attending work, with some at risk for detention who are also the primary caretakers of their families.

“Many of them are like, ‘Yeah, it is a risk every day when I step out, but I need to work to be able to provide for my family,’” he said.

Asylum-seekers and other legal immigrants targeted

Republican Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Leah Foley said she is “100% supportive” of ICE’s latest operation in the state and that her office will not hesitate to prosecute immigrants without legal status who commit crimes. Noncriminals have also been swept up in raids that ICE calls “collateral arrests.”

“We stand ready to charge individuals who violate all federal laws, including those who enter our country without authorization after being deported and those who assault federal law enforcement officers or impede or interfere with federal officers doing their jobs,” she said in a statement to the AP.

Advocates like Lam pushed back on claims that ICE agents are only targeting criminals, saying that with fewer protections for asylum-seekers and others who are here legally, the strategy seems to be going well beyond “bad immigrants” with records.

Alexandra Peredo Carroll, director of legal Education and advocacy at the Boston-based Mabel Center for Immigrant Justice, said the Trump administration is “trying to fit folks into this narrative of being illegal or having broken the law, when in fact, many of these are individuals who are actually going through the legal process.”

“I think you’re going to see more and more how families are going to be torn apart, how individuals with no criminal history, with pending forms of relief, pending applications are just going to be rounded up,” she said.

But multiple immigration professionals told CBC News they're concerned some IRCC officers are refusing applications without checking all the submitted documents.
Tao acknowledges IRCC's view that the tools do not affect the officers' decisions, but he thinks the ""line between the two is quite thin.""
It even noted that computer problems in some offices meant ""strong processing officers were down to 60/day compared to their usual 75+/day.""
It adds that it's up to the applicant to satisfy the visa officer that they meet the requirements for a visa.","Immigration professionals and people applying to enter Canada say they're increasingly getting refusal letters they think don't make sense — leading them to wonder whether their cases are being fully and properly reviewed by a human being.

Toronto immigration lawyer Mario Bellissimo began to have concerns after seeing multiple examples, such as a case he worked on where the officer refused an application on the grounds that no birth certificate was included, even though he says a copy of the birth certificate was attached to the application.

""It worries me as an applicant and as a lawyer for an applicant: what is actually being looked at?"" Bellissimo told CBC News.

Immigration professionals like Bellissimo are pointing to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada's use of computer-assisted decision-making technology as the problem.

Although IRCC acknowledges it has developed computer programs that allow officers to sort and process applications faster, it rejects the idea these programs affect the thoroughness of officers' reviews.

IRCC says human officers make the final decision on eligibility and admissibility for immigration cases. It says refused applicants get ""thorough correspondence"" from the department.

""Decisions about whether an applicant meets these requirements are made by highly trained officers who assess each application against the relevant program criteria,"" IRCC said in an email statement to CBC News.

But multiple immigration professionals told CBC News they're concerned some IRCC officers are refusing applications without checking all the submitted documents.

""[Refusals] should never infringe or breach procedural fairness. And in order to do that, it is required that the officer looks at every single document in the file,"" said Annie Beaudoin, a retired senior immigration officer for IRCC who is now an immigration consultant.

""And lately, there is evidence that that is not done.""

Why IRCC turned to technology in decision-making

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has faced immense public pressure to deal with backlogs and long processing times, which can take years in some cases.

How long does a Canadian visitor visa take? 500 days later, these parents are still waiting

Immigrant entrepreneurs say years-long wait for Canada's startup visa leaves them in limbo

Numbers released by IRCC at the end of July indicated there were more than 2.2 million applications in IRCC's systems. Of those, more than 901,000 had exceeded the department's time standards for processing and were considered back-logged.

Beaudoin, who worked for 15 years in the immigration department's Los Angeles office, says that when she started in 2004, there was ""much less pressure.""

She says that by the time she retired in 2018, managers would regularly remind officers of quotas for the number of cases to process in a given time. She felt there was a lot of pressure to go fast, and less emphasis on the quality of the work.

The department began to use a computer model in 2018 called ""advanced data analytics"" to sort cases and help officers make eligibility decisions. It claims the system can speed processing by up to 87 per cent.

In an email, IRCC said advanced analytics uses ""machine learning technology"" to find patterns in data, such as how likely it is that a specific type of applicant has been approved by an officer in the past.

It says advanced analytics doesn't recommend refusals; only human officers can do this, ""based on their own review.""

For the human review step, IRCC developed a spreadsheet-based tool called Chinook to allow officers to examine and approve or refuse multiple cases at the same time. It offers officers boilerplate language to explain their decision.

IRCC describes Chinook as a tool to ""simplify"" the displayed information for the officer. The agency emphasizes the tool itself doesn't use any artificial intelligence and doesn't make or recommend decisions.

But immigration lawyer Bellissimo, who has made submissions to parliamentarians on IRCC's use of new technology, worries it can lead officers to miss or skim over parts of applications.

He says he has seen some decisions with time-stamps that suggest the officer only considered the case for a couple of minutes, which in Bellissimo's view should not be viewed as a ""badge of honour.""

""It does not instill the confidence we need in an immigration system to foster a belief that we are processing applicants in a fair and transparent manner to the benefit of Canadians,"" he said.

A 2018 Chinook user manual released under access to information suggests an officer can use the system to examine up to 1,000 cases at the same time.

Vancouver immigration lawyer Will Tao, who wrote a master's thesis on IRCC's use of technology, is concerned that officers can use Chinook to take ""bulk"" actions, giving the same answer to multiple cases. The feature can be used for both refusals and approvals.

Internal IRCC documents state officers can use Chinook to make decisions on up to 150 applications, which IRCC says can all be added into its information management system at once.

In a 2023 briefing note, IRCC described bulk processing as important for handling growing numbers of cases efficiently.

""This bulk and blanket treatment of individuals definitely has had a negative impact on the system,"" Tao told CBC News.

Tao acknowledges IRCC's view that the tools do not affect the officers' decisions, but he thinks the ""line between the two is quite thin.""

""What it does do is it alters decision-making,"" he said.

Speed of processing

Chinook was first rolled out in some IRCC offices in 2018. An IRCC document released under access to information in 2022 praised the efficiency in processing cases that offices from Ankara to London were able to gain by using Chinook.

It even noted that computer problems in some offices meant ""strong processing officers were down to 60/day compared to their usual 75+/day.""

Beaudoin says she saw but never used an early version of Chinook before retiring from the L.A. office.

In the last year, in her work as an immigration consultant, she says some of her clients have received refusals she feels defy logic. She cites the example of a work permit refusal on the grounds that only one employment-related document was submitted, when in fact multiple documents were included.

""As a [former] immigration officer, I have a lot of sympathy and compassion, because officers have a lot of pressure to do a lot of decisions extremely fast,"" she said. ""And that's when these problems occur.""

In its statement to CBC, IRCC says it trains officers to ""carefully and systematically"" assess all applications and make decisions ""based on the information presented before them."" It adds that it's up to the applicant to satisfy the visa officer that they meet the requirements for a visa.

Beaudoin says the department is willing to acknowledge and reconsider errors, but she says a refusal based on an incomplete review of a file is unfair.

Other immigration professionals are equally worried.

In an open letter to IRCC on Aug. 13, the Canadian Immigration Lawyers Association wrote, ""The introduction of automated and analytic tools to assist decision makers is in our opinion directly linked to the increase in decisions that are neither meaningful nor well-reasoned.""

Family reunification

When applicants disagree with an officer's reasons for refusal, they may ask IRCC to reconsider. That was the case for Chandni Ajwani and Jay Dave, whose application to be reunited in Canada was initially refused.

Ajwani is a Canadian citizen and lives in Montreal, while Dave is an Indian citizen who lives in Ahmedabad, India. The couple married in July 2023.

They have a spousal sponsorship application underway, which is expected to take some time to complete. In the meantime, Dave applied for a visitor visa so he could see Ajwani in Canada.

""When you're staying at a distance, that is something that pinches you a lot,"" Dave said.

In December 2024, an officer rejected the application for a visitor visa, saying Dave had insufficient funds and that the visit wasn't consistent with a temporary stay.

The couple, who work in finance and human resources, disagreed with that reasoning, and told CBC they submitted many documents to prove their incomes.

The notes on the officer's reasoning for refusal didn't mention a Canadian spouse or that Ajwani has an active sponsorship application for Dave.

Their immigration consultant, Beaudoin, expected to see at least some acknowledgement of that relationship, and believes an officer gave insufficient attention to the file.

This led Beaudoin and the couple to ask for a reconsideration. Dave's visitor visa was eventually granted in March 2025.

Ajwani says she was upset and felt the application wasn't examined fairly the first time.

""There was anger, I'm not gonna lie. And the sad part is I know that's not how Canada functions. Our immigration system is quite fair,"" she said.

IRCC plans to keep using computerized tools to assist its officers, saying in a statement it has assessed the impacts and considers technology ""essential to modernizing our immigration system.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7631833.1757629776!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/immigration-visas-20230606.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-16 12:57:09.024450

As families hole up in homes — afraid to leave and risk detainment — advocates are reporting an increased presence of unmarked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles sitting in parking lots and other public areas throughout immigrant communities, where agents appeared to target work vans. One man captured a video of three landscapers who were working on the Saugus Town Hall property being arrested after agents smashed their truck window.

The city of Everett canceled its annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival after its mayor said it would not be right to “hold a celebration at a time when community members may not feel safe attending.”

The actions have been praised by public officials such as New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who signed legislation this year banning sanctuary city policies in her state, vowing not to let New Hampshire “go the way of Massachusetts.” ICE this summer began utilizing a New Hampshire airport about an hour from Boston to transport New England detainees.

However, others argue that ICE’s presence in Massachusetts is doing more harm than good.

“This is really increasing the fear in communities, which is already incredibly high,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Sept. 4 filed a lawsuit against Mayor Michelle Wu, the city of Boston and its police department over its sanctuary city policies, claiming they were interfering with immigration enforcement. In response, Wu accused Trump of “attacking cities to hide his administration’s failures.”

Now, ICE has launched an operation it called “Patriot 2.0″ on the heels of a May crackdown in which nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in Massachusetts. Its latest operation came days before a preliminary mayoral election, where incumbent Wu won comfortably. The mayor has become a frequent target over her defense of the city and its so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Boston surge would focus on “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” living in Massachusetts.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but protect them at the peril of law-abiding American citizens,” she said in a press release early last week, which detailed the arrest of seven individuals by ICE, including a 38-year-old man from Guatemala who had previously been arrested on assault-related charges.

The agency did not respond to requests from The Associated Press about the number of immigrants detained since “Patriot 2.0” began.

Asylum-seekers and other legal immigrants targeted

U.S. Attorney Leah B. Foley said she is “100 percent supportive” of ICE’s latest operation in the state and that her office will not hesitate to prosecute immigrants without legal status who commit crimes. Non-criminals have also been swept up in raids that ICE calls “collateral arrests.”

“We stand ready to charge individuals who violate all federal laws, including those who enter our country without authorization after being deported and those who assault federal law enforcement officers or impede or interfere with federal officers doing their jobs,” she said in a statement to the AP.

Advocates pushed back on claims that ICE agents are only targeting criminals, saying that with fewer protections for asylum-seekers and others in the country legally, the strategy seems to be going well beyond immigrants with records.

Alexandra Peredo Carroll, director of legal education and advocacy at the Boston-based Mabel Center for Immigrant Justice, said the Trump administration is “trying to fit folks into this narrative of being illegal or having broken the law, when in fact, many of these are individuals who are actually going through the legal process.”

“I think you’re going to see more and more how families are going to be torn apart, how individuals with no criminal history, with pending forms of relief, pending applications are just going to be rounded up,” she said.",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2021/10/MALW-Digital-Product-Mockups_Tessa.png,N,,2025-09-16 10:56:27.383345

TOP TALKER

MORE ARRESTS: The Trump administration is ramping up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area with 250 individuals taken into custody, according to Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations.

Underwood, who was briefed Monday on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the region, expressed concern about the impact on Illinois.

“Everyone deserves to feel safe in their community. Like all Illinoisans, I’ve been concerned and alarmed by reporting about ICE’s conduct and operations in our state under Donald Trump,” said Underwood, who had pushed for the briefing about “Midway Blitz,” as the operation has been named.

ICE activity took a deadly turn Friday when a federal officer fatally shot a person who had allegedly injured an ICE agent during an arrest. The lack of details surrounding the incident has drawn criticism from elected officials and residents alike.

“We need more information,” Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Monday. “If this were the Chicago Police Department, if this were the Sheriff’s Office in Cook County, if this were Illinois State Police, you would have had a lot more information already released.”

In a wide-ranging speech, Pritzker said that heightened federal activity is causing fear across communities that has been exacerbated by the political tensions since the assassination of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.

Threats are on the rise: Pritzker told reporters he’s received an increased number of threats since Kirk’s death. Mayor Brandon Johnson has similarly seen an increase in threats, according to a person close to the mayor.

Pritzker called it a “watershed moment,” saying “Americans must come together and say clearly that threats and political violence are not the answer.”

He listed recent acts of violence targeting Republicans and Democrats — including “the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump, arson at Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home … the assassinations of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the shootings of State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife.”

“It’s now incumbent upon leaders of all stripes to work together to stop [political violence]. Most especially, this should come from the top,” Pritzker. said. “Yet with each new crisis in recent years, we are reminded that we cannot rely on President Trump to tamp down the anger and the passion in the aftermath of political violence. Instead, he actively fans the flames of division.”

Pritzker emphasized that leadership requires a choice: “We can choose to stay silent and live in fear of more political violence, or we can choose to be loud for peace, for compassion and for an America where people settle their political differences through free speech and at the ballot box. Let’s be those people.”

Illinois House Republicans scoffed, asserting in a statement that Pritzker has been “one of the loudest voices” escalating political rhetoric and pointing to his comparing Trump policies to Nazi Germany.

Meanwhile in Washington, the president again threatened to send the National Guard into Illinois. “We’ve got to save our big cities,” Trump told reporters at the White House, adding after sending troops to Memphis, Chicago is “probably next.”

That won’t be a surprise. Pritzker warned earlier, “We never really know what [Trump] intends to do.”

THE BUZZ

A MADIGAN TRIBUTE: Former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, who has largely stayed out of the public eye since his conviction earlier this year on bribery and corruption charges, broke his silence to honor the late Gov. Jim Edgar.

“Shirley and our family express our condolences upon Jim Edgar’s passing. We send sympathy and prayers to Brenda, Brad and Elizabeth,” Madigan said in a statement Monday.

The longtime Democratic leader reflected on his years working alongside the former Republican governor, recalling both his wife’s role as chair of the Arts Council and his own as speaker.

“We worked with Jim ... We found him to be at times conservative, but generally moderate, as when as a Republican he supported the pro-choice position concerning reproductive rights. We worked with him to find common ground among competing interests in developing the State budget, where he was always supportive of the Arts Council,” Madigan wrote.

“We found him to always be respectful of others; personally and with regard to governmental and political views. Illinois is a much better place because of Jim Edgar. Shirley and I have lost a good friend.”

BUSINESS OF POLITICS

— FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: State Rep. Nick Smith won’t seek reelection, capping off an eight-year term in the Illinois General Assembly.

The surprise decision came “after much thought and careful consideration,” the Democrat told Playbook. “Serving as a member of the Illinois General Assembly in the House of Representatives has been an honor of a lifetime. Serving the people of the 34th Representative District and the state of Illinois has been an absolute privilege.”

Smith was appointed in 2018 and won every election after that. A chemistry major at heart, Smith’s legislation has been focused on workforce development, environmental justice and infrastructure investment, often working across ideological lines to find practical solutions.

His departure will leave a significant vacancy in a district that straddles urban and suburban concerns, stretching from Chicago’s Pullman neighborhood to parts of the south suburbs. Smith’s exit sets the stage for a competitive Democratic primary.

Wilson, in a statement Monday, said the Education and Justice departments recently rescinded 2015 federal guidance that clarified states’ obligations to English Learner students.

The rollback, say the lawmakers, threatens to weaken enforcement of existing laws, strip protections for nearly 5 million students nationwide, and limit the ability of parents with limited English proficiency to make informed decisions about their children’s education.

Both the Israeli and U.S. sanctions clearly violate the Rome Statute, the treaty that established and governs the ICC.","For decades, the Treasury Department has politicized its authority to impose sanctions. Now, however, with the Trump administration sanctioning three Palestinian human rights organizations, civil society activists around the world are shocked and terrified: Could they be next?

The alarm is due to the brazen willingness of President Donald Trump to sanction the staff of these Palestinian groups specifically because of their advocacy with the International Criminal Court to hold Israeli war criminals accountable.

It’s the first time the U.S. has levied sanctions against an organization specifically for its efforts to use lawful, peaceful tools of advocacy in pursuit of legal accountability. There is no pretense other than the groups’ work on legal issues that the administration doesn’t like.

Trump has global civil society directly in the crosshairs.

Copying another page from the authoritarian playbook, Trump now has global civil society directly in the crosshairs of the U.S. government’s legal, financial, and criminal arsenals. The next disfavored issue, these groups fear, could be climate change, arms control, or reproductive rights — virtually anything.

To justify its recent sanctions against Al Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, the Treasury announcement said the groups “directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals.”

The only other sanction the U.S. ever imposed on a human rights organization was earlier this year against Addameer, a Palestinian group that the Trump administration claimed was linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.

Blocking Accountability

Trump has gone far out of his way to shield Israel from any form of judicial accountability for its atrocities in Gaza, illegal occupation, and apartheid rule.

The sanctions on the Palestinian organizations follow extensive attacks and threats against the ICC itself, including sanctions against the ICC prosecutor who secured the arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Later, four of the judges who approved the warrants were also sanctioned.

The new Treasury sanctions also follow lockstep with Israel’s near-identical sanctions against human rights groups and activists. On June 30, Israel imposed sanctions on Al Haq Europe, Law for Palestine, the Hind Rajab Foundation, Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, and DAWN, where I am the executive director. Additionally, Israel targeted individual staffs of these organizations, myself included.

As with the U.S., Israel explained these moves as punishment for the work these groups did with the ICC’s Palestine prosecution.

Both the Israeli and U.S. sanctions clearly violate the Rome Statute, the treaty that established and governs the ICC. Article 70 of the treaty prohibits obstruction of justice, and the sanctions by Israel and the U.S. are seeking to interfere with the court’s prosecution.

For Americans caught up in the sanctions, there are also First Amendment issues. The sanctions could chill protected speech, advocacy, or engagement by hanging “material support” charges over the heads of those who would work with the ICC or the sanctioned Palestinian organizations. Federal courts have already concluded that this chilling effect can take place, issuing preliminary injunctions in two cases in favor of plaintiffs who argued the sanctions had impinged on their free speech rights.

Short of a judicial ruling overturning the sanctions entirely, however, Americans will remain in fear of prosecution simply for talking to the court or these organizations.

All for Israel

The effectively unregulated ability of the U.S. to deploy its powerful sanctions arsenal has now moved beyond the usual grounds of terrorism, human rights abuses, or violation of U.S. laws or other sanctions to include anything the Trump administration disfavors.

There’s nothing to stop this administration from seeking to sanction any other organization in the world for pursuing advocacy odds with Trump’s worldview.

The Biden administration’s feeble effort to reform America’s gargantuan global sanctions regime, which it critiqued as an overused “tool of first resort,” ended up producing a seven-page report and zero concrete action.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and congressional Republicans have made no secret of their aim to crush pro-Palestine activism with every tool available. Immigrant students were the first targets, swept into deportation proceedings for their speech about Palestine.

Now, the administration and its allies are pursuing more concrete moves. Last week, Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., introduced a bill that would allow the secretary of state to revoke the passports of Americans they accuse of giving material support to a terrorist group.

As happened with immigrant students, the provision could easily be used to label criticism of Israel as tantamount to support for Palestinian groups, such as Hamas, designated as terrorists by the U.S. (Following The Intercept’s coverage of the bill and widespread opposition to the measure, Mast moved to strike the language.)

The passport bill followed a narrowly defeated effort to include a provision in Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that would allow the Treasury Department to strip nonprofit organizations of their tax-exempt status merely by accusing them of supporting terrorism.

Efforts to quash Israel’s prosecution at the ICC with these sanctions may seem less dangerous than U.S. military and financial support for Israel’s genocide in Gaza, efforts to annex the West Bank, and military attacks against seven other countries in the Middle East. And the sanctions may be less consequential than the unprecedented attack on academic freedom by punishing universities for speech critical of Israel.

What the sanctions do, though, is open up an entirely new front for the Trump administration’s global attack on civil society around the world — all in defense of Israel.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2223423623_f3b0ab-e1757969892748.jpg?fit=4000%2C4000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-09-16 11:58:00.147158

Since 2014, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has operated a secretive program in which ICE agents train civilian volunteers in the operation of firearms, surveillance of immigrants, and use of lethal force against others.

ICE describes its courses, called Citizens Academies, as a way to educate civilians “intrigued by the Enforcement and Removal Operations Unit mission.” That unit’s mission, according to ICE’s website, is the “arrest and removal of aliens.”

Volunteers also participate in simulations of drug busts, executions of warrants, surveillance of immigrants, and detentions, some of which feature violent or shoot-to-kill maneuvers taught in Citizens Academies by ICE agents. ICE has planned or conducted multi-week Citizens Academies in over two dozen U.S. cities and had planned at least 30 courses in 2020.

The scope and details of Citizens Academies were not known until October 2024, when ICE produced documents in response to litigation filed by Organized Communities Against Deportations (OCAD) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). For the first time, agency documents detail ICE’s decade-long initiative to engage civilians in surveillance, detention, and weapons training.

Over 6 to 10 weeks, groups of about 20 civilians participate in Citizens Academies, meeting for 2 to 4 hours weekly, and up to 8 hours for firearm trainings. Civilian participants are instructed by federal agents from ICE’s two enforcement offices, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), sometimes in cooperation with local law enforcement.

ICE’s website lists the Academies as outreach programs designed to strengthen ties with local leaders and to promote community cooperation by teaching participants about HSI’s offices, operations, and “how to partner with [ICE-HSI] to improve the safety and security of our local communities.”

At Citizens Academies, participants conduct “mock investigations, learn defense tactics and even participated in mock surveillance,” according to HSI Executive Associate Director Derek Brenner. Invitations sent by ICE to Chicagoans in 2020 advertised “scenario-based training” that included “defensive tactics, firearms familiarization, and targeted arrests,” all centered on interactions with immigrants.

Participants in one Kansas City Citizens Academy spent their second and third weeks on live weapons fire and on what agents call a “takedown night.” Live-fire scenarios appear integral to Citizens Academy agendas, and ammunition is included in the cost of the course.

In Kansas City, internal ICE emails show that HSI agents prepared a 3-hour “room clearing instruction” activity with scenarios that placed civilian participants in the role of ICE agents or local officers entering a “shoot house” to arrest suspects for drug trafficking and firearm possession. Two of the four simulated arrests on HSI’s agenda are tagged with the instruction “This is a SHOOT scenario no other outcome should happen.”

Congressmembers Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Robin Kelley (D-Ill.) of the House Judiciary Committee wrote to ICE’s Acting Director in 2020 requesting information on Citizen Academy participants’ use of real or simulated firearms. ICE did not publicly respond to the legislators, but Congress’s request for basic information—How many Academies are there? Where have Academies been held? On what criteria does ICE select participants?—highlights how little was known about Citizens Academies outside of ICE-HSI before the 2024 FOIA lawsuit.

According to an internal memo, the ICE-HSI Citizen Academy program was first launched as a pilot in 2014 in Puerto Rico and expanded to ICE field offices during the first Trump Administration. OCAD noted that ICE hosted many Citizens Academies in sanctuary cities in cooperation with local law enforcement, including in several cities with policies “limiting information-sharing [by local police] with ICE in certain circumstances.”

Citizens Academies are neither schools nor academic programs, though ICE refers to past participants as “graduates,” and ICE agents present volunteers with certificates at “special ceremonies.”

But Citizens Academies are not open to all citizens. ICE has advertised that HSI and ERO Citizens Academies are open to community “stakeholders,” but they are usually not open to the public at large. Rather, ICE is strategic about whom it selects to invite, relying on existing relationships with news media and businesses to determine whom it invites to apply.

A memo prepared by HSI’s Executive Associate Director in 2020 or 2021 states that Citizens Academies are designed to counter “current negative opinion” toward ICE “fueled by harmful headlines or political views.” ICE views Citizens Academies as “critical and instrumental in changing that narrative and improving community relations,” according to the memo.

A 2022 “Communications Plan” lists the types of people ICE prioritized for recruitment: “Media, Hill, Academic leaders, Business/community leaders, Prosecutors and local and state law enforcement, Local citizens, Non-governmental organizations.” One Academy in Austin invited Texas Governor Greg Abbott to give a keynote speech to the graduating stakeholders, among whom were reporters from ABC and NPR, a community liaison from Austin’s police department, and three congressional staffers, according to an ICE email.

Although participants’ information is partially redacted in ICE documents, OCAD noted that employees at major American banks comprised a significant portion of Citizen Academy attendees, along with several legislative staffers at the state and national level. Victims advocates, criminal justice professors, local journalists, and religious leaders have also participated in Citizens Academies.

Among the documents released in October 2024 are training slideshows used in Citizen Academies, which include instruction on the two highest levels of force taught to ICE agents: hard techniques and deadly force.

So-called “hard techniques” include take-downs and riot baton strikes. ICE instructs participants using detailed maps showing where to strike someone with a baton or weapon in “vital and vulnerable striking areas.”

One ICE-HSI slideshow instructs participants on the legal standards for law enforcement officers’ use of lethal force, such as when they may fire at fleeing suspects or moving vehicles. In another slideshow, ICE-HSI includes instructions for civilian participants to yell “‘Police, drop the gun,’ while drawing and firing on the target,” as justification for using deadly force.

In 2020, ICE spokesperson Nicole Alberico told Newsweek that “ICE is not training anyone to do immigration enforcement” and that Citizens Academies “show the community what this training [for federal law enforcement officers] looks like.”

Many non-profit and community organizations have questioned the public benefit of Citizens Academies. Genia Blaser, hotline director at the Immigrant Defense Project, stated that ICE was “recruiting people who could incite vigilante violence in communities.” Congressmembers Jamie Raskin and Robin Kelley wrote that “role-playing exercises—complete with simulated firefights—are of dubious public benefit.”

Worries over vigilantism against immigrants has risen in recent years, especially along the Mexico–U.S. border, where armed civilian groups who claim to collaborate with police and immigration agents also film themselves “conducting patrols…issue orders, and detain and even point guns at migrants.” In 2024, Arizona lawmakers attempted to expand the state’s “castle doctrine” to allow property owners to use or threaten deadly force against trespassers anywhere on their farmland, and not just their home or yard. Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed the bill, stating that it valued “property over human life and incentivizes vigilantism.”

Months into the second Trump Administration, ICE officers have rounded up and deported tens of thousands non-citizens and U.S. citizens without presenting identification or warrants. ICE agents’ conduct during many arrests—plainclothes agents swarm a suspect, then pull them into an unmarked vehicle—makes it easier for civilians to kidnap or otherwise abuse people by impersonating ICE agents.

Civilians impersonating ICE have proliferated in 2025, with prominent cases in South Carolina, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Washington. The Democratic Women’s Caucus wrote to DHS and ICE about a spike in ICE impersonators attacking women, citing several reports of men in ICE gear using threats of violence or deportation to assault and sexually assault women. The Congresswomen argue that ICE protocols excusing agents from showing official badges and photo identification endangers law enforcement legitimacy and citizens, also noting that “fake ICE jackets became a ‘best seller’ on Amazon in February of this year.”

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons defended the use of masks to protect ICE agents and their families, citing death threats and harassments towards agents while emphasizing the agency’s singular focus on deportations in line with President Trump’s policy goals.

Ramirez's green card application had been improved prior to his detention, according to a letter written by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reviewed by Chicago Sun-Times.

Why It Matters

Immigration enforcement has been a key focus of the Trump administration. On President Donald Trump's first day of his second term, he signed 10 executive orders and proclamations related to immigration. During the administration's first 100 days, ICE reported that it arrested 66,463 undocumented immigrants and removed 65,682.

What To Know

Sergio Ramirez and his wife, Kristina Ramirez, were near the U.S.-Canada border on May 29 when they realized they were going the wrong way and turned around, Chicago Sun-Times reported. The husband and wife were pulled over, searched and questioned by federal agents, the outlet reported.

Sergio told the outlet that he was detained for three months before deciding to self-deport after receiving advice from his lawyer.

Kristina, a U.S. citizen who was born in Illinois, told the outlet that she was detained for three days. She said she showed her driver's license, but DHS and ICE officers still questioned her about where her parents were born and accused her of being ""illegal.""

A CBP spokesperson previously told Newsweek that ""the assertions Mrs. Ramirez was held by CBP for 3 days are a bold face lie.""

""CBP has no indication Mrs. Ramirez was held for 3 days. Her and her husband were referred to secondary for not having the proper U.S. travel documents on May 31,"" the spokesperson said.

Sergio told Chicago Sun-Times that he did not have any criminal record.

""My husband has a legit Social Security number and his work permit. I'm an American citizen, and we have all our documents. Who's thinking that, 'Oh my God, they're going to take us?'"" Kristina said.

The Department of Homeland Security told the outlet, ""Being married to a U.S. citizen, or any pending application for a visa, does NOT shield an illegal alien from removal proceedings. All of his claims will be heard by an immigration judge. The Trump administration is not going to ignore the rule of law.""

What People Are Saying

A CBP spokesperson, in previous comments to Newsweek: ""After inspection and questioning, CBP determined Mr. Ramirez is removable from the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act and was turned over to ICE. Mrs. Ramirez was subsequently admitted into the U.S. on June 1.""

Sergio Ramirez, in comments to Chicago Sun-Times: ""There's a lot of people that came to the United States to work and better their lives, and not everybody's the same. There's some people that are bad, but not all of them. We still have a lot of good people out there.""

Kristina Ramirez, in comments to Chicago Sun-Times: ""My greatest fear already happened. My greatest fear was that he self-deported.""

What Happens Next

Kristina Ramirez told the Chicago Sun-Times that she planned to travel to Mexico to reunite with her husband and explore whether he could return to the U.S. legally or if they would remain in Mexico.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2722871/us-customs-border-protection.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 10:56:23.426143

09/15/2025 — WHAT WE’VE HEARD TODAY:

The TRiiBE is collaborating with indie investigative newsroom Unraveled Press and Chicago alt-weekly Chicago Reader to publish reports about the increased enforcement and presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agents. Due to the rapid and sporadic nature of federal agent activity in the Chicagoland area, we’re working together to confirm and publish reports.

As of 3:45 p.m. today, federal agents have been spotted across the Chicagoland area. Federal agents have arrested people in southwest suburb Joliet, according to Chicago Reader news editor Shawn Mulcahy.

There’s also been activity in northwest suburb Elgin and suburban West Chicago. Illinois State Sen. Karina Villa (D- 25th District) went live on Facebook, alerting people about ICE activity in West Chicago this morning.

According to Elgin Rapid Response, which posted an activity recap for today, twelve people were detained from a residence in West Chicago this morning around 6:30 a.m. One video posted to Bluesky this morning shows agents breaking a person’s car window in West Chicago before handcuffing them.

Last week, Unraveled Press reported that U.S. Immigration Enforcement Agents (ICE) shot and killed 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González in the northwest suburb of Franklin Park during a traffic stop.

Though many local media outlets quoted the statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), claiming Villegas González dragged an ICE officer during his attempt to flee arrest, Unraveled published video accounts that show Villegas González driving away from the officers instead of towards them.

Bystanders who are interested in sending in video of federal agent activity can send it to newsrooms collecting footage using this link.

The escalated ICE activity in and around Chicago is part of “Operation Midway Blitz.” The plan was announced by the Department of Homeland Security last Monday, targeting “illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois.”

The Berwyn-Cicero Rapid Response Network, one of many groups across the city and state, posted multiple updates to its Instagram page of ICE sightings in Cicero this morning. The posts include the make and model of the alleged ICE vehicles, along with license plate numbers and a hotline number to report ICE activity at 855-435-7693.

A post this afternoon from Bluesky user, The People’s Fabric, shows an ICE branded Dodge Charger in the west suburb of Broadview, where the ICE processing facility is located and people were reportedly “snatched” by ICE agents this morning.

“The City of Waukegan has confirmed reports of ongoing operations by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) within the city. You are encouraged to know your rights and be aware of misinformation. Inform yourself through trusted sources,” reads the statement.

“As a reminder, officers with the Waukegan Police Department will not conceal their identity and will continue to be clearly identifiable while on duty, wearing official uniforms with badges. In accordance with the Illinois TRUST Act, the Waukegan Police Department will not participate in federal immigration enforcement, as the act prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from assisting the federal government with civil immigration enforcement,” the statement read.

García,,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ice-seeks-deport-daca-recipient-100000897.html,"EL PASO — In early August, Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago had arrived at the local airport to catch a flight to Austin.
Since that Aug. 3 airport confrontation, Santiago has been held in a detention center as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement works to deport her.
Since her arrest, there have been demonstrations in Phoenix, El Paso, Chicago and Boston — places where she has worked with immigrant rights organizations — demanding that ICE release her.

A court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 23 before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone in El Paso.","EL PASO — In early August, Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago had arrived at the local airport to catch a flight to Austin. But after passing through the security checkpoint, two Border Patrol agents approached Santiago, a 28-year-old immigrant from Mexico, asked for her identification and questioned how she obtained a work authorization card.

Santiago, who came to the U.S. at 8 and is legally in the U.S. through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, insisted on having a lawyer present, according to a cell phone video she recorded that was later publicly released.

The agents told her to follow them to a room and turn off her phone.

Since that Aug. 3 airport confrontation, Santiago has been held in a detention center as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement works to deport her. Since her arrest, there have been demonstrations in Phoenix, El Paso, Chicago and Boston — places where she has worked with immigrant rights organizations — demanding that ICE release her.

An immigration judge ruled last week that Santiago can’t be deported because she has permission to live in the U.S. through DACA, an Obama administration program that has given many undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children work permits and temporary protection from deportation.

“This decision is a victory, but the fight is not over until Xochitl is free,” said Desiree Miller, Santiago’s spouse. “Our family and community have suffered every single day since she was taken. Now that the judge threw out her case, she should not spend another night in detention. We need her home now.”

Still, ICE lawyers said they would appeal the judge’s ruling and will keep her in an ICE detention center in El Paso, according to Norma Islas, Santiago’s immigration lawyer.

It’s unclear why Border Patrol agents approached Santiago, but under federal law, immigration agents have the right to question and search people without a warrant within 100 miles of an international border.

“The victories that we have gotten thus far are important but they’re just the beginning of the fight,” Islas said during a demonstration Wednesday afternoon in front of the El Paso detention facility, where about 30 people waved signs calling for Santiago’s release. “If we’re successful on the merits of this case, it can help other (DACA recipients) from being detained.

Santiago was born in Oaxaca, Mexico, and is Zapotec, an Indigenous group. Her parents brought her and her brother to Florida, where her parents worked as migrant farmer workers. The children learned Spanish and English when they attended school.

In 2012, Santiago applied and received DACA and has renewed her two-year work permit six times.

She became an immigrant rights advocate, first in Florida then Boston before moving to El Paso nearly six years ago. She also worked taking care of a small community farm, where she met Miller.

For years, DACA recipients felt relatively safe from deportation. It was meant as temporary protection from deportation for young immigrants without a criminal record until Congress could approve legislation that would create a permanent solution. Thirteen years after its creation, Congress has not approved such legislation and the Trump administration has prioritized cracking down on undocumented immigrants this year.

The administration has said it is targeting the “worst of the worst” undocumented immigrants, highlighting the arrest of those convicted of rape, pedophila or other violent crimes. But government data shows that the vast majority of the more than 70,000 immigrants detained as of August don’t have a criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonprofit that collects and analyzes federal government data.

The Trump administration has also tried to dismantle DACA, which it has called illegal. So far, federal courts have kept the program in place for current DACA enrollees.

Still, U.S. Department of Homeland Security press secretary Tricia McLaughlin said people who “claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals are not automatically protected from deportations.” She also described Santiago as a “criminal illegal alien” who was arrested in Arizona on suspicion of trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia in 2020. In the same statement, McLaughlin encouraged DACA recipients to self-deport.

But Graham County Attorney L. Scott Bennett, the Arizona prosecutor whose office reviewed the case in 2021, said his office didn’t prosecute Santiago because of “insufficient information.”

Now, Santiago’s legal team has asked a different federal judge to order ICE to release Santiago from custody. A court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 23 before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone in El Paso. Cardone also ordered the Trump administration not to transfer Santiago out of El Paso.

“Constitutional protections generally apply to all people within the jurisdiction of the United States regardless of immigration or citizenship status,” Cardone wrote in her order.

“Simply put, if Santiago is removed from the country, she may never be able to return,” Cardone wrote, adding that if the Trump administration has evidence that can justify her deportation, it can present them in a hearing.

Santiago’s brother, José, said that because his sister is involved in the immigrant rights movement, she knew what to expect in an immigrant detention center and knew that it could be a long fight to get released.

“She's very aware of what the situation she's in, knows what she wants to do,” he said.

Miller, who talks to Santiago by phone every morning, said it’s been difficult having her wife detained.

“There's no reason for them to keep holding her in there. There was no reason for them to detain her in the first place.”

Midterm elections, held two years into a presidential term, usually flip House control from the president’s party to the opposition. It happened in 2022 under Biden, in 2018 under Trump’s first term, in 2010 under Obama, and in 2006 under George W. Bush’s second term.

Facing a potentially similar result next year in 2026, Trump encouraged Texas to redraw its districts with new maps projected to net Republicans up to five additional seats. For context, Republicans currently control the U.S. House by only five seats nationally.

Texas’s move sparked an arms race to respond in kind, among both red and blue states. California, Illinois, and Maryland are now considering mid-decade redistricting on the Democratic side; Florida, Missouri, and Ohio on the Republican side.

Context: what is mid-decade redistricting?

Each U.S. House district is supposed to contain an approximately equal number of residents, currently around 761 thousand. But populations in these districts gradually change: births, deaths, people moving in, people moving out.

To keep the numbers equal over time, states usually redraw their district boundaries once per decade, after a Census. The Census occurs in years ending with 0, such as 2010 and 2020. So those new lines go into effect during years ending with 2, such as 2012 and 2022. Anything after that, such as for next year’s 2026 election, is considered “mid-decade.”

10 states actually ban mid-decade redistricting in their state constitutions, comprising red, blue, and swing states alike: Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.

But it’s not banned at the federal level. Should it be?

What the bills do

Two bills in Congress would do just that. The two main proposals this summer were introduced by Texas Democrats in opposition to that state’s Republican plan, and by a California Republican in opposition to that state’s Democratic plan.

Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX33) introduced the former, titled the Anti-Rigging Act, on July 10. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA3) introduced the latter, numbered H.R. 4358, without an official title, on August 5.

The bills’ sponsors have not coordinated their legislation.

Both bills contain provisions making an exception for mid-decade redistricting if a state does so to comply with either the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act of 1965, if mandated by a federal court. For example, in 2023, the Supreme Court nixed Alabama’s map for violating the Voting Rights Act—a rare 2020s Supreme Court ruling considered good for Democrats.

What supporters say

Congress’s lead Democrat and lead Republican on this issue both argue that mid-decade redistricting changes the rules of the game for pure partisan gain, when it should only be done for neutral reasons.

“This move by Gov. Abbott does Trump’s bidding, not for any legitimate constitutional purpose as they claim, but to attempt to win an election before the first ballot has been cast,” lead Democrat Rep. Veasey said in a press release. “It is cynical, racist, and with clear political intent. This bill would ensure it could never happen again.”

“Gavin Newsom is trying to subvert the will of voters,” lead Republican Rep. Kiley said in a separate press release. “Fortunately, Congress has the ability to protect California voters using its authority under the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This will also stop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.”

(The Constitution’s Elections Clause allows Congress to set parameters for the “times” and “manner” of congressional elections in the states.)

What opponents say

The most prominent Republican and Democratic governors on this issue both argue that states are within their rights to maximize partisan political advantage—and that current times call for it.

The new congressional districts “better reflect the actual votes of Texans,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said in a press release upon passage of the state-level One Big Beautiful Map Act. “While Democrats shirked their duty, in futility, and ran away to other states, Republicans stayed the course, stayed at work, and stayed true to Texas.”

“California will not sit idle as Trump and his Republican lapdogs shred our country’s democracy before our very eyes,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a separate press release upon introducing the state-level Election Rigging Response Act. “This moment calls for urgency and action—that is what we are putting before voters this November, a chance to fight back against his anti-American ways.”

Odds of passage

So far, the Democratic congressional bill has attracted nine cosponsors, all Democrats from Texas. No Democrat outside of Texas has yet cosponsored it.

Two Democrats from Texas haven’t signed on, either: Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-TX20) and Henry Cuellar (D-TX28).

The Republican congressional bill has not yet attracted any cosponsors, likely because such a move would be considered too “anti-Trump” within the party. Not even any of the other eight California House Republicans have signed on.

Both bills await a potential vote in the House Judiciary Committee, unlikely under Republican control.

Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY17) has publicly come out against mid-decade redistricting, in opposition to his home state New York’s Democratic plan, but has neither cosponsored the existing Republican bill nor introduced his own such bill as of this writing.

Take New York City's Charter Revision Commission. Despite acknowledging that a million New Yorkers identify as independent, so cannot vote in the primary, they punted in July, declining to send an open-primary proposition to the November ballot. The excuse? Supporters hadn't reached a ""clear consensus"" on either the problem or the remedy.

Reformers had pinned their hopes on 2024, believing this would be the year voters finally flung open those gateways through some combination of Open-primary, Ranked-choice, or Top-X general elections (let’s call them ORT).

Alas, these efforts hit a wall. Eleven ORT proposals in nine states were on the November 5th ballot. Every single one lost.

Why? Independents and third parties don’t just want to be heard; they want a seat at the table in the room where decisions are made. They want their views rewarded. They want true representation.

Elections, at their core, are about redistributing political power. And clearly, ORT struggles to sell a polarized and skeptical public on its benefits.

RCV and Open Primaries/Top-X, despite their vocal proponents, are burdened with a litany of well-documented flaws, like exhausted ballots, strategic voting, complexity, and perverse outcomes. Linking them together on a single vote, as we just witnessed, only diminishes their combined prospects.

Why else did ORT fail at the polls? Logically, many independents understand their third-choice ranked ballot might tip the scales towards an acceptable, if uninspiring, candidate. They might even take intellectual pridein playing kingmaker.

However, RCV falls short on both the emotional and utilitarian litmus tests.

Did the eventual winner make explicit policy commitments to independents for their support– commitments they'll honor in office? Or were independents taken for granted, a default vote in the ORT system? Were third-party candidates even listed on the general election Top-X ballot? If not, a third party feels erased from history.

For a major party member, the situation is more favorable. Backing the winner brings tangible emotional and political benefits, reinforcing their social group's standing in both primary and general elections. But in ORT elections, where your leading candidate is squeezed off the ballot, you feel marginalized and demeaned.

Negotiated Consensus: A Different Approach

Voting method experimentation stretches back millennia, and while history may not repeat itself, it often rhymes. So, is there a better alternative waiting to be unearthed from the archives that might be attractive to the sidelined forty percent?

In 1885, Charles Dodgson—yes, the mathematician and author of Alice in Wonderland—grappled with precisely this challenge after discovering issues with a new preferential voting system. His remarkable suggestion? To ""club"" and trade votes. It’s a proposal I’ve expanded upon and call “Negotiated Consensus.”

Under Negotiated Consensus, all major candidates are listed on the primary and general election ballots. Voters cast a single vote for the nominee they enthusiastically endorse and trust as their proxy. If no candidate secures a simple majority, aspirants negotiate among themselves (and in consultation with their supporters) for policy concessions, redistributing (or “clubbing”) their proxy votes until a majority winner emerges. If a clean majority can't be negotiated, the race defaults to a top-two runoff (details can be found in the original article).

The public debate and the inherent tension of a plurality election highlight the critical role small parties and independents play as ""kingmakers."" Trading votes for policy concessions ensures the winner’s administration is more representative than in a plurality election or RCV, all the while sidestepping ORT's pathologies. Indeed, drawing two-party gerrymandered districts may backfire when independents shift the balance of power.

By marrying the clarity of a single-choice ballot with the accountability of public coalition-building, NC can succeed where RCV and non-partisan primaries stumbled. It promises to give independents and third parties the influence and spotlight they’ve been seeking—and in the process, revitalize majority rule itself.

The Georgia facility, operated by Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution, saw 475 of its workers arrested on allegations that they were in the U.S. illegally, or without the proper work permits, with hundreds of detained South Koreans sent home Thursday.

The raid was part of a broader deportation drive by the Trump administration, which the White House has described as central to fulfilling U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign promises. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser, has pushed for 3,000 arrests a day.

Amid backlash and concerns over how the raid could disrupt efforts to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. — a move called reshoring or onshoring — Trump, in a post on Truth Social Monday, stressed that foreign workers are ""welcome"" in the country.

Trump said that he wants foreign companies building complex products, machines, and various other ""things"" to bring skilled employees to train the domestic workforce, though he emphasized that these foreign workers are expected to return home eventually.

""If we didn't do this, all of that massive Investment will never come in the first place... I don't want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies,"" Trump said.

Besides Washington's reconciliatory statements, Landau also said in a post on X that the U.S. State Department ""will ensure that [the South Koreans] have the necessary and proper visas to comply with our laws.""

South Korean state media reported that Washington has agreed to establish a new ""visa working group"" for the country, with discussions said to include Seoul's desire for a separate U.S. visa quota for its workers.

Currently, the U.S. allows employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in ""specialty occupations"" under its H-1B visa program, but the system is highly selective due to an annual cap and a lottery system.

A South Korean presidential spokesperson also told local media on Monday that Seoul is conducting a more thorough review to determine whether any human rights violations had occurred during U.S. immigration enforcement at the Georgia battery plant.

U.S. government officials said that hundreds of the workers detained at the facility had been staying in the country illegally.

Experts have told CNBC that the immigration actions — the single largest enforcement operation in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's history — could lead to other foreign businesses reassessing their workforces in the U.S.

LG Energy Solution told CNBC last week that the commencement of the Georgia EV battery plant had been postponed from 2025 to 2026. However, the company claimed that the decision was not related to the recent incident but rather to external factors, including overall market conditions.

“The court does not reach this conclusion lightly,” Judge Chutkan wrote in her 16-page ruling.","A federal judge in Washington excoriated the Trump administration on Monday for what she described as its disregard of court-ordered protections for migrants it had deported to Ghana, even as she declined to rule on their behalf, citing a lack of jurisdiction.

The judge called out a “cavalier acceptance” that they may face torture and persecution in their home countries, as several are set for deportation again. One of the migrants had said in a sworn statement that he had been beaten and tortured by police officers and soldiers in his home county of Nigeria, and had been told that if they ever saw him again, they would kill him.

But Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the Federal District Court in Washington ruled late Monday that she could not prevent those migrants from being sent to their home countries because they had already been sent to Ghana — and thus out of her legal purview.

The decision was a victory for the Trump administration and the most recent sign of how recent Supreme Court rulings have paved the way for elements of President Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

The five plaintiffs in the case, identified by their initials for fear of persecution in their home counties, are citizens of Nigeria and Gambia. One man, known in the filing as K.S., has already been deported by Ghana to Gambia, where he is in hiding. K.S. is bisexual, and Gambia criminalizes relationships between men with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

The other four plaintiffs were still in Ghana as of early Tuesday, and have been told by officials there that their deportations were imminent.

“The court does not reach this conclusion lightly,” Judge Chutkan wrote in her 16-page ruling. But, she added, despite being “alarmed and dismayed,” her “hands are tied.”

The ruling brought an end to a frantic legal battle that began on Friday and lasted through the weekend.

Lawyers representing the five migrants had sued in federal court, accusing the Trump administration of using an agreement with Ghana to accept deported migrants to “do their dirty work” and send them onward to their home countries, despite orders from immigration judges who had determined that those migrants were more likely than not to face persecution, torture or death if returned.

Judge Chutkan appeared to largely agree with that assessment, saying in an emergency hearing on Saturday that “I have not been shy about saying that I think this is a very suspicious scheme.” But, she added, the Supreme Court had blocked a lower court decision in a similar case earlier this year, and told the plaintiffs’ lawyers that “there’s no point in getting decisions from me that are immediately going to be stayed.”

The Trump administration has brokered deals with several African nations, Rwanda, Uganda, Eswatini and — most recently — Ghana, to accept deported migrants, many of whom have no connection to those countries. Administration officials, under pressure from President Trump to carry out his promised mass deportation operation, have moved swiftly on these so-called third-country deportations.

The Supreme Court has broadly allowed the government to deport migrants to countries other than their own, and had paused a federal judge’s ruling that said the migrants must first be given a chance to show that they would be at risk of torture.

Justice Department lawyers conceded in arguments that it appeared Ghana had violated the migrants’ legal protections, but argued that the U.S. government was powerless to tell Ghana what it can do with migrants once immigration authorities had delivered them into Ghanaian custody — an argument the Trump administration had previously used in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.

“The United States is not saying that this is OK,” Elianis N. Pérez, a Justice Department lawyer, said during the hearing. “What the United States is saying is that the United States does not have the power to tell Ghana what to do.”

In sworn statements submitted to the court, the migrants said that they were told by U.S. and Ghanaian officials that they would all be sent to their home countries after arriving in Ghana — despite informing them of their protective orders.

The migrants also described abysmal conditions both during their initial deportations from the United States, and at a remote detention facility known as Dema Camp, at an undisclosed location in Ghana.

On Sept. 5, the migrants were awakened late at night, shackled and put on a military cargo plane without being allowed to notify family or legal counsel, and, in at least one case, without identification documents. They claim that some of them were placed in straitjackets for up to 16 hours during the flight, and one of the plaintiffs in the case, D.A., claimed that he now has difficulty walking because his straitjacket was secured so tightly.

D.A., a citizen of Nigeria, was a member of the People’s Democratic Party, one of the main political parties in the country. In the sworn statement, D.A. said that he had been a target of violent attacks in his home country. First, he was beaten by members of a rival party, the All Progressives Congress, he said. Months later, he was tortured by the military and police officers.

“They tortured me and kept me locked in a dog cage for three days,” D.A. said, adding that after letting him go, “they told me they would kill me if they ever saw me again.”

“After this incident I had to leave Nigeria to save my life,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15dc-ghana-deport-fgck/15dc-ghana-deport-fgck-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 03:56:58.931810

He refused to follow law enforcements commands and drove his car at law enforcement officers. One of the ICE officers was hit by the car and dragged a significant distance. Fearing for his own life, the officer fired his weapon.”

But the CCTV footage that has emerged does not show Villegas-Gonzalez’s car driving at or hitting law enforcement officers. In the footage, two officers stand on either side of Villegas-Gonzalez’ vehicle as he reverses away from the officers. One of the officers appears to hold onto the window frame on the driver's side, moving backward with the vehicle, and then forward as the vehicle drives out of frame of the CCTV camera. It is unclear why the ICE officer moves with the vehicle or whether he is being dragged.

Two other videos have emerged showing two officers in flak jackets with “Police” written on the back pulling Villegas-Gonzalez out of his car roughly 20 meters from where he was initially stopped and providing him with medical care. His death was confirmed by the Mexican embassy later that day.

In other words, Justice Kavanaugh doesn’t ask at all how overinclusive ICE’s race-based (at least in part) policy might be.","Last week’s emergency-docket decision by the Supreme Court in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo to lift a preliminary injunction entered by a federal district judge in Los Angeles against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials has caused understandable consternation on the part of civil rights groups and immigration-rights activists, among others. The district court had enjoined ICE agents from over-relying on an individual’s skin color, Spanish language use, occupation, and physical location in deciding whether to detain that person for investigation of the person’s immigration status. The case was brought by (among others) several individuals, some of whom are U.S. citizens, who were detained by ICE officials allegedly on the exclusive basis of a combination of the four factors identified above. The plaintiffs argued that the Fourth Amendment’s requirements that government have individualized reasonable suspicion or probable cause of a person’s wrongdoing before that person can be seized was being violated by ICE policy that made use of these factors. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (which declined to disturb the preliminary injunction) explained:

The district court ordered that. . . defendants were not permitted [within the Central District of California, which includes seven counties, from Orange County to San Louis Obispo County and Los Angeles County to Riverside County] to rely solely, alone or in combination, on the following factors to form reasonable suspicion for a detentive stop: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; presence at a particular location [such as an agricultural site]; the type of work one does [such as day labor].

The Supreme Court, with the three Democrat-appointed Justices dissenting, granted the federal government’s request to stay (or block) the district court order’s implementation, pending further litigation of the case on the merits. What that means in practice is that ICE agents within the capacious Central District of California remain free to make use of the factors at issue in the case, including “apparent race or ethnicity,” in making detentive stops for immigration purposes. The Court did not issue an explanation that spoke for the majority, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh did write an opinion setting forth his reasons for concurring in the decision to grant the government’s application. While Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Jackson, our attention below will focus on Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s writing, which has received the bulk of analysts’ attention.

THE GOOD

What positive things can be said about Justice Kavanaugh’s explanation? Importantly, that he felt the need to explain at all. Of course we don’t know any of the other five Justices who voted to grant (and perhaps there was no single rationale that commanded a majority), but as Justice Sotomayor’s dissent powerfully observed, the Court’s unexplained intervention in Vasquez Perdomo is part of a troubling pattern in recent months by which significant, precedent-altering law is frequently being made without any meaningful justification that accounts for the votes of a majority of the Court. To his credit, Justice Kavanaugh is less guilty of this disturbing practice than are many of the other Justices whose votes are often similar to his own.

Second, Justice Kavanaugh does purport to place some limits on ICE’s ability to rely on race. As he puts the point: “to be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion.” But he quickly (and problematically, as we explain below) adds: “however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.” (citation omitted).

THE BAD

So much for the good. Unfortunately, the bad is somewhat more copious. For starters, he suggests that plaintiffs likely lack Article III standing and, on that ground, will probably lose their case. In reaching this conclusion he not only relies on, but inexplicably and implausibly extends, the highly criticized 1984 Los Angeles v. Lyons ruling. In Lyons, Adolph Lyons had been victimized by the Los Angeles Police Department’s (LAPD) use of a chokehold device he claimed violated the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. He sued the City of Los Angeles for damages and also for an injunction preventing the LAPD from unconstitutionally choking him again. (The chokeholds at issue in Lyons and other cases at this time were not child’s play; for example, 16 or so persons died from LAPD chokeholds between 1975 and 1982.) The U.S. Supreme Court held that while his damage claim presumably could go forward, his claim for an injunction was not justiciable because he was very unlikely to be subject to another chokehold, in part because even if he were to encounter police again in the near future the odds are low that he would “provoke the use of a chokehold by resisting arrest, attempting to escape, or threatening deadly force or serious bodily injury.” Lyons was bad law on its own facts, first because (as the Court seemed to concede) Lyons’s damage claim already established a “case or controversy” within the meaning of Article III of the Constitution, and so the question of his entitlement to an injunction should have been considered to be a matter of remedial discretion, not (as the Court suggested) constitutional authority. Moreover, because Lyons could have sought and obtained an injunction the instant before he was choked the first time had he been able to call a time-out and invoke a judge’s intervention then and there, that ripe-at-that-time claim for an injunction should not have become legally moot simply because of the practical reality that litigation takes time. Recognition of that practical reality is, after all, what drives the “capable of repetition yet evading review” exception to mootness the Court has explicitly recognized.

But however bad Lyons was (and it was bad and should not be relied upon, especially by a Court and a Justice for whom first principles are more important than stare decisis), it simply has no application to Vasquez Perdomo. As fellow Verdict columnist Mike Dorf put it on his blog:

As Justice Sotomayor . . . pointed out in dissent, unlike Lyons, whose future encounters with the police were unpredictable, the plaintiffs in Vasquez Perdomo had every reason to believe that they would encounter ICE agents repeatedly—given the ICE policy of targeting their workplaces [and ethnicities] for immigration enforcement raids.

This point seems so obvious (especially because the dissent made it too) that we are reluctant even to spend time echoing Mike, except that even smart legal minds (see Orin Kerr’s post, for example) seem to unquestioningly accept and endorse Justice Kavanaugh’s use of Lyons. We emphasize this point also because the error in Justice Kavanaugh’s extension of Lyons would mean that even if ICE had a policy of relying on race alone (which Justice Kavanaugh says is plainly impermissible) no one would have standing to sue for injunctive relief in that situation either.

There is also plenty of bad (or at least question-begging) in Justice Kavanaugh’s discussion of the merits. To be sure, Justice Kavanaugh explains correctly that reasonable suspicion is a lesser standard than probable cause, and that it is determined by considering the totality of the circumstances. In listing and evaluating those circumstances, however, he raises more questions than he resolves.

First, he never grapples with the fact that previous “reasonable suspicion” cases by the Court require more than statistical correlations and probabilities but some kind of “individualized” or “particularized” reasons for detaining an individual, even briefly. To be sure, the meaning of “individualized” can be arguable in some instances. For example, imagine that past police arrest records make clear that a particular street corner is a very common venue for certain kinds of criminal activity at certain times of the day; would stopping all of the individuals (a small number of racially diverse folks) at that locale at those times be unconstitutionally based on population-wide statistics or instead permissibly based on “individualized” assessment of that venue? Moreover, the Court’s own caselaw has so many implausible exceptions and deviations from the ostensible requirement of individualized suspicion (think airport and school metal detectors, random drug searches, sobriety checkpoints, administrative subpoenas of large groups of people, drug tests for transportation employees, etc.) that one has to wonder how seriously the Court takes its own doctrine, and whether the Court would, if pressed, create an “immigration” exception alongside all the others, given the difficulty of immigration enforcement. To be clear, we are not arguing that the results of any of these cases invoking exceptions are wrong—the Fourth Amendment, after all, speaks of overall “reasonable[ness]” and not of “individualized” suspicion, and one of us (Professor Amar) has been on record in favor of a move away from the Court’s arbitrary doctrinal boxes in favor of a more holistic reasonableness analysis. But if the Court is going to make that kind of move, it should not be in a shadow-docket case, and it certainly shouldn’t be without a robust explanation.

And even if the Court were to openly move away from individualized suspicions to focus on group statistical generalizations, it would have to do so much more carefully than Justice Kavanaugh does, especially where race is concerned. One key factor he identifies is the “extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area,” a number Justice Kavanaugh describes as 10 percent of the people in the region, or approximately 2 million illegal immigrants. Even assuming his statistics are valid, there is no evaluation of what percentage of Hispanic-looking and sounding men at day labor sites in Southern California are in the U.S. unlawfully. In other words, Justice Kavanaugh doesn’t ask at all how overinclusive ICE’s race-based (at least in part) policy might be. It is certainly possible that the “hit rate,” if you will, of undocumented persons among groups of Hispanic men near Home Depots is equal to or higher than the 10% baseline. But given the publicity over ICE raids (and the fear it has stirred among undocumented persons) that rate could also be much lower than 10%. The fact that Hispanics and Spanish-sounding folks make up such a large percentage of Angelinos and of day laborers means that there are many, many, Hispanic men working as day laborers in the region who are not in the U.S. unlawfully. Justice Kavanaugh never demands that the government (which has more information on these questions than do plaintiffs) demonstrate, empirically, that its targeting of persons and locations is sufficiently free of under- and over-inclusiveness to count as reasonable.

Justice Sotomayor’s dissent highlights these failures. Focusing on precedent she reminds us that “a set of facts cannot constitute reasonable suspicion if it describes[s] a very large category of presumably innocent’ people. . . . Never mind that nearly 47 percent of the Central District’s populations identifies as Hispanic or Latino . . . Never mind that over 37 percent of the population of Los Angeles County speaks Spanish at home. . . .”

Justice Sotomayor’s last point, about the prevalence of Spanish speakers, bears emphasis. Putting aside native Spanish speakers who might speak Spanish at home, California is home to over 750 Spanish immersion programs in its public education system. Every year the state is graduating thousands of students whose use of their achievements as bilingual speakers somehow marks them, under ICE’s policies, as suspicious and fuels the perception that they are unlawful immigrants.

There may be room for useful discussion on this issue, about just how large the category of innocents defined by a particular policy must be for the policy to be rejected as unreasonable. But there is simply no such discussion in Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence because a concern for detaining a significant number of innocent individuals for stops is never addressed.

Part of Justice Kavanaugh’s silence here is likely explained by the kind of limited detentions he appears to think are at issue. He repeatedly emphasizes what he views as a de minimis burden of stops on lawful immigrants or citizens: “Importantly, reasonable suspicion means only that immigrant officers may briefly stop the individual and inquire about immigration status. If the person is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter.”

But just how does Justice Kavanaugh envision an individual’s lawful presence in the U.S. is to be established such that she is free to go? If all detained individuals have to do is to assert that they are citizens or lawful immigrants, the encounter would indeed be brief, but also completely ineffectual from ICE’s perspective. And there is no reason to think that such bare assertions would be accepted. All the record evidence described in Justice Sotomayor’s dissent is to the contrary. If Justice Kavanaugh is licensing detentions based even in part on race, it is incumbent on him to show not only (as discussed above) that the enforcement gains are substantial enough to justify racial means, but also that the detentions he is willing to allow have to remain very minimal in duration and force. But he never says that; his suggestion that excessive force claims can be litigated not only ignores immunity doctrines but also fails to recognize that force might not rise to the level of excessive within the meaning of due process but can still be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, especially where race is being used as a sorting tool.

All of this leaves us to wonder whether all of us (or at least all of us who “look” Hispanic, speak Spanish, or speak English with an accent) must carry proof of legal status with us at all times? For citizens, does that require carrying a United States passport everywhere? (Note here that half of American citizens do not even have passports.) Must lawful immigrants carry alternative proof of legal status? If this evidence is at home or otherwise not immediately accessible, can the investigative detention continue until it is provided to the immigration officer’s satisfaction?

The failure of the concurrence to elaborate on what an investigative stop by immigration officials can entail contributes to Justice Kavanaugh’s one-sided discussion of the equities in this case. Having to establish citizenship through a passport or other documents is itself a burden. Further, if an individual’s workday is disrupted to respond satisfactorily to an immigration officer’s inquiries, he may lose pay because of lost time off the job. Employers may be reluctant to hire lawfully present Hispanic workers or those who speak Spanish out of a concern that their presence at the workplace may trigger ICE raids or that temporary detentions will interfere with the performance of job duties. On top of this, there is some stigma attached to being hauled off as an illegal immigrant, even if mistakenly. Onlookers who see workers taken away may not be there to see that they were later released. Indeed, one may argue that the very use of ethnicity and language as proxies for illegal status communicates the invidious message that most Hispanics are here illegally.

It may be that a fair balancing of the equities in this case, even taking into account the need for extra caution in making any race-based decision and the reality of what an investigative stop entails, would still result in a ruling favorable to the government. The effective enforcement of immigration laws is never going to be without cost and free from all externalities. But a persuasive account of such a fair balancing should involve a more focused attention on the competing interests than the concurrence provides.

The UGLY

Most importantly, one might have expected a judicial decision allowing government to take race and ethnicity into account (as well as language and accents which we consider to be factors tightly related to race and ethnicity) to say something about the depth of our core constitutional commitment to rejecting such considerations. This is a Court, after all, that recently held race cannot be a factor in college admissions, no matter how closely it correlates in a statistical sense with legitimate educational goals or the background or perspective of applicants. Even hunches based on professional experience about race are impermissible tools for lawyers in deciding which potential jurors to strike through preemptory challenges. The enforcement of immigration laws may require a limited exception to this commitment. But one would hope that our country’s historical and constitutional misuse of race should warrant some words of caution when describing the scope and operation of this exception. Remember, we are talking here not about the inclusion (in, say, an APB) of a person’s race in a witness-provided description of an individual suspect after a crime has been committed; we are talking about sweeping racial correlations (also known as generalizations) about (il)legitimate presence in a diverse and cosmopolitan community.

In reading Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence, we get the sense that consideration of racial correlations in reasonable suspicion analysis warrants no greater judicial attention than consideration of any other statistical factor. In other words, his concurrence reads as if an ICE policy based on race and occupation would be no different from one based on location and occupation. But legions of cases under equal protection (and how can constitutional equality not be a factor in reasonableness?) teach us that not all classifications or sorting tools should be viewed with similar skepticism. In this regard, the district court’s order itself was quite thoughtless in banning “any combination” of the four factors at issue; an ICE policy detaining every person seeking work outside a Home Depot (including a large number of Whites, Blacks, and Asians) is very different from the ICE policies actually being deployed. The Justices could perhaps have justifiably vacated the district court order on this, much narrower, ground, and avoided the ugly look of a Court that is rigidly color-blind, except when it’s not.",https://i0.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_300476858.jpg?quality=90&resize=426%2C350&strip=all&fit=1000%25&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-16 03:57:07.946335

For the most part, his administration has gloried in the many excesses of its mass-deportation program, apparently on the theory that aggressive enforcement tactics and even cruelty would help move things along as anyone not legally in the country would self-deport instead of finding themselves in a brutal ICE detention facility or an even more brutal rent-a-prison overseas.

But an immigration raid on September 4 at an EV battery plant in Georgia, which was supervised by the elite Homeland Security Investigations arm of ICE, has caused some real buyer’s remorse for the 47th president. The 475 arrests for immigration violations included 317 South Korean citizens sent to oversee the building of the plant, and their government was not at all happy with their treatment. The busts (mostly for visa overstays) disrupted U.S.–South Korean diplomatic relations, including sensitive negotiations over tariffs, and appear to have traumatized the workers involved, as the Los Angeles Times reported:

Throughout the day, people described federal agents taking cellphones from workers and putting them in long lines … Some workers hid for hours to avoid capture in air ducts or remote areas of the sprawling property. The Department of Justice said some hid in a nearby sewage pond.

Collectively, the detained South Koreans chose to go home even after they were offered a temporary respite from deportation. Indeed, the South Korean government is investigating the possibility that the raid violated international human-rights agreements. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau has “expressed deep regret” for the raid in a meeting with South Korean diplomats. And most remarkably, the president himself backtracked in a Sunday Truth Social post:

This was a very wordy way for Trump to admit that two of his biggest priorities are in conflict. The ultimate prize at the end of the rainbow for his Liberation Day tariff initiative is to push the world’s manufacturers into relocating facilities to the U.S. That isn’t going to happen if the people they send over to set up said facilities are being rounded up by ICE and put in cages. In retrospect, it’s rather surprising the administration didn’t foresee this problem and at least provide some coordination between their economic-policy folks and the zealous deporters of DHS and ICE. And you have to wonder if anyone on the immigration side of the policy table got chewed out for blowing up U.S.–South Korean relations, making other countries nervous, and forcing the president to semi-apologize. Are there limits to Stephen Miller’s power after all?

This isn’t just an embarrassment for the administration, to be clear. The EV-battery plant was very necessary for a Hyundai EV-manufacturing plant next door. Together these facilities represented the largest economic development project in Georgia history and the crown jewel of Brian Kemp’s governorship. To add insult to injury, DHS pressed Georgia state troopers into service during the battery-plant bust, presumably as part of routine state cooperation with federal immigration-enforcement efforts. Kemp, whose relationship with the president is famously fraught but recently peaceful, couldn’t have been happy. Beyond that, though, someone needs to make the Trump administration aware that attracting foreign direct investment is one of the favorite economic-development tools of virtually every Republican governor; for some, it’s all they know how to do, other than cutting taxes, to create wealth.

It will be fascinating to see if the incident puts a bit of a damper on the nativist strain of America First politics and policy and maybe keeps a few people out of ICE-detention hell.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9da/54c/d1051c652db1e0619d82cb7c127161d798-georgia-ICEraid.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 02:56:47.480274

The news of the deportation of these African nationals from the United States surfaced last week and prompted a lawsuit by American lawyers. They claim that Washington’s move was an attempt to circumvent its own immigration laws that prohibit returning certain people to countries where their well-being may be at risk.

On Monday, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, Ghana’s Minister of Government Communications, told the Associated Press that all 14 people – 13 Nigerians and one Gambian – “have since departed for their respective countries,” without specifying when exactly they were returned.

According to the lawyers, this is yet another example of how the Trump administration deported people and then distanced itself from the consequences. The case drew parallels with the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, in which the administration erroneously deported him to El Salvador despite a court order, and then claimed that his return was impossible.

The Trump administration, facing immigration proceedings in which for legal and procedural reasons some people cannot be sent back to their countries of origin, has increasingly sought to send them to third countries with which agreements have been made.

“It smells like fraud.”

– Lee Gelernt

Lawyers representing five of these African men filed suit on Friday, arguing that they have legitimate protections against removal due to fears of torture.

“What the United States knew that these individuals would be sent into serious danger despite an immigration judge’s order, and yet refused to act, is striking. It seems evident that the United States hatched a scheme to use third countries to bypass what the United States cannot do directly.”

– Lee Gelernt

On Saturday, a federal judge asked the government to describe in detail what exactly is being done so that Ghana does not send migrants to other countries in violation of U.S. court orders. The so-called third-country agreement, such as Ghana, is part of a broader immigration policy campaign aimed at deporting millions of people from the United States.

A Justice Department lawyer said that the judge hearing the case does not have the authority to control how another country treats the deported. It was also noted that the U.S. Supreme Court this summer ruled that the administration may continue sending immigrants to countries from which they do not originate, even if they have not yet had the opportunity to raise concerns about torture.

Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is part of the group of lawyers representing five of the men in the suit, said on Monday that the whole situation “smells like fraud.”

“We simply could not continue to endure the suffering of our West African compatriots,” said Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa during a briefing in Accra. “As long as the United States adheres to a strict understanding that we will only take West Africa, we will continue to adhere to this principle,” he added.

The Government of Nigeria said it was not informed about the deportation of its citizens to Ghana and that it had previously received Nigerians deported directly from the United States. “We do not reject Nigerians deported to Nigeria. The only thing we reject is the deportation of other citizens to Nigeria,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told AP.

The Government of The Gambia did not respond to requests for comment. None of the 14 deportees originated from Ghana, and five of the African migrants who filed suit had no ties to the country or did not name it as a potential removal country, according to the lawsuit.

Lawyers and activists note that the Trump administration appears to be turning to third countries with requests for deportations to bypass U.S. law in the areas of trade, immigration, and aid.

The resolution, which passed unanimously, comes less than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents refused to identify themselves while detaining a parent near Talbot Community School.
According to a letter to the community from Superintendent Ryan Scallon, the ICE agents refused to identify themselves and used unmarked vehicles.

The resolution, which passed unanimously, comes less than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents refused to identify themselves while detaining a parent near Talbot Community School.

The document singles out and denounces “the use of unmarked vehicles, masked agents and unidentifiable personnel in immigration enforcement activities within the city,” especially near “churches, schools and other public institutions.”

It also calls on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to “implement clear, uniform identification standards for all field agents,” including badges, marked vehicles and advance notice when operating “in or near local jursidictions.”

The resolution also directs the city’s Health & Human Services & Public Safety Committee to consider policies or agreements “that seek to prioritize transparency and public safety in immigration enforcement and uphold and protect the civil rights of our community members.”

ICE detained Denis Rivera Martinez, 42, around 8 a.m. Thursday on an access road near Talbot Community School. According to a letter to the community from Superintendent Ryan Scallon, the ICE agents refused to identify themselves and used unmarked vehicles.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email statement last week that Rivera Martinez, of Honduras, is in the country illegally.

Portland police spokesperson Brad Nadeau confirmed that Portland officers arrested Rivera Martinez, who is accused of Class D domestic violence assault, on Wednesday, one day before he was taken into ICE custody.

Rivera Martinez should have been immediately turned over to ICE when he was arrested, McLaughlin said, and the arrest had to be made “at large in the community because Portland authorities do not cooperate with ICE.”

Portland resident Joey Brunelle equated the federal immigration law enforcement agencies to President Donald Trump’s secret police.

“They show up in unmarked vehicles, they wear masks or refuse to identify themselves, they grab people, handcuff them and take them away and never state why they are being taken away, ” Brunelle told the council. “They’re secret police kidnapping our neighbors.”

Brunelle said, “This proclamation is a start,” but the council ought to take further action, such as educating the public on their rights and documenting and announcing detainments in the city.

Kerrie Dowdy, president of the Portland Education Association, warned “this will keep happening” at Portland schools and urged the council to pass the resolution.

“Our schools should be safe places where students can focus on learning and engaging with their peers instead of worrying that a classmate or a parent will get arrested on school grounds,” Dowdy said, later adding, “We cannot do this alone. We need help.”

School Board Chair Sarah Lentz said in a news conference Friday that the community is “reeling” from the arrest so close to the school. On Monday, she urged the council to pass the resolution.

“As stewards of these institutions that are so vital to our city, we always have another choice about what we can do to protect our city and to help make it thrive,” Lentz said. “The collective power in this room is capable of so much.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/20170921_CityHall_0191-1757540929.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 00:56:29.355142

On September 4, 2025, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), supported by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), conducted a raid at the $4.3 billion Hyundai-LG battery plant construction site near Savannah, Georgia. Authorities detained 475 people, of whom more than 300 were South Korean nationals. The facility is a joint project between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution.

Many of the detained South Koreans were reportedly engineers or equipment installers brought in under B-1 business visitor visas or visa waiver programs. Attorneys argue that their roles were short-term and specialized, not long-term. Video released by ICE shows some workers shackled at the wrists, ankles, and waists while being transported on buses.

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry confirmed it is investigating whether workers’ rights were violated, focusing on visa status, detention conditions, and access to counsel and interpreters. To mitigate long-term immigration consequences, Seoul arranged with US officials for the workers’ voluntary return on a chartered flight instead of formal deportation.

US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau expressed “deep regret” over the incident during bilateral talks in Seoul, according to a statement from the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

One central issue under review is visa authorization versus work authorization. Reports indicate that many of the detained workers had entered the US under short-term B-1 business visitor visas or through the visa waiver program. Questions have arisen as to whether these visas were improperly used for labor activities that legally require separate work permits.

South Korea’s government has emphasized the long-term reentry implications for those detained. By negotiating for the workers to depart voluntarily on a chartered flight, Seoul sought to avoid formal deportation orders that could have carried severe consequences for the workers’ future ability to re-enter the US.",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Hyundai_Motor_Manufacturing_Indonesia_HMMI_2023.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 20:56:36.038605

]” But Kavanaugh and other justices have already restricted how someone can succeed when suing federal agents over constitutional violations like the use of excessive force.
On September 10, State Senator Zellnor Myrie and Assemblymember Gabriella Romero introduced the New York Civil Rights Act, S8500/A9076.
It would create a private right to sue federal officials who deprive New Yorkers of their constitutional rights.
If passed, the laws would offer state court options that aren’t available federally, allowing compensatory damages, punitive damages, or attorney’s fees.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Democratic legislators are pursuing new state laws to let New Yorkers sue government officials who violate their constitutional rights. This comes in response to a September 8 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the ability of federal agents to enforce immigration law.

The bills could create a new legal pathway to seek justice in New York state courts, which the bills’ sponsors call necessary in light of SCOTUS actions to counter longstanding federal precedents and protections. Any official—federal, state, or local—who violates a suspect’s rights or freedoms while acting in their official role could be held accountable under the proposals.

The push follows the decision in “Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo” permitting federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to resume investigative detentions in Los Angeles. The ruling temporarily lifted a lower court order that had previously limited how ICE targets people.

The lower court had found a “mountain of evidence” that the agency or its officers were violating the Constitution. Ultimately, it told agents that they had to consider more than just a suspect’s race, ethnicity, language, or work history when planning stops or arrests. But in a partisan six to three decision, the conservative SCOTUS majority—including Justice Brett Kavanaugh—undid that requirement.

In a concurring opinion, Kavanaugh added that the Fourth Amendment bans federal agents from using excessive force, and that “remedies should be available in federal court” if they do. He said that in an area like Los Angeles, featuring lots of undocumented immigrants, several factors can establish “at least reasonable suspicion” for a stop. Kavanaugh also wrote, “to the extent that excessive force has been used, the Fourth Amendment prohibits such action[.]”

But Kavanaugh and other justices have already restricted how someone can succeed when suing federal agents over constitutional violations like the use of excessive force. The 1971 case “Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents” allowed lawsuits against federal officers for monetary damages under a Fourth Amendment violation, which is supposed to prevent unreasonable searches and seizures. But SCOTUS has limited this precedent to only three cases over the years, repeatedly declining to cover new contexts, so victims of constitutional violations find it difficult to pursue a legal remedy.

And the Federal Tort Claims Act is supposed to allow civil action against a government employee for a constitutional violation, too. Still, in 2002’s “Egbert v. Boule,” a U.S. citizen who sued a Border Patrol agent over excessive force on American soil. SCOTUS decided they lacked standing under Bivens.

Trying to close that gap, state Democrats introduced the new bills days after the SCOTUS decision. On September 10, State Senator Zellnor Myrie and Assemblymember Gabriella Romero introduced the New York Civil Rights Act, S8500/A9076. The law’s text explains that it is designed to “restore a meaningful avenue of accountability consistent with federal supremacy, state sovereignty, and the longstanding principle that rights must be paired with remedies.”

The bill lets state courts issue injunctions in such cases. That means they’d be able to order a government agency or official to stop performing certain actions or behaving in particular ways, depending on the specifics of the case—like, for example, targeting New Yorkers for immigration enforcement based on their use of a language besides English.

In a press release about the New York Civil Rights Act legislation, State Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris said, “We cannot leave New Yorkers defenseless to the Trump administration’s relentless assault on Americans’ civil rights.”

Two days later, State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Micah Lasher introduced a similar bill, S8504/A9092. It would create a private right to sue federal officials who deprive New Yorkers of their constitutional rights.

The new bills build on a past proposals introduced earlier in the year. For example, State Senator Robert Jackson and Assemblymember Pamela Hunter sponsored S176/A1402 in January, making government agencies pay for any judgments against an employee or for their legal liabilities under that law.

It targets qualified immunity, the shield protecting law enforcement and public officials from lawsuits “when they deprive the rights of New Yorkers.” The legal principle prevents civil lawsuits against those federal officials, officers, or agents unless their conduct violates a clearly established law or constitutional right that any reasonably well-trained officer would know. This defense makes it hard for a plaintiff to even bring a case against the feds, let alone win it.

If passed, the laws would offer state court options that aren’t available federally, allowing compensatory damages, punitive damages, or attorney’s fees. Both the older S176/A1402 and the more recent New York Civil Rights Act also let the New York Attorney General sue on behalf of someone whose rights were violated.

The SCOTUS decision is available below, including Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent. She wrote that the lower court had found that “a very large category of presumably innocent” people were impacted. “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” she wrote.

She also pointed out that SCOTUS lifting the injunction failed to a address that use of force issue, noting that agents jumped out of cars to chase and tackle alleged targets. Sotomayor said that the SCOTUS argument improperly shifts the burden of proof away from the government and onto citizens who are supposed to have the right to due process.

Sotomayor called the majority decision a “grave misuse of our emergency docket.” Here’s the decision:",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2025/06/justicekavanaugh_010725gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-15 21:57:34.092277

News of the West Africans’ deportation to Ghana emerged last week, sparking a lawsuit by US lawyers.
Lawyers say it’s another case of the Trump administration deporting people and then trying to distance itself from the repercussions.
“We just could not continue to take the suffering of our fellow West Africans,” the minister said of the rationale behind the government’s decision.
“For now, the strict understanding that we have with the Americans is that we are only going to take West Africans,” he added.","The government of Ghana said Monday that 14 West Africans deported to the country from the US have been sent to their home countries, places where lawyers representing some of the men say they face a risk of persecution or torture.

News of the West Africans’ deportation to Ghana emerged last week, sparking a lawsuit by US lawyers. They argue the move was an attempt by US authorities to evade their own immigration laws that prevent some of the men from being returned to countries where their well-being could be at risk.

On Monday, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, Ghana’s minister for government communications, told the Associated Press that all 14 men —13 Nigerians and one Gambian — “have since left for their home countries,” without saying when they were returned.

Lawyers say it’s another case of the Trump administration deporting people and then trying to distance itself from the repercussions. The case has drawn parallels to that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a court order prohibiting it, then argued it couldn’t get him back.

The Trump administration, faced with people in immigration proceedings who for legal and procedural reasons cannot be sent to their home countries, has increasingly been trying to send them to third countries with which the administration has created agreements.

Lawyers argue the men have legal protections

Lawyers representing five of the West African men filed a lawsuit Friday arguing that the men had legal protections preventing them from being sent home over concerns they’d be tortured or persecuted. The complaint, filed by lawyers for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said the men had been granted fear-based relief from being sent to their countries and asked the judge to immediately halt their deportations.

A federal judge Saturday asked the US government to detail what it was doing to ensure Ghana would not send the immigrants elsewhere in violation of US court orders. The administration’s agreements with so-called third countries like Ghana are part of a sweeping immigration crackdown seeking to deport millions of people from the United States.

A Department of Justice lawyer argued that the judge hearing the case had no power to control how another country treats deportees. The lawyer noted the US Supreme Court this summer ruled the administration could continue sending immigrants to countries they are not from, even if they hadn’t had a chance to raise fears of torture.

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who is part of a legal group representing the five men in the lawsuit, said Monday that the whole situation “reeks of a scam.”

“That the United States knew these individuals were going to be sent to grave danger despite an immigration judge order, and still refused to take any action is outrageous. It seems evident that the United States has concocted a scheme to use third countries to circumvent what the United States cannot do directly,” Gelernt said.

The lawsuit filed on behalf of some of the migrants said they were held in “straitjackets” for 16 hours on a flight to Ghana and detained for days in “squalid conditions” after they arrived there.

Ghana rejects accusation that it endorses Trump’s immigration policy

The opposition and activists in Ghana have criticized the decision to accept the third-country deportees. Opposition lawmakers said it raises “serious constitutional, sovereignty and foreign policy concerns which cannot be overlooked.”

At a press briefing in the capital of Accra, Ghana’s foreign minister, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, pushed back on criticism that the decision was an endorsement of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Ablakwa said Ghana did not receive any financial compensation from the US over the deportation.

“We just could not continue to take the suffering of our fellow West Africans,” the minister said of the rationale behind the government’s decision. “For now, the strict understanding that we have with the Americans is that we are only going to take West Africans,” he added.

Nigeria’s government said it was not briefed about its nationals being sent to Ghana and that previously it had received Nigerians deported directly from the US.

“We have not rejected Nigerians deported to Nigeria. What we have only rejected is deportation of other nationals into Nigeria,” Kimiebi Imomotimi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told AP.

The authorities in Gambia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

None of the 14 deportees were originally from Ghana, and the five West Africans who filed the lawsuit did not have ties with the country or designate it as a potential country of removal, according to the complaint.

Lawyers and activists have said the Trump administration appears to be making such deportation requests to the nations most affected by his policies on trade, migration and aid.

Ghana joined Eswatini, Rwanda and South Sudan as African countries that have received migrants from third countries who were deported from the US, an approach whose legality has been questioned by lawyers and human rights organizations.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25258548401834.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-15 18:56:48.447818

Federal law enforcement agencies and National Guard units from D.C. and seven states are continuing operations in the city.","President Trump on Monday threatened to once again federalize Washington’s police force, in what he suggested could come in response to the mayor’s stated refusal to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

Trump’s emergency order, which took over the local police force, expired last week. Hours before it elapsed, Mayor Muriel Bowser said that the city would not cooperate with Immigration Customs and Enforcement in its continued operations in the nation’s capital. Earlier, she had said the city would work with other federal agencies even after the emergency order expired.

In an early-morning social media post Monday, Trump said his intervention into D.C.’s law enforcement had improved crime in the city, a claim Bowser has backed up, though data show crime was already falling in Washington before the law enforcement surge began.

Trump said crime could increase if cooperation on immigration enforcement ceases, in which case he would “call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!”

The mayor’s office declined to comment.

The White House did not say if Trump would follow through on his threat. It also did not say whether the president had considered trying to extend his previous order that placed the city’s police force under federal control. The order was not renewed by Congress and lapsed last Thursday.

Bowser issued an order Sept. 2, setting up how the local police will continue working with the federal law enforcement agencies that continue working in the city. The order listed a number of federal agencies she anticipated working cooperatively with the MPD, the local police, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Secret Service, among other agencies. Absent was ICE.

Speaking Sept. 10 at a ribbon-cutting ceremony, the mayor said “immigration enforcement is not what MPD does,” referring to the local police department. She added that when the emergency order ends, “it won’t be what MPD does in the future.”

Data analyzed by the Associated Press during the emergency period showed that more than 40% of arrests were immigration related, highlighting that the Trump administration continued to advance its hard-line immigration policies as it sought to fight crime in the nation’s capital.

Federal law enforcement agencies and National Guard units from D.C. and seven states are continuing operations in the city.

Trump’s threat comes the same day that the House Committee on Rules is taking up several D.C.-related bills, including a proposal to lower the age at which juveniles can be tried to 14 from 16 for certain serious crimes, as well as restricting the district’s authority over its sentencing laws and its role in selecting judges.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a similar hearing last week.

On August 15, DC filed a federal lawsuit challenging Trump’s emergency order, arguing the Trump administration exceeded its legal authority and violated constitutional principles of local self-governance.
Despite her public criticism of ICE tactics, Bowser has been relatively cooperative with the Trump administration compared to other Democratic mayors.
The 30-day federal control period stipulated by Section 740 expired last week, but in early September, she issued an executive order establishing indefinite coordination between the city and most federal law enforcement agencies, though notably excluding ICE from the arrangement.
In his statement Monday, apparently triggered by Bowser’s exclusion of ICE from the order, Trump accused the mayor of refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement.","President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to declare a national emergency to maintain federal control over Washington, DC’s police force, escalating a legal battle with the city over his administration’s unprecedented takeover of local law enforcement.

On August 11, Trump asserted federal control over the DC Metropolitan Police Department by invoking Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act, which allows presidential control of local police during “special conditions of an emergency nature.” Notably, the president’s authority under Section 740 is limited to 30 days in the absence of a joint Congressional resolution permitting an extension.

On August 15, DC filed a federal lawsuit challenging Trump’s emergency order, arguing the Trump administration exceeded its legal authority and violated constitutional principles of local self-governance.

Later that month, on August 27, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a press conference that while she believed the increased law enforcement presence had helped reduce certain types of crime, she also felt the federal takeover had resulted in a breakdown in trust between police and the community. “We know having masked ICE agents in the community has not worked and National Guard from other states has not been an efficient use of those resources,” she said.

Despite her public criticism of ICE tactics, Bowser has been relatively cooperative with the Trump administration compared to other Democratic mayors. The 30-day federal control period stipulated by Section 740 expired last week, but in early September, she issued an executive order establishing indefinite coordination between the city and most federal law enforcement agencies, though notably excluding ICE from the arrangement.

In his statement Monday, apparently triggered by Bowser’s exclusion of ICE from the order, Trump accused the mayor of refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. He claimed his intervention has transformed DC from “one of the most dangerous and murder ridden cities in the [country], and even around the World, to one of the safest,” and warned that ending federal control would cause crime to “come roaring back.” He added, sic: “I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!

“We were clearly targeted for abuse by the Assistant Warden simply because of who we are.","September 15, 2025 – Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the ACLU of Louisiana, and the National Immigration Project today filed multiple complaints on behalf of one woman and three transgender people who were subjected to sexual abuse, harassment, forced labor, retaliation and denial of medical care at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center (SLIPC) in Basile, Louisiana. As outlined in four separate complaints under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and a civil rights complaint submitted to the Department of Homeland Security oversight bodies, including the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the four individuals were repeatedly abused by prison officers and ICE employees between 2023 to 2025. The complaints cite instances of sexual assault, forcible touching, groping, physical abuse, denial of seizure medication, and retaliatory solitary confinement.

The woman, a mother in her thirties named Jane* who suffers from diagnosed epilepsy, was detained in November 2023 and quickly targeted by the then-Assistant Warden of the facility. The warden began stalking her and harassing her with aggressive, inappropriate sexual comments. After months of this harassment, he escalated his attacks, cornering Jane in a warehouse where he forcibly groped her breasts and genitals. From February to May 2024, the warden regularly forced Jane to perform oral sex on him, threatening her life and her family if she refused.

Jane filed multiple Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) complaints, grievances, and verbally reported the abuse to ICE and medical staff at SLIPC. Her reports and pleas for help were systemically buried and ignored. Her seizures became more frequent and intense and her mental health rapidly declined. She was ultimately deported in January 2025.

“When I was in detention, the people who were supposed to be in charge took advantage of their power and used it to abuse me,” said Doe. “The Assistant Warden sexually abused me for months, threatened me and my family, and used his position to protect himself from any accountability. I begged the U.S. government to help me. I filed complaints and grievances. I told ICE officers and medical staff. But they did nothing. I want people to know what happened to me and what continues to happen to people detained in these facilities.”

The three transgender people, Kenia Campos-Flores, Monica Renteria-Gonzalez, and Mario Garcia-Valenzuela, were targeted by the same warden for an unsanctioned “night shift program” wherein they were required to do hard manual labor without any protective equipment. They received $1/day or $5/day to labor in unsafe conditions between the hours of 8pm and 6am. At one point, while stripping floors, the harsh chemicals burned through Renteria-Gonzalez’s fabric shoes and the skin of his feet. The Assistant Warden targeted these people on the basis of their transgender identities, stating “Aren’t you a man? Can’t you do manly work?”

Campos-Flores, Renteria-Gonzalez, and Garcia-Valenzuela were also subjected to sexual harassment and abuse from the Assistant Warden and other SLIPC officers, including repeated comments about their appearance and gender identity. In two separate instances, the Assistant Warden approached Renteria-Gonzalez from behind and forcibly placed his groin directly against Renteria-Gonzalez’s buttocks.

“Regardless of our immigration status, at the end of the day we are human beings and we still have rights and feelings and we still matter, even if we are detained,” said Renteria-Gonzalez. “We want to raise awareness of the fact that this type of abuse does happen inside these detention facilities. Our rights are being violated everyday. This is a privately run facility that profits from our suffering. They are using us to make a profit but denying us medical care, food, even the most basic things like proper clothes and mattresses.”

“Our families and people outside trust that we are cared for in here and taken care of, but the reality is that we are not,” said Garcia-Valenzuela. “Every day, the U.S. government is abusing people in its care. It is even harder on people who identify as transgender because we are singled out and discriminated against. This facility must be closed down. They are incapable of treating us like human beings. The American people need to know what is happening inside these facilities.”

“Everyone deserves to be treated equally and with dignity no matter where they come from, their gender identity, or their immigration status,” said Campos-Flores. “We were clearly targeted for abuse by the Assistant Warden simply because of who we are. Now, we seek accountability to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”

Like Jane, the people sought help by filing PREA complaints and grievances. Renteria-Gonzalez and Garcia-Valenzuela remain detained at SLIPC.

In response to this pattern of abuse, the participating organizations have called for SLIPC’s closure and the release of all detained individuals, as well as an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse and labor exploitation at the facility.

How many Guatemalan children in ORR custody have final orders of removal from an immigration judge?
How many have requested voluntary departure before an immigration judge, and/or had that request adjudicated?","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Representative Jamie Raskin (D-Md.-08), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, and Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.-07), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, demanded answers from the Trump Administration on their cruel efforts to unlawfully remove dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children from the United States in the middle of the night over Labor Day weekend.

In their letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the lawmakers demanded answers on the Administration’s compliance with due process and confidentiality obligations under asylum law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), and other statutory protections afforded to unaccompanied children by law. They also asked for copies of the agreement the Administration said they made with the government of Guatemala regarding these removals and requested copies of training requirements for officials who interact with children.

“We write in response to deeply disturbing allegations that the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attempted to unlawfully remove unaccompanied children (UACs) from the United States in the dead of night, during a holiday weekend,” wrote the lawmakers. “We are concerned that you violated these children’s due process and procedural rights, and in doing so, abandoned your legal obligation to safeguard the best interests of the children in your care.”

“UACs are among the most vulnerable children attempting to navigate our complex immigration system. They must trust in the government’s care, frequently having fled abuse, violence, and persecution abroad,” continued the lawmakers. “They are entitled to notice and due process under the Constitution, and the Trafficking Victims Protections Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) sets forth special procedures for the removal or voluntary departure of UACs to ensure they receive such process.”

The Trump Administration identified approximately 600 Guatemalan children living alone for removal, first notifying Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) staff on Friday night, August 29, to prepare children for deportation despite their ongoing immigration proceedings. Both attorneys and the children were shocked to learn for the first time that night that repatriations may occur. Late Saturday into Sunday morning, 76 Guatemalan children were put on planes for removal with no regard for their well-being or safety, as many children expressed immense fear of returning to Guatemala.

At 4:22 a.m. on Sunday, August 31, a federal judge issued an emergency temporary restraining order against the removals, but the Administration continued to place children onto planes until 10:30 a.m. Government officials did not respond to the judge’s requests to transmit the court order to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ORR staff amid their ongoing attempts to deport these unaccompanied children, which prompted the judge to call an emergency hearing at 12:30 p.m. the same day.

The TVPRA sets forth specific procedures for the removal or voluntary departure of unaccompanied children, generally affording them the opportunity to appear before an immigration judge before DHS can remove them. The Guatemalan children in question did not have this opportunity — likely violating the TVPRA — nor did the Administration explain to them why their immigration court cases were taken off the docket.

Many of these children and their families strongly objected to their return to Guatemala, and many had pending applications for asylum, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, or other protection. In fact, a majority of Guatemalan families contacted explicitly expressed that they did not request their children’s return, according to a recent report by a Guatemalan attorney general’s office. This report was then later substantiated by a Department of Justice attorney representing the government at a September 10 hearing, withdrawing the government’s previous statements in court claiming parents had requested that their children be returned. After the hearing, D.C. District Court Judge Timothy J. Kelly extended the preliminary injunction, blocking the Administration from removing the children until September 16.

“As the Ranking Members of the Committees and Subcommittees with primary jurisdiction over the TVPRA and the [Immigration and Nationality Act], it is our responsibility to conduct oversight over implementation of these laws, ensuring that HHS, ORR, DHS, and the immigration courts meet their legal and ethical obligations under the law with respect to the care and protection of unaccompanied children. This situation is alarming, unacceptable, and raises serious concerns as to whether you are meeting your basic obligations to act in the best interests of children in your care,” concluded the lawmakers.

The lawmakers demanded responses to a series of inquiries regarding the incident by September 29.

Earlier this year, Senator Padilla led seven Senators in sounding the alarm on troubling reports that ORR unlawfully granted expanded access to sensitive data on unaccompanied children and their sponsors to DHS’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Senators raised serious concerns that ICE could misuse this confidential information to enact mass deportations and detain immigrant families and demanded DHS Secretary Noem and HHS Secretary Kennedy immediately cease this misguided practice. In March, Padilla blasted the Trump Administration’s stop work order to organizations that provide legal services for unaccompanied children and demanded they protect Congressionally mandated legal representation for these children in the immigration system.

Full text of the letter is available here and below:

Dear Secretary Rubio, Attorney General Bondi, Secretary Kennedy, and Secretary Noem:

We write in response to deeply disturbing allegations that the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attempted to unlawfully remove unaccompanied children (UACs) from the United States in the dead of night, during a holiday weekend. We are concerned that you violated these children’s due process and procedural rights, and in doing so, abandoned your legal obligation to safeguard the best interests of the children in your care.

On the evening of Friday, August 29, staff at ORR shelters received notice to prepare children to depart the country, and attorneys for the children learned for the first time that their clients were facing return to Guatemala. In the wee hours of Sunday, August 31, the Trump administration put 76 Guatemalan children on planes bound for Guatemala. These planned removals came as a total surprise to the children and their attorneys, as many, if not all, of the children that DHS attempted to remove were properly participating in ongoing immigration court proceedings and requesting relief from removal because they did not want to, and in many cases feared, return to their home country. Even after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) at 4:22am, children continued to be transferred onto planes as late as 10:30am. Reports suggest that government officials did not respond to requests by the presiding federal judge to transmit the court’s order to your Departments to ensure compliance, even as officials worked through the night to rush these children out of the country.

UACs are among the most vulnerable children attempting to navigate our complex immigration system. They must trust in the government’s care, frequently having fled abuse, violence, and persecution abroad. They are entitled to notice and due process under the Constitution, and the Trafficking Victims Protections Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) sets forth special procedures for the removal or voluntary departure of UACs to ensure they receive such process. If DHS seeks to remove any UAC who is not from Mexico or Canada, it must place the child in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and wait until such child is issued a final order of removal or receives voluntary departure after an Immigration Judge adjudication. As noted above, many children slated for “repatriation” were in such proceedings and had not received a final order of removal or agreed to voluntary departure. Most received no explanation from the government as to why their cases were being dropped from immigration court dockets.

Multiple public reports indicate these actions were part of an orchestrated plan to remove hundreds of Guatemalan children without any regard for their best interests, wishes, or safety. Affidavits submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia indicate that many of the children on the planes expressed fear of returning to Guatemala and had pending applications for asylum, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, or other protection. According to a report by a Guatemalan attorney general’s office, and contrary to initial assertions by the Trump Administration, Guatemalan authorities were unable to contact the vast majority of the families of the children slated for return, and the majority of those who they did contact stated that they did not request their children’s return and, in fact, “expressed anger” at the prospect of their children being returned; some even described their contact with Guatemalan officials as “intimidating” and said they were told that they needed to take their children back. This report was then later substantiated by a Department of Justice attorney representing the government at a September 10th hearing, withdrawing the government’s previous statements in court. It also does not appear that children were screened for concerns related to abuse or neglect in their home country.

As the Ranking Members of the Committees and Subcommittees with primary jurisdiction over the TVPRA and the INA, it is our responsibility to conduct oversight over implementation of these laws, ensuring that HHS, ORR, DHS, and the immigration courts meet their legal and ethical obligations under the law with respect to the care and protection of unaccompanied children. This situation is alarming, unacceptable, and raises serious concerns as to whether you are meeting your basic obligations to act in the best interests of children in your care.

Accordingly, we ask the Departments to provide written responses to the inquiries below by no later than September 29, 2025:

1. What steps are DHS and ORR taking to meet their legal obligation to ensure that children from noncontiguous countries are given the proper opportunity to appear before an immigration judge if DHS seeks to remove that unaccompanied child from the United States?

2. What are the terms of agreement the Trump Administration made with the government of Guatemala to initiate these repatriations? Please share a copy of the agreement.

3. How many Guatemalan children in ORR custody have final orders of removal from an immigration judge? How many have requested voluntary departure before an immigration judge, and/or had that request adjudicated?

4. What are the training requirements for officials who interview or question children? Please provide a copy of training materials.

5. For children who have been granted voluntary departure or have a final removal order, how are the agencies ensuring that protocols are followed to ensure safe repatriation as required by law?

6. Under what authority are children who have pending asylum cases or other immigration benefits requests determined eligible for removal or repatriation?

7. How are the agencies ensuring compliance with confidentiality regulations under asylum law or other statutory confidentiality requirements that are applicable based on the type of application filed by the child, including ensuring that information included in asylum applications is not shared with the child’s country of origin?

We understand that responses to some of these questions may relate to ongoing litigation; however, the Supreme Court has held that legal proceedings do not limit the right of Congress to conduct its own investigations. You are obligated to produce the requested information.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. We look forward to receiving your responses in a timely manner.

By GARY FIELDS and CHRIS MEGERIAN Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to once again federalize Washington, D.C.’s police force, in what he suggested could come in response to the city’s mayor’s stated refusal to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

Trump’s emergency order, which took over the local police force, expired last week. Hours before it elapsed, Mayor Muriel Bowser said that the city would not cooperate with Immigration, Customs and Enforcement in their continued operations in the nation’s capital. Earlier, she had said the city would work with other federal agencies even after the emergency order expired.

In an early-morning social media post on Monday, Trump said his intervention into the D.C.’s law enforcement had improved crime in the city, a claim Bowser has backed up, though, data shows crime was already falling in Washington before the law enforcement surge began.

Trump said crime could increase if cooperation on immigration enforcement ceases, in which case he would “call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!”

The mayor’s office declined to comment.

The White House did not say if Trump would follow through on his threat. It also did not say whether the president had considered trying to extend his previous order that placed the city’s police force under federal control. The order was not renewed by Congress and lapsed September 11.

Bowser issued an order September 2, setting up how the local police will continue working with the federal law enforcement agencies that continue working in the city. The order listed a number of federal agencies she anticipated working cooperatively with the MPD, the local police, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Secret Service, among other agencies. Absent was ICE.

Speaking September 10 at a ribbon cutting ceremony, the mayor said “immigration enforcement is not what MPD does,” referring to the local police department. She added that when the emergency order ends, “it won’t be what MPD does in the future.”

Data analyzed by the Associated Press during the emergency period showed that more than 40% of arrests were immigration related, highlighting that the Trump administration continued to advance its hardline immigration policies as it sought to fight crime in the nation’s capital.

Federal law enforcement agencies and National Guard units from D.C. and seven states are continuing operations in the city.

Trump’s threat comes the same day that the House Committee on Rules is taking up several D.C.-related bills, including a proposal to lower the age at which juveniles can be tried to 14 from 16 for certain serious crimes, as well as restricting the district’s authority over its sentencing laws and its role in selecting judges.

News of the West Africans’ deportation to Ghana emerged last week, sparking a lawsuit by U.S. lawyers.
A U.S. federal judge Saturday asked the U.S. government to detail what it was doing to ensure Ghana would not send the immigrants elsewhere in violation of domestic U.S. court orders.
“We just could not continue to take the suffering of our fellow West Africans,” the minister said of the rationale behind the government’s decision.
“For now, the strict understanding that we have with the Americans is that we are only going to take West Africans,” he added.","ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — The government of Ghana said Monday a group of 14 West Africans deported to Ghana from the U.S. has been sent to their home countries, places where lawyers representing some of the men say they face a risk of persecution or torture.

News of the West Africans’ deportation to Ghana emerged last week, sparking a lawsuit by U.S. lawyers. They argue the move was an attempt by U.S. authorities to evade their own immigration laws that prevent some of the men from being returned to countries where their well-being could be at risk.

On Monday, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, Ghana’s minister for government communications, told the Associated Press that all fourteen – 13 Nigerians and one Gambian – “have since left for their home countries,” without saying when they were returned.

Lawyers say it’s another case of the Trump administration deporting people and then trying to distance itself from the repercussions. The case has drawn parallels to that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a court order prohibiting it, then argued it couldn’t get him back.

The Trump administration, faced with people in immigration proceedings who for legal and procedural reasons cannot be sent back to their home countries, has increasingly been trying to send them to third countries with which the administration has created agreements to take deportees.

Lawyers argue the men have legal protections

Lawyers representing five of the West African men filed a lawsuit last Friday arguing that the men, who’d been sent to Ghana along with another nine people, had legal protections preventing them from being sent home over concerns they’d be tortured or persecuted. The complaint, filed by lawyers for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said the men had been granted fear-based relief from being sent to their countries and asked the judge to immediately halt their deportations.

A U.S. federal judge Saturday asked the U.S. government to detail what it was doing to ensure Ghana would not send the immigrants elsewhere in violation of domestic U.S. court orders. The administration’s agreements with so-called third countries like Ghana are part of a sweeping immigration crackdown seeking to deport millions of people from the United States.

A Department of Justice lawyer argued that the judge hearing the case had no power to control how another country treats deportees. The lawyer noted the U.S. Supreme Court this summer ruled that the administration could continue sending immigrants to countries they are not from, even if they hadn’t had a chance to raise fears of torture.

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who is part of a legal group representing the five men in the lawsuit, said Monday that the whole situation “reeks of a scam.”

“That the United States knew these individuals were going to be sent to grave danger despite an immigration judge order, and still refused to take any action is outrageous. It seems evident that the United States has concocted a scheme to use third countries to circumvent what the United States cannot do directly,” said Gelernt.

The lawsuit filed on behalf of some of the migrants said they were held in “straitjackets” for 16 hours on a flight to Ghana and detained for days in “squalid conditions” after they arrived there.

Ghana rejects accusation that it endorses Trump’s immigration policy

The opposition and activists in Ghana have criticized the decision to accept the third-country deportees. Opposition lawmakers said it raises “serious constitutional, sovereignty and foreign policy concerns which cannot be overlooked.”

At a press briefing in the capital of Accra, Ghana’s Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa pushed back on criticism that the decision was an endorsement of U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Ablakwa said Ghana did not receive any financial compensation from the U.S. over the deportation.

“We just could not continue to take the suffering of our fellow West Africans,” the minister said of the rationale behind the government’s decision. “For now, the strict understanding that we have with the Americans is that we are only going to take West Africans,” he added.

Nigeria’s government said it was not briefed about its nationals being sent to Ghana and that previously it had received Nigerians deported directly from the U.S.

“We have not rejected Nigerians deported to Nigeria. What we have only rejected is deportation of other nationals into Nigeria,” Kimebi Imomotimi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told AP.

The authorities in Gambia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

None of the 14 deportees were originally from Ghana and the five West Africans who filed the lawsuit did not have ties with the country or designate it as a potential country of removal, according to the complaint.

Lawyers and activists have said the Trump administration appears to be making such deportation requests to the nations most affected by his policies on trade, migration and aid.

Ghana joined Eswatini, Rwanda and South Sudan as African countries that have received migrants from third countries who were deported from the U.S., an approach whose legality has been questioned by lawyers and human rights organizations.

Head Start preschool programs will continue to welcome all immigrant children regardless of legal status, federal judges ruled in two separate lawsuits this week, blocking efforts by the Trump administration to restrict enrollment.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced in July that Head Start and other programs it administered would be limited to U.S. citizens and certain immigrants with legal status, upending decades where the rule has been not to check the immigration status of the participating babies and children too young for preschool.

The Illinois Head Start association filed a lawsuit, along with other Head Start and parent advocate groups and the American Civil Liberties Union, to halt the changes to the rules announced by the Trump administration. Another suit was filed by Illinois and 19 other states with Democratic attorneys general, plus the District of Columbia.

This week in both cases, Republican-appointed federal judges agreed to block the changes.

The rulings come amid this week’s escalation of federal enforcement against immigrants in Chicago, stemming from Trump campaign promises to deport anyone without legal status.

On Wednesday, in the case filed by the attorneys general, U.S. District Court Judge Mary McElroy of Rhode Island halted the new rules while the lawsuit makes its way to trial.

“The Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly 30 years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start — at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the Government,” wrote McElroy, a Trump appointee, in her 60-page ruling. “The Court is skeptical of that.”

Then on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo Martinez of Washington ruled in favor of the Head Start advocates, issuing a nationwide injunction that prevents the proposed changes from taking effect.

Congress changed the rules of Head Start since its founding in 1965 several times but never included any immigration or citizenship requirements for Head Start eligibility, Martinez wrote in a 26-page ruling.

“The Directive imposes new obligations on Head Start agencies and strips away rights from immigrant families,” said Martinez, appointed to the federal bench by President George W. Bush. “Agencies must publish proposed rules and allow the public the opportunity to comment before promulgating substantive rules.”

On behalf of the Illinois Head Start Association and other plaintiffs, Allison Siebeneck, director of the Women’s and Reproductive Rights Project at the ACLU of Illinois, wrote in a statement that the ruling “protects essential early childhood education for families across the country. It also reaffirms that no president can bypass Congress or rewrite law by executive edict.”

An HHS spokeswoman said in an email the agency “disagrees with the court’s decisions and is evaluating next steps.”",https://ipmnewsroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/headstart-1024x576.webp,N,,2025-09-15 16:57:53.878541

MJ Enterprise and Spiffy entered into a franchise agreement to operate a Get Spiffy car service business. The franchise agreement contained a Maryland state-specific addendum signed by both parties. After facing several financial, logistical, and operational issues, MJ Enterprise ceased operations in 2023. After its closure, MJ Enterprise attempted to mediate its claims for deceptive business practices and, after failing to resolve the claims, sued Spiffy in Maryland federal court in November 2024. Spiffy moved to compel arbitration under the franchise agreement’s arbitration provision.

The court agreed that arbitration of some claims was required and stayed the entirety of the litigation until arbitration was complete. MJ Enterprise opposed Spiffy’s motion to compel arbitration, claiming that (i) the parties did not mutually assent to arbitration; (ii) the arbitration provision was unconscionable under state and federal law; and (iii) Spiffy waived its right to arbitrate the claims. The court first determined that the parties mutually assented to arbitration of certain claims, despite the parties’ execution of a Maryland state addendum prohibiting the waiver of MJ Enterprise’s right to file a lawsuit in Maryland bringing Maryland franchise law claims.

But the D.C. National Guard, which is under Trump's command, will remain in the District.
Go deeper: Scoop: D.C. mayor urged AG against raising tensions with Trump, suing over National Guard","President Trump overnight Monday threatened to once again seize the Washington, D.C., police department if it doesn't cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The big picture: Trump's previous emergency takeover of the city police department expired. Mayor Muriel Bowser has ordered city officials to cooperate with federal agencies, but her list notably did not mention ICE.

""Immigration enforcement is not what MPD does,"" Bowser said at a Wednesday news conference. ""And with the end of the emergency, it won't be what MPD does in the future.""

Driving the news: Trump wrote on Truth Social shortly after 1am. ET that Bowser ""has informed the Federal Government that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens.""

If that happens, he said, ""CRIME would come roaring back.""

The president continued, ""To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON'T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I'll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!""

Bowser's office did not immediately comment.

Catch up quick: Trump declared last month that he would seize control of district police and mobilize the National Guard to target what he had described as rampant lawlessness (despite a decrease in violent crime).

Under the city's Home Rule Act, the president can temporarily seize the Metropolitan Police Department for up to 30 days — or longer with congressional action.

But the D.C. National Guard, which is under Trump's command, will remain in the District. Some of those patrols are carrying weapons.

Between the lines: Trump's post, which accused Bowser of presiding over a ""violent criminal takeover of our Capital,"" is a sharp departure from the praise he gave her earlier this month for her cooperation with federal agencies.

Even in congratulating her and touting her popularity, he warned Bowser, ""don't go Woke on us.""

As Axios' Cuneyt Dil reported, Bowser has joined a number of leaders who have forged a frenemy-ship with the president — a big gambit for the leader of the deep-blue District, where a Washington Post poll last month found that about 8 in 10 residents opposed Trump's federalization.

Ten months later, he remains detained.",Stephanie Casanova,,,,,https://prismreports.org/2025/09/15/kamel-maklad-immigration-detention-withholding-of-removal/,"A Syrian man remains locked up at an immigration detention center in Eloy, Arizona, almost 10 months after a judge granted him deportation relief.
The man from El Salvador was granted withholding of removal in 2019 and lived in Maryland for years before being detained by ICE in March.
He is now being held at an immigration detention center in Virginia.
He’s been detained in the Eloy Immigration Detention Center, owned by CoreCivic, since then.
His cousins went through the same process he did, but they won their cases sooner and have since been released from detention, Maklad said.","A Syrian man remains locked up at an immigration detention center in Eloy, Arizona, almost 10 months after a judge granted him deportation relief.

Kamel Maklad had spent 14 months in detention before a federal immigration judge in November 2024 granted him “withholding of removal,” meaning he cannot be deported to Syria because he would likely be persecuted. In previous years, migrants who were granted withholding of removal were typically released from detention and waited in limbo on the outside for years, often receiving a work permit, immigration lawyers told Prism. But the current administration is changing course and detaining people even after they have won their case.

“Do I stay here my whole life?” Maklad asked in Spanish, during a phone call with Prism in July. “In Syria, at least I know I’m either dead or alive. But here, what am I doing?”

Maklad, 38, left Syria in 2011 as the civil war there began and lived for 10 years with legal status in Venezuela, where the U.S. is now threatening to deport him. In late August of this year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents told him that Venezuela had agreed to take him back and that if he didn’t accept the U.S. government’s proposal to leave, they would keep him in the Eloy detention center, he said.

Meanwhile, his application for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), filed in May 2024, is still pending. He said he doubts it will be granted.

“It’s not easy to make a decision in this situation,” Maklad told Prism. “I lost my health, I lost two years of my life … and for them, it’s like nothing happened.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a series of questions in time for publication about Maklad’s case or the department’s plans for withholding of removal cases.

An “anomaly” at any other time

Luis Campos, an immigration lawyer of more than 30 years who does not have any ties to Maklad’s case, said the case sounds very similar to that of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. The man from El Salvador was granted withholding of removal in 2019 and lived in Maryland for years before being detained by ICE in March. Sparking outrage across the country, Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador before being brought back to the U.S. three months later. He is now being held at an immigration detention center in Virginia.

Campos said that in past years, he would have considered a case like this to be likely an “anomaly.”

“In today’s times, given the current circumstances and state of affairs, I think we’re going to be seeing an increase of persons detained in similar circumstances because it reflects a broader trend,” Campos said. “That broader trend is to hold people until they capitulate and ultimately sign papers for them to be removed abroad.”

Legal battles

Maklad’s lawyer, Pattilyn Bermudez Solano, told Prism that she was drawn to his case after seeing that he won relief but was still detained. Bermudez Solano is helping Maklad reach out to Kuwait and other countries where he would prefer to be deported, to see if they’ll accept him. She is also representing him with his pending TPS application.

“I am concerned that ICE might want to send him to a country where he could be at risk or tortured,” Bermudez Solano said.

She mentioned a case earlier this year in which one of her clients suddenly stopped appearing in the ICE Online Detainee Locator System. ICE got the man’s case dismissed and processed him for expedited removal. They deported him to Mexico, near the Guatemalan border. She didn’t find out until days later, when he borrowed a stranger’s cellphone to call his partner, who informed Bermudez Solano, she said.

Campos said the U.S. is allowed to deport people to third countries, but immigrants can contest that order.

In deciding to keep Maklad detained, ICE officials need to provide a custody review and consideration of release 90 days into his detention with a reasonable explanation as to why they consider him a flight risk or a danger to society, Bermudez Solano said.

For a custody review, the ICE field office director considers the nature and seriousness of the person’s criminal convictions, other criminal history, and prior immigration violations, among other factors. September 2023 was the only time Maklad entered the U.S. illegally; he did not make any other attempts. He has no criminal history.

On March 25, 2025, ICE sent Maklad a letter, which he shared with Prism, saying that he poses “a danger to the community, to the safety of other persons, or to property.”

“Your illegal entry into the United States shows a disregard to laws and indicates that you are a flight risk,” ICE wrote as an additional reason for keeping him detained.

Stuck in prison, Maklad said he has lost 30 pounds in the last year. About 11 months ago, he started vomiting after every meal, sometimes throwing up blood along with his food, medical records viewed by Prism show. Maklad said that doctors have suggested stress might be a factor, after test results showed nothing wrong with his esophagus. He now eats in his room, away from the rest of the detainees, to spare them the image of his body rejecting food, he said.

Prism interviewed Maklad over a series of phone calls this summer and visited him in detention twice. Maklad sat in a visitation room behind a table with a small wooden divider, wearing a red, scrub-like outfit. His frame was thin. The top of his hair was darker and a couple of inches long, the sides a graying fade, matching his graying, trimmed beard. Around him, other men sat at their own tables, waiting to see their children, mothers, wives, sisters, or fathers.

Maklad talked fast, sounding desperate, frustrated, angry, and at times hopeless. He talked about his immigration case, his backstory, and his experiences in the detention center, including the injustices he and the other detainees experience daily.

Maklad told Prism that he left Syria because he was afraid of becoming a prisoner there, but now he’s a prisoner in the U.S.

“I don’t know where I am, where I’m going, or what my end is,” he said in Spanish. “I don’t know what I’m waiting for.”

Making the journey north

After Maklad first left Syria, he moved to Venezuela, where he found work and learned Spanish.

He visited Syria in 2018, after rebels burned down his and his family members’ homes and torched his car.

Maklad returned to Venezuela in early 2019 and found work again, but his visa expired in 2022. He applied to renew it, but the political crisis in Venezuela stalled the immigration process, he said. After police learned that he did not have legal status, they would threaten him often and expect bribes, he said.

Tired of the threats, Maklad started his journey north. He entered the U.S. in September 2023 at the Mexico-U.S. border in Arizona with a group of migrants—including some of his cousins—and led by migrant smugglers, he said.

After each migrant stepped through a widened part of the wrought iron border fence, they walked a short distance to a road where they were met by Border Patrol agents. Maklad turned himself in.

He’s been detained in the Eloy Immigration Detention Center, owned by CoreCivic, since then. His cousins went through the same process he did, but they won their cases sooner and have since been released from detention, Maklad said.

In January 2024, Maklad filed for asylum and withholding of removal. In early April, a judge denied his requests, but Maklad appealed that decision and was granted a new hearing.

In court, Maklad provided proof that he is wanted by Syrian police for not reporting for military service in 2020.

The court found that Maklad “established that his political opinion will be ‘a reason’ the Syrian government will target him for persecution.”

On Nov. 11, 2024, Judge William Mabry III granted Maklad’s request for withholding of removal and for protection under the Convention Against Torture. The standard of proof for withholding of removal is set higher than the standard for asylum.

“No respect for human rights”

Maklad said he is worried about what awaits him in Venezuela if he’s deported there. He’s worried he’ll struggle to find work and a place to live, as well as the money he would need to get a visa, an ID, and a work permit. He said he expects to be threatened and harassed like he was before deciding to come to the U.S.

He couldn’t return to Syria, his home country, because of ongoing threats to his safety. He left Venezuela due to police harassment. In the U.S., he hoped for peace in “a land of law.”

“But really, I was surprised, shocked,” Maklad said. “Here, there is no justice, no legality, no respect for human rights.”

“This decision is specifically about CHNV humanitarian parole, but it has significant implications for the other humanitarian parole programs at issue in the Svitlana litigation, such as Uniting for Ukraine and Operation Allies Welcome — jeopardizing the lawful status of hundreds of thousands more currently living and working in the US,” she added.

This ruling marks a pivotal juncture in immigration enforcement policy and is already generating deep legal, social, and political reverberations across California and the nation. This in-depth article explores the origin and context of these restrictions, analyzes the Supreme Court’s decision, presents the stakes for communities and law enforcement, and examines the broader implications for civil rights and immigration policy.

Background: Restrictions on Immigration Stops in Los Angeles

Los Angeles, with its diverse population and status as a gateway for immigrants, has historically been a flashpoint for tensions between federal immigration authorities, local law enforcement, and community advocates. Restrictions on immigration stops had been in place since the early 2020s, triggered by widely publicized incidents in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents mistakenly detained US citizens during sweep operations.

These rules limited where and when federal agents could conduct stops, introduced strict protocols for verifying legal status before detention, and required additional oversight and reporting on enforcement outcomes. Local officials and advocates cited these measures as necessary checks against racial profiling, wrongful detainment, and erosion of trust between immigrant communities and government agencies.

The Sweeps That Sparked Reform

The urgency for reform intensified after multiple well-documented incidents where US citizens—some of whom were born and raised in Los Angeles—were held for extended periods following ICE raids focused on undocumented immigrants. Mistaken detentions led to lawsuits, media scrutiny, and protests, prompting local and state leaders to seek intervention.

Key incidents included:

The 2021 “Boyle Heights Sweep,” in which three US citizens were detained for over 72 hours before their citizenship was confirmed

The 2022 case of a US Navy veteran mistakenly swept up and held for five days, resulting in significant public backlash

An analysis revealing that, over two years, at least 45 confirmed US citizens were detained by immigration officers in the LA metro area

These cases underscored flaws in verification protocols and sparked debates about due process, citizenship rights, and the scope of federal immigration enforcement powers.

Table: Documented Incidents of Mistaken Detention in LA

Supreme Court Case: Legal Arguments and Ruling

The Supreme Court’s decision arose from a challenge by federal immigration agencies, who argued that the LA restrictions interfered with federal authority and national security. The case centered on:

The constitutional scope of federal power over immigration enforcement versus municipal rights to regulate policing within city limits

Balancing due process protections and civil rights against counterterrorism and anti-trafficking imperatives

Whether local restrictions constituted “obstruction” of federal law

Federal officials contended that additional oversight and documentation requirements hampered timely response and risked letting dangerous individuals slip through. The opposing argument, advanced by civil rights groups, emphasized that faulty procedures had led to unconstitutional detentions and ongoing harm for US citizens and documented immigrants.

In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that:

Federal jurisdiction preempts local or state restrictions that “substantially interfere” with national immigration enforcement

Procedural guardrails can be implemented, but blanket bans or prior approvals on stops are unconstitutional

Due process for individuals detained must be protected, but verification is not required before every stop

Implications for Law Enforcement and Agency Practice

With these restrictions now lifted, federal agents operating in Los Angeles regain broad latitude to conduct stops and sweeps based on suspicion, prior intelligence, or other enforcement criteria. Key changes include:

Resumption of concentrated “sweep” operations in targeted neighborhoods

Reversal of mandates for immediate verification of citizenship before detention

Streamlined oversight, with documentation required but not as a prerequisite for detention

Local police agencies now anticipate increased coordination demands with federal authorities

Proponents argue these changes enhance national security and ensure efficient enforcement against undocumented immigration. Critics express concern about renewed risks of wrongful detention, community mistrust, and civil rights abuses.

Table: Comparison of Enforcement Protocols Before and After Ruling

Effects on Los Angeles Communities

The ruling’s impacts extend far beyond law enforcement operations, touching families, businesses, schools, and civic institutions. Some anticipated consequences include:

Heightened Anxiety: Immigrant communities, including mixed-status families, fear increased sweeps and the potential for mistaken detentions.

Public Backlash: Advocacy groups and civil liberties organizations are mobilizing to monitor enforcement and challenge wrongful detentions in court.

Community Trust: Long-term efforts to build police-community trust risk reversal as residents worry about profiling or being targeted by operations.

Many local leaders warn of “chilling effects” on reporting crime, public service usage, and civic participation, especially among the sizeable Latino, Asian, and African immigrant populations in LA.

Data: LA County Demographics and Immigration Status (2025 Estimates)

Legal and Political Fallout

The Supreme Court’s ruling sets a precedent with national reach:

Litigation: Civil rights groups plan aggressive legal challenges in individual cases, arguing for due process rights and damages for wrongful detention.

Legislative Response: California legislators are exploring new statutes requiring state-funded legal representation for all detained in immigration sweeps, regardless of status.

Political Debate: The ruling intensifies polarization over immigration reform, with advocates calling for congressional action to define “minimal verification procedures” federally.

Meanwhile, federal agencies are issuing new training guidance meant to reduce mistaken detentions, but critics question its effectiveness given recent history.

Table: Risks and Safeguards Post-Decision

Potential Paths Forward for LA and California

Experts and stakeholders point to several possible strategies to mitigate harm and encourage fair practices going forward:

Community-Based Oversight: Formation of neighborhood “rapid response” teams to monitor sweeps and support affected families

Legal Education: Expanded outreach programs informing residents of their rights if stopped or detained

Improved Data Systems: Investments in high-quality verification technology to minimize errors in citizenship or status checks

Policy Innovation: Continued push for local protections, such as “sanctuary city” measures and civil liability insurance for victims of wrongful detention

Future legislative sessions are likely to focus on checks and balances, balancing federal powers with robust safeguards against civil rights violations.

Lessons for National Immigration Policy

The LA case and the Supreme Court’s ruling underscore chronic deficiencies in national immigration enforcement, including:

Inadequate and error-prone databases for legal status checks

Lack of uniform standards for due process and notification

Gaps between federal and local law enforcement priorities

As other cities face similar challenges, calls are growing for comprehensive federal immigration reform that includes protections for citizens and mixed-status families.

Table: US Cities with Local Immigration Stop Restrictions (Pre-Ruling)

Broader Implications for Civil Rights

Civil liberties organizations have cautioned that the Supreme Court’s ruling could weaken essential protections amid a surge in aggressive immigration enforcement:

Increased scrutiny on racial profiling and wrongful detainment

Calls for independent monitors and transparency in federal enforcement databases

Importance of legal advocacy and public oversight in safeguarding rights

Constitutional scholars predict further judicial review as individuals and groups challenge specific actions under existing civil rights statutes.

Conclusion

The Supreme Court’s decision to lift restrictions on immigration stops in Los Angeles marks a watershed moment for federal-local relations, civil rights, and enforcement practices in America’s largest immigrant hub. While proponents argue it fortifies national security and rule of law, detractors predict increased harm to US citizens, compromised trust, and intensified legal struggle.

As Los Angeles and California confront the new enforcement landscape, the challenge is clear: how to balance effective immigration oversight with the urgent need to protect civil rights, public safety, and community cohesion in a diverse and ever-changing state.

Moving forward, vigilant public engagement, ongoing legislative innovation, and transparent law enforcement will be crucial if California hopes to prevent abuses and ensure justice for all residents—regardless of where they were born or what papers they carry.",https://calcoasttimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supreme-Court-lifts-restrictions-on-LA-immigration-stops-set-after-agents-swept-up-US-citizens.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 15:56:55.211325

This country has a long history of racial profiling in policing and immigration enforcement that the Supreme Court has played a role in enabling through cases like Whren v. United States, which allowed police to conduct, often racially motivated, pretextual traffic stops.

This decision also has implications beyond immigration, as it is a slippery slope from authorizing federal immigration enforcement to consider race and ethnicity in their stops in Los Angeles to race-based policing being normalized across the country.","On Monday, September 8th, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo overturned a federal district court ruling that barred immigration officials in Los Angeles from conducting roving patrols that targeted Latino communities without “reasonable suspicion.” The concurring opinion from Justice Kavanaugh states that “apparent ethnicity” can be a “relevant factor” for ICE to conduct immigration stops, along with “speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent,” location, and type of employment. Essentially, SCOTUS legalized the use of racial profiling in immigration raids.

This country has a long history of racial profiling in policing and immigration enforcement that the Supreme Court has played a role in enabling through cases like Whren v. United States, which allowed police to conduct, often racially motivated, pretextual traffic stops. This week’s decision also comes 2 years after the ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard banned race-conscious college admissions that were meant to promote equal educational and employment opportunity for groups that were historically underrepresented due to systemic discrimination, resulting in sharp declines in diversity on campuses, particularly impacting Black, Latino, and Indigenous students.

Institutional racism has been a rampant problem at the southern border for years, where U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s broad authority to operate regularly violates people’s civil and constitutional rights. The current administration’s dramatic expansion of immigration enforcement in the past 8 months has seen more than a 250% increase in daily arrests, masked agents abducting people off the streets, local law enforcement recruited to assist ICE, overcrowded detention centers with widespread illness and hunger, immigrants with no criminal record deported without due process to an El Salvador prison notorious for human rights violations, the targeting of immigrants in sanctuary cities and sensitive areas that were previously restricted like schools, churches, hospitals, and courthouses, and an executive order to end universal birthright citizenship.

As with all other crises, this harsh anti-immigrant campaign, aggravated by the Supreme Court decision, disproportionately harms women in immigrant communities, especially BIPOC, poor, and disabled women. Immigrant women, who make up 20% of early educators and 26% of direct care workers, are often pillars of their communities, yet are forced to live in fear while navigating a hostile immigration system that undermines their dignity, security, and livelihoods. Now that ICE can enter hospitals, immigrants are avoiding necessary medical care due to fears of being deported, including pregnant women and new mothers who may be dealing with acute issues, which doctors predict will lead to a rise in maternal mortality. Immigrant children’s health is also being impacted in multiple dimensions, even those who have American citizenship, due to being from mixed-status families.

This aggressive immigration crackdown has also been accompanied by an increase in gender-based and sexual violence. The most frequently reported issues in ICE detention are sexual assault against both adults and children, suicide attempts, and serious pregnancy complications, as women are denied access to reproductive healthcare, and a repealing of protections makes them more vulnerable to abusers who easily avoid accountability. Immigration officers in this new era are also masked, creating a new crisis of women being assaulted by individuals impersonating ICE agents.

All of these issues were pervasive even before the September 8th Supreme Court ruling, which will no doubt exacerbate them in a racially-targeted fashion. This decision also has implications beyond immigration, as it is a slippery slope from authorizing federal immigration enforcement to consider race and ethnicity in their stops in Los Angeles to race-based policing being normalized across the country. While the policy claims to be prioritizing public safety, the actual enforcement and effects appear to place cruelty and spectacle above security and effective immigration reform. It also opens the doors for further racialized harassment of immigrants in public spaces and the viewing of immigrant and Latino identities as inherently criminal, a view that many White Americans already hold.",https://feminist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nitish-meena-IFh4o-U-BGg-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 15:56:37.776307

Nichole Flores, a University of Virginia scholar of religion and public life, said confusion is compounded by disinformation about Catholic teaching.
Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez told the panel that Mass attendance in parts of his archdiocese has fallen sharply following high-profile raids.
“A lot of the priests are telling me… at least 30% of the people attending Mass are not coming anymore,” Gomez said.
The measure of the church in this moment, he suggested, will be whether it refuses to let fear replace fellowship.","WASHINGTON — From a stage at Georgetown University, under the banners of Catholic social teaching, a panel of bishops, nuns, and scholars offered a blunt assessment of the human toll of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown — and a plan to fight it in the pews, the courts, and the streets.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

“The dreams of immigrants are just collapsing,” said Washington Auxiliary Bishop Evelio Menjivar-Ayala, himself an immigrant from El Salvador who fled civil war as a young adult. He described a pastoral landscape transformed by fear: parents skipping work and Mass, children pulled from school or after-school programs because families “don’t want to risk” exposure to immigration agents. “What I’m seeing in people’s eyes is pain and a deep confusion,” he said. “Where do we go from here if we’re not welcome.”

The Sept. 11 forum, hosted by Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, showcased a widening religious front against mass deportations that Catholic leaders argue are tearing apart families, destabilizing parishes, and chilling participation in religious life. Speakers said they will press the administration and Congress on religious-liberty grounds to halt arrests in and around churches and schools, restore clear protections for “sensitive locations,” and rein in tactics they say violate both conscience and community safety.

Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski, who has ministered outside and inside the Florida detention site nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz,” accused the administration of “painting all immigrants as lawbreakers.”

“The reality is the law is breaking them,” Wenski said. “The law is inadequate to meet the needs of the nation. The law is antiquated, the law is ineffective and because of the ineffectiveness we have people living in this country for 20 years, 30 years, many with a legal work permit.” He recalled praying a rosary in the Everglades heat with the Knights on Bikes — a Knights of Columbus ministry — and, days later, celebrating Mass inside the facility. “Even in a very dehumanizing situation, prayer emphasizes their dignity. God has not forgotten them.”

That detention center is now the subject of fast-moving litigation. A federal district judge ordered it wound down by the end of October; on Sept. 4, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put that ruling on hold while the administration appeals — another reminder, church leaders said, that policy whiplash is battering families and those who minister to them.

Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, who chairs the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Committee on Migration, said the church intends to test the administration’s stated commitment to religious liberty. “It is interesting, since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of rights including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict,” he said. “We’re happy for the opportunity to dialogue on these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging.”

Those inconsistencies, panelists argued, begin with the rollback of the long-standing “sensitive locations” guidance — the policy that, absent exigent circumstances, kept immigration arrests away from schools, hospitals, and houses of worship. Ashley Feasley, a legal expert in residence at Catholic University of America’s Immigration Law and Policy Initiative, said the clearer Obama-era guardrails were rescinded in the first days of Trump’s second term and replaced with a murkier directive. “Within the first few days of the administration they rescinded the policy and put forth a policy that is much less clear,” she said, adding that bishops nationwide are reporting parishioners too afraid to receive the sacraments or even step onto church grounds.

Nichole Flores, a University of Virginia scholar of religion and public life, said confusion is compounded by disinformation about Catholic teaching. “There is really straightforward Catholic teaching on this matter and it is misconstrued, bent and folded in lots of ways that are convenient for various political interests,” she said. The church’s social doctrine, she added, holds both the right of nations to regulate borders and the moral duty to welcome and protect the vulnerable — and prudence must be applied to concrete policies, not abstractions.

On the ground, the fallout is measurable. Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez told the panel that Mass attendance in parts of his archdiocese has fallen sharply following high-profile raids. “A lot of the priests are telling me… at least 30% of the people attending Mass are not coming anymore,” Gomez said. Parish ministries that serve immigrant families have been disrupted; the archdiocese is directing legal and financial assistance to those detained or at risk of deportation.

The pushback is also ecumenical. A new report produced by the U.S. bishops in collaboration with the National Association of Evangelicals, World Relief, and the Center for the Study of Global Christianity estimates that more than 10 million Christian immigrants in the U.S. are vulnerable to deportation — including people with temporary protections that could be revoked. Nearly 7 million U.S.-citizen Christians live in households with someone at risk, the study says, concluding that one in twelve American Christians is either vulnerable themselves or lives with a family member who is. The authors stress that while deportation can be a tool of law enforcement, indiscriminate removals fracture congregations, destabilize communities, and contravene the biblical mandate to welcome the stranger.

“It’s not only destabilizing the life of the particular immigrant,” Menjivar said of current enforcement practices. “Whole families, businesses, the life of children, whole communities, neighborhoods” are affected — and so is public safety. If people fear that any contact with authorities could lead to deportation, he warned, they will stop reporting crimes or serving as witnesses. “This is not going to help to make our streets, our communities safer.”

Sister Norma Pimentel, who runs Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley’s respite center in McAllen, Texas, spoke of ministering in grim detention settings — and the humanity she sees on both sides of the razor wire. “I saw Border Patrol agents looking at us, and they, too, were moved and were crying,” she said. As she left one facility, an officer told her, “Thank you, sister, for helping us realize they’re human beings.”

Beyond public witness and pastoral care, Catholic leaders are adjusting their own institutional footprint. Earlier this year, the bishops ended a half-century of federal partnerships serving refugees and migrant children after an abrupt halt to funding by the administration — a “heartbreaking” move they said was forced by shifting policies and politics. In dioceses across the country, parishes are expanding “know your rights” trainings, building rapid-response legal networks, and organizing mutual aid for mixed-status families bracing for arrests.

Seitz framed the next steps plainly. “We don’t stop at praying,” he said. “Prayer moves us to action.” That means pressing to restore robust protections for worship and school grounds; pushing for laws that “rationalize and humanize” enforcement, in Wenski’s phrase; correcting misinformation about what the church teaches; and standing visibly with families in crisis.

Menjivar, the Salvadoran American bishop who still recognizes the fear he once felt as a new arrival, closed on a note of hope — and urgency. “For me, it’s very personal because I was a stranger and you welcomed me,” he said. The measure of the church in this moment, he suggested, will be whether it refuses to let fear replace fellowship. “Our communities are suffering,” he said. “We are called to be present.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5u9X!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6504cefb-a1c4-426b-a77d-05a234cdd0dc_750x422.jpeg",N,,2025-09-15 13:57:09.537215

NYSE to file lawsuits against building owners, general contractors and anyone else involved in a construction project who could plausibly be blamed for a worker’s injury.

A decade later, politics provided a huge boost to so-called Scaffold Lawsuits. Joseph Biden won the presidency and effectively opened the southern border to a flood of more than 8 million Latin immigrants. Tens of thousands of them wound up in New York, providing a ready supply of workers willing to sign their names to Section 240 complaints in exchange for a few thousand dollars in cash up front.

Lawsuits filed by Subin Associates, which specializes in construction injury litigation, surged 61% from 2018 to 2023. It filed 707 cases in New York courts in 2023, most of them involving plaintiffs with Latin names. Gorayeb & Associates, which says on its website it is “recognized within the Hispanic community as `The People’s Lawyers,’” saw a more modest 26% increase over the same period, also mostly naming Latino plaintiffs.

Section 240 was the ideal vehicle for plaintiff firms because New York judges had earlier determined the loosely worded law meant defendants had almost no way to fight a claim. Even if the plaintiff bore most of the blame for his accident, the defendant companies were liable.

Unique in the U.S., the law also allows plaintiffs to double-dip, collecting from the Workers’ Compensation system while pursing a potential multimillion-dollar claim in civil court.

Insurers who pay to defend and settle these cases soon picked up on the trend. Lawsuits insurers filed in state and federal court claim the increase in construction accidents wasn’t due to chance, but because plaintiff lawyers seized upon the presence of thousands of poorly educated, undocumented immigrants to file fraudulent injury suits and sent them to doctors willing to perform unnecessary surgeries to drive the value of the claim up.

As alleged in those lawsuits, a network of runners in the immigrant community, some of them connected to Latin gangs, recruited plaintiffs by promising them thousands of dollars up front if they’d go to a lawyer’s office and sign some papers. Those papers – typically in English, although many of the plaintiffs speak only Spanish – included a claim of injury as well as an agreement to borrow money against the value of the lawsuit at usurious interest rates of 50% a year or more (in New York, lawsuit loans aren’t subject to consumer lending rules).

Investigators found evidence of the scheme in plain sight. An insurance industry claims database identified a number of “hotspots,” or addresses where residents have filed hundreds of claims. One 67-unit building in New York has 300 claims including 11 filed by a single resident. Exo Insurance found 13 Subin clients were connected to a single apartment at 2011 Amsterdam Ave. in New York. One of them, Isaha Hernandez, sued the building owners themselves for a slip-and-fall.

Illustrating the central role medical records and financing play in these cases, Subin name partner Herbert Subin shares a patent covering software to track patient medical records with the owner of a finance firm that extends loans to doctors.

Subin and Gorayeb didn’t respond to requests for comment. In an editorial published earlier this year, Victoria Wickman, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, criticized insurers for “aggressive, defamatory legal filings aimed squarely at intimidating the injured from making valid claims.”

“If anything sounds like a coordinated effort, it’s the successive filings of these RICO actions,” Wickman wrote.

As in court systems across the country, litigation on this scale requires two parties to work: Lawyers and judges. New York’s trial judges are elected and are routinely asked to adapt the law to benefit plaintiff lawyers.

Lawyers attempt to tie most injuries to gravity to invoke the Scaffold Law. Judges must decide whether a heavy pipe or piece of wood falling over can be chalked up to gravity, or if gravity is to blame when a worker twists their ankle while descending stairs.

And insurance defense lawyers complain most New York judges refuse to allow defendants to obtain a plaintiff’s medical records from before a claimed accident to determine whether the injury predates the claim.

Speaking on condition of anonymity because he appears frequently before these same judges, a defense lawyer said: “How can you know what someone’s future pain and suffering will be due to an accident when you don’t know their prior condition?”

There are also vast differences in the value of a claim based on which court district it is brought in.

“I’m in Suffolk county – the same claim might be $50,000-$100,000 here, but in the Bronx that is a $700,000 claim,” said Jason Bartow, a broker who sells commercial insurance through his family’s brokerage in New York.

Ionian Insurance, in a lawsuit against Gorayeb and other alleged co-conspirators filed in state court in New York, says its outstanding liability, or pending claims, skyrocketed more than 700% between 2021 and 2023, mainly because of questionable construction claims. This increase contrasts with a steady decrease in reported workplace injuries in New York over the same time.

One Subin client filed three lawsuits and a workers’ compensation claim over the same alleged accident, even though an eyewitness testified they saw the plaintiff undo his safety harness and jump off a platform. Subin withdrew from the case after it was sued by Tradesman Insurance in 2024, but insurance executives say there are thousands more such lawsuits still working their way through New York courts.

“Most insurance companies are not staffed to deal with organized crime,” said Don Orlando, who heads an investigative group at Tradesman that includes former FBI, CIA and military intelligence officers.

Clearly someone at Subin was worried about the quality of the firm’s workplace-injury claims. Citing letters from insurance companies identifying “a pattern of fraud within the construction industry as to Scaffold Law cases,” Subin last year quietly withdrew as counsel in more than 200 lawsuits. In each case, the firm said it was withdrawing on the advice of an outside ethics expert, but declined to provide further details to the court.

At one hearing in January, an insurance lawyer sought in vain to get more information about exactly why Subin was pulling out of a workplace-injury case and whether it was because the client was referred by a well-known “referral source” or runner named Jorge Lupi. Subin’s lawyer would only say the information was protected by the attorney-client privilege.

“Otherwise known as keeping your distance,” quipped Judge Robert J. Caloras. He then ruled against any further disclosure.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS

While some firms, like Subin, have scaled back their construction-injury lawsuits, the immigrant community is still providing thousands of plaintiffs for routine slip-and-fall and auto accident cases. The business is so lucrative that Gorayeb found itself on the receiving end of a lawsuit by rival Ginarte Gonzalez & Winograd for swapping the Gorayeb name into Ginarte’s tagline on television ads: “ACCIDENTE DE CONSTRUCCIÓN, GINARTE ES LA SOLUCIÓN.”

“Members of the public, legal community, media, and most importantly, workers and prospective clients in the Spanish-speaking construction business, associate the tagline/mark exclusively with the Ginarte law firm and the excellent services provided by the firm,” the law firm complained. Potential clients are “likely to be confused” by the similarity, the firm said.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wex_yoast_1200_v4.png?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-15 13:57:14.098468

Ramirez, ranking member of the US House of Representatives’ Veterans’ Affairs Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, says she has led a new investigation into the Trump administration’s arrest, detention, and deportation of non-citizen service members, veterans and military families.

Ramirez, the daughter of working-class Guatemalan immigrants, who represents Illinois’ 3rd Congressional District, said on Sept. 4 that she was joined in the probe by Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin of Illinois, as well as by Democratic Congressional Representatives Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire.

The lawmakers have led 55 members of Congress in dispatching a letter to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the US Department of Defense (DOD) seeking an explanation for what they say is a violation of DHS’s long-running policy to protect service members, veterans, and their immediate family members from immigration enforcement.

“The Trump administration’s (actions) threaten US national security interests and erode the US military’s credibility when it makes promises to its service members who have put their lives on the line for our country,” wrote the lawmakers.

“We demand an explanation for why DHS is betraying its promises to service members who play a key role in protecting US national security,” they added.

Ramirez said they strongly believe that the Trump administration is targeting military families using information the families voluntarily provided to the federal government in connection with their service.

She said that, when applying for immigration benefits, like “parole in place,” military families provide a significant amount of personal data, including their physical addresses and information like eye color and height, country of birth, and more.

“Now, USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) may be using that information to refer service members or their families to ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) for removal proceedings, even if they were previously deprioritized for enforcement actions,” Remirez said.

The coalition, Ramirez said, is calling on the two agencies to provide information regarding how many non-citizens are serving in the military, as well as a list of service members, veterans, and family members who have been arrested, detained, or deported since January 2025. The coalition also seeks to determine the impact of the new policies on recruitment, readiness, and morale, and to learn what information about non-citizen service members and military family members the Pentagon provides DHS and ICE. Ramirez asked for the information to be turned over by Sept. 16.

Ramirez noted that, in April 2025, ICE rescinded its former policy of considering military service a “significant mitigating factor” when deciding whether to pursue immigration enforcement and issued a new policy that is “less protective of service members and their families.”

Following the policy change, Ramirez said “multiple constituents affected by the administration’s reckless changes to immigration protections for military families have shared their stories with representatives in Congress.”",https://www.caribbeanlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Delia_Ramirez_official_portrait_2025.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-09-15 13:57:05.503616

Family members say 16-year-old Gustavo Enrique de Oliveira was chased by ICE agents after stopping at a bakery on Main Street Friday afternoon.

Gustavo's father, Itamar de Oliveira, spoke with NBC10 Boston. He said the family now fears ICE may go after them - they've been summoned to appear before ICE in Burlington after the incident.

He ran out of fear, ran out of fear, anyone would do that, you know? Anyone would run, he ran out of fear to avoid arrest. He ran, they grabbed him, pinned him to the ground, pinned him… put him in the car, and took him away,"" de Oliveira told NBC10 Boston.

The teen was taken a few blocks down Main Street in a dark SUV, which pulled in front of a white car to question someone in front of the police department.

Within a few minutes, a passerby showed up to film. Agents instruct him to stay away. Twenty minutes later, police arrived to control a growing ground.

Video released by Milford police shows a white vehicle stopped at an intersection when a dark SUV with flashing lights pulls up in front of it. A second vehicle then pulls up right behind it.

A group of people can be seen gathering by the stopped vehicle, appearing to talk with police. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can be seen conversing with the driver, and at some point and after about 8 minutes pass they are seen leaving the area.

""Anyone, somebody shows up on an active scene it's it's a recipe for disaster,"" said Milford Police Chief Robert Tusino.

Tusino said ICE has been very active in Milford, but not very communicative.

“It does hamper our ability to work with the community on a lot of cases, that's why initially when these things happen my personal belief is all these things should come through us,"" Tusino said.

The teen was released later Friday evening. His father is now worried for his son's mental and physical health.

“This government just wants to destroy families. Understand? And destroying families. It's destroying its own country,"" he said.

The teen's lawyer is concerned for the parents, who she says have no criminal history and are in the middle of their asylum process.

“They show up to court, there's not a criminal history,"" attorney Jill Seeber said. ""There's no reason for them to be detained.”

Gustavo's parents are being called to show up to ICE in Burlington tomorrow. De Oliveira said he is afraid the government will take them both and separate them from their son.

Milford residents reported a heavy presence of federal agents in several parts of town on Friday. Videos shared by witnesses with Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra showed ICE operations in the town center. Local business employees and residents confirmed that the operations began early in the morning.

One downtown restaurant employee said her coworker's husband was arrested by ICE while dropping her off at her workplace.

One video shared by a resident showed two agents in green vests escorting a barefoot man. In another video, a masked agent could be seen running after a shirtless, barefoot man who attempted to flee. A third video showed a young man being lifted off the ground by an agent and taken into custody.

The arrests and the ICE presence were primarily concentrated in downtown Milford near the police station.

The president said in a social media post that if Bowser didn't agree to work with ICE, the consequences would be dire, saying, ""CRIME would come roaring back.""

Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 11 declaring a crime emergency in Washington, invoking a section of the federal Home Rule Act of 1973 that allows him to direct the district to give his administration control of the police department for 30 days. His emergency takeover has since expired.

Bowser signed an executive order on Sept. 2 requiring district officials to coordinate with federal law enforcement agencies ""to the maximum extent allowable by law within,” listing off several federal agencies such as the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI. Not included on the list is U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Bowser told reporters at a Sept. 10 press conference that the executive order requires a return to the “pre-emergency status quo.”

“Immigration enforcement is not what MPD does. And with the end of the emergency, it won’t be what MPD does in the future,” she later added.

Trump blasted Bowser in an early morning Sept. 15 Truth Social post. “Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has presided over this violent criminal takeover of our Capital for years, has informed the Federal Government that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens. If I allowed this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!""

Trump has claimed that his takeover has resulted in a safer DC.

“D.C. has gone from one of the most dangerous and murder ridden cities in the U.S.A., and even around the World, to one of the safest - In just a few weeks,” he wrote in the post.

Bowser has agreed that the increased federal presence has helped reduce the number of homicides, carjackings and gun crimes. However, violent crime in the city was already down by 26% from 2024 when Trump announced his takeover.

Maintaining a federalized police force beyond 30 days requires action from Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he won't work to extend the deadline.

Last week, she said that with the emergency order lifted, the city would return to the status quo.

""If I allowed this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!"" Trump wrote.

Earlier this month, if she had any concerns that not working with ICE would upset the White House.

“I don’t,” she said. “We have a long history of working with federal law enforcement, and we’re going to continue to partner in ways that make sense for D.C. safety.”

The mayor told 7News that the city will continue to do what it did to bring crime down over the last couple of years.

“We want to make it perfectly clear that that doesn’t change today,” Bowser said. “The things that were against the law last month are still against the law. We still don’t want people using guns in our community. We don’t want anybody stealing from stores and from each other in our community. Carjacking will not be tolerated in our communities.”

Bowser has previously commented on Trump’s federal takeover, saying that having additional law enforcement officers expanded the police department's ability to drive down crime. She also signed an executive order requiring cooperation with federal law enforcement as permitted under local rules.

Lawsuits filed by Subin Associates, which specializes in construction injury litigation, surged 61% from 2018 to 2023.
As in court systems across the country, litigation on this scale requires two parties to work: Lawyers and judges.
New York’s trial judges are elected and are routinely asked to adapt the law to benefit plaintiff lawyers.","In February 2004, a pair of workers attempted to roll an 800-pound reel of wire down some steps in the New York Stock Exchange using a crude rope sling. The reel tumbled forward, one of the workers got his fingers caught in the rope and a lucrative new business for plaintiff lawyers was born.

In a pivotal 2009 decision, New York’s highest court decided that Labor Law Section 240, which was first passed in 1885 to protect workers injured on dangerous construction sites, applied to almost any workplace accident involving a building and the force of gravity.

Plaintiff lawyers seized upon the decision in Runner v. NYSE to file lawsuits against building owners, general contractors and anyone else involved in a construction project who could plausibly be blamed for a worker’s injury.

A decade later, politics provided a huge boost to so-called Scaffold Lawsuits. Joseph Biden won the presidency and effectively opened the southern border to a flood of more than 8 million Latin immigrants. Tens of thousands of them wound up in New York, providing a ready supply of workers willing to sign their names to Section 240 complaints in exchange for a few thousand dollars in cash up front.

Lawsuits filed by Subin Associates, which specializes in construction injury litigation, surged 61% from 2018 to 2023. It filed 707 cases in New York courts in 2023, most of them involving plaintiffs with Latin names. Gorayeb & Associates, which says on its website it is “recognized within the Hispanic community as `The People's Lawyers,’” saw a more modest 26% increase over the same period, also mostly naming Latino plaintiffs.

Section 240 was the ideal vehicle for plaintiff firms because New York judges had earlier determined the loosely worded law meant defendants had almost no way to fight a claim. Even if the plaintiff bore most of the blame for his accident, the defendant companies were liable.

Unique in the U.S., the law also allows plaintiffs to double-dip, collecting from the Workers’ Compensation system while pursing a potential multimillion-dollar claim in civil court.

Insurers who pay to defend and settle these cases soon picked up on the trend. Lawsuits insurers filed in state and federal court claim the increase in construction accidents wasn’t due to chance, but because plaintiff lawyers seized upon the presence of thousands of poorly educated, undocumented immigrants to file fraudulent injury suits and sent them to doctors willing to perform unnecessary surgeries to drive the value of the claim up.

As alleged in those lawsuits, a network of runners in the immigrant community, some of them connected to Latin gangs, recruited plaintiffs by promising them thousands of dollars up front if they’d go to a lawyer’s office and sign some papers. Those papers – typically in English, although many of the plaintiffs speak only Spanish – included a claim of injury as well as an agreement to borrow money against the value of the lawsuit at usurious interest rates of 50% a year or more (in New York, lawsuit loans aren’t subject to consumer lending rules).

Investigators found evidence of the scheme in plain sight. An insurance industry claims database identified a number of “hotspots,” or addresses where residents have filed hundreds of claims. One 67-unit building in New York has 300 claims including 11 filed by a single resident. Exo Insurance found 13 Subin clients were connected to a single apartment at 2011 Amsterdam Ave. in New York. One of them, Isaha Hernandez, sued the building owners themselves for a slip-and-fall.

Illustrating the central role medical records and financing play in these cases, Subin name partner Herbert Subin shares a patent covering software to track patient medical records with the owner of a finance firm that extends loans to doctors.

Subin and Gorayeb didn’t respond to requests for comment. In an editorial published earlier this year, Victoria Wickman, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, criticized insurers for “aggressive, defamatory legal filings aimed squarely at intimidating the injured from making valid claims.”

“If anything sounds like a coordinated effort, it's the successive filings of these RICO actions,” Wickman wrote.

As in court systems across the country, litigation on this scale requires two parties to work: Lawyers and judges. New York’s trial judges are elected and are routinely asked to adapt the law to benefit plaintiff lawyers.

Lawyers attempt to tie most injuries to gravity to invoke the Scaffold Law. Judges must decide whether a heavy pipe or piece of wood falling over can be chalked up to gravity, or if gravity is to blame when a worker twists their ankle while descending stairs.

And insurance defense lawyers complain most New York judges refuse to allow defendants to obtain a plaintiff’s medical records from before a claimed accident to determine whether the injury predates the claim.

Speaking on condition of anonymity because he appears frequently before these same judges, a defense lawyer said: “How can you know what someone’s future pain and suffering will be due to an accident when you don’t know their prior condition?”

There are also vast differences in the value of a claim based on which court district it is brought in.

“I’m in Suffolk county – the same claim might be $50,000-$100,000 here, but in the Bronx that is a $700,000 claim,” said Jason Bartow, a broker who sells commercial insurance through his family’s brokerage in New York.

Ionian Insurance, in a lawsuit against Gorayeb and other alleged co-conspirators filed in state court in New York, says its outstanding liability, or pending claims, skyrocketed more than 700% between 2021 and 2023, mainly because of questionable construction claims. This increase contrasts with a steady decrease in reported workplace injuries in New York over the same time.

One Subin client filed three lawsuits and a workers’ compensation claim over the same alleged accident, even though an eyewitness testified they saw the plaintiff undo his safety harness and jump off a platform. Subin withdrew from the case after it was sued by Tradesman Insurance in 2024, but insurance executives say there are thousands more such lawsuits still working their way through New York courts.

“Most insurance companies are not staffed to deal with organized crime,” said Don Orlando, who heads an investigative group at Tradesman that includes former FBI, CIA and military intelligence officers.

Clearly someone at Subin was worried about the quality of the firm’s workplace-injury claims. Citing letters from insurance companies identifying “a pattern of fraud within the construction industry as to Scaffold Law cases,” Subin last year quietly withdrew as counsel in more than 200 lawsuits. In each case, the firm said it was withdrawing on the advice of an outside ethics expert, but declined to provide further details to the court.

At one hearing in January, an insurance lawyer sought in vain to get more information about exactly why Subin was pulling out of a workplace-injury case and whether it was because the client was referred by a well-known “referral source” or runner named Jorge Lupi. Subin’s lawyer would only say the information was protected by the attorney-client privilege.

“Otherwise known as keeping your distance,” quipped Judge Robert J. Caloras. He then ruled against any further disclosure.

While some firms, like Subin, have scaled back their construction-injury lawsuits, the immigrant community is still providing thousands of plaintiffs for routine slip-and-fall and auto accident cases. The business is so lucrative that Gorayeb found itself on the receiving end of a lawsuit by rival Ginarte Gonzalez & Winograd for swapping the Gorayeb name into Ginarte’s tagline on television ads: “ACCIDENTE DE CONSTRUCCIÓN, GINARTE ES LA SOLUCIÓN.”

“Members of the public, legal community, media, and most importantly, workers and prospective clients in the Spanish-speaking construction business, associate the tagline/mark exclusively with the Ginarte law firm and the excellent services provided by the firm,” the law firm complained. Potential clients are “likely to be confused” by the similarity, the firm said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_center_square_articles_912/f08cea9ce00f1d2e317c0d1bbb407b8c,N,,2025-09-15 13:57:17.639905

“To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!”

Bowser, a Democrat, earlier this month issued an executive order creating an “emergency operations center” that would coordinate with several federal law enforcement agencies.

The order did not mention Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, whose masked agents have been seen targeting suspected undocumented immigrants across the city in the past month. In a press conference last week, the mayor emphasized that the police would no longer be involved with such arrests.

“Immigration enforcement is not what the MPD does. And with the end of the emergency, it won’t be what MPD does in the future,” she said. Her administration has otherwise signaled support for having federal agents patrol the city, with Bowser writing in her executive order that violent crime had “notably decreased”.

Though rates of violent crime in the capital are at 30-year lows, Trump on 11 August exercised a never-before-used clause of Washington DC’s Home Rule Act to put the police department under his administration’s control for the 30-day period allowed by law, and also ordered the national guard and officers from several federal law enforcements agencies to patrol its streets.

So far, reports of arrests and raids have been scattered and unclear. In Signal group chats, activists and community members crowdsource possible ICE sightings, while downtown, protesters rally. Confusion and fear—alongside determination and energy—run rampant.

The situation reached a new level of intensity on Friday. I reported from a protest outside of an ICE processing facility in Broadview, a town just outside of Chicago. When someone is detained by ICE in the Chicago area, they are likely to be brought to the Broadview facility before being transferred out of state—in 2021, Illinois lawmakers made it illegal to use Illinois jails to hold ICE detainees.

By mid-morning, a crowd of around 100 protesters had gathered. Some had been there since the early hours of the morning. The facility’s doors and windows are boarded up, and chain link fences topped with coils of barbed wire kept agents in and protesters out.

More from Emma Janssen

A small contingent of around seven protesters sat in front of one of the facility’s driveways with the goal of blocking vehicles from moving in and out. Most of those vehicles were nondescript, unmarked white vans.

Just before 11:30 a.m., agents attempted to drive a gray sedan out of the facility. In tactical gear with their faces characteristically covered, they pushed forward toward the chanting protesters, who refused to move. Agents responded by surrounding them and dragging them forcibly across the road before retreating into the facility. Throughout, Broadview police officers formed lines to separate the protesters from the ICE agents.

Meanwhile, the protesters remained peaceful. A handful of them were members of the same church group. One, who asked to stay anonymous out of fear of retaliation, told me that their faith motivated their decision to come protest.

“We are called to love and care for one another,” they said. “It’s so maddening to me that they’re doing this, and that we have local police, state police, and federal police cooperating on stuff that is just so abhorrently cruel.”

Around noon, the same van returned to the facility. A prerecorded message played from a speaker, telling protesters to disperse or risk arrest. Nobody moved. Agents once again pushed toward the protesters, this time firing what the crowd assumes were pepper balls at the seated protesters. The van drove quickly around the crowd and back through the gate. An agent stood on the roof, weapon in hand, looking down at the crowd.

When agents weren’t dragging protesters across the concrete, the mood was calm and bordering on joyful. Spanish music boomed from speakers (Bad Bunny featured prominently), and protesters hunted for any sliver of shade they could find to protect themselves from the late-summer sun. Two candidates for Illinois’s Ninth Congressional District open seat, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss and online media personality Kat Abughazaleh, made appearances and chatted with those gathered. When the sun was at its highest, someone brought bags of crushed ice (pun very much intended) and passed out improvised snow cones.

“It’s clear to me that any escalation is coming from the state,” another protester, who lives in Chicago, told me. They had been sitting in the driveway when ICE agents picked them up by the underarms to clear the way. “I think some people were able to stay limp more successfully than I was. And once we were up, they [ICE] shoved us out of the way.”

A few hours later, I watched a different protester get shoved by ICE agents and spoke to her after they had gone back into the building. “They just wanted to push us around,” she said. “They’re just a bunch of wannabe fascists.”

By 2 p.m., there were some 25 protesters left. Attorney Kevin Herrera of Raise the Floor Alliance arrived at the scene and attempted to enter the facility by knocking on the boarded-up front door. Nobody answered. Herrera explained that one of his clients had been detained by ICE just hours earlier while driving his car in Little Village, one of Chicago’s predominantly Latino neighborhoods.

Herrera said that he didn’t know where his client was taken after his arrest but figured that the Broadview facility was a likely place to look. His client is a day laborer in his late thirties whose wife lives in Chicago with him. The man is a plaintiff in a civil rights lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and Home Depot for the detention and beating of day laborers. Herrera noted that the timing of his client’s detention and his participation in a lawsuit seems suspicious.

Herrera's first stop after the arrest was to make sure his client’s wife was OK, and his second stop was the processing facility. But he was unable to get in or even communicate with the officials inside.

In the past, he said, “I’ve been able to show that I represent the individual and then have a conversation with them. I know that Los Angeles has had similar problems with access to counsel at processing facilities.”

ON FRIDAY, THE NEWS ALSO BROKE THAT, just four miles from the Broadview facility, an ICE agent shot and killed a man named Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez. A representative for ICE said that Villegas-Gonzalez was resisting arrest during a vehicle stop and drove his car toward ICE officers. One officer was dragged by the car and injured but is now in stable condition.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin tried to use the incident to discourage anti-ICE activism and awareness campaigns, saying in a statement: “Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.”

Chicagoans haven’t taken the bait. “Know your rights” trainings are continuing across the city, and some activists I spoke to are planning to demonstrate outside of the Broadview facility at least once a week.

Earlier in the year, Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, tried to scorn but instead actually complimented Chicago: “Sanctuary cities are making it very difficult,” he said on CNN in January. “For instance, Chicago … they’ve been educated on how to defy ICE, how to hide from ICE.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23511/download/Janssen-Chicago%20ICE%20091525.jpg?cb=eedba2ef8a9d201a379843f1b32a79a1&w=1024,N,,2025-09-15 11:58:54.215746

According to the complaint, on September 5, five migrants—three from Nigeria and two from the Gambia—were taken from an ICE detention facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, loaded onto a US military cargo plane, and flown to Ghana.

The complaint stated that the plaintiffs had already been granted fear-based relief by immigration judges, meaning they were legally barred from removal to their countries of origin on account of risk of persecution or torture. Nonetheless, the lawsuit contends, the US effectively deported them via a “third country” scheme, using Ghana under what plaintiffs call a “transit hub” policy to circumvent such protections.

The passengers were not told where they were going, shackled, and only given bread and water, according to the lawsuit. Four of them were allegedly restrained in straitjackets for approximately 16 hours during the flight.

The lawsuit asked the court for an immediate halt to the plaintiffs’ removals to their countries of origin.

The Trump administration has administered deals with several African countries, including Eswatini, Rwanda, and Uganda, to accept migrant deportations regardless of connection to these countries. Such “third country deportations” were authorized following litigation in June after the Supreme Court allowed the practice.

Noah Baron, Assistant Director of Litigation at the AAAJ, told The Washington Post, “It reflects a very concerning pattern by the administration of removing people from the United States to countries that they had protection against returning to, and in which they — the administration — knows, or reasonably should know, that they will be in grave danger.”",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/plane_1744905732.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 10:56:46.904946

The South Korean government says it is investigating potential human rights violations during the raid and detention of Korean workers by US authorities.

South Korea has expressed ""strong regret"" to the US and has officially asked that its citizens' rights and interests are not infringed during law enforcement proceedings, said a presidential spokesperson on Monday.

More than 300 South Korean workers returned home on Friday after being held for a week following a raid at an electric vehicle battery plant in the US state of Georgia.

The incident has tested ties between the countries, even as South Korean firms are set to invest billions in America under a trade deal to avoid steep US tariffs.

South Korean authorities will work with the relevant companies to ""thoroughly investigate any potential human rights violations or other issues"", said the presidential spokesperson during a press briefing.

The BBC has contacted the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for comment.

The raid has raised tensions between the US and South Korea, where many of those detained were from, with President Lee Jae-myung warning that it will discourage foreign investment into the US.

He called the situation ""bewildering"", adding that it is a common practice for Korean companies to send workers to help set up overseas factories.

Last week, Hyundai said the plant's opening will be delayed by at least two months.

South Korea's trade unions have called on Trump to issue an official apology.

On 4 September, around 475 people - mostly South Korean nationals - were arrested at a Hyundai-operated plant, in what marked the largest single-location immigration raid since US President Donald Trump launched a crackdown on illegal migrants earlier this year.

ICE officials said the South Koreans had overstayed their visas or were not permitted to work in the US.

A South Korean worker who witnessed the raid told the BBC of panic and confusion as federal agents descended on the site, with some people being led away in chains.

Trump has said foreign workers sent to the country are ""welcome"" and he doesn't want to ""frighten off"" investors.

The US needs to learn from foreign experts of fields like shipbuilding, chipmaking and computing, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.

""We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own 'game,' sometime in the not too distant future,"" he said.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/468b/live/32446a30-91e8-11f0-a576-4558a4f7f884.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:58:45.784537

At issue is the provision of information on individuals living in, or entering, the US illegally. Trump's threat adds to a move critics have seen as federal overreach, with more than 2,000 troops patrolling the city.

The comments come after several thousand protesters hit the streets this month over Trump's August deployment of National Guard troops to ""re-establish law, order, and public safety"", after calling crime a blight on the capital.

""In just a few weeks. The ""place"" is absolutely booming ... for the first time in decades, virtually NO CRIME,"" Trump said on Truth Social.

Bowser's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's post.

Earlier, he had put the metropolitan police department under direct federal control and sent federal law enforcement, including members of the ICE, to police the streets. It is unclear when their mission will end.

Trump blamed ""Radical Left Democrats"" for pressuring Bowser to inform the government about the non-cooperation with ICE, adding that if the police halted cooperation with ICE, ""Crime would come roaring back"".

He added, ""To the people and businesses of Washington DC, DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalise, if necessary!!!""

Bowser, who has previously praised Trump's surge of federal law enforcement, bringing a sharp decline in crime, earlier signed an order for the city to coordinate with federal law enforcement.

Introduction

Chapter 1. Court Concerns of Noncompliance with Judicial Orders

1. “Bad faith” conduct and “gleeful” boasts culminate in “willful” disobedience and probable cause for criminal contempt

2-a. Post-Supreme Court reporting orders met with non-answers and failures to comply

2-b. Expedited discovery ordered “in the face of ongoing refusal to comply,” with possible contempt proceedings reserved pending the record

2-c. “Willful and bad faith refusal” to comply with expedited discovery obligations, with DOJ “counsel stubbornly refus[ing] to provide any basis for” “non-particularized” privilege claims

2-d. Return from El Salvador achieved, but “no appetite” to restore “status quo ante,” with “defiance and foot-dragging” warranting further relief

2-e. Government “not so subtly spurns” court orders; “respect … must be reciprocated,” or “anarchy would result”

3. Government took actions that “hardly appeared to comply with the TRO Order and raised some concern about the general presumption by courts ‘that executive officials will act in good faith’”

4. “Clearly hasn’t complied” with court order, culminating in a looming contempt finding

5. “No choice but to find that they were in violation;” “flagrant violation”

6. After weeks of having to “wrangle the Government into compliance,” judge noted an apparent “blatant disregard” of the court’s order

7. “Dressing their RIF in new clothes, and that they are thumbing their nose at both this Court and the Court of Appeals”

8. Finding of noncompliance with a federal court order; FEMA’s “covert” rebranding of an indefinite freeze

9. Agencies “actions violate the Preliminary Injunction”

10. Government action “violated this Court’s order staying Petitioner’s removal”

11. Government counsel “make no attempt to offer any justification for their blatant lack of effort to comply;” and unrebutted claim that the government created a sui generis document as a “contrivance” to avert court ruling

12. “No dispute Defendants are in breach;” court also references “Defendants’ delay in curing that breach and complying with the Court’s June 10, 2025 Order”

13. “[I]t appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without actually ceasing the challenged conduct. The court can think of few things more disingenuous”

14. Defendants “have not complied with the … TRO,” efforts to “evade [the preliminary injunction’s] terms through post-hoc explanations”

15. “Manifestly unreasonable” and “contrived” reading of injunction, “border[ing] on violating Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)” and “deserving of … reprimands”

16. Government at “risk [of] being held in contempt” for disregard of discovery orders, and later “failed to comply” with submitting declaration

Chapter 2. Court Distrust of Government Information and Representations

A. General

1. “Obscur[ing] from the Court” and “refusing to provide any helpful information” while “rapidly dispatching removal flights”

2. Placing attorney on leave for his compliance with “the duty of candor to the court”

3. Providing “highly misleading, if not intentionally false” sworn declaration to the court; “so disingenuous that the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything”

4. Providing pretext for motion to dismiss an indictment

5. “Defendants’ plea for a presumption of good faith rings hollow when their own actions contradict their representations.”

6. Providing false sworn declarations about “hotly contested” material fact; “The Court was given false information, upon which it relied, twice, to the detriment of a party at risk of serious and irreparable harm.”

7. Providing the court with “the sorriest statement I’ve ever seen;” “This is a terrible, terrible affidavit. If this were before me in a criminal case and you were asking to get a warrant issue on this, I’d throw you out of my chambers”

8. “This Court takes clear offense to Respondents wasting judicial resources to admit to the Court it has no evidence;” “contradict[ing] themselves throughout the entire record;” providing “shoddy affidavits and contradictory testimony”

9. Failure to answer interrogatories and mischaracterization of Supreme Court opinion

10. Solicitor General providing inaccurate information to the U.S. Supreme Court

11. “Flip-flopping—in sworn declarations—rais[ing] severe concern,” “consistently refused to give … the full story,” providing “cagey answers,” and “omitting key information”

12. “The ‘administrative record’ submitted by the government is a sham. It does not facilitate judicial review: It frustrates it;” judge calls out government for “lie” in termination letters, and for DOJ preventing testimony because “afraid … would reveal the truth”

13. Presenting military experts who misrepresented multiple studies

14. Providing false and incomplete information concerning DOGE’s leadership and authorities

15. Failing to “to offer any explanation, let alone one supported by the record;” court saying “can’t get a straight answer from you”

16. Providing explanations of protecting criminal investigation that appeared to be pretext for blocking embarrassing information

17. Mischaracterizing the content of sealed grand jury documents in court filings

18. Making “patently incredible” claims

19. Providing an “explanation [that] is riddled with inconsistencies”

20. Making representation that “does not reflect the level of diligence the Court expects from any litigant—let alone the United States Department of Justice;” “The contradiction between [Government’s] factual representations and the facts on the ground is particularly striking”

21. Unrebutted claim that the government created a record as a “contrivance” to avert court ruling

22. Offering an “official justification … [that] is not plausible”

23. Admitting to making false statement to the court

B. Pretext and Retaliatory Motives

24. “The Court will not apply any presumption of regularity to conduct that is so unusual and therefore irregular on its face.” Preliminary injunction granted where the government was found to be pursuing “an unconstitutional course of retaliatory conduct directed at Harvard”

25. Executive Order terminating collective bargaining rights for federal workers enjoined as retaliatory, with court finding the presumption of regularity “has no application”

26. Executive Order targeting Jenner & Block LLP found unconstitutional

27. Executive Order targeting WilmerHale found unconstitutional

28. Preliminary injunction issued against section of EO terminating Treasury employees’ collective bargaining rights

29. Executive Order targeting Susman Godfrey LLP found unconstitutional

30. Preliminary injunction issued against section of EO terminating Department of State and USAID employees’ collective bargaining rights

31. Executive Order targeting Perkins Coie LLP found unconstitutional

32. Preliminary injunction granted where DOJ appeared to have terminated grants to ABA with retaliatory motive

33. Preliminary injunction issued where DHS appeared to have acted to punish AFGE and its members

34. Executive Order’s broad exclusions from collective bargaining rights for federal workers found retaliatory and pretextual, rebutting presumption of regularity

35. Preliminary injunction issued where FTC investigation of Media Matters deemed retaliatory for criticism of Musk’s X

36. Funding freeze targeting Harvard ruled retaliatory and pretextual

37. Habeas Cases

Introduction

The “presumption of regularity” is a judicially created doctrine with a long and contested history. The doctrine affords the executive branch a distinctive advantage not enjoyed by private litigants. It generally instructs courts to presume, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, that executive officials have “properly discharged their official duties” and that government agencies have acted with procedural regularity and with bona fide, non-pretextual reasons. In practice, the presumption can preclude discovery, limit review of the facts, and truncate cases. It can constrict (or even end) civil suits challenging government action and curb criminal defendants’ ability to claim vindictive or selective prosecution, and more.

Over the decades, the scope and weight of the presumption has fluctuated. In the face of extraordinary executive misconduct or malfeasance, courts may choose (explicitly or implicitly) to narrow its scope, reduce its weight, or even potentially deem the presumption more generally forfeited, as the Trump administration is beginning to learn. Indeed, Judge Paul L. Friedman cautioned in an August 2025 opinion:

“Generations of presidential administrations and public officials have validated this underlying premise of the presumption of regularity: their actions writ large have raised little question that they act ‘in obedience to [their] duty.’ Over the last six months, however, courts have seen instance after instance of departures from this tradition. … In just six months, the President of the United States may have forfeited the right to such a presumption of regularity.” (emphasis added).

The Supreme Court itself showed the limits of the presumption during the first Trump administration upon learning that the Commerce Department had “contrived” a false rationale for reinstating the citizenship question in the national census. In Department of Commerce v. New York, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, “[W]e cannot ignore the disconnect between the decision made and the explanation given. Our review is deferential, but we are ‘not required to exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens are free.’” That move was to the chagrin of Justice Clarence Thomas, who argued that the majority had given “lipservice” to the principle that “courts reviewing agency action owe the Executive a ‘presumption of regularity.’”

We document three categories of executive branch conduct since Jan. 20, 2025 that, in Judge Friedman’s words, showed to courts “instance after instance of departures from this tradition” of public officials acting “in obedience to [their] duty.” The three categories are:

1. Courts’ concerns over noncompliance with judicial orders (over 15 cases)

2. Courts’ distrust of government information and representations (over 35 cases)

3. Courts’ findings of “arbitrary and capricious” administrative action (over 50 cases)

On this record, we believe more federal judges will rightfully conclude that the administration has forfeited the full protections of the presumption.

Indeed, Judge Friedman is not alone in his observations. Denying a government bid to indefinitely seal a judicial order, Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui recently responded to the government’s request for deference in sharp terms. Recounting a list of concerns across different cases in the federal courts and aberrant behavior by the Justice Department, the judge wrote: “Blind deference to the government? That is no longer a thing. Trust that had been earned over generations has been lost in weeks. … These norms being broken must have consequences. High deference is out; trust, but verify is in” (emphasis added). Other judges have raised similar concerns about the viability of the presumption in the cases before them. At a July hearing in the Abrego Garcia case, Judge Paula Xinis told government counsel, “You have taken the presumption of regularity and you’ve destroyed it in my view.” In litigation over the administration’s efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Judge Amy Berman Jackson wrote, “the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything.” Concerning an executive order against a law firm, Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote that the government’s noncompliance with a temporary restraining order “raised some concern about the general presumption by courts ‘that executive officials will act in good faith.’” And when reviewing the rescission of government funds to small businesses and nonprofits, Judge Loren L. AliKhan wrote, “Defendants’ plea for a presumption of good faith rings hollow when their own actions contradict their representations.”

Before turning to the three categories of executive conduct, we should mention three methodological notes about our research:

1. Our account includes only government conduct that has come to the courts’ direct attention. We do not include internal executive branch actions that may also suggest the administration has undercut the premise for applying the presumption. We considered including those as well, but we focus here instead on what the courts themselves have found. Nor did we want to reinvent the wheel: a separate Tracker comprehensively documents internal administrative changes that have undermined the executive branch’s capacity to identify and address official misconduct and systemic irregularities.

2. The three categories above do not capture all of the judiciary’s expressed concerns about the administration’s conduct; the record is even more overwhelming than the cases cataloged below. For example, we exclude judges’ concerns about Department of Justice conduct involving prosecutorial decisions that do not fit our three categories. In a September hearing, for instance, Judge Faruqui—a former federal prosecutor—criticized the government’s motion to dismiss charges against a defendant after a grand jury’s refusal to indict. In an accompanying order, the court questioned whether the U.S. Attorney’s Office for D.C. was still following the DOJ Manual on when to initiate a prosecution, “[g]iven that there have been an unprecedented number of cases that the U.S. Attorney dismissed in the past ten days.” The court added, “It’s not fair to say they’re losing credibility. We’re past that now. … There’s no credibility left.”

3. We take no position on the presumption’s proper scope in ordinary circumstances. The documented cases below are not intended to indicate when we think courts should apply the presumption. Well before the Trump administration, the metes and bounds of the presumption were unsettled, and its pedigree was ripe for being questioned. Some scholars trace the presumption back to the 1926 Supreme Court decision of United States v. Chemical Foundation, where the Justices presumed that a State Department official acted with knowledge of material facts when selling patents seized under the Trading with the Enemy Act. Paradoxically, the application of the presumption in that case worked against the Coolidge administration, which had sought to invalidate the sale as “induced by misrepresentation.” What’s more, the Court did not explain why it was appropriate to presume the regularity of a process the government itself said was irregular.

Other scholars and courts trace the presumption further back to Martin v. Mott. In that 1827 case, the Supreme Court accorded deference to the president’s determination that an “invasion” existed in calling the New York militia into federal service during the War of 1812. If the presumption belongs to that lineage of judicial deference, our study has broader implications. However, we have reason to doubt the two forms of deference – the one in Mott and the one in Chemical Foundation – are doctrinally equivalent.

In other words, we do not attempt to resolve how far back to trace the doctrine’s origins, the doctrine’s appropriate scope, or whether it has seeped into judicial decisions in underexamined or unwarranted ways. Such an analysis would need to contend, among other things, with the logical foundations of the doctrine and to which types of government actions those foundations are applicable as well as whether a president should enjoy a presumption that his or her subordinates do not.

* * *

In sum, the presumption of regularity “credits to the executive branch certain facts about what happened and why and, in doing so, narrows judicial scrutiny and widens executive discretion over decisionmaking processes and outcomes,” as an influential Harvard Law Review Note explained. But the maintenance of the presumption rests on certain foundations, and those foundations have been eroded by the Trump administration, especially the Justice Department, in the following three ways.

Chapter 1. Court Concerns of Noncompliance with Judicial Orders

Introduction

According to a foundational Supreme Court judgment, the presumption of regularity assumes that executive officials have “properly discharged their official duties.” In a landmark D.C. Circuit decision this meant, “We [the Court] cannot allow a breach of the presumption of regularity by an unwarranted assumption that the President was indifferent to the purposes and requirements of the [statute], or acted deliberately in contravention of them” (emphasis added). Insofar as the presumption rests on such considerations – i.e., that the Executive is “following the rules” – then the cardinal duty of complying with court orders is a potential test case.

The executive branch’s flagrant noncompliance with court orders may, and indeed has already, undermined judicial support for the presumption. In this Chapter, we document over 15 cases in which courts have found the Executive in noncompliance with judicial orders—ranging from willful disobedience and rebranding of enjoined conduct to flagrantly slow-walking compliance, missing or ignoring court-imposed deadlines, and refusing to provide court-ordered information—often prompting show-cause orders and contempt warnings.

1. “Bad faith” conduct and “gleeful” boasts culminate in “willful” disobedience and probable cause for criminal contempt

Chief Judge James E. Boasberg (W. Bush appointee; Obama appointee), J.G.G. v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00766 (D.D.C.)

This class action challenged the Trump administration’s mid-March removals of Venezuelan detainees to El Salvador under the claimed authority of the Alien Enemies Act.

Following his Mar. 15 temporary restraining orders barring transfers to El Salvador and requiring the return of flights that had not deboarded in El Salvador, at an Apr. 3 show-cause hearing, Judge Boasberg said there was “a fair likelihood … the government acted in bad faith throughout that day,” questioning how officials could have “ever … operated in the way [they] did” if they believed their conduct lawful.

In his Apr. 16 memorandum opinion, Judge Boasberg formally found probable cause of criminal contempt, holding that the administration “willfully disobeyed a binding judicial decree.” He described a pattern of “increasing obstructionism” and an effort to “outrun the equitable reach of the Judiciary” by launching removal flights even during a hearing. He wrote that officials had “deliberately flouted this Court’s written Order and, separately, its oral command,” conduct amounting to “deliberate or reckless disregard” and a “willful disregard” of binding orders. The opinion also pointed to “boasts” by government officials outside the courtroom, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s repost of El Salvador President Bukele’s mocking post, “Oopsie… Too late 😂,” as evidence that defiance was “deliberate[ ] and gleeful[ ].” Emphasizing that the government had “ample opportunity to rectify or explain” but instead “chose to press ahead,” the court concluded there was probable cause for criminal contempt.

(On appeal, the D.C. Circuit panel divided: Judge Katsas concluded there was no clear wrongdoing, characterizing the TRO as ambiguous; Judge Rao did not reach the misconduct issue, vacating instead on authority grounds; and Judge Pillard dissented, finding probable cause of contempt and supporting Judge Boasberg’s conclusion. The case remains open on a petition for en banc review.)

2-a. Post-Supreme Court reporting orders met with non-answers and failures to comply

Judge Paula Xinis (Obama appointee), Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.)

This case involves the government’s admission that the administration unlawfully sent Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador despite an immigration court order prohibiting removal to that country.

On Apr. 10, the Supreme Court affirmed Judge Xinis’ preliminary injunction to “‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.” The Justices also wrote that the government “should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.”

That same day, Judge Xinis first ordered the government to report by 9:30 a.m. on Apr. 11 what steps it was taking to secure Garcia’s return. DOJ responded that the deadline was “impracticable” and sought until Apr. 15. Rejecting that position, Xinis wrote that the claim DOJ needed days to review a four-page order “blinks at reality” and reset the deadline to 11:30 a.m. DOJ again refused, stating it was “not in a position where they ‘can’ share any information requested by the Court. That is the reality.” At an Apr. 11 status conference, DOJ counsel admitted he lacked “personal knowledge of steps taken to comply,” could not answer the “very simple question … where is he?,” and offered no description of concrete steps. Judge Xinis replied that this suggested counsel had “no full and effective contact with your client,” which was “just not adding up.” In a written order later that day, Judge Xinis found DOJ had “failed to comply” with her instructions and would not answer “straightforward questions” (emphasis added).

2-b. Expedited discovery ordered “in the face of ongoing refusal to comply,” with possible contempt proceedings reserved pending the record

Judge Paula Xinis (Obama appointee), Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.)

This case involves the government’s admission that the administration unlawfully sent Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador despite an immigration court order prohibiting removal to that country.

At the Apr. 15 status conference, Judge Xinis explained she would not initiate contempt proceedings without a fuller record, stating: “I’m not going to issue a show cause today for contempt findings,” but any contempt finding “will be based on the record before me.” She ordered expedited discovery “to determine whether you are abiding by the court order … whether you intend to abide … And if not, is it in bad faith?” She also underscored the lack of concrete action: “I’ve gotten nothing. I’ve gotten no real response, nor have I gotten any legitimate legal justification for not answering,” and “what the record shows is nothing has been done. Nothing.” She added, “I just don’t think it’s that difficult. I think you want to make it that difficult.” That same day, Judge Xinis wrote that “Defendants … have done nothing at all;” she rejected efforts to “skirt this issue by redefining ‘facilitate;’” and found a “uniform refusal to disclose ‘what it can’” along with a “repeated refusal to provide even the most basic information.” She concluded. “Defendants have not yet complied with this Court’s directives” and ordered expedited discovery—depositions of ICE, DHS, and State officials and document production by month’s end (emphasis added).

On the same day, the court ordered expedited discovery. Judge Xinis wrote: [1] “Defendants therefore remain obligated, at a minimum, to take the steps available to them toward aiding, assisting, or making easier Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and resuming his status quo ante. But the record reflects that Defendants have done nothing at all” (emphasis added). [2] “Second, and more fundamentally, Defendants appear to have done nothing to aid in Abrego Garcia’s release from custody and return to the United States to ‘ensure that his case is handled as it would have been’ but for Defendants’ wrongful expulsion of him. Abrego Garcia, 604 U.S.— , slip op. at 2. Thus, Defendants’ attempt to skirt this issue by redefining ‘facilitate’ runs contrary to law and logic” (emphasis added). [3] “[T]he discovery is necessary in light of Defendants’ uniform refusal to disclose ‘what it can’ regarding their facilitation of Abrego Garcia’s release and return to the status quo ante, or present any legal justification for what they cannot disclose” and “in the face of ongoing refusal to comply” (emphasis added).

2-c. “Willful and bad faith refusal” to comply with expedited discovery obligations, with DOJ “counsel stubbornly refus[ing] to provide any basis for” “non-particularized” privilege claims

Judge Paula Xinis (Obama appointee), Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.)

This case involves the government’s admission that the administration unlawfully sent Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador despite an immigration court order prohibiting removal to that country.

On Apr. 22, addressing DOJ’s objections to discovery, Judge Xinis wrote that its position “reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations” (emphasis added). She found that “Defendants and counsel stubbornly refuse to provide any basis for” their privilege claims—which she said were being used “as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court’s orders”—and that they relied on “boilerplate, non-particularized objections” which the court deemed “presumptively invalid” and “reflect a willful refusal to comply” (emphasis added). Their refusal to identify all individuals involved in Garcia’s removal and detention, she added, “reflects a deliberate evasion of their fundamental discovery obligations” and “can only be viewed as willful and intentional noncompliance” (emphasis added).

On May 7, the court ordered the government to file a privilege log by May 12. On May 13, Judge Xinis noted that “evidently missing from Defendants’ filing is a privilege log,” directed the government to cure the “deficiency,” and warned that continued failure “will be construed as an intentional refusal to comply with this Court’s orders.” During the May 16 hearing on discovery motions, Judge Xinis underscored that “this Court has found more than once that you haven’t complied, and you haven’t in bad faith,” adding, “The whole reason we’re here is because I’ve said repeatedly you’ve done nothing, and now you tell the world you’re not going to do anything.” She further remarked that the court-ordered depositions from key officials had yielded a “goose egg.”

2-d. Return from El Salvador achieved, but “no appetite” to restore “status quo ante,” with “defiance and foot-dragging” warranting further relief

Judge Paula Xinis (Obama appointee), Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.)

This case involves the government’s admission that the administration unlawfully sent Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador despite an immigration court order prohibiting removal to that country.

Despite Garcia’s Jun. 6 return to the United States, during a Jul. 7 hearing, Judge Xinis refused to grant the government’s motion to dismiss the case, pressed DOJ about whether the indictment and return were used to facilitate compliance with her injunction, and highlighted unresolved production gaps (including the missing arrest warrant) and incomplete compliance with her orders. In a Jul. 23 order granting emergency relief to require Garcia’s return to Maryland pending further proceedings, she noted that, over the prior three months, the government had “disregarded court orders,” displayed “defiance and foot-dragging,” and a “persistent lack of transparency,” warranting further injunctive relief. She found that, despite the first part of her April 4 preliminary injunction (to facilitate Garcia’s release from El Salvador) having been met, the government had shown “no appetite” to fulfill the second part of the injunction—“to restore Abrego Garcia to the status quo ante.” Garcia remained in U.S. Marshals’ custody in Tennessee with an ICE detainer, and the court “shared Plaintiffs’ ongoing concern” that, “absent meaningful safeguards,” he could be removed again “without having restored him to the status quo ante.” Judge Xinis maintained that she would “not hesitate to revisit” broader relief “if Defendants fail to comply with this Order or otherwise attempt to remove Abrego Garcia … without due process.”

2-e. Government “not so subtly spurns” court orders; “respect … must be reciprocated,” or “anarchy would result”

Judge Stephanie Thacker (Obama appointee), Judge Robert King (Clinton appointee), Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III (Reagan appointee), Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 25-1404 (4th Cir.)

Appeal from the district court’s Apr. 10 order directing the government to “take all available steps to facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return and to report on steps taken.

On Apr. 17, the Fourth Circuit (Wilkinson, joined by King & Thacker) denied the government’s emergency stay and mandamus, stressing that “‘facilitate’ is an active verb” and that the word’s “plain and active meaning … cannot be diluted” as the government urged. Judge Wilkinson wrote that “‘[f]acilitation’ does not permit the admittedly erroneous deportation … in disregard of a court order that the government not so subtly spurns.” It warned that “if today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens … ?” Emphasizing comity, the Judge Wilkinson added:

“The respect that courts must accord the Executive must be reciprocated by the Executive’s respect for the courts. Too often today this has not been the case, as calls for impeachment of judges for decisions the Executive disfavors and exhortations to disregard court orders sadly illustrate.” (emphasis added).

Recalling President Eisenhower’s example—his insistence that the Executive must support and ensure enforcement of federal court decisions—Judge Wilkinson quoted: “unless the President did so, anarchy would result.”

3. Government took actions that “hardly appeared to comply with the TRO Order and raised some concern about the general presumption by courts ‘that executive officials will act in good faith.’”

Judge Beryl A. Howell (Obama appointee), Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Department of Justice, 1:25-cv-00716 (D.D.C.)

Challenge to Executive Order 14230 directing federal agencies to take actions against Perkins Coie, including terminating government contracts, denying members of the firm access to federal employees, and suspending employees’ security clearances.

In an Apr. 25 memorandum and order, inter alia, granting leave to amend the complaint, Judge Howell addressed two compliance problems with her Mar. 12 temporary restraining order (TRO). First, the government’s March 18 status report showed agencies were told to suspend EO 14230 §§1, 3, and 5, but were not directed to notify “every recipient” that disclosure requests under §3(a) were rescinded—leaving requests by agencies beyond the seven named defendants “in place notwithstanding the Court’s explicit TRO direction to all defendants—which included the United States, as defined in the Complaint.” As Judge Howell put it:

“[T]he government has already raised the specter that the current configuration of named defendants… may lead to … those agencies not named as defendants [to] claim to be free to ignore it. …. This scenario … would open the door to a game of judicial whack-a-mole, requiring … contested contempt proceedings against non-compliant agencies. … This is not the first instance in this case that has raised the potential specter of noncompliance, which has only crystallized the seriousness of the issues raised. … Luckily, forewarned is forearmed.” (emphasis added).

Second, the government’s March 20 status report attached a Bondi/Vought memorandum that added an extra two-sentence paragraph repeating the EO’s “dishonest and dangerous” accusation—language whose “implementation and use of which had specifically been enjoined by the TRO.” Judge Howell wrote:

“This intentional additional promulgation of derogatory statements about plaintiff across all the Executive branch agencies hardly appeared to comply with the TRO Order and raised some concern about the general presumption by courts ‘that executive officials will act in good faith.’ … As government’s counsel reluctantly conceded … the extra paragraph …. went ‘beyond the minimum required’ for compliance with the Court’s order clarifying the scope of the TRO.” (emphasis added).

4. “Clearly hasn’t complied” with court order, culminating in a looming contempt finding

Judge Royce C. Lamberth (Reagan appointee), Abramowitz v. Lake, 1:25-cv-00887 (D.D.C.) and Widakuswara v. Lake, 1:25-cv-01015 (D.D.C.) (related cases)

These related cases challenged the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and shut down Voice of America (VOA) and its grantee networks pursuant to Executive Order 14238, which eliminated agency functions and ordered personnel reductions.

Following an Apr. 22 preliminary injunction, Judge Lamberth repeatedly found government failures to comply with his orders to restore VOA programming, giving defendants multiple opportunities across June to August to show good-faith compliance. At a Jun. 23 hearing, he “expressed … dissatisfaction with the lack of concrete evidence regarding VOA’s current operations or future plans,” and two further rounds of supplemental briefing remained conclusory and non-responsive. On July 30, Judge Lamberth granted the plaintiffs’ “motions to show cause” why the government was not in violation of court orders, finding the government had “consistently refused to give the Court the full story,” provided “misleading and contradictory information,” and even omitted from its filings the “monumental” decision to remove Michael Abramowitz as VOA Director. At an Aug. 25 hearing, the court concluded that USAGM acting CEO Kari Lake “clearly hasn’t complied with my order,” was “stonewall[ing]” the Court, and was “on the verge of contempt.” That same day, the court gave the government “one final opportunity” and ordered depositions of Lake, USAGM adviser Frank Wuco, and VOA’s Persian broadcasts director by Sept. 15.

5. “No choice but to find that they were in violation;” “flagrant violation.”

Judge Brian E. Murphy (Biden appointee), D.V.D. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 1:25-cv-10676, (D. Mass.)

This case involves, inter alia, the removal of O.C.G., a Guatemalan national, to Mexico allegedly without a “meaningful opportunity” to raise a fear-of-torture claim.

Judge Murphy wrote, “Twice, well-founded allegations of non-compliance or imminent non-compliance led this Court to amend or clarify the Preliminary Injunction.” The court described DHS’s attempts in late April to “evade this injunction by ceding control over non-citizens or the enforcement of its immigration responsibilities to … the Department of Defense” (emphasis added).

On May 21, Judge Murphy found that on May 20, DHS “rac[ed] to get [eight] class members onto a plane to unstable South Sudan, clearly in breach of the law and this Court’s order,” giving him “no choice but to find that they were in violation” of the Apr. 18 preliminary injunction, but “reserve[ing] ruling on whether such a violation warranted a finding of contempt” (emphasis added).

Defendants had “maintain[ed] that ambiguity in the phrase ‘meaningful opportunity’ precipitated this controversy. Indeed, when the Court issued the Preliminary Injunction, it declined to elaborate on what constitutes a ‘meaningful opportunity,’ preferring instead to let experience show through hard cases the finer points of what is required under the Due Process Clause. To be clear, this is not one of those hard cases. … [N]o reasonable interpretation of the Court’s Preliminary Injunction could endorse yesterday’s events,” Judge Murphy wrote. Murphy said that it was “hard to come to any conclusion other than that Defendants invite lack of clarity as a means of evasion. … [I]t is hard to take seriously the idea that Defendants intended these individuals to have any real opportunity to make a valid claim.” In fact, Judge Murphy found the government’s action to amount to a “flagrant violation” of his injunction (emphasis added).

On Jun. 23, the Supreme Court stayed the district court’s injunction, and, on Jul. 3, the Supreme Court issued a second order clarifying that its earlier order fully blocks all components of the district court’s injunction that had prevented the administration from removing immigrants to third countries without an opportunity to present their claims of potential torture.

6. After weeks of having to “wrangle the Government into compliance,” judge noted an apparent “blatant disregard” of the court’s order.

Judge Mary S. McElroy (Trump appointee), Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. Department of Agriculture, 1:25-cv-00097 (D.R.I.)

This case involves a challenge to the Trump administration’s Executive Order 14154, requiring a pause on funding appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)

On Aug. 8, responding to plaintiffs’ fourth compliance report for the Apr. 15 preliminary injunction, Judge McElroy noted the court and parties “had to have four status conferences over the course of three subsequent weeks to wrangle the Government into compliance” (emphasis added). Despite government assurances that HUD had “resumed processing” Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) awards “in the ordinary course,” plaintiffs alleged “$760 million … still inaccessible.” The Court warned: “At risk of understatement, that is serious. If no ‘Comprehensive’ funding under GRRP has been processed in the nearly four months since the injunction, the Court struggles to see how HUD’s inaction can be construed as anything other than a serious violation of the Court’s order, one that exhibits blatant disregard for it” (emphasis added). Directed to “explain itself,” HUD said on Aug. 13 that some GRRP streams had resumed and that “Comprehensive” awards awaited a rule amendment moving through clearance. At a status conference later that day, Judge McElroy reportedly “called out the government for appearing to ‘slow walk’ the release of the money,” and ordered biweekly status reports.

On Aug. 27, plaintiffs reported they had “seen no indication” HUD had resumed processing “Comprehensive” awards or made “any concrete progress,” calling the update “facially insufficient,” offering “little information” on steps or timing, and leaving “little basis to conclude that HUD is not slow-walking its compliance.” In a Sept. 10 status report, the plaintiffs stated they “still have seen no indication that Defendants have resumed processing Comprehensive awards under the GRRP;” and that “a date certain for complete compliance and a clear, comprehensive timeline would aid Plaintiffs and this Court in assuring HUD is not slow-walking its compliance.

7. “Dressing their RIF in new clothes, and that they are thumbing their nose at both this Court and the Court of Appeals.”

Judge Amy Berman Jackson (Obama appointee), National Treasury Employees Union v. Vought, 1:25-cv-00381 (D.D.C.)

This case involves the Trump administration’s en masse removal of federal employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

On Mar. 28, Judge Jackson issued a preliminary injunction stating, in part, that the government (1) “shall not terminate any CFPB employee, except for cause related to the individual employee’s performance or conduct;” and (2) “shall not issue any notice of reduction-in-force [RIF] to any CFPB employee.”

On Apr. 11, the D.C. Circuit partially stayed the preliminary injunction and modified it to permit the termination and RIFs of employees who the government determined after “a particularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of defendants’ statutory duties.”

Following the DC Circuit ruling, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau quickly issued RIF notices affecting roughly 80% of its workforce. On Apr. 17, the plaintiffs submitted an emergency motion to show cause why the government had not violated the modified preliminary injunction.

The following day, Judge Jackson noted the “scope and speed” of the government’s action, “the apparent lack of consultation with the heads of the statutorily mandated agency components involved, and the troubling description of the RIF meetings,” at which one meeting Chief Legal Officer Mark Paoletta allegedly said “all that mattered was the numbers.” Judge Jackson went on to say she had:

“significant grounds for concern that the defendants are not in compliance with its Order as it was refined by the Court of Appeals. While the Chief Legal Counsel has intoned the phrase ‘particularized assessment,’ there is reason to believe that the defendants simply spent the days immediately following the Circuit’s relaxation of the Order dressing their RIF in new clothes, and that they are thumbing their nose at both this Court and the Court of Appeals.” (emphasis added).

While the government appealed, the D.C. Circuit on Apr. 28 sua sponte reinstated the original preliminary injunction’s full ban on RIFs.

On Aug. 15, a divided D.C. Circuit panel vacated the preliminary injunction on jurisdictional and APA grounds.

8. Finding of noncompliance with a federal court order; FEMA’s “covert” rebranding of an indefinite freeze

Chief Judge John J. McConnell, Jr. (Obama appointee), State of New York v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00039 (D.R.I.)

This case involves the Trump administration’s indefinite halt on wind energy project approvals and its freeze on FEMA and other federal grant disbursements pursuant to a Jan. 27 Office of Management and Budget directive.

Following a temporary restraining order, the court found on Feb. 10 that FEMA had failed to comply with its “clear and unambiguous” order, granting plaintiffs’ motion to enforce and holding that the government “continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds” in violation of the TRO’s “plain text.” (The Feb. 10 ruling reportedly marked the first case in which the administration was formally found to have failed to comply with a federal court order.) Although a preliminary injunction issued on Mar. 6 superseded the TRO and rendered the second enforcement motion moot, Judge McConnell stressed that the plaintiffs’ “unrebutted” evidence—presented after a full hearing at which the government offered “no answer, no evidence, and no counter to the States’ extensive evidence of still frozen funds”—demonstrated “irreparable and continuing harm” and expressly barred the government from reinstating the freeze “under a different name or through other means.” On Mar. 24, the plaintiffs again alleged ongoing freezes across hundreds of FEMA grant programs, and on Apr. 4 the court granted enforcement of its preliminary injunction, finding FEMA’s “manual review” process “essentially impose[d] an indefinite categorical pause on payments,” and warning that the agency could not “covertly” reinstate the freeze, ordering full compliance with the “plain text” of the injunction.

9. Agencies “actions violate the Preliminary Injunction.”

Judge Rita F. Lin (Biden appointee), Thakur v. Trump, 3:25-cv-04737 (N.D. Cal.)

This case involves a class action challenging agencies’ en masse termination (and later “suspension”) of UC research grants through form letters lacking grant-specific reasons.

On Aug. 12, Judge Lin determined that “NSF’s actions violate the Preliminary Injunction” (emphasis added). The Jun. 23 injunction had prohibited the NSF and other agencies from “giving effect to any grant termination that results in the termination of funding” of members of the class where the termination was communicated by a notice that lacked a “grant-specific explanation” and consideration of the “reliance interests at stake.” Following the injunction, NSF acted (through two letters on July 31 and Aug. 1) to purportedly “suspend” hundreds of UCLA grants, stating that the “awards no longer effectuate program goals or agency priorities” and citing campus allegations of “race discrimination,” “antisemitism,” and “bias.”

Rejecting NSF’s claim that its actions were not barred by the injunction because it suspended, rather than terminated, the grants, Judge Lin held the “‘suspensions’ were terminations by another name” and amounted to “indefinite, en masse funding cuts … without providing any avenue for the researchers to restore their funding.” She added that her injunction was “not unclear. It is not necessary for the order to describe every possible label an Agency could use to describe a research grant funding cut.” Judge Lin found that the suspension letters “suffer from the same infirmities as the letters considered in” her initial injunction as they “fail to provide a ‘grant- specific explanation’ for why the award has been terminated“ and “[fail to] provide any grant-specific explanation of NSF’s consideration of the researchers’ reliance interests.”

Accordingly, the court vacated NSF’s suspensions and ordered NSF to restore the status quo and reinstate the grants.

10. Government action “violated this Court’s order staying Petitioner’s removal”

Judges Richard J. Sullivan (Trump appointee), Alison J. Nathan (Biden appointee) and Maria Araújo Kahn (Biden appointee), Melgar-Salmeron v. Bondi, 23-7792 (2d. Cir.)

This case involves an undocumented immigrant who was removed to El Salvador despite a court order barring his removal.

On April 17, 2025, the administration moved to expedite Melgar-Salmeron’s deportation case and removal. Petitioner moved for emergency relief and requested the government be enjoined from removing him, which the Second Circuit granted on May 7.

Despite the court order barring his removal, the petitioner was placed on a flight to El Salvador 28 minutes later, which the government stated the following day was due to an administrative error. On May 12, the Second Circuit ordered the government to provide details as to the circumstances of his removal. On Jun. 24, the court ruled that the government must facilitate the Petitioner’s return from El Salvador as soon as possible. The Court explained that the government acknowledged that they had transferred the Petitioner, an alleged MS-13 member, to El Slavador on May 7, 2025 in defiance of a court order and despite assurances given to the court due to a “a confluence of administrative errors” in the government’s words. The government’s action was “improper because it violated this Court’s order staying Petitioner’s removal from the United States during the pendency of this matter before this Court,” the panel wrote (emphasis added).

11. Government counsel “make no attempt to offer any justification for their blatant lack of effort to comply;” and unrebutted claim that the government created a sui generis document as a “contrivance” to avert court ruling

Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher (Trump appointee) J.O.P. v. DHS, 8:19-cv-01944-SA (D. Md.)

Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory (Clinton recess appointee; W. Bush appointee) and Judge DeAndrea Gist Benjamin (Biden appointee), No. 25-1519 (Fourth Circuit)

This case involves an individual deported to El Salvador in alleged violation of a judicially-enforced agreement that prohibited unaccompanied minors’ removal from the United States prior to the final determination of their asylum claims.

On Apr. 23, Judge Gallagher ordered the government to facilitate the return to the United States of “Cristian,” a pseudonymous member of the class covered by the agreement who had been deported to El Salvador. At the time, Judge Gallagher wrote that “Defendants have provided no evidence, or even any specific allegations, as to how Cristian, or any other Class Member, poses a threat to public safety.” On May 1, the United States Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) produced an “Indicative Asylum Decision” asserting that, “if Cristian were returned to the United States, it would deny his asylum application based on (1) terrorist-related inadmissibility grounds . . . and (2) as a matter of discretion.” The Department of Justice presented the document to the court as demonstrating an “adjudication on the merits” that was the “precise relief” Cristian sought.

In a May 19 order denying the government’s motion for a stay of Judge Gallagher’s order pending appeal, the Fourth Circuit noted that “the Indicative Asylum Decision—created five days after the district court’s facilitation order was issued—was not an authentic change in factual circumstances. Cristian contends that neither ‘USCIS regulation, policy, [n]or practice’ provides for ‘Indicative Asylum Decisions,’” and that the decision was “a ‘litigation-driven’ document—a ‘contrivance’ ‘created just for this case. The Government has no response to this charge—a deafening silence” (emphasis added),

On May 28, Judge Gallagher issued an order finding that Defendants’ had “utterly disregarded this Court’s May 20, 2025 Order” which required Defendants to provide a status report “on the steps they have taken to facilitate the return of Cristian to the United States” before May 27. Judge Gallagher found that Defendants’ untimely response “is the functional equivalent of, ‘we haven’t done anything and don’t intend to’” and said that the Defendants had also shown “zero effort to comply” with the Court’s April 23 Order,” adding, “Defendants not only ignore the requirements of this Court’s Orders, ECF 254, 280, but also make no attempt to offer any justification for their blatant lack of effort to comply” (emphasis added).

12. “No dispute Defendants are in breach;” court also references “Defendants’ delay in curing that breach and complying with the Court’s June 10, 2025 Order.”

Judge Dana M. Sabraw (W. Bush appointee), Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 3:18-cv-00428 (S.D. Cal.)

This case involves noncompliance with a 2023 settlement made regarding a court case filed in 2018, during the first Trump administration, where the government agreed to provide reunification and other services to a class of plaintiff parents who were separated from their children at the southwest border of the United States.

On Apr. 23, members of the plaintiff class filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement, alleging that the government had refused to renew the legal services contract associated with the 2023 settlement (which committed the government to “continue to contract with an independent contractor to . . . assist Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members with necessary parole and employment authorization applications”). On Jun. 10, Judge Sabraw granted the motion to enforce on Jun. 10, granting “the remedy of specific performance in the form of a Court order requiring Defendants to reinstate their contract with Acacia to provide the services set out in the Settlement Agreement” and stating “there is no dispute Defendants are in breach” (emphasis added). On Jun. 27, Judge Sabraw issued an order following a status conference that required defendants to “set out their position on whether the Court has authority to extend the term of the Settlement Agreement given Defendants’ decisions to cancel their contracts with the previous service providers (Acacia and Seneca), the Court’s finding that Defendants are in breach of the Settlement Agreement, and Defendants’ delay in curing that breach and complying with the Court’s June 10, 2025 Order” (emphasis added).

Defendants responded by filing a Rule 60(b) motion seeking temporary relief from the court order, while plaintiffs filed a motion for immediate interim relief on July 23 that stated: “During this time, Defendants have made no meaningful steps to comply with the Court’s order enforcing the Agreement. The Class has been without legal services for almost three months and Defendants in breach for as long.” Judge Sabraw denied the defendants’ motion on July 24, while simultaneously granting an additional motion to enforce (“Defendants did not comply with the Court’s order to reinstate the task order with Acacia.”).

In an Aug. 20 joint status report, plaintiffs stated that: “Defendants intend to impose new limitations on Acacia’s provision of legal services that are inconsistent with the Settlement Agreement. Under its previous contract, Acacia accepted referrals for legal services of pro bono screenings from any source. … The new contract, however, requires that Acacia accept new referrals only from the Executive Office for Immigration Review” (emphasis added). On Aug. 22, Judge Sabraw found such conditions “contrary to the spirit and purpose of the Settlement Agreement and this Court’s June 10, 2025 Order granting Plaintiffs’ renewed motion to enforce that Agreement” and ordered that they “should not be part of the parties’ ongoing negotiations.” (emphasis added).

The case is currently on appeal to the Ninth Circuit.

13. “[I]t appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without actually ceasing the challenged conduct. The court can think of few things more disingenuous.”

Judge Loren L. AliKhan (Biden appointee), National Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Management and Budget, 1:25-cv-00239 (D.D.C.)

This case involves OMB’s memo requiring federal agencies to pause any activities related to President Donald Trump’s executive orders.

On Jan. 28, the court granted an administrative stay: “During the pendency of the stay, Defendants shall refrain from implementing OMB Memorandum M-25-13 with respect to the disbursement of Federal funds under all open awards.”

On Feb. 3, Judge AliKhan granted a temporary restraining order on the memo’s implementation, stating:

“For Defendants to innocently claim that OMB’s poststay actions were merely a noble attempt to ‘end[] confusion,’ strains credulity. By rescinding the memorandum that announced the freeze, but ‘NOT . . . the federal funding freeze’ itself, it appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without actually ceasing the challenged conduct. The court can think of few things more disingenuous. Preventing a defendant from evading judicial review under such false pretenses is precisely why the voluntary cessation doctrine exists. The rescission, if it can be called that, appears to be nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to prevent this court from granting relief.” (citations omitted) (emphasis added).

14. Defendants “have not complied with the … TRO,” efforts to “evade [the preliminary injunction’s] terms through post-hoc explanations.”

Judge Amir H. Ali (Biden appointee) AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. USAID, 1:25-cv-00400 (D.D.C.) and Global Health Council v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00402 (D.D.C.) (related cases)

These two cases involve challenges to the Trump administration’s suspension of USAID funding.

On Feb. 20 Judge Ali granted in part the plaintiffs’ emergency motion to enforce the temporary restraining order “to the extent Defendants have not complied with the terms of the TRO,” namely, by “continu[ing] their blanket suspension of funds pending review of agreements, the very action that the TRO enjoined” and by seeking to “search for and invoke new legal authorities as a post-hoc rationalization for the en masse suspension” or to “replace their earlier implementations with ‘other directives’ to ‘suspend[], paus[e], or otherwise prevent[] the obligation or disbursement of appropriated foreign-assistance funds’” (emphasis added). The court did not make a finding of contempt, as requested by the plaintiffs, citing “Defendants’ explicit recognition that ‘prompt compliance with the order’ is required.”

On Feb. 24, plaintiffs in Global Health Council v. Trump filed a renewed emergency motion to enforce the TRO. At the close of the Feb. 25 hearing, Judge Ali granted the motion and adopted plaintiffs’ proposed relief, ordering by 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 26 that defendants “pay all invoices and letter of credit drawdown requests” for work completed before the Feb. 13 TRO; “permit and promptly pay” drawdowns and reimbursements on grants and assistance agreements; and “take no actions to impede” and “take all necessary action to ensure the prompt payment of appropriated foreign assistance funds.” The court also required that the joint status report due noon on Feb. 26 confirm steps taken and that disbursements would be made by 11:59 p.m. that day, and directed defendants to provide by noon any “directives or guidance” sent since Feb. 13 concerning TRO implementation or suspensions/terminations. Noting that the record showed payments remained frozen, the court observed: “Defendants have not rebutted that evidence, and when asked today, defendants were not able to provide any specific examples of unfreezing funds pursuant to the Court’s TRO” (emphasis added).

On July 21, following a Mar. 10 preliminary injunction—which ordered the government not to withhold payment for work performed before Feb. 13—the court granted in part the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce. “The Court’s preliminary injunction did not include any exception for Defendants to evade its terms through post hoc explanations for terminations, and the Court has previously rejected similar attempts by Defendants.” The court stated that the government “must promptly take steps to come into compliance as to the awards at issue.” It otherwise denied or deferred further relief pending the D.C. Circuit’s decision of the government’s appeal.

15. “Manifestly unreasonable” and “contrived” reading of injunction, “border[ing] on violating Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)” and “deserving of … reprimands”

Judge Lauren King (Biden appointee), State of Washington v. Trump, 2:25-cv-00244 (W.D. Wash.)

This case involves several states suing to enjoin an Executive Order directing agencies to cut off federal research and education grants to medical institutions, including hospitals and medical schools, that provide gender-affirming care.

On Feb. 28, Judge King granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, except as to a small Section 8(a) of the Executive Order.

On Mar, 6, plaintiffs submitted a motion to hold defendants in contempt of court, alleging that the government tried to circumvent the preliminary injunction by falsely claiming actions taken to withhold funding under the enjoined EOs were actually taken pursuant to other policies.

On Mar. 17, Judge King denied plaintiffs’ motion for contempt, granted expedited discovery on the question of whether the actions were taken pursuant to the enjoined EOs, and criticized the government for its “unreasonable interpretation of the Court’s orders.” He wrote:

“The Court first addresses Defendants’ unreasonable interpretation of the Court’s orders. Defendants argue that the Court ‘enjoined enforcement of Sections 3(e) or 3(g) of the [Gender Ideology] EO only as to “gender-affirming care” as that term is used in the [Medical Services] EO’—i.e., only as to the four Listed Services. This interpretation borders on violating Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). … Despite Defendants’ contrived arguments to the contrary, … it is clear from the Court’s preliminary injunction order that “gender-affirming care” includes all [various forms of gender-affirming set out in the preliminary injunction]. … In sum, it was manifestly unreasonable for Defendants to ‘understand this Court’s enjoinment of Section[s] 3[(e) and (g)] of the [Gender Ideology] EO . . . to exclude . . . care other than the Listed Services.’ …

Defendants also adopt an unreasonably narrow and self-serving view of what constitutes ‘care,’ arguing that research studies categorically cannot include the provision of care. Such an interpretation appears to be deliberately ignorant: it is common knowledge that research studies frequently involve patient care. …

Defendants’ unreasonable and self-serving interpretation of the Court’s orders is certainly deserving of the above reprimands, as well as a warning that the Court may impose sanctions for any future violations of Rule 11, other Federal Rules, the Local Civil Rules, or its orders. The Court further orders counsel for Defendants to correct their unreasonable interpretation of the Court’s orders.” (emphasis added).

Granting expedited discovery, the court said, “NIH’s communications have raised substantial questions regarding whether the March 4, 2025 federal funding revocation occurred as part of enforcement of the Gender Ideology EO in contravention of the Court’s preliminary injunction.” But finding enough had not been presented to establish contempt, the court said, the “evidence raises the possibility that the March 4 revocation of grant funding was effected pursuant [the EO] for an enjoined purpose. But a mere possibility that an action violates a court order is not enough to establish contempt.”

On April 30, plaintiffs moved to compel discovery and catalogued evidence of alleged noncompliance, but by then NIH had already reinstated the terminated grant on Mar. 27, after the court authorized expedited discovery; defendants argued that reinstatement rendered the contempt-related discovery moot. On June 16, the court agreed and denied the motion to compel as moot, adding that plaintiffs’ fallback request for monetary contempt sanctions could not keep the issue live because sovereign immunity bars such awards absent an express waiver.

16. Government at “risk [of] being held in contempt” for disregard of discovery orders, and later “failed to comply” with submitting declaration.

Judge Edward M. Chen (Obama appointee), National TPS Alliance v. Noem, 3:25-cv-01766 (N.D. Cal.)

This case involves the Trump administration’s decision to terminate temporary protected status for Venezuelans in the United States.

On May 19, Judge Chen warned the government it was at “risk [of] being held in contempt” due to their disregard for the court’s discovery orders. He wrote:

“To be clear, the Court’s discovery order requiring production today still stands. Defendants are expected to comply with that order unless and until the Court rules otherwise. The Supreme Court’s decision stayed the Court’s postponement order but did not stay the litigation on the merits. Defendants risk being held in contempt of Court if they do not comply with the Court’s discovery order.” (emphasis added).

On May 29, 2025, the court held a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion regarding alleged noncompliance with discovery orders. The court ordered the defendants to “immediately ask the 20 custodians at issue whether they used communication means outside of government email and OneDrive with respect to the TPS decisions (e.g., nongovernment email, text messaging, hard drive),” and further required that “[b]y 6/3/2025, the government shall file a declaration(s) from a person(s) with personal knowledge certifying that the inquiry was made and what the responses of each of the custodians were.” On June 4, the plaintiffs filed a notice of noncompliance with the court’s order to file declarations by June 3. On June 5, the Court ordered that the “government has failed to comply with the Court’s order and has not given a specific date by which it will comply. The Court orders the government to provide the declaration previously ordered by today, June 5” (emphasis added).

Note: Similar to National TPS Alliance v. Noem, in other cases courts have found the government did not comply with judicial orders to submit filings or other documents. See, e.g., Judge Timothy J. Kelly (Trump appointee), OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates v, Rubio, 1:25-cv-00287 (D.D.C.) (Minute order stating that “Defendants’ continuing inexplicable failure to comply with the Court’s 6 Standing Order, Defendants have not shown good cause for a further extension.”).

Chapter 2. Court Distrust of Government Information and Representations

Introduction

A core aspect of executive officials “properly discharg[ing] their official duties,” and thus being entitled to a presumption of regularity, is those officials telling judges the truth. Accordingly, if the government evinces an extensive inability to provide courts with accurate explanations and truthful information, the application of the presumption accordingly loses the basis for its support. In this Chapter, we document over 35 cases in which courts have identified serious defects in the government’s explanations and representations—pretextual rationales (including retaliatory motives masked by pretext), false sworn statements, contradictions with the record, refusals or inability to answer basic questions, and litigation-driven “contrivances”—prompting judges to discount government submissions, compel expedited discovery, and withhold the presumption.

A. General

1. “Obscur[ing] from the Court” and “refusing to provide any helpful information” while “rapidly dispatching removal flights”

Chief Judge James Boasberg (W. Bush appointee; Obama appointee), J.G.G. v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00766 (D.D.C.)

This case involves the Trump administration’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.

On Apr. 3, Judge Boasberg repeatedly asked the government’s counsel for information on the flights the administration was using to transport alleged gang members to El Salvador, and was told that the DOJ had no additional information. In an Apr. 16 memorandum opinion finding probable cause for criminal contempt, Boasberg wrote that he believed “that the Government might be rapidly dispatching removal flights in an apparent effort to evade judicial review while also refusing to provide any helpful information.” He added, “Those later-discovered flight movements, however, were obscured from the Court when the hearing resumed shortly after 6:00 p.m. because the Government surprisingly represented that it still had no flight details to share.”

2. Placing attorney on leave for his compliance with “the duty of candor to the court”

Judge Stephanie Thacker (Obama appointee), Judge Robert King (Clinton appointee), Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 25-1345 (4th Cir.)

This case challenged the Trump administration’s acknowledged wrongful removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.

In an April 7 order, the Fourth Circuit noted that the government attorney in the district court hearings, in accordance with his duty of candor to the court, acknowledged parts of the administrative record not in the government’s favor, but, as a result, the Justice Department placed him on administrative leave.

“Consistent with this reality, the Government attorney appearing before the district court at the April 4 hearing candidly admitted that no order of removal is part of the record in this case,” the Fourth Circuit wrote. The judges also noted that the government attorney conceded, consistent with an ICE official’s Declaration, that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed from the United States due to a immigration court order prohibiting his transfer to El Salvador.

The Fourth Circuit made an unusual statement in writing: “in response to the candid responses by the Government attorney to the district court’s inquiry, that attorney has been put on administrative leave, ostensibly for lack of ‘zealous[] advocacy.’ . . . But, the duty of zealous representation is tempered by the duty of candor to the court, among other ethical obligations, and the duty to uphold the rule of law, particularly on the part of a Government attorney.”

3. Providing “highly misleading, if not intentionally false” sworn declaration to the court; “so disingenuous that the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything”

Judge Amy Berman Jackson (Obama appointee), National Treasury Employees Union v. Vought, 1:25-cv-00381 (D.D.C.)

This case involves the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

In a March 28 opinion granting a preliminary injunction, Judge Jackson scolded the government for a false sworn declaration:

“This rosy depiction of events, designed to assuage the Court, was accompanied by the February 24, 2025 Declaration of Adam Martinez, the Chief Operating Officer of the CFPB, First Martinez Decl., which was a carefully worded and highly selective account that was immediately contradicted by a second series of declarations and exhibits submitted by the plaintiffs. The defendants’ witness was then placed in the awkward position of submitting another declaration, in which he acknowledged the accuracy of the facts set forth by plaintiffs’ declarants, including their accounts of his own statements, but he still voiced the assurance that the agency was complying with its statutory obligations.” (emphasis added).

Jackson concluded:

“It is now clear to the Court that the omissions from the first declaration rendered it to be highly misleading, if not intentionally false. Defendants’ initial effort to persuade the Court in their opposition that employees were hard at work on their statutory duties even after they were ordered to stand down on February 10 has been shown to be unreliable and inconsistent with the agency’s own contemporaneous records, and the defendants’ eleventh hour attempt to suggest immediately before the hearing that the stop work order was not really a stop work order at all was so disingenuous that the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything.” (emphasis added).

4. Providing pretext for motion to dismiss an indictment

Judge Dale Ho (Biden appointee), United States v. Adams, 1:24-cr-00556 (S.D.N.Y.):

This case involves the Department of Justice’s effort to dismiss its own indictment of Mayor Eric Adams.

On Apr. 2, Judge Ho wrote that the government’s stated rationale (that there was an appearance of impropriety in bringing the case) was “unsupported by any objective evidence” and “appears pretextual.” Instead, the court concluded the true rationale appeared to be a quid pro quo. Judge Ho wrote: “Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.”

5. “Defendants’ plea for a presumption of good faith rings hollow when their own actions contradict their representations.”

Judge Loren L. Alikhan (Biden appointee), National Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Management and Budget, 1:25-cv-00239-LLA (D.D.C.)

This case involves a memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requiring federal agencies to pause any activities implicated by executive orders.

On Feb. 3, Judge Alikhan granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the administration from implementing the directives in the OMB memorandum and requiring the administration to provide written notice to all relevant agencies. In the order, stated:

“Defendants claim that they have ended any allegedly unlawful activity by retracting memorandum M-25-13. Even taking the rescission at face value, however, Defendants have not convincingly shown that they will refrain from “resum[ing] the challenged activity” in the future. As evidenced by the White House Press Secretary’s statements, OMB and the various agencies it communicates with appear committed to restricting federal funding. If Defendants retracted the memorandum in name only while continuing to execute its directives, it is far from ‘absolutely clear’ that the conduct is gone for good.”

“Defendants … protest that such a conclusion ‘would be contrary to the presumption of good faith that courts routinely accord the government when assessing voluntary cessation.’… Here, Defendants’ plea for a presumption of good faith rings hollow when their own actions contradict their representations.”

6. Providing false sworn declarations about “hotly contested” material fact; “The Court was given false information, upon which it relied, twice, to the detriment of a party at risk of serious and irreparable harm.”

Judge Brian E. Murphy (Biden appointee), D.V.D. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 1:25-cv-10676 (D. Mass.)

This case involves, inter alia, the removal of O.C.G., a Guatemalan national, to Mexico without a “meaningful opportunity” to raise a fear-of-torture claim.

In opposing plaintiffs’ request for emergency relief, DOJ submitted a sworn declaration by an assistant field office director for ICE’s Phoenix Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), stating that on or about Feb. 21—just prior to O.C.G.’s removal—ERO officers verbally asked whether he feared return to Mexico, and that O.C.G. “stated he was not afraid.” DOJ counsel repeated this claim in briefing opposing the motion for a preliminary injunction. As a result, in its Apr. 18 order, the court declined to direct O.C.G.’s return—citing a “hotly contested” factual dispute between the government’s “hearsay” declaration and O.C.G.’s sworn account (that he was never asked and begged to speak to his attorney)—and ordered expedited discovery.

However, on May 16, 2025—during the course of that discovery, and just hours before the ICE official who submitted the declaration was scheduled to be deposed—DOJ filed a “Notice of Errata” retracting the declaration and admitting that it could not “identify any officer who asked O.C.G. whether he had a fear of return to Mexico[, nor could it identify] the officer who O.C.G. states ‘told [him] that he was being deported to Mexico.’” The government acknowledged that its prior misrepresentation was based not on direct communication but on a data entry in ICE’s ENFORCE Alien Removal Module database.

In its May 23, 2025 order granting a preliminary injunction directing the government to “take all immediate steps … to facilitate the return of O.C.G. to the United States,” the court censured the government in strong terms: “Finally, it must be said that, while mistakes obviously happen, the events leading up to this decision are troubling. The Court was given false information, upon which it relied, twice, to the detriment of a party at risk of serious and irreparable harm.”

O.C.G. was subsequently able to return to the United States.

7. Providing the court with “the sorriest statement I’ve ever seen;” “This is a terrible, terrible affidavit. If this were before me in a criminal case and you were asking to get a warrant issue on this, I’d throw you out of my chambers.”

Judge Leonie M. Brinkema (Clinton appointee), Sanchez Puentes v. Charles, 1:25-cv-00509 (E.D. Va.)

This case involves a habeas challenge by a Venezuelan couple, whom ICE detained in March 2025 (while they held Temporary Protected Status) based on allegations that they were members of Tren de Aragua.

At a Mar. 28, 2025 hearing granting the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Judge Brinkema criticized the affidavit of an ICE assistant director—the government’s only evidence offered to justify detention on the basis that the couple were alleged Tren de Aragua members—stating:

“[I]t is the sorriest statement I’ve ever seen. First of all, it’s pure hearsay. … This is a terrible, terrible affidavit. If this were before me in a criminal case and you were asking to get a warrant issue on this, I’d throw you out of my chambers. No agent should do this type of editorializing, not when people’s liberty is at stake. I expect more from the government than this kind of very shoddy work. This is assumptions and putting words in people’s mouths. … I was shocked when I saw it.”

8. “This Court takes clear offense to Respondents wasting judicial resources to admit to the Court it has no evidence;” “contradict[ing] themselves throughout the entire record;” providing “shoddy affidavits and contradictory testimony.”

Judge David Briones (Clinton appointee), Sanchez Puentes v. Garite, 3:25-cv-00127 (W.D. Tex.)

This case also involves a habeas corpus challenge by a Venezuelan couple whom the government alleged to be Tren de Aragua members.

On April 21, denying the government’s motion to extend time to respond to the petitioners’ amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Judge Briones said:

“To date, Respondents have not provided this Court with a single reason as to why Petitioners have been designated as Alien Enemies. To date, Respondents have not provided this Court with a single reason as to whether Petitioners’ ‘circumstances have materially change[d]’ which would warrant rearrest and incarceration by ICE. To date, Respondents have not provided the Court with any information that would be materially helpful in determining whether Petitioners are being unlawfully detained in violation of their TPS protections during the appeal period. Respondents have known about the instant habeas petition for at least six days. Respondents could have filed their response, which was due on April 21, 2025, providing the Court with even a reason or two as two (sic) why Petitioners’ habeas petition should be denied, while also requesting an extension of time, but rather than putting in the slightest bit of effort, Respondents instead just asked for more time. To date, Respondents have not provided the Court with anything useful.”

On April 25, granting the petitioners petition for amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Judge Briones wrote:

“Respondents declare, without providing this Court with a single piece of meaningful evidence, that ‘Petitioners are members of Tren de Aragua.’ … Of great concern to this Court is that Respondents contradict themselves throughout the entire record. … [T]he April 23, 2025 Habeas Corpus hearing in this Court, Respondents and the Government based the entirety of their case on multiple levels of hearsay, hidden within declarations of declarants who have no personal knowledge about the facts they are attesting to. … What is astonishing is that these declarants cannot even so much as identify what government official did receive the alleged information directly. Respondents ask this Court to accept their claims, going off of nearly nothing, to substantiate their mammoth claims. … The Court would not accept this evidence even in a case where only nominal damages were at stake, let alone what is at stake here. Beyond these shoddy affidavits and contradictory testimony, Respondents haven’t provided “membership” at all as it relates to Petitioner Sanchez Garcia … This Court takes clear offense to Respondents wasting judicial resources to admit to the Court it has no evidence, yet seek to have this Court determine Petitioner Sanchez Puentes is “guilty by association.” This Court found no need to even allow closing arguments as to Petitioner Sanchez Puentes at the April 23, 2025 Habeas Corpus Hearing. … It is this Court’s finding that Respondents’ Response and testimony was replete with conclusions, declarations, and accusations, completely and wholly unsubstantiated by anything meaningful in the record.

9. Failure to answer interrogatories and mischaracterization of Supreme Court opinion

Judge Paula Xinis (Obama appointee), Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.)

This case involves the government’s admission that the administration unlawfully sent Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.

On Apr. 22, Judge Xinis strongly criticized the Justice Department’s failure to answer the plaintiff’s interrogatories – which the court described as “a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations” as well as the government’s “continued mischaracterization of the Supreme Court’s Order.”

Note: The Justice Department’s mischaracterization of the Supreme Court’s order included misquoting what the Supreme Court said.

The DOJ filing stated: “Defendants object to Interrogatory No. 3 as based on the false premise that the United States can or has been ordered to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador. See Abrego Garcia, 604 U.S.—, slip op. at 2 (holding Defendants should ‘take all available steps to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United State [sic]’) (emphasis added).”

The Supreme Court had stated: “The order properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”

10. Solicitor General providing inaccurate information to the U.S. Supreme Court

Judge Susan Illston (Clinton appointee), American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, 3:25-cv-03698 (N.D. Cal.)

This case involves reductions in force across several departments and agencies.

On Jul. 28, in an unusual step, the district court judge submitted a statement to the Ninth Circuit explaining that the U.S. Solicitor General had presented overstated figures to the U.S. Supreme Court in a stay application in the litigation. The Government had claimed that the district court injunction prohibiting reductions in force of government employees included several agencies and positions that were not actually subject to the injunction. Judge Illston called the discrepancy “not insignificant,” and said it underscored the need for accurate fact-finding overriding any deliberative-process privilege.

11. “Flip-flopping—in sworn declarations—rais[ing] severe concern,” “consistently refused to give … the full story,” providing “cagey answers,” and “omit[ting] key information”

Judge Royce C. Lamberth (Reagan appointee), Abramowitz. v. Lake,1:25-cv-00887 (D.D.C.) and Widakuswara. v. Lake, 1:25-cv-01015 (D.D.C.) (related cases)

This cases involve the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the firing of journalists from the Voice of America (VOA) media outlet. In a July 30 show-cause order addressing both cases, Judge Lamberth wrote that the government had

“consistently refused to give the Court the full story regarding personnel actions. … the defendants continue to provide cagey answers and omit key information. … And perhaps more shockingly, on July 8—the day this Court ordered a second round of supplemental briefing, and a full ten days before the defendants filed the second supplemental memorandum—the defendants informed Plaintiff Michael Abramowitz that he would be removed from his position as Director of VOA. … However, the defendants made no mention of this monumental personnel decision in their filings to this Court.” (emphasis added).

Lamberth further wrote that the government was

“providing misleading and contradictory information … The defendants’ descriptions of their activities are cryptic and even misleading … And troublingly, the crumbs of data provided suggest the defendants are ignoring several statutory mandates. … [T]he defendants have also made contradictory representations to the Court. … This sort of flip-flopping—in sworn declarations— raises severe concern and provides yet another basis for entering a show cause order for the defendants to provide a truthful, accurate, and detailed plan regarding VOA’s ongoing operations.” (emphasis added).

12. “The ‘administrative record’ submitted by the government is a sham. It does not facilitate judicial review: It frustrates it;” judge calls out government for “lie” in termination letters, and for DOJ preventing testimony because “afraid … would reveal the truth”

Judge William Alsup (Clinton appointee) American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. United States Office of Personnel Management, 3:25-cv-01780 (N.D. Cal.)

This case involves the government’s efforts to significantly reduce the federal workforce’s probationary employees via termination letters that criticized workers’ “performance.”

At a Mar. 13 hearing in which Judge Alsup issued an injunction from the bench, the court criticized the administration, calling the letters a “gimmick” and saying, “It is sad – a sad day – when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie. … That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.” In a subsequent memorandum opinion, the court elaborated that the OPM’s template termination letter claiming performance problems “was an obvious pretext intended to obstruct appeal and avoid statutory and regulatory reduction-in-force procedures (for example, the honoring of veteran preferences in the order of retention).”

At the Mar. 13 hearing, responding to the government’s apparent gamesmanship—namely, submitting OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell’s sworn declaration that asserted OPM did not direct the firings, then withdrawing it and refusing to produce him for court-ordered cross-examination—Judge Alsup admonished DOJ, saying, “You can’t just say, ‘Here’s the declaration. You have to accept it without question’ whenever there is a question.” He continued:

“You will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. You’re afraid to do so because you know cross-examination would reveal the truth. … This is the U.S. District Court. Whenever you submit declarations, those people should be submitted to cross-examination, just like the plaintiffs’ side should be. … [T]hen we get at the truth of whether that’s what — your story is actually true. I tend to doubt it. I tend to doubt that you’re telling me the truth whenever we hear all the evidence eventually. … And you withdrew his declaration rather than do that? Come on. That’s a sham. Go ahead. I’m — it upsets me. I want you to know that. I’ve been practicing or serving in this court for over 50 years, and I know how we get at the truth. And you’re not helping me get at the truth. You’re giving me press releases, sham documents. All right. I’m getting mad at you and I shouldn’t. You’re trying to do your best, and I apologize.” (emphasis added).

On Sept. 12, the district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs. The court wrote:

“The ‘administrative record’ submitted by the government is a sham. It does not facilitate judicial review: It frustrates it. …

The ‘quote’ proffered by government counsel James D. Todd Jr. is a fabrication. … The result: A statement concerning OPM authored and approved exemption categories becomes, by brackets, ellipses, and government counsel’s chicanery, a shot through the heart of plaintiffs’ case. Counsel’s ersatz evidence fails to persuade.” (emphasis added).

13. Presenting military experts who misrepresented multiple studies

Judge Ana Reyes (Biden appointee), Talbott v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00240 (D.D.C.)

This case involves the Trump administration’s efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, and to dishonorably discharge currently serving transgender service members.

During a March 12, 2025 hearing, Judge Ana Reyes criticized how the Justice Department invoked a 2021 AMSARA report, a Department of Defense accession research study that appeared in DoD’s own Action Memo but did not support the government’s asserted justifications. Reyes asked the DOJ’s attorney, “Should I defer to the military experts who cherry-picked one part of this study, misrepresented even that and ignored the rest of it, and ignored the obvious import of it?” The court noted the study was actually used to support the Biden era policy of including transgender personnel.

In a March 18 memorandum opinion, Judge Reyes further underscored the government’s Action Memo had misrepresented several studies to justify the transgender military ban. The court said its summary of the AMSARA report was “inexplicably misleading,” since the data actually showed transgender troops performing “similar or better” in 10 of 11 categories. Likewise, its summary of the 2025 Medical Literature Review was so distorted that “no one summarizing the Review in good faith could draw these conclusions.” On cost, the court rejected reliance on a bare number “devoid of any context or analysis,” warning that if such reasoning were accepted “courts would have to accept any cost amount the military cites to justify any policy.”

14. Providing false and incomplete information concerning DOGE’s leadership and authorities

Judge Theodore D. Chuang (Obama appointee), J. Doe 4 v. Musk, 8:25-cv-00462 (D. Md)

Judge Tanya S. Chutkan (Obama appointee), New Mexico v. Musk, 25-cv-429 (D.D.C.)

Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly (Reagan appointee; Clinton appointee), Alliance for Retired Americans v. Bessent, 1:25-cv-00313 (D.D.C.)

This cases involve challenges to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s activities and, at the time, Elon Musk’s constitutional authority.

Across different cases, judges critiqued the Trump administration for its failure to provide straightforward answers regarding DOGE’s leadership and authority.

Feb 17: False claim that Musk was not head of DOGE, and false claim that DOGE did not have authority over personnel actions:

On Feb. 17, Joshua Fisher, the Director of the White House Office of Administration, stated in a sworn declaration in New Mexico v. Musk that Elon Musk was a Senior Advisor to the President and was not employed by or the administrator of DOGE. Fisher also stated that Musk’s role gave him “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself. Mr. Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President’s directives.” In an accompanying notice, the Department of Justice asserted that they were “not aware of any source of legal authority granting” DOGE “the power to order personnel actions at any of the agencies” in question, and that “[n]either of the President’s Executive Orders regarding ‘DOGE’ contemplate—much less furnish—such authority.”

In a Feb. 18 opinion denying a motion for a temporary restraining order against DOGE, Judge Chutkan implicitly rejected Fisher’s declaration, noting that “Elon Musk directs the work of DOGE personnel but is formally classified as a ‘special government employee.’” In a footnote, Chutkan further wrote that the “plain text” of the DOGE Executive Orders “‘contemplates’ DOGE’s authority over personnel actions. Defense counsel is reminded of their duty to make truthful representations to the court” (emphasis added).

In a separate case, Judge Chuang would also go on to more directly reject the Fisher sworn declaration in favor of the plaintiffs’ evidence finding that “Musk was, at a minimum, likely the official performing the duties and functions of the USDS Administrator.”

Feb. 24: Inability or refusal to inform court who was head of DOGE at the time:

On Feb. 24, Judge Kollar-Kotelly repeatedly asked Justice Department attorney Bradley Humphreys who was the head of DOGE while it was a component of the Office of Management and Budget and whether that person was a Schedule C government employee. Humphreys repeatedly said that he did not know the answer. Humphreys also said that he could not answer what Musk’s role was in DOGE, who was the current administrator of DOGE, or even whether there was a person acting as DOGE administrator.

Feb 28: Inability or refusal to inform court who was head of DOGE before Gleason:

On Feb. 28, after the administration had identified Amy Gleason as the head of DOGE, Judge Chuang asked a government attorney to identify who had led DOGE before Gleason and to clarify Musk’s role with the government. The government attorney repeatedly said he could not answer Judge Chuang’s question.

Judge Chuang: Who was the head of DOGE before Amy Gleason?

Government counsel: I can’t answer that, I don’t know.

Judge Chuang: I mean, that seems like a knowable fact, doesn’t it?

Government counsel: I’m sure it is knowable; I just don’t know it. …

Judge Chuang: Have you asked anyone?

Government counsel: I have not asked …. Actually, strike that. I have asked previously, and I was not able to get [an] answer.

During the hearing, Judge Chuang said, “The plaintiffs are saying Musk was the head of DOGE. You’re saying he wasn’t, but we can’t tell you who was, which admittedly is highly suspicious . . . I’m not saying that you’re not being candid, but the whole operation raises questions.”

In a May 27 memorandum opinion denying the administration’s motion to dismiss charges against DOGE and Musk in New Mexico v. Musk, Judge Chutkan also rejected the government’s representations regarding DOGE’s leadership. In the order, Judge Chutkan wrote that the government had “unsuccessfully attempt[ed] to minimize Musk’s role, framing him as a mere advisor without any formal authority,” and that the “States have sufficiently pleaded that [Musk’s] position qualifi",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design_page-00011-e1757859252531.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 10:56:50.731676

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

The Israeli military yesterday announced it had struck multiple high-rise buildings in Gaza City, in what appeared to be an accelerating assault on the metropolitan area. Hospital officials in Gaza say Israeli strikes have killed more than 130 Palestinians since Saturday. According to Israeli officials, the military ground operation into Gaza City could begin as early as today. Ibrahim Dahman, Eugenia Yosef, Tim Lister, Eyad Kourdi, Oren Liebermann, and Mostafa Salem report for CNN.

Israel gave the United States notice of last week’s strike on Qatar minutes before the attack, “so close to actual launching of missiles that there was no way to reverse or halt the order,” a senior U.S. defense official tells the Wall Street Journal. Israel launched the long-range missiles on a high trajectory that avoided Saudi Arabia’s airspace, U.S. officials add. Shelby Holliday, Michael R. Gordon, Lara Seligman, and Summer Said report.

Prior to the Doha strike, Israel’s external intelligence agency, the Mossad, had declined to carry out a plan for ground operatives to kill senior Hamas leaders in Qatar, in part due to concerns the attack could rupture the agency’s relationship with the Qataris, Israeli sources said. The Mossad’s refusal to conduct a ground operation influenced how the strike was carried out, the sources add. Gerry Shih, Shira Rubin, Karen DeYoung, and Souad Mekhennet report for the Washington Post.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — REGIONAL RESPONSE

Qatar will today host an emergency summit of Arab and Islamic heads of state in response to Israel’s attack on Hamas officials in Doha. A draft resolution reviewed by Reuters condemns what it describes as Israel’s “genocide, ethnic cleansing, starvation, siege, and colonizing activities and expansion policies.” Arab foreign ministers met in Doha yesterday to lay the groundwork for today’s summit, the New York Times reports. Hugo Bachega and Jaroslav Lukiv report for BBC News; Jana Choukeir and Andrew Mills report; Vivian Nereim and Aaron Boxerman report.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

The U.N. General Assembly on Friday voted 142-10 to endorse a declaration outlining “tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps” toward a two-state solution between Palestine and Israel ahead of the Sept. 22 meeting during which the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, and Belgium are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Reuters reports.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Romania intercepted a Russian drone within Romanian airspace on Saturday, Romania’s defense ministry announced in a statement “firmly condemnin[ing] the irresponsible actions” of Russia.

Daria Tarasova-Markina, Cristiana Moisescu, and Sophie Tanno report for CNN.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

President Trump on Saturday said he will only impose new sanctions on Russia if all NATO members do the same, stop buying Russian oil, and collectively impose tariffs of 50% to 100% on China. On Friday, Trump also suggested his patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin is “running out fast.” Maggie Haberman reports for the New York Times; Lauren Kent and Darya Tarasova report for CNN.

The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, yesterday accused Moscow of “reckless escalation,” describing a Russian drone’s incursion into Romania’s airspace as “yet another unacceptable breach of an E.U. member state’s sovereignty.” Jin Yu Young and Anton Troianovski report for the New York Times.

The Group of Seven states’ finance ministers on Friday discussed further sanctions on Russia and potential tariffs on countries “enabling” Moscow’s war in Ukraine, according to a statement from Canada. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that during the call, he had invited the ministers to join the United States in imposing tariffs on countries that purchase Russian oil. David Lawder reports for Reuters.

NATO has launched a new mission to bolster the alliance’s eastern defenses following Russia’s incursion into Polish airspace, Secretary-General Mark Rutte has announced. The new operation, named Eastern Sentry, will draw on resources France, Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom provided in recent days, Rutte added. Laurence Norman and Michael R. Gordon report for the Wall Street Journal.

Alyssa Lukpat and Joe Barrett report for the Wall Street Journal; Christal Hayes and Regan Morris report for BBC News.

The Trump administration last week asked Congress to approve $58 million in emergency funding for Supreme Court security, citing a surge in threats to public officials that followed Kirk’s killing, according to the New York Times. Robert Jimison reports.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Penske Media, the owner of Rolling Stone, Billboard, and Variety, sued Google on Friday over AI-generated summaries that appear on top of its search results.

Chase Difeliciantonio reports for POLITICO; Tyler Katzenberger reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump administration health officials plan to link Covid-19 vaccines to the deaths of 25 children, sources say. The findings appear to be based on information submitted to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which contains unverified reports of side effects or bad experiences with vaccines. The officials plan to include the claim in a presentation to influential Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisers this week, a source adds. Lena H. Sun, Rachel Roubein, and Dan Diamond report for the Washington Post.

Federal investigators had grounds to believe they would find classified records while searching former national security adviser John Bolton’s home due to what they learned about a foreign adversary hacking his email years ago, a search warrant affidavit released on Friday shows. Katelyn Polantz, Zachary Cohen, and Kristen Holmes report for CNN.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Trump administration’s mass firing of probationary employees earlier this year was illegal, a federal judge ruled on Friday, finding that the terminations came at the direction of the personnel office and not the agencies with the authority to fire employees. The judge did not order the administration to reinstate the fired employees to their jobs, however, as “too much water has now passed under the bridge.” Eileen Sullivan reports for the New York Times.

A federal judge on Friday issued an order temporarily restraining the Department of Housing and Urban Development from changing the rules of a program providing funding to build houses for homeless families and individuals. The nonprofit organizations behind the lawsuit allege the rules change is intended to advance partisan goals. Michael Casey reports for AP News.

The Trump administration’s deportation of a group of African nationals to Ghana “with a wink and a nod” appears to be “truly disingenuous,” a federal judge said during a Friday hearing. The lawyers for the immigrants, who filed a lawsuit challenging the deportations earlier in the day, allege the U.S. officials deported their clients to Ghana only for Ghana to prepare to re-deport them to their countries of origin.

Like other Chicagoans, Pilsen residents have tended to be reliable Democrats.","The streets of the Pilsen neighborhood, a few miles southwest of downtown Chicago, are ordinarily bustling in September with house parties and cookouts in the weeks surrounding Mexican Independence Day.

But after the Trump administration announced the start of a crackdown on illegal immigration in Chicago, few of the usual vendors were hawking tamales or cups of elote in the neighborhood last week in Pilsen. People came out briefly for an annual parade, but hours later, only a single car was honking its way down 18th Street waving Mexican flags. Cashiers and business owners lamented that they were waiting for customers who never came.

Residents of Pilsen, which has been home to Mexican immigrants to the Midwest for decades, said the threat of raids had upended their neighborhood. They spoke of undocumented relatives and neighbors who now are mostly staying at home, and of a broad sense of worry — but also of renewed solidarity.

The Department of Homeland Security has focused on the Chicago area since last week, as part of an effort that it is calling Operation Midway Blitz. That operation has netted the arrests of several people, including some accused of robbery, assault and other violent crimes, the agency has said. In a Chicago suburb on Friday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot a man during a vehicle stop, after the man struck and dragged an officer with his car as he fled, the agency said.

Chicagoans throughout the city have been watchful for ICE agents and vehicles, and reporting ICE activity to hotlines and websites that track the federal officers’ whereabouts. Immigrant advocacy groups said that since last weekend, they had seen an increase in sightings of officers.

In Pilsen, residents expressed anger at President Trump, at his new focus on Chicago after crackdowns in Los Angeles and Washington, and at his push to ramp up deportations. Many people also voiced frustration at Democrats who occupied the White House before Mr. Trump, and at both parties’ failure for decades to fix what the residents see as an outdated and flawed immigration system.

“Something has got to break,” said Carlo Romano, 52, a hair colorist and naturalized citizen from Mexico City who was eating a coconut milk paleta outside an ice cream shop. “Democrats throw the ball to Republicans, and Republicans throw the ball to Democrats, and there’s no concrete solution to the problem.”

Mexican migrants began arriving to work in the city’s stockyards and meatpacking plants as early as the mid-1800s. Later, they came to work in steel mills and on the railroads that converge on the city.

The neighborhood that became known as Pilsen was home first to Irish immigrants and later to German, Czech, Polish and Italian immigrants. It started transforming into a hub of Mexican culture in the 1950s, as the city began to deindustrialize and as development began to displace Mexican families from other parts of Chicago. Over the following decades, Pilsen became a center of Mexican American political activity during the civil rights movement.

Some local businesses include the names of places where Mexican immigrants came from — Juárez, Iguala, Uruapan. But gentrification has come to Pilsen, and murals of schoolchildren and civil rights activists now stand beside trendy shops, thrift stores and condominiums. As housing costs in Pilsen rise, newer Mexican American families are being driven to other neighborhoods.

Like other Chicagoans, Pilsen residents have tended to be reliable Democrats. But in 2024, the neighborhood saw modest shifts toward Mr. Trump, with some residents saying they favored him on the issues of the economy and illegal immigration. Vice President Kamala Harris won the neighborhood overwhelmingly, but by a narrower margin than President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had in 2020, and in some places Mr. Trump’s vote totals were more than 20 percentage points higher in 2024 than in 2020.

Tensions escalated across the country over immigration in 2023 after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas began sending busloads of asylum seekers from Central and South America to Chicago and other cities, saying that his own state was unfairly overwhelmed by people crossing the border. Chicago was inundated with people who had nowhere to stay, and some camped out on streets and filled up shelters and city facilities.

The Biden administration granted temporary deportation protections and work permits for many of the new arrivals from Venezuela. For some Mexican Americans, especially those with undocumented relatives or friends who had been in Chicago longer, the move was seen as unfair, creating resentment and division.

Though many of the encampments are now gone, some bitter feelings have lingered.

As Ventura Alvarez, 56, helped set up for his niece’s quinceañera in the basement of a Catholic church, he described frustration with Mr. Biden. A Mexican American who was born and raised in Chicago, Mr. Alvarez said he was a Democrat and had voted against Mr. Trump in the last election, but he said Mr. Biden had stirred up much of the stress in the neighborhood.

“He let all the immigrants come in from Venezuela, and now all these raids are the cost of that,” said Mr. Alvarez, who said he drives an Uber and works in construction. “And the people who are here that came from Mexico? They never got nothing.”

In interviews around Pilsen, other residents expressed resignation and a growing distrust of the political process in this country, and of both major political parties. Many said the Trump administration appeared to be bragging over immigration enforcement actions that they saw as prejudiced and cruel. Some recalled with dismay the news reports of an operation conducted months ago, early in the second Trump administration, in which the daytime TV personality Phil McGraw, known as Dr. Phil, was seen accompanying the president’s border czar, Thomas D. Homan, on raids in Chicago.

Some Pilseners faulted the Democratic Party for making big promises over time to provide fairer, faster and clearer ways to enter the United States legally, only to leave behind a tangled system and disappointing outcomes.

“Obama deported millions of people — you just didn’t see it on television,” said Isabel Hernandez, a 50-year-old naturalized citizen from Mexico who grew up in Pilsen.

Walking out of Mass on a Sunday morning, Rafael Vieyra, 85, a permanent legal resident, said he had seen the same story play out under the leadership of both political parties. As a young man, he said he moved back and forth between Pilsen and his native Mexican state of Guanajuato before settling in Chicago for good. He would work in Chicago’s stockyards, laundries, home gardens and bars and restaurants, then return to Mexico when anti-immigrant rhetoric rose and workplace raids grew common.

“I’ve seen it all,” he said. “This is the worst period yet.”

The threat of a crackdown now has sent some people indoors, but others are looking for ways to push back. At the Mexican Independence Day parade on Sept. 6, which at least briefly drew hundreds to the streets of Pilsen, Mexican cowboys known as charros passed out “know your rights” fliers. People wore bright orange whistles around their necks, where they would be handy to warn others if ICE raids were to unfold.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/16/multimedia/16-NAT-CHICAGO-NEIGHBORHOOD-01-PRINT/pilsen-chicago-1-fcjq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 08:56:42.741197

Trump had previously praised her for cooperating with the federal government’s enforcement efforts in D.C. when she touted the crime drop after Trump deployed troops.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump lashed out at Bowser, saying she buckled under pressure by her fellow Democrats. Trump had previously praised her for cooperating with the federal government’s enforcement efforts in D.C. when she touted the crime drop after Trump deployed troops.

“It has been a beautiful thing to watch but, now, under pressure from the Radical Left Democrats, Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has presided over this violent criminal takeover of our Capital for years, has informed the Federal Government that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens,” Trump wrote in his post.

“If I allowed this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN,” Trump continued.

“I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!”

Congress did not vote to extend the president’s 30-day emergency authority over the city’s police force, which expired last week. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said he thought it was “not necessary,” noting Congress had not received a request to act and that the city has been cooperative.

Bowser’s executive order authorized coordination between local police and federal forces. The Army also extended authorization of National Guard troops in the city through Nov. 30.

Bowser said last week that the executive order requires the return to “the preemergency status quo.” Asked whether that means the Metropolitan Police Department will stop cooperating by transporting ICE detainees, Bowser said, “That certainly would be my expectation.”

“Immigration enforcement is not what MPD does. And with the end of the emergency, it won’t be what MPD does in the future,” she added.

Organizers across the country, from Massachusetts and North Carolina to California and Washington state, have postponed or canceled heritage month festivals altogether.
Also during National Hispanic Heritage Month, the South American nation of Chile observes its independence day on Sept. 18.
Similarly, Sacramento's annual Mexican Independence Day festival was canceled with organizers citing the political climate and safety concerns.
Other events that have been canceled include the Hispanic Heritage Festival of the Carolinas, Hispanic Heritage Fest in Kenner, Louisiana and FIESTA Indianapolis.","Each year during Hispanic Heritage Month, huge celebrations can be expected across the U.S. to showcase the diversity and culture of Hispanic people.

This year, the Trump administration's immigration crackdowns, a federally led English-only initiative and an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push have changed the national climate in which these celebrations occur. Organizers across the country, from Massachusetts and North Carolina to California and Washington state, have postponed or canceled heritage month festivals altogether.

Celebrated each year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the month is a chance for many in the U.S. to learn about and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic cultures, the country's fastest-growing racial or ethnic minority, according to the U.S. Census. The group includes people whose ancestors come from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America.

More than 68 million people identify as ethnically Hispanic in the U.S., according to the latest census estimates.

Before there was National Hispanic Heritage Month, there was Hispanic Heritage Week, which was created through legislation sponsored by Mexican American U.S. Rep Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles and signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.

The weeklong commemoration was expanded to a month two decades later, with legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.

""It was clustered around big celebrations for the community,"" Alberto Lammers, director of communications at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute said. ""It became a chance for people to know Hispanic cultures, for Latinos to get to know a community better and for the American public to understand a little better the long history of Latinos in the U.S.""

Sept. 15 was chosen as the starting point to coincide with the anniversary of ""El Grito de Dolores,"" or the ""Cry of Dolores,"" which was issued in 1810 from a town in Mexico that launched the country's war for independence from Spain.

The Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica celebrate their independence on Sept. 15 and Mexico marks its national day on Sept. 16, the day after the cry for independence.

Also during National Hispanic Heritage Month, the South American nation of Chile observes its independence day on Sept. 18.

The White House so far has not mentioned any planned events. Last year, President Joe Biden hosted a reception and issued a proclamation for the occasion.

Hispanic was a term coined by the federal government for people descended from Spanish-speaking cultures. But for some, the label has a connotation of political conservatism and emphasizes a connection to Spain. It sometimes gets mistakenly interchanged with ""Latino"" or ""Latinx.""

For some, Latino reflects their ties to Latin America. So some celebrations are referred to as Latinx or Latin Heritage Month.

Latin Americans are not a monolith. There are several other identifiers for Latin Americans, depending largely on personal preference. Mexican Americans who grew up during the 1960s Civil Rights era may identify as Chicano. Other may go by their family's nation of origin such as Colombian American or Salvadoran American.

Each culture has unique differences when it comes to music, food, art and other cultural touchstones.

September typically has no shortage of festivities. Events often include traditional Latin foods and entertainment like mariachi bands, folklórico and salsa dance lessons. The intent is to showcase the culture of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and other Latin countries.

Masked ICE agents carrying out President Trump's policies via workplace raids at farms, manufacturing plants and elsewhere - which has included detaining legal residents - led some to fear large gatherings would become additional targets for raids. Another obstacle heritage celebrations face is the perception that they'd violate bans on DEI programming - something Mr. Trump has discouraged across federal agencies. Some companies and universities have followed suit.

Early in September, organizers of a Mexican Independence festival in Chicago announced they would postpone celebrations due to Trump's promises of an immigration crackdown in the city.

""It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake - and that's a risk we are unwilling to take,"" said the organizers of the festival.

A new date has not yet been announced. Though Mexican Independence Day falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago typically span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants for lively parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans.

""The fact that the federal government is sending troops as we start these celebrations is an insult,"" Illinois state Sen. Karina Villa, a Democrat, said at a news conference. ""It is a fear tactic. It's unforgivable.""

Similarly, Sacramento's annual Mexican Independence Day festival was canceled with organizers citing the political climate and safety concerns.

Other events that have been canceled include the Hispanic Heritage Festival of the Carolinas, Hispanic Heritage Fest in Kenner, Louisiana and FIESTA Indianapolis.

Ivan Sandoval-Cervantes, an anthropology professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said when celebrations are canceled from the top down it affects how we see them throughout the country. Used to seeing celebrations in Las Vegas advertised, he has seen very little leading up to this year's heritage month.

""If it's not being celebrated by a specific state that doesn't mean they won't be celebrated but they might go into the private sphere,"" Sandoval-Cervantes said. ""Where it's safer to embrace the symbols or even speak Spanish.""

In Mexico, the government launched a new appeal to raise awareness among Mexican migrants to take every possible precaution during the holidays because any incident, such as while driving, could lead to a deportation.

""Rather than not celebrating, be cautious"" and gather at the consulates, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday.

On Thursday, Mexico's foreign affairs secretary said there would be more consular staff on duty to respond to any emergency. Mexican nationals stopped by U.S. authorities are advised to not flee, remain silent and not sign any documents.

Chicago Latino leaders called on residents to remain peaceful during expected protests at Mexican Independence Day celebrations, arguing that any unrest could be used as justification for sending federal troops to the city.

""We will not allow others to use our fear or our anger against us,"" said Berto Aguayo, of the Chicago Latino Caucus Association. ""We will not take the bait. We will know our rights. We will protect each other and peacefully protest.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/19/ac65a0df-9492-4c8d-b1dc-8a7694f16dae/thumbnail/1200x630/25e7b85e534ced0093227d4965537dfd/16x9-hispanic-heritage-month-2024.png,N,,2025-09-15 10:56:27.132265

“The foreign ministry is looking at whether our demands were properly addressed, and the companies are also conducting their own reviews, to check whether any measures were insufficient on either the Korean side or U.S. side,” Kang said.

Seoul said that Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Christopher Landau ""expressed deep regret"" over the incident in a meeting with his counterpart on Sunday.

In a sign of the close ties that have been strained by the raid on one of South Korea's biggest U.S. investment projects, the country's top trade envoy was heading to the U.S. on Monday as the two countries work to hash out the final details of a tariff deal agreed in July.

About 475 people, including more than 300 South Koreans — 307 men and 10 women — were detained in the Sept. 4 raid on the battery plant by U.S. immigration and other federal officials who said they were investigating allegations of unlawful employment practices.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said that those arrested in the operation were either working illegally or had overstayed their visas.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has called the raid “bewildering,” adding that it would discourage future investment into the U.S.

But Trump said that need not be the case.

“I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies,” he wrote in the Truth Social post.

“We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own “game,” sometime into the not too distant future!,” the president added.

Trump said that foreign workers had expertise on how to make “very unique and complex products” such as chips and semiconductors.

“I want them to bring their people of expertise for a period of time to teach and train our people how to make these very unique and complex products, as they phase out of our Country, and back into their land,” he said.

“Chips, Semiconductors, Computers, Ships, Trains, and so many other products that we have to learn from others how to make, or, in many cases, relearn, because we used to be great at it, but not anymore,” he added.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250912-south-korea-mb-0831-219aee.jpg",N,,2025-09-15 07:57:30.121452

With the horrors of World War II fresh in their memory, European leaders, including Winston Churchill, created the European Convention on Human Rights to help guard against future human rights violations.
For the most part, the court has done its job of protecting convention rights well.
But the main obstacle to removing migrants is not international human rights law.
As governments in Europe blame human rights for tying their hands on migration, so the media has followed, stirring negative public sentiments.","The European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights are under attack — again.

In May, nine European Union states, including Poland, Italy and Denmark, suggested that the human rights court was constraining their ability to act for public safety, particularly over immigration, and had strayed beyond its original mandate.

The UK government has since joined the chorus, with the then-lord chancellor saying in June that the way courts interpret the convention is “out of step with common sense,” against a domestic backdrop of calls for the UK to leave it altogether.

Even the Council of Europe’s secretary general said the convention needed to “adapt” (though confusingly, he also said it did not need reform).

To understand why the court and convention are so important, it’s worth recalling their origins and understanding the potential consequences of these attacks.

With the horrors of World War II fresh in their memory, European leaders, including Winston Churchill, created the European Convention on Human Rights to help guard against future human rights violations.

To uphold its promise, they also founded a regional court to step in when national courts were unable or unwilling to protect people’s rights. (Despite sharing part of their name, they have no connection to the European Union).

For the most part, the court has done its job of protecting convention rights well. Many of the human rights protections we enjoy in Europe today arise from the work of the court — including ending corporal punishment against children in schools, protecting press freedom, and protecting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.

The court will only take a case if a person has already sought and been unable to find justice in national courts.

It rejects most applications that are brought to it.

And historically its judges have deferred significantly to governments on questions of how rights should be interpreted in national law and policy.

So why is it that the court faces such opprobrium from democratic governments? The first answer is obvious — the court holds governments to account for their actions, including with fines and orders to address violations.

And governments don’t like having their power constrained, whether by courts, the media or otherwise.

Two misconceptions

Beyond that there are two main criticisms: first, that the court’s judges interpret the convention to “find” rights that were never intended by its framers 70 some years ago.

Second, that the court’s interpretation of the right to family life has led to deportations being blocked in immigration cases.

The criticism about judges “finding” rights is misplaced. The court does apply the convention as a living instrument to factual situations that were not envisioned when the treaty was drafted. In doing so it applies the rights in the treaty rather than creating new ones.

And its actions ensure that the convention continues to protect the rights of people as the framers intended.

On immigration, it is true that national courts apply the convention in ways that sometimes frustrate government efforts to deport foreign nationals. In some cases, those decisions draw on European court rulings.

But the main obstacle to removing migrants is not international human rights law. A key issue is that the states from which the migrants originate frequently decline to accept or cooperate with their return, frustrating deportation efforts.

As governments in Europe blame human rights for tying their hands on migration, so the media has followed, stirring negative public sentiments.

'Right to family life' is there to protect children

While the right to family life is sometimes cited by domestic courts as a reason why foreign nationals convicted of crimes cannot be deported, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the basis of those decisions.

It is the impact on the rights of other family members (for example, children) who are lawful residents and often citizens rather than the person facing deportation that are often crucial to the decision.

Their rights are often forgotten in the political debate around the issue.

While the European court undoubtedly constrains state action at times, that is what it was designed to do: to protect people from overreach by the state, and ultimately to serve as a bulwark against tyranny and war. It protects 700 million people across the Council of Europe region.

While the court is not without problems — a long backlog of cases means decisions can take years — genuine reform efforts have helped streamline its decision making. The main obstacle to its effective functioning remains the reluctance of some governments to fully implement its rulings and tackle the persistent abuses that lead to them.

At a time when Europe faces some of the gravest threats since the end of World War Two, European governments should be commending and strengthening its regional institutions, not undermining them.

Mayes’s office did not answer whether Corley and the HSI agent in Hawaii, Tabitha Hanson, were suspended from using TRAC.
For years, civil liberties advocates have warned that ICE would use TRAC data for purposes beyond money laundering investigations.","For years, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes defended the Transaction Record Analysis Center, a secretive financial surveillance program that tracks wire transfers between the U.S. and Mexico sent via Western Union and other companies. As recently as April, in response to The Intercept’s reporting, her office brushed off fears that the Trump administration might use TRAC data to hit its deportation quotas.

“To our understanding there is nothing in the data TRAC collects that provides information on an individual’s immigration status,” said Mayes’s spokesperson, Richie Taylor, in an email in April, “and TRAC data is used exclusively for money laundering investigations.”

But earlier this summer, after The Intercept filed a public records lawsuit for documents about TRAC, Mayes took steps to limit Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ access to the database, her office disclosed to The Intercept.

As of late June, agents from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO, wing have been “de-platformed,” Mayes said in an emailed statement, and her office has “barred usage by agents and officials in these agencies for misuse of the data.”

“I continue to support the use of this data to assist law enforcement in our mission of defeating transnational drug cartels,” Mayes said, “but this data is not and has never been intended to be used for immigration purposes.”

Taylor attributed the change in Mayes’s stance to her increasing concern “about the unconstitutional actions of the Trump administration over the last several months.”

“The Attorney General’s Office is working on additional restrictions to safeguard the use of the data,” Taylor said. “And if there are any additional instances of misuse of the data, Attorney General Mayes is prepared to deplatform and ban additional agencies from using the database.”

Mayes’s office acknowledged the shift in policy in response to questions from The Intercept about two instances this year in which agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s intelligence wing, used TRAC data to locate noncitizens for deportation who were not accused of any crime aside from unauthorized presence in the country. In recent months, thousands of HSI agents have been diverted to support ERO in removal operations.

The American Civil Liberties Union told The Intercept that Mayes was “right to recognize the extraordinary harm that will flow from feeding this highly sensitive and revealing data to the federal government’s indiscriminate mass deportation machine,” but that her belated steps to rein in certain ICE agents’ access were not enough.

“Cutting off ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents still leaves access for the thousands of agents in ICE Homeland Security Investigations who have been unleashed by this administration to pursue civil immigration deportation efforts,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project in an email. “The only way to durably protect our communities is to shut this database down.”

At a bare minimum, Wessler added, “Arizona must require law enforcement agents to submit valid legal process, such as a warrant, identifying the non-immigration-related basis for the search.”

“These limited measures are insufficient to address the danger TRAC presents,” said Daniel Werner, a senior staff attorney with Just Futures Law, whose clients tried to challenge TRAC in federal court, in an emailed statement. “Even with these measures in place, the TRAC database could still be used to carry out deportations and continues to facilitate mass surveillance without individualized suspicion or court oversight.”

Leadership at TRAC, which was organized as a nonprofit by Mayes’s predecessor in 2014, has long dismissed concerns. TRAC’s president, Rich Lebel, wrote in an emailed statement in April that under TRAC’s “very clear data use policy,” the database “is to be utilized for money laundering investigation purposes.”

Previously, Lebel pointed to technical measures TRAC had taken to guard against potential misuses, including “data tokenization” and “routine monitoring of the system by TRAC personnel.” Under an agreement Mayes’s office signed with TRAC in 2023, users were required to promise not to abuse their access and declare the “underlying predicate offense” for a given query.

But until recently, TRAC users could select “something else” as the predicate offense, Mayes’s office told The Intercept. This option has been removed, and TRAC users must now select a specific racketeering offense as defined under Arizona state law.

“As long as law enforcement agents are allowed to run searches justified only by a selection from a drop-down menu, there will be abuse,” the ACLU’s Wessler said.

Lebel did not respond to The Intercept’s questions about why such a catchall category was available to TRAC users in the first place.

According to Mayes’s office, TRAC has sent emails to the hundreds of law enforcement agencies across the country with access to the database, “reminding users that TRAC data must be utilized for specific money laundering purposes, and unlawfully being present in the country is not an acceptable predicate offense.” TRAC also put a notice to this effect on the database home page.

“The AG’s Office is working with TRAC to implement additional restrictions to prevent the database from being used for immigration purposes,” Taylor, the spokesperson, wrote.

The Intercept and other outlets have identified two instances this year in which HSI agents apparently used TRAC data to identify and locate a noncitizen for deportation. In both instances, the agents searched wire transfer data before TRAC implemented the additional query restrictions in late June.

In one case, an HSI agent in Hawaii described how she used “information from a money remittance company” to track down a Mexican man, based on 11 instances when he sent “individual remittances to individuals located in Mexico” between October 2021 and May 2025. The case was first reported by Honolulu Civil Beat.

The agent’s target, Gregorio Cordova Murrieta, had no criminal history and was not accused of money laundering or the other grave crimes used to justify TRAC. He was indicted on a single count of reentering the country without authorization after having been previously deported to Mexico.

This week, Cordova Murrieta was sentenced to time served after spending 76 days at a federal detention center in Honolulu. He will remain behind bars as he awaits deportation, according to Civil Beat.

The Intercept identified a second instance of an HSI agent using wire transfer data as part of the deportation crackdown, in El Paso, Texas.

In January, Monica, who lives on the north side of El Paso, less than 10 miles from the U.S. border, received a wire transfer from her family in Mexico.

It was not a massive transfer — less than $2,000, according to Monica’s attorney, Eduardo Beckett, who spoke with The Intercept on the condition that his client be identified by a pseudonym.

“Picking up money isn’t a crime,” Beckett said.

Monica, a mother and homemaker, first came to the U.S. in 2006, on a visa that expired in 2016. “She’s never been accused or convicted of any crimes,” Beckett said. “Her only crime is overstaying her visa.”

A few months after Monica received the transfer via Western Union, a special agent for ICE found her “while conducting law enforcement database queries,” HSI special agent Garrett Corley later wrote in a report filed as part of Monica’s deportation proceedings.

Court records from other cases show how HSI’s investigative focus has changed. In court records from 2023, Corley identified himself as part of HSI’s “Financial Crimes Unit,” writing that he had “conducted investigations which have involved criminal enterprises and their elements of financiers, manufacturers, distributors, and money launderers.”

Another court record, filed by Denver prosecutors in 2024, described Corley’s legwork on a multistate investigation that led to the conviction this year of a man who had produced and distributed millions of fentanyl pills.

But the Trump administration has shifted thousands of HSI agents like Corley away from hunting down money launderers, drug smugglers, human traffickers, and war criminals. Instead, Gorley used the suite of surveillance tools at his disposal to find Monica, via database queries conducted in mid-June.

Corley and an ERO officer arrested Monica on July 2, according to Corley’s report, and then brought her to the El Paso Service Processing Center. Beckett said Monica was later released from detention on bond.

Corley’s report did not specify the database he used to access the details of Monica’s wire transfer, including the address she gave as part of the Western Union transaction.

The Arizona state attorney general’s office established TRAC in 2014 as part of a settlement agreement with Western Union. As of July 2024, the TRAC database contained records about nearly 340 million transfers, including transfers of $500 or more sent via Western Union to or from Mexico, Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas stretching back more than a decade.

Mayes, like her predecessors, sends administrative subpoenas to Western Union, MoneyGram, Ria, and other companies, which send bulk data about their customers straight to TRAC.

Over the years, ICE has played an outsized role in TRAC. Using legally dubious administrative subpoenas of their own, agents from two HSI offices funneled data about millions of wire transfers to TRAC, according to findings published by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., in 2022 and 2023.

ICE agents have also been top users of the database, served on TRAC’s board, and at one point even funded the nonprofit’s operations.

Along with hundreds of other ICE agents, Corley’s name appears on a list of registered TRAC users from 2018, along with an ICE email address registered to Corley, who did not reply to The Intercept’s questions. The Intercept obtained the list of TRAC users from a public records request to Mayes’s office, which is currently fighting The Intercept’s lawsuit for additional records about the relationship between the state agency and TRAC.

Mayes’s office did not answer whether Corley and the HSI agent in Hawaii, Tabitha Hanson, were suspended from using TRAC. ICE did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment.

For years, civil liberties advocates have warned that ICE would use TRAC data for purposes beyond money laundering investigations.

“We have long warned about the dangers of this kind of indiscriminate bulk surveillance,” Wessler said of Monica’s case. “Authorities like to say they will reserve this surveillance for only serious financial crimes, but its apparent use to fuel the federal government’s indiscriminate deportation dragnet shows why Arizona must shut down the TRAC database immediately.”

Wessler noted that Mayes’s latest restrictions on TRAC also fail “to prevent officers in other local, state, and federal agencies from running queries at ICE’s request, something we have seen in similar contexts.”

Beckett said that his client’s case should be a warning about the danger of surveillance tools like TRAC, especially in the hands of ICE.

“As Americans we should all be concerned. Today they target immigrants. Tomorrow, they’ll target U.S. citizens,” he said. “They want 3,000 people a day. They’re going to do whatever it takes.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1386976153-e1757865936223.jpg?fit=4000%2C2000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-09-15 10:56:37.449404

Human Rights First, a nonprofit that tracks ICE flights, has logged at least five trips to Hanscom over the past week. The activity comes two months after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it stopped using the airport, located 20 miles northwest of Boston.

In June, WBUR reported that ICE had moved hundreds of detainees through Hanscom since President Trump took office. At that time, local activists complained about the ICE flights. Many of the immigrants were held at the Plymouth County jail and then transferred to the airport.

The Plymouth County Sheriff’s Office, which operates the only jail in Massachusetts with a contract to hold people for ICE, transported more than 40 detainees to Hanscom in the past week, according to spokeswoman for the office, Karen Barry.

Federal authorities have not publicly disclosed how many additional people in custody were taken to Hanscom by private contractors or from other facilities, like its office in Burlington.

An ICE spokesman confirmed to WBUR that the agency has restarted the flights in Hanscom to support its latest crackdown on alleged immigration violations in Massachusetts.

“Flying aliens out of Hanscom allows ICE to move detainees quickly from the intake center at Burlington to a detention center once they have been processed,” the spokesman, James Covington, said in a statement.

ICE has a contract to house up to 526 people at the Plymouth County jail, but its larger detention facilities are in other states.

Barbara Katzenberg, a Lexington town meeting member and a representative on the Hanscom Field Advisory Commission, said she believes the flights will spark more protests.

“There are a lot of very interested activists in this area who are unhappy with the involvement of ICE,” Katzenberg said. She expects the topic may come up at the airport advisory commission’s next meeting on Tuesday.

The government resumed the Hanscom flights to “support Operation Patriot 2.0,” according to the ICE spokesman. That's what the agency is calling its latest enforcement wave in Massachusetts, following “Operation Patriot,” when federal authorities arrested nearly 1,500 people here in May.

The Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates Hanscom, has previously said ICE does not need the state agency's permission to use the facility and does not alert the airport when it lands flights there. ICE typically uses private charter planes for the flights.",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0609_hanscom-field03-1000x667.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 06:56:23.973304

The President displayed a digitally altered photo of tattoos that Ábrego García has on one hand, with the characters “MS-13” superimposed on his knuckles.
The most sensitive—which they have made repeatedly—is that Ábrego García is a “wife beater.” In April, the D.H.S.","After a pair of federal judges in Tennessee had cleared the way for Kilmar Ábrego García to be released from pretrial detention, on August 22nd, so that he could spend a couple of days with his family before a scheduled check-in at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore, he was taken directly to a nearby hotel. The first thing he did was change into a new set of clothes that his wife, Jennifer Vasquez, had bought for him. Then he was given some flowers and ushered into a small room where Vasquez, their three children, other relatives, and supporters were waiting. He picked up his youngest son as people chanted, “¡Sí, se pudo!”—something like “Yes, we did!”

The child had been in a car with Ábrego García when ICE arrested him, near their home in Maryland, on March 12th. The arrest occurred during the government’s scramble to fly hundreds of people—mostly Venezuelans it claimed were members of the Tren de Aragua gang—to be incarcerated in El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison, under the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act. (A federal appeals court in New Orleans has since ruled that President Donald Trump had improperly invoked the law.) Days later, Ábrego García, a Salvadoran native, was sent to CECOT on a plane with some of them, beginning one of the highest-profile campaigns of retribution against an individual person of Trump’s second term.

On March 24th, lawyers for Ábrego García and his family filed a civil lawsuit demanding his return, and the courts quickly ruled that he had been deported in error. His entanglement with ICE had begun six years earlier, in March, 2019, when the Prince George’s County police department, in Maryland, arrested him and three other day laborers outside a Home Depot. (More recently, he has been employed as a sheet-metal worker.) He sought asylum and the right to not be refouled, or forcibly returned to a place where one is subject to persecution—in his case, to El Salvador. An immigration judge in Baltimore denied him the asylum request but granted him the latter, in a “withholding of removal,” which allowed him to work in the U.S. without risk of being sent back to his home country. The judge found that he had a “well-founded fear” of persecution there, on account of official corruption and a history of extortionist demands and death threats from a local gang, against both him and his family, who ran a pupusa business.

Eduardo Zelaya, a Salvadoran organizer with CASA—one of the immigrants’-rights organizations that, alongside a team of immigration lawyers, has been advocating for Ábrego García’s freedom since March—was with him in Tennessee. “Seeing the family reunified felt like a victory,” he told me in Spanish. “But, at the same time, it felt like the beginning of a battle.”

That battle had started during the effort to secure his release. Ábrego García had finally been returned from El Salvador on June 6th—but to Tennessee, not to Maryland, and only once the government had filed a new set of charges, in an indictment, accusing him of unlawfully transporting undocumented immigrants across state lines. The federal magistrate judge in Tennessee handling pretrial matters in the new case, Barbara Holmes, finding that he posed no risk of flight or danger to other people, had ordered him released on June 22nd to await trial. But that release was delayed for two months, as officials, in public and before judges in Maryland and Tennessee, offered shifting explanations as to the government’s intentions with the indictment. Did the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security want Ábrego García to face, as Attorney General Pam Bondi has put it, “American justice”? If so, he’s presumed innocent until proved otherwise, in a criminal court of law. Or did they want him to face the deportation system right away, and remove him to a country other than El Salvador under the immigration laws? If so, there would be a process for that in immigration court. What the government could not pursue is both courses at once.

Faced with this legal reality, on the night of Thursday, August 21st, hours before Ábrego García was to be released, ICE devised a choice for him. He could agree to delay his release until the following Monday, and then be deported to Costa Rica, whose government had just committed to granting him refugee status or residency—in exchange for pleading guilty to the federal indictment in Tennessee. Or, he could be released as planned, decline the plea offer, report to his scheduled appointment at the ICE field office in Baltimore, and risk being deported this time, inexplicably, to Uganda, if he chose to await trial. His criminal-defense team in Tennessee, which is seeking to have the indictment thrown out as a “vindictive and selective prosecution,” immediately brought this development to the attention of Waverly Crenshaw, the U.S. district judge overseeing the prosecution, stating, “There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat.” (The government has since said that it plans to deport him instead to Eswatini; on Thursday, Reuters reported that the African nation had no knowledge of this arrangement.)

Ábrego García preferred to be released as scheduled, and, when he arrived for his ICE appointment in Baltimore, hundreds of supporters were waiting outside, including members of Congress, state and local officials, and faith leaders. “When he goes in that building, we’ll be supporting him. We continue to fight. No matter what happens in there today, we got his back,” Representative Glenn Ivey, of Maryland, said. Ábrego García read a prepared statement, in Spanish. “I want you to always remember that today I can say with pride that I am free and reunited with my family,” he said. Moments with his loved ones had given him the “strength and hope to continue this fight.” Speaking of others who have been detained under the Trump Administration, he said, “God is with us. He will never leave us. He will bring justice to all the injustice they’ve done.”

Ábrego García and Vasquez, his wife, entered the building. Less than an hour later, she emerged alone, and Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Ábrego García’s lead immigration lawyer, told the crowd that his client had been arrested again. The legal team shortly filed a petition for habeas corpus in Maryland. This was the fourth legal action between Ábrego García and the U.S. government since 2019, but this new case is different, in that it challenges what supporters describe as the political nature of Ábrego García’s rearrest. “The fact that they’re holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they’re weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,” Sandoval-Moshenberg announced to the crowd. At a hearing later in the week, he stated that Ábrego García would again seek asylum in the U.S. Paula Xinis, the U.S. district judge in Maryland who had been handling Ábrego García’s earlier civil case, returning him from El Salvador, is also handling the new case, and she has prevented the government from taking any action against him until she rules in the dispute, after a hearing scheduled for October 6th.

Senator Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, who met with Ábrego García in El Salvador in April, told me that “his case reflects a corruption of the legal process from start to finish.” The D.H.S. posted a short clip, on X, of Ábrego García after his arrest at the ICE office, being led away in handcuffs and leg-irons. It was picked up by Fox News and other outlets, creating a viral moment of sorts, on account of two words that Ábrego García had said, looking into the camera: “Gobierno corrupto.”

Ábrego García wasn’t previously on any of Donald Trump’s enemies’ lists, but he landed there when he began winning his cases with the federal judiciary. Critical to those wins was the government’s admission of error in the civil suit he filed in March. Erez Reuveni, a veteran lawyer with the Justice Department’s Office of Immigration Litigation, was fired after stating during a hearing that Ábrego García should not have been sent to El Salvador; he later became a whistle-blower. Another government official, Robert Cerna, in a separate court filing, wrote that the wrongful refoulement was the result of an “administrative error.”

Based on that information, on April 4th, Judge Xinis ordered the government to take steps to return Ábrego García to the U.S. The Administration challenged her ruling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld it. So did the Supreme Court, on April 10th, issuing a unanimous, unsigned order that “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”

The Administration, however, stonewalled. Four days after the Supreme Court ruling, at an Oval Office meeting between Trump and the Salvadoran President, Nayib Bukele, a reporter asked, “President Trump, do you plan to ask President Bukele to help return the man who your Administration says was mistakenly deported?” Attorney General Pam Bondi answered for Trump: “If they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it—meaning provide a plane.” The White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller soon suggested that the Supreme Court had actually ruled in the Administration’s favor. Then he added, “That is the President of El Salvador. Your questions about it, per the Court, can only be directed to him.” A confused-looking Bukele replied, “I don’t have the power to return him to the United States.”

Judge Xinis and the Fourth Circuit both expressed dismay at the Administration’s failure to comply. “Defendants appear to have done nothing,” she wrote in a follow-up order, which allowed Ábrego García’s legal team to seek basic information about his status and whereabouts. The U.S. circuit judge J. Harvie Wilkinson, a Reagan appointee, noted Bukele’s and Trump’s denials of responsibility. “We are told that neither government has the power to act,” he wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”

This months-long standoff has allowed the Administration to escalate its campaign against Ábrego García in the press and on social media. The President displayed a digitally altered photo of tattoos that Ábrego García has on one hand, with the characters “MS-13” superimposed on his knuckles. After his rearrest, Bondi said, “He will no longer terrorize our country.” In August, Ábrego García’s criminal-defense team asked Judge Crenshaw to issue a gag order against Bondi and Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security Secretary, stating that “the government’s ongoing barrage of prejudicial statements severely threaten—and perhaps have already irrevocably impaired—the ability to try this case at all—in any venue.”

Members of the Administration have also attacked Ábrego García based on allegations from various court records and his immigration file. The most sensitive—which they have made repeatedly—is that Ábrego García is a “wife beater.” In April, the D.H.S. released records from Prince George’s County showing that Vasquez had sought temporary court intervention, in 2020 and 2021, after accusing her husband of violence against her; she withdrew one request and didn’t pursue the other. (They married while he was in detention in 2019; she testified on his behalf while pregnant with their son.) In May, Vasquez, who is a U.S. citizen, said in a statement, “My husband was traumatized from the time he spent in ICE detention and we were in the throes of COVID. Like many couples, we were caring for our children with barely enough to get by. All of those factors contributed to the actions which caused me to seek the protective order.”

Vice-President J. D. Vance, meanwhile, posted on X that Ábrego García was a “convicted MS-13 gang member,” a claim immediately refuted by commenters pointing out that there had been no conviction, or even a criminal complaint. There was only a police report, from his original arrest in 2019, citing an informant and claiming that Ábrego García’s clothing—including a Chicago Bulls cap—signified gang membership. (He wore a Bulls cap at the reunion in Tennessee.) After the Supreme Court ruling, the Justice Department posted the police report. The New Republic and USA Today both noted that it had been written by a discredited Prince George’s County detective who was later criminally indicted for leaking “sensitive and confidential information about an ongoing police investigation with a commercial sex worker.” Judge Xinis, in one of her orders, noted that the Administration had provided no evidence of MS-13 or terrorist ties, which it has also repeatedly alleged.

A few days before Ábrego García’s release in Tennessee, in August, his defense team there asked Judge Crenshaw to dismiss the indictment because the government cannot retaliate against anyone merely for exercising their rights in court. “This case results from the government’s concerted effort to punish him for having the audacity to fight back, rather than accept a brutal injustice,” they wrote.

The indictment, which was kept under seal until Ábrego García’s return from El Salvador, implicates him in a criminal conspiracy in which he and others are said to have “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens who had no authorization to be present in the United States, and many of whom were MS-13 members and associates.” It points to a single incident: on November 30, 2022, a Tennessee state trooper pulled over a Chevrolet S.U.V. driven by Ábrego García, for speeding. He was taking nine other passengers, all of whom were Hispanic men, to Maryland, but after a brief inspection he was let go without a traffic ticket. According to the indictment, he was acting in concert with six unnamed co-conspirators. Tennessee authorities have released video of the traffic stop and confirmed that the federal government declined to take action then, and his lawyers have compiled a list of similar prosecutions in the same jurisdiction where prosecutors did not wait more than two years before bringing an indictment.

The effort to prepare the case, in fact, was conducted with Joint Task Force Vulcan, a special Justice Department unit formed during Trump’s first term to build criminal cases against MS-13. When the indictment was made public, Bondi personally thanked the unit, some of whose members, the Times reported, had no idea who Ábrego García was until they were enlisted to build the case against him, on April 28th. Among the witnesses the government hopes to put on the stand, and who offered grand-jury testimony, is a man who has been deported five times, and who, for his coöperation on the case, has been granted early release from federal prison, where he was serving a thirty-month sentence for human smuggling; he has also been promised deferred action on deportation in exchange for testimony against Ábrego García, whom he claims to have worked with.

Around the time that Ábrego García was indicted, according to ABC News, Ben Schrader, the head of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee, resigned, reportedly because of the indictment’s politically motivated nature. Without addressing the circumstances of his resignation, Schrader wrote on LinkedIn that, at the Justice Department, “the only job description I’ve ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons.”

The case has been instructive because the judges handling it, Holmes and Crenshaw, have begun to test some of the evidence the government has gathered so far. They haven’t shied away from examining the domestic-violence incidents or the uncorroborated claims of gang ties. When weighing whether to release Ábrego García ahead of trial, Judge Holmes acknowledged that his wife had twice sought orders of protection, but found that this alone did not make him a risk. “There is no evidence of any similar occurrences since 2021,” she wrote. “Nor any evidence that Ms. Vasquez is anything other than fully supportive of Abrego.” Holmes likewise discredited the MS-13 accusation, for which prosecutors relied on the testimony of coöperating witnesses who either contradicted one another or were otherwise unreliable. In July, Crenshaw, in a second ruling endorsing her findings, was emphatic: “At bottom, the Government fails to provide any evidence that there is something in Abrego’s history, or his exhibited characteristics, that warrants detention.” He did suggest that Ábrego García will soon be afforded what the Trump Administration has denied him so far: a full and fair trial where he can subject the witnesses against him “to a rigorous cross examination.”

This kind of scrutiny, which the Constitution demands, may be precisely why the government devised the Uganda option: by coercing Ábrego García to plead guilty, it might have avoided the burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt, plus all the procedural safeguards that come with a public trial. That proof is what Senator Van Hollen wants to see from the Administration. “Shut up on social media,” he said. “Put up your evidence in court.” ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68c45a1cbfdf4cfc4ca42361/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Farias_Garcia_GettyImages-2231291708.jpg",N,,2025-09-15 06:57:02.334756

This assertion comes after the Trump administration has falsely claimed that immigrants drive a disproportionate volume of violent crime.
Just this week, Raquel saw ICE agents circling her block.
“That erosion of trust further exacerbates feelings of fear and uncertainty.” Those feelings can be further complicated when interactions with federal agents turn violent.
Hundreds of protesters have peacefully marched in downtown Chicago to oppose “Operation Midway Blitz” and show that immigrants are welcome.","Last month, Raquel heard a knock on her front door. Because she wasn’t expecting company — and her security camera wasn’t working — she worried it might be U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

“I’m scared to even open the door,” she said in Spanish. “There’s that fear, an insecurity of ‘what will happen?’”

At first, Raquel, who lives on Chicago’s West Side, said she thought the threats of ICE raids were just an intimidation tactic. The Trump administration had said it would target people with criminal records, which reassured her that she and her family of four would be left alone. (Raquel asked to be referred to by a pseudonym because she fears for her safety.)

But then, she saw online reports of everyday people being seized and deported, and noticed ICE agents in her neighborhood. Her fears grew. And the scope of ICE’s activity turned out to be different than what she had envisioned: An estimated 70 percent of people currently detained by ICE have never been convicted of a crime. “They are taking innocent people and it’s affecting the community,” Raquel said. “You can’t even be at peace in your own home.”

The Department of Homeland Security is now sending ICE agents into Chicago as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” justifying the campaign by saying that it will reduce crime and improve public safety. This assertion comes after the Trump administration has falsely claimed that immigrants drive a disproportionate volume of violent crime. Yet, as Chicago experiences a record decline in gun violence, immigrant families and community leaders say Trump’s actions pose a more urgent threat to their safety.

Just this week, Raquel saw ICE agents circling her block. Her youngest daughter, a U.S. citizen, worries they may be separated. They, like other Chicagoans, have heard of many people without criminal backgrounds being ripped away from their families.

“I don’t feel protected,” Raquel said. “I don’t feel like there are any rights. I see it as discrimination directly against Hispanic people.”

And the campaign has already turned violent. On Friday, federal immigration officials reported that an officer shot and killed someone who “severely” injured an ICE agent during a “targeted law enforcement activity” in Franklin Park.

The ‘fundamental human need’ for safety

Since 2015, Trump has seized on American anxieties about violent crime, casting undocumented immigrants as a threat to public safety. In his 2025 inauguration speech, Trump called for a government that protects “law-abiding” citizens from “dangerous criminals… that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.”

But there is no empirical evidence to support the notion that undocumented migrants are responsible for an outsized share of violent crime. A Justice Department-backed analysis of data from the the Texas Department of Public Safety found that undocumented immigrants are arrested at less than half the rate of native-born citizens for violent and drug crimes.

For many immigrant families, the fear of deportation is nothing new. But as social media spreads videos of ICE activity, they’re watching their fears come true in real time, witnessing violations of due process, and immigrants being sent to countries that are foreign to them.

What’s legally allowed on immigration enforcement is changing, too. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal judge’s order early this month that prohibited federal agents in Los Angeles from questioning people about their immigration status based on factors like race, ethnicity, and language. The ruling is not yet final, but it allows racial profiling as litigation continues.

“People have a fundamental human need to feel safe and secure,” said Aimee Hilado, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice focused on immigration trauma. “The systems that were in place, the people, institutions that we are told to trust, in this environment, we can no longer rely on how we operated in the past,” she said. “That erosion of trust further exacerbates feelings of fear and uncertainty.”

Those feelings can be further complicated when interactions with federal agents turn violent. On Friday, federal immigration officials reported that an officer shot and killed someone who “severely” injured an ICE agent during a “targeted law enforcement activity” in Franklin Park.

When fears come true

Hilado recounted a call with the Welcome to Illinois Coalition, in which she heard a community member share her experience going through the court process to obtain documents to legally reside in the U.S. She said they were denied legal status and were undergoing deportation proceedings, but hoped to appeal the decision. While they waited for their court date, they received calls from an unknown number that directed them to go to a police station to complete paperwork. When her husband arrived, the woman said, ICE was waiting for him. They arrested him and took him away.

“Denying people access to due process, denying people rights, removing people’s ability to live full and safe lives with dignity and safety is structured violence,” Hilado said. She worries about the long-term impact these new policies and threats toward immigrants will have on society.

“It exacerbates social inequalities, and we will start to continue increasingly stigmatizing immigrant groups,” she said. “This is not new. Historically, we tend to scapegoat larger problems on specific communities.”

Heriberto Flores has lived in West Elsdon, a primarily Latino neighborhood, for 25 years. Generally, he said, it’s been peaceful. Recently, he added, the rhetoric against immigrants has increased racism against Latino people. Flores has seen this firsthand through a soccer club he runs.

“It is frustrating and saddening to see how hate can be pervasive and transmitted onto other people who may not understand the circumstances of each individual,” he said in Spanish. “It affects us psychologically that other people categorize us as bad people.”

What’s really behind the immigration raids

Several Chicagoans The Trace spoke to said they don’t believe the deployment of immigration agents or the threats of sending the National Guard are actually meant to keep their city safe.

If it was really about safety, said Ricky Flores, a Brighton Park resident, the Trump administration would have offered to send the National Guard during the summer, when gun violence peaks, and not in September, when Independence Day celebrations for several Latino communities take place. Instead of protecting Chicagoans, Flores said, the administration is jeopardizing the safety of immigrants by sending them into countries they may not be familiar with or places they left to escape violence.

“Oftentimes, the decision to leave one’s home country is not an easy one,” Hilado said. “They leave it because they want to rebuild their lives with safety and dignity, and then to come to a place where the policies are replicated, the institutions replicate harm and violence — that sense of welcome is not there — they are reliving what they had hoped to escape.”

Amid the challenges faced by the city’s immigrant communities, Chicagoans have risen to support their neighbors. Hundreds of protesters have peacefully marched in downtown Chicago to oppose “Operation Midway Blitz” and show that immigrants are welcome.

“I admire how the Hispanic community is responding,” Raquel said. On her block, they have created a system of communication among neighbors. If someone spots ICE, they call or text each other with warnings to stay home.

Other areas, like Little Village, are using a whistle system. Some residents, like Ricky Flores, are riding around the area in trucks to confirm ICE sightings, or making their presence known during detainments to ensure accountability for immigration agents and the due process of immigrants.

“Unity creates strength,” said Heriberto Flores. “If we don’t come together, we will never be able to navigate what is happening around us.”

These issues have been raised in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case.
The government recently threatened Abrego Garcia with deportation to Uganda, a country with which he has no association.
The threat to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda (and now Eswatini) came in the context of a plea deal the government offered.","The nasty underside of the Trump immigration agenda keeps gaining visibility. Deporting as many as possible as quickly as possible while disappearing due process is the name of the game. Smearing and demonizing those who are caught in the ICE machinery is also part of the game plan. The Trump regime always says they are deporting “the worst of the worst” but that is a big lie. The deported could be your co-workers, a graduate student or some unlucky person with brown skin.

While Americans have been told these mass deportations will make America great, I would submit the erosion of due process is a grave danger for all of our rights. Taking away rights from a disfavored group creates precedent for taking away rights from everyone else.

With so many court decisions playing out, it can be difficult to sort out which ones are most consequential. Back in June, the U.S. Supreme Court decided one case on its unexplained shadow docket that deserves attention. In the case of D.V.D. v. Department of Homeland Security, the Supreme Court ruled the government can deport non-citizens to third countries without prior notice or an opportunity to challenge that deportation.

A lower court had required 15-day notice before deporting non-citizens to countries other than their country of origin but, without rationale, the Supreme Court overturned the order. The Court majority didn’t appear to have a problem with deporting non-citizens to places they have never lived and to places where the deported person doesn’t speak the language or have any ties.

No-notice deportations raise the risk of sending non-citizens to countries where they are likely to be tortured or killed. The reason the 15-day notice matters is that it allows the opportunity to seek counsel and to have a hearing where evidence can be presented about the dangerous situation they may face if deported.

At first glance, I could not believe the Supreme Court was going along with allowing deportations to a third country. It didn’t seem right. You might think otherwise but the due process requirement applies to all persons regardless of immigration status. It is a constitutional right.

There is also the matter of international law. The principle of non-refoulement prohibits deporting people to unsafe third countries where they could face persecution or torture. The principle especially comes into play when migrants are sent to countries known for violence, instability and human rights abuses.

These issues have been raised in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case. The government recently threatened Abrego Garcia with deportation to Uganda, a country with which he has no association. Now they say it will be Eswatini, a tiny African nation formerly known as Swaziland. Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. in 2011. He is the husband of a U.S. citizen and father of a U.S.-born child and he was the guy who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in disregard of an immigration judge’s order that he not be removed.

The Supreme Court ruled he was deported illegally and said the federal government had to facilitate his return. Although they said they could not do it, the feds did bring him back but they immediately re-arrested him on human smuggling charges related to a 2022 traffic stop.

Because Abrego Garcia stood up and exercised his constitutional rights, he became the monster poster boy of the Trump regime. With no evidence, Trump, Vance, Miller, Bondi and Noem have all relentlessly tagged him as a “violent terrorist.” They have poisoned the water around Abrego Garcia’s case by slandering him so much. What we have witnessed is a prototype in creating a demon in the public mind.

The threat to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda (and now Eswatini) came in the context of a plea deal the government offered. They said he could be ultimately deported to Costa Rica if he pled guilty and served jail time on the human smuggling charge.

That charge appears to be a fraud manufactured by prosecutors. No case was ever brought up in 2022. Now, to make their human smuggling case, the government uses informants who they offer deals on their own criminal or immigration charges in exchange for desired testimony. The case could not smell more.

Abrego Garcia has not accepted the plea deal and a federal court judge has ruled that he cannot be deported from the U.S. before his trial in October. He also has filed an asylum claim. You would never know that Abrego Garcia originally left El Salvador to escape gangs.

No one outside the Department of Justice knows why the Trump regime picked Uganda or Eswatini for Abrego Garcia. It is a calculated act of cruelty meant to harm. Sending someone to an unknown place where they don’t even speak the language is bad. Whether that place is dangerous is at least an open question but the Trump regime acts like concern about torture or persecution is a joke.

During the Great Depression and in the years after World War II, an estimated two million people were forced to leave the U.S. because they were suspected of being Mexican. In that period, Mexicans were blamed for taking American jobs and public resources. It turned out that over one million were American citizens who were wrongly deported.

With deportations, we are seeing a very similar thing happen again.

Under these circumstances, the Foreign Ministry considers thorough fact-finding essential.
Most of the detained Korean workers had entered the US on nonimmigrant short-term business visas — either B-1 visas or Electronic System for Travel Authorization permits — which are meant for brief business visits rather than employment.
Seoul intends to verify details concerning all 316 South Koreans, though the ministry cannot mandate South Korean companies to undergo a full-scale probe or set its timing, according to the official.

Since a total of 316 South Koreans returned home on Friday, testimonies have poured in alleging abusive conditions at detention facilities in Georgia, including human rights violations and racist remarks by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials directed at the Korean detainees.

“We still need fact-finding regarding what activities our workers were engaged in, the situation at the time of the raid, who among them were unjustly arrested and detained and what kinds of human rights violations occurred inside the detention facilities,” a Foreign Ministry official said on condition of anonymity during a closed-door briefing.

“We will continue holding meetings with LG Energy Solution and other related companies to gain a more accurate understanding of the facts, and if there are additional demands to be raised with the US side, we plan to raise them.”

A total of 317 South Koreans — 307 men and 10 women — were among 475 people detained in the Sept. 4 immigration raid in Georgia at an electric vehicle battery plant being built by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution.

The men were held at an ICE detention facility in Folkston, southern Georgia, while the women — including one who was pregnant — were held at the nearby Stewart Detention Center.

Every Korean had returned home as of Friday, except for one who had applied for a green card and held a valid work permit. The worker remained in detention to proceed with immigration hearings after the others were released.

The Foreign Ministry official explained that negotiations between Seoul and Washington over the unprecedented mass detention of Korean workers took place intensively over just a few days — from Sept. 6 through Sept. 9 — leaving Seoul with limited bandwidth to fully grasp the situation.

Under these circumstances, the Foreign Ministry considers thorough fact-finding essential.

Most of the detained Korean workers had entered the US on nonimmigrant short-term business visas — either B-1 visas or Electronic System for Travel Authorization permits — which are meant for brief business visits rather than employment.

The official further explained that Seoul still seeks a full explanation as to why legally employed B-1 visa holders were detained.

Seoul intends to verify details concerning all 316 South Koreans, though the ministry cannot mandate South Korean companies to undergo a full-scale probe or set its timing, according to the official.

The official stressed that South Korean companies employing the workers should take the lead first in investigating the circumstances surrounding their employees.

“They went to the US as employees of these companies. They received visas as company workers and engaged in labor under that status. So, above all, we believe it is important for the companies to first understand the situation,” the official said.

“If necessary, our government will step in to hear their accounts and address any human rights violations that may have occurred.”

The official also underscored the importance of documentation to help prevent a recurrence of such incidents.

“Both South Korea and the US have come to share the recognition that this incident stems from structural problems. In that sense, we are considering turning it into an opportunity by documenting various related cases,” the official said.

“Although we do not yet know the appropriate format or channel, we will make sure to raise this issue in our consultations with the US.”

Working-level consultations are underway between the Foreign Ministry and US Embassy in Seoul to create a bilateral visa working group, in a step aimed at addressing what Seoul considers the root cause of the crisis, another Foreign Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.

Seoul also proposed establishing an informal consultative mechanism between ICE’s Atlanta Field Office and the Korean Consulate General in Atlanta to prevent similar incidents in the future, the first unnamed official explained, adding that ICE responded positively to the suggestion.

A total of 316 South Koreans, among 330 workers detained, were repatriated last Friday after a week in custody, following what officials described as “intense negotiations.”

Inside the Detention

Workers who spoke to local media painted a grim picture. Some described being treated like convicts: shackled in chains, marched into buses, and placed in crowded detention halls. Others recalled unsanitary conditions — mattresses spotted with mold, limited access to showers, and inadequate heating that left detainees shivering at night.

Consular officials, who eventually gained access after Seoul lodged formal protests, said their priority was securing the workers’ release rather than cataloguing complaints. Still, they confirmed that detainees were able to make phone calls and access needed medication only after consular intervention.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, agreed to waive a standard requirement that workers sign documents admitting to unlawful stay — a concession Seoul pushed for to protect their visa status. Workers holding short-term B-1 visas, typically used for meetings and contract signings, were assured that their visas would remain valid.

A Diplomatic Balancing Act

The South Korean government has expressed “strong regret” to Washington and vowed to continue pressing for answers. Kang, the presidential spokesperson, acknowledged that “some requests have been accepted, and there were improvements,” but added that officials would continue investigating whether “any issues or inconveniences for our citizens remain.”

Hyundai and LG are separately collecting testimonies from the workers to determine whether discrimination or mistreatment occurred, with plans to share their findings with the Foreign Ministry.

For now, the episode has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on the vulnerabilities South Korean companies and workers face as they expand aggressively into the United States, drawn by the promise of tax incentives and proximity to American automakers.

“A comprehensive fact-finding review will be carried out,” a ministry official said. “If we find that human rights violations did occur, we will raise the issue with the U.S.”

Welcome to our live coverage of US politics.

The US president took charge of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) on 11 August for 30 days, activating the National Guard and deploying federal officers in what he framed as a crackdown on crime and homelessness but what was widely seen as another example of federal overreach.

The ruling reinforces federal authority to conduct immigration enforcement operations that critics argue disproportionately target Latino communities, including U.S. citizens and legal residents. As the state grapples with the implications, voices from government, advocacy groups, and affected communities are converging in opposition, underscoring deep divisions over immigration policy, enforcement practices, and civil liberties.

This extensive article explores the background of the case, details of the Supreme Court ruling, reactions from California’s leadership, social and legal ramifications, and the ongoing mobilization to challenge and mitigate enforcement impacts.

Immigration Enforcement and Historical Contestation in Southern California

Southern California has long been a focal point for immigration dynamics in the U.S., characterized by its large, diverse immigrant population and complex intergovernmental relations. Over the past decades, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has conducted numerous high-profile operations in the region, drawing fire for alleged racial profiling and civil rights violations.

In 2020, multiple lawsuits and local ordinances sought to restrict ICE’s ability to conduct street-level arrests, demanding stricter procedural safeguards and transparency. These measures emerged in response to documented cases where U.S. citizens and lawful residents were mistakenly detained or subjected to intimidating tactics during large-scale immigration sweeps.

Supreme Court Case: Central Issues and Decision

The legal battle centered on whether local restrictions on immigration-related stops unlawfully interfered with federal immigration authority. Key constitutional questions included:

The extent of federal preemption under the Supremacy Clause.

Compliance with Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Balancing individual rights with federal interests in immigration control and public safety.

On a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court sided with the federal government, holding that:

Federal statutes and executive powers largely preempt local regulations limiting immigration enforcement.

Targeted arrests based on suspected immigration violations, including considerations of ethnicity and language, do not inherently violate constitutional rights if justified by reasonable suspicion.

Local ordinances that required additional verification prior to federal detentions imposed impermissible barriers.

The ruling thus grants greater latitude to ICE and related agencies operating in Southern California and beyond.

Reactions from California Leadership: Unanimous Outrage and Calls for Action

Governor Gavin Newsom, Attorney General Rob Bonta, and key members of the California Legislature quickly condemned the decision:

Governor Newsom described the ruling as “a setback for human dignity and justice,” emphasizing dangers posed to families and communities.

AG Bonta pledged to “redouble efforts” to uphold immigrant protections at the state level and vowed to defend Californians’ constitutional rights aggressively.

Prominent state legislators called for federal reforms and increased funding for legal defense programs.

Beyond elected officials, local leaders, including mayors and county supervisors, voiced alarm over anticipated upticks in detentions, displacement, and social disruption.

Table: Summary of California Leaders’ Reactions

Impact on Southern California’s Immigrant Communities

Southern California’s immigrant residents—many of whom have deep-rooted ties, U.S.-born children, and legal status—fear heightened exposure to immigration actions marked by racial profiling.

Key concerns include:

Disruption of Family Units: Increased deportations can split families, leaving children without caregivers.

Chilling Effect: Fear of enforcement reduces cooperation with police, impedes reporting of crimes or abuse, and hinders participation in public programs.

Economic Hardship: Detainment of breadwinners results in income loss, housing instability, and broader economic ripple effects.

Health Impacts: Anxiety and trauma exacerbate physical and mental health disparities.

Communities are already organizing mutual aid networks and legal response teams to address these challenges.

Data Illustrating the Local Impact

Approximately 40% of Los Angeles County’s 10 million residents identify as Latino.

Estimates suggest ICE made over 15,000 arrests in Southern California in 2024.

Data from community organizations report an 18% increase in family separations following enforcement spikes.

Studies indicate a 25% decline in crime reporting in neighborhoods heavily impacted by immigration raids.

Legal and Constitutional Implications

The Supreme Court decision raises critical questions regarding constitutional rights and the federal-state power balance.

Fourth Amendment safeguards guard against unreasonable searches but allow specific exceptions for immigration enforcement.

Equal protection jurisprudence confronts the permissibility of ethnic or linguistic considerations.

States have limited ability to obstruct federal enforcement but can regulate cooperation and provide supplemental protections.

Civil rights lawyers warn of a potential rise in legal cases fighting abuse and wrongful detentions.

Advocacy and Resistance Strategies

In response, community groups and civil rights organizations are mobilizing:

Training thousands of “Know Your Rights” workshops across affected areas.

Establishing rapid legal response teams for detainment cases.

Filing new lawsuits targeting patterns of unconstitutional enforcement.

Lobbying Congress for protective legislation, including new frameworks to prohibit racial profiling.

Broader Political and Social Context

The ruling represents a flashpoint in the nation’s polarized immigration debate:

Supporters frame the decision as necessary for public safety and border control.

Opponents see it as a major roll-back of protective measures for immigrants and a legitimization of racialized policing.

Media discourse, protests, and political campaigns increasingly focus on how immigration enforcement intersects with civil rights and community cohesion.

Comparative Overview of Immigration Enforcement in Major U.S. Cities

Future Outlook and Policy Recommendations

To mitigate harm and promote justice, several paths emerge:

Strengthened local legal aid and community defense funding.

Development of state legislation to shield vulnerable populations.

Enhanced public accountability mechanisms for federal agents.

Immigration reform at the federal level to clarify enforcement scope.

Continued dialogue and advocacy will shape the post-ruling immigration landscape.

Conclusion

The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to uphold federal law enforcement’s authority to profile in Southern California ignites a critical debate about the balance between security and civil liberties. While intended to enhance immigration control, the ruling threatens to erode trust, amplify fears, and deepen inequalities in one of America’s most diverse regions.

California’s leadership, communities, and advocates face a daunting task—navigating the complex intersections of law, policy, and humanity to protect rights, ensure justice, and foster inclusion amid evolving national realities.

This landmark decision marks a significant shift in the ongoing legal battles over immigration enforcement practices and civil rights protections for immigrant communities in the nation’s most populous city. The ruling has profound implications for governance, community trust, and civil liberties, and it has sparked a vibrant debate among legal experts, policymakers, advocates, and affected residents.

This comprehensive article delves into the background and developments of the LA immigration raids, the legal trajectory culminating in the Supreme Court’s stay, the details and rationale of the ruling, its immediate and long-term impacts, and the multifaceted response across various sectors. Structured to provide readers with a deep understanding, the article also employs statistical insights and tabular presentations to underscore critical dimensions of this issue.

Background: Immigration Raids and the LA Legal Context

For years, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies have conducted operations targeting undocumented immigrants in California, particularly in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

Los Angeles, home to millions of immigrants, many without legal status, has been a focal point for enforcement because of its role as a major urban entry point and sanctuary city status. However, operations involving ICE agents have been controversial, often stirring community fear and resistance.

Numerous large-scale raids targeting alleged gang members and criminal suspects have unfortunately resulted in the detention of US citizens and legal residents, raising alarms about the use of “racial profiling” and insufficient safeguards. Public and political backlash prompted local authorities and civil rights organizations to impose restrictions on ICE enforcement activities, seeking transparency, accountability, and civilian oversight.

The Legal Battle: From Injunctions to the Supreme Court

The specific case at issue emerged when Los Angeles County challenged federal immigration enforcement protocols, citing violations of constitutional protections including the Fourth Amendment’s ban on unreasonable searches and seizures, and due process guarantees.

Lower federal courts responded by issuing restraining orders and injunctions limiting when and how ICE agents could conduct “immigration stops” in LA neighborhoods. These rulings emphasized the overreach risks of indiscriminate sweeping actions without individualized suspicion and aimed to protect civil rights.

The Department of Homeland Security, backed by the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, appealed these decisions, arguing that the local restrictions interfere with critical federal functions and national security. The case escalated to the Supreme Court, which granted a stay allowing federal raids to proceed pending the final outcome.

Supreme Court Stay: Key Points and Reasoning

In a tightly divided decision, the Supreme Court’s majority ruled that:

Federal immigration enforcement falls within the exclusive domain of the federal government, preempting local measures that substantially impede operations.

The country faces “serious national threats,” justifying expedited and robust actions by federal agents.

While individual civil rights remain paramount, the government has not yet been shown to violate legal standards under the challenged procedures.

The stay does not signal final approval but maintains the status quo allowing ICE to perform arrests under existing protocols.

The decision was a narrow 5-4 outcome, reflecting deep judicial divisions over the scope of federal immigration power versus local autonomy and individual liberties.

Table: Supreme Court Votes on LA Immigration Raids Stay

Immediate Implications for Los Angeles

Federal enforcement agents swiftly resumed targeted immigration sweeps in several LA neighborhoods known for gang activity and drug trafficking. Coordination with local law enforcement increased, although critics accuse some agencies of complicity or insufficient resistance.

Communities, especially Latino immigrants, expressed alarm and heightened anxiety over potential detentions. Local government officials reiterated commitments to protect immigrant rights through legal aid expansions and shielding policies.

Civil Liberties and Human Rights Concerns

Opponents of the ruling warn that restoring broad federal authority risks the following:

Civil Rights Violations: The resumption of sweeping enforcement operations threatens Fourth Amendment protections.

Racial Profiling: Evidence indicates that ethnicity and language often become proxies for suspicion.

Community Disruption: Fear leads to decreased reporting of crime and public engagement.

Family Separation: Elevated risk of deportations affecting mixed-status households.

Legal aid organizations anticipate a surge in cases challenging arrests and seeking damages.

Government and Community Responses

California’s state leadership, including Governor Newsom and Attorney General Becerra, swiftly condemned the decision and announced expanded support for immigrant defense, including state-funded legal help and public awareness campaigns.

Community-based groups intensified outreach, emergency hotlines, and “rapid response” networks to aid those detained and their families.

Table: Community Support Initiatives in Response

National and Global Perspectives

The ruling has prompted nationwide discussion with other urban centers assessing enforcement models amidst similar tensions. International observers underline the balance between sovereignty, human rights, and migration management as a global challenge.

Future Legal and Policy Outlook

Court challenges continue with pending lawsuits seeking broader injunctions. Meanwhile, legislators in California and Congress face pressure to:

Clarify the legal framework around enforcement profiling.

Expand local protections and sanctuary policies.

Improve data sharing and transparency for oversight.

Invest in alternatives to detention and support community health.

Conclusion

The Supreme Court’s stay allowing immigration raids to resume in Los Angeles represents a significant moment in the enduring national debate on immigration, security, and civil rights. While it empowers federal enforcement agencies, it rekindles fears and frustrations within impacted communities. California’s leaders and advocates face a critical task to safeguard the dignity and rights of residents amid shifting legal boundaries.

Nathan Phillips, of Newton, Natasia Lawton-Sticklor, of Leominster, and Eleanor Reid, of Hanover, New Hampshire are all facing one misdemeanor charge of trespassing.

Police reported to the ICE Boston Field Office Friday around 11 a.m. after ICE agents reported protesters who were refusing to leave the front steps, according to court documents and the Burlington police.

The individuals – later identified as Phillips, 58, Lawton-Sticklor, 42, and Reid, 33 – “were trying to deliver food to the detainees that are in the facility,” according to a police report filed in Woburn District Court.

When police said ICE cannot accept the outside food and asked them to move to the grass, the trio allegedly refused and said they were “not going to voluntarily leave until they were allowed to deliver the food,” the report said.

The Boston Field Office is located in an office building near Burlington Mall. Since the administrative office has been doubling as a detention center, the town is attempting to gain access to inspect the building’s conditions, Burlington officials said in an update Friday.

Lawyers, including representing a teen from Milford who was detained for nearly a week at the Burlington office, have called the facility inhospitable and overcrowded, with detainees sleeping on concrete floors. State officials have called out the “abysmal” conditions.

“We’re here to deliver food and care packages to the people being held here, and visit with them, if possible, to make sure they’re doing okay,” Lawton-Sticklor told WBUR on Friday. “We have some deep concerns about food, basic necessities, being withheld from them.”

After the people allegedly said they had no intention of leaving “until we can deliver the food,” the report said, they were informed they could be arrested.

“You have all been asked multiple times to leave. This is the operational area of this facility. You are disrupting the operations of the facility by being here with no actual business. You have been asked to leave by the security of the facility and the Burlington Police Department,” a captain told the people at the scene, according to the report. “Are you refusing to do so? Are you refusing to leave?”

The three were then arrested without incident, according to police, who noted they believe arrests were the ultimate goal of a planned protest.

Phillips is a Boston University professor who previously participated in a hunger strike to protest what he called threats to free speech on campus amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on international student visas.

South Korea said Monday that it is closely looking into whether any human rights violations took place during the raid and detention of Korean workers by US immigration authorities in Georgia earlier this month, local media reported.

""I understand that the government is conducting a more thorough review with the companies to determine whether any human rights violations occurred,"" Yonhap News Agency cited presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung as saying.

Over 300 South Korean nationals returned home Friday after a week in detention following the raid by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at a Hyundai-LG battery plant construction site in Bryan County following negotiations between the two countries.

Many workers spoke of cramped spaces, mold-covered mattresses, cold temperatures and limited access to basic hygiene at the detention center.

Several others described how they were shackled with chains around their waist, legs and wrists during the arrest and treated roughly by immigration officers.

""The Foreign Ministry is looking at whether our demands were properly addressed, and the companies are also conducting their own reviews to check whether any measures were insufficient on either the Korean side or US side,"" Kang said.

The city-sponsored parade is usually held in early November and draws large crowds to Long Beach.

Even though the city is not aware of federal enforcement activity targeting the parade, the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution” because it’s “a large and very public outdoor event,” said Long Beach spokesperson Kevin Lee.

Long Beach City Councilmember Mary Zendejas had requested the cancellation, Lee said.

“This decision did not come lightly,” both Zendejas and the city said in statements. The decision addresses “genuine fears raised by community members, especially those who may face the possibility of sudden and indiscriminate federal enforcement actions that undermine the sense of security necessary to participate fully in public life.”

The Arte y Ofrendas Festival, a separate ticketed event organized by an outside vendor and held at Rainbow Lagoon Park, also has been canceled this year. The festival typically coincides with the city-sponsored parade and is held where the parade ends its route, thus drawing parade attendees.

Roberto Carlos Lemus, a marketer who brought food trucks and other vendors to the festival last year, called the cancellation “very sad.”

“Everyone’s very sad about the situation. Día de los Muertos has been one of the largest celebrations for a very long time, and the city has done a great job putting it on,” Lemus told The Times on Sunday. “Unfortunately with Latinos being kidnapped and attacked by ICE and the current administration, I do understand why they made the decision that they made.”

Lemus said some local businesses were worried about economic fallout of the festival and parade cancellation as well as the potential effects of raids on Latino Restaurant Week in Long Beach, an event he co-founded that is set to begin Sept. 22.

“They are afraid,” he said. “Overall, it affects everybody.”

Immigration raids have swept Southern California in recent months, with thousands of people detained by federal agents. A new Supreme Court ruling has cleared the way for U.S. immigration agents to stop and detain people in Southern California whom they suspect of being in the U.S. illegally, even if their suspicion is solely based on the type of job they hold, the language they speak or their appearance.

The ruling has bolstered fears that people with brown skin and Spanish speakers will be targeted — especially going into national Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins Monday — and was met with outrage by immigration rights attorneys and local leaders.

At its meeting Tuesday, the Long Beach City Council approved a motion to push unspent funds allocated for this year’s parade to next year’s budget, ensuring $100,000 will be available for the 2026 parade.

The council also added $600,000 to the Long Beach Justice Fund, which provides legal representation to residents who face immigration actions, bringing the budget available for the fund to $1.85 million. The fund ensures residents have access to “resources necessary to safeguard their constitutional rights, uphold due process protections, and preserve family unity,” according to the motion.

Some Southern California events have proceeded as scheduled despite similar fears.

East L.A.’s 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade held on Sunday seemed to draw smaller crowds than usual, but many said they felt a sense of pride and duty to attend in spite of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

There have also been multiple reports that masked federal agents have swept up American citizens during the raids, as well as others with documentation granting them legal status.
“It was just very impactful for me.” On Sept. 9, witnesses captured federal agents targeting occupants of a Camero parked outside of Van Nuys Mexican restaurant for unknown reasons.
In that instance, masked agents shattered the driver’s window and detained two men, both of whom were said to have green cards or lawful permanent residents.
Asked by KTLA for comment on the Long Beach car wash raid, a spokesperson with DHS released the following statement:","Seven workers at a Long Beach car wash were detained by federal immigration agents Saturday, one of whom appeared to faint and collapse while in custody.

The incident comes nearly a week since the United States Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration could, at least temporarily, resume sweeping immigration enforcement operations in L.A. and seven other SoCal counties.

There have also been multiple reports that masked federal agents have swept up American citizens during the raids, as well as others with documentation granting them legal status.

Workers at Bixby Knoll’s Car Wash, at 577 E. Wardlow Rd., were the latest to be targeted in the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration dragnet.

The raid, according to witnesses, some of whom documented it on their cellphones, said the raid unfolded at around 10 a.m. Saturday when about four dark-colored SUV’s carrying masked agents with tactical vests pulled up and blocked the car wash’s entrance and exits, prompting several of the car wash employees to make a break for it.

One woman captured by agents and escorted to one of the SUV’s appeared to faint and collapse as she was about to be put into the vehicle. The agent holding her struggled to keep her off the ground before another agent came to his aid.

A man filming the incident, who did not want to be identified, can be heard yelling at agents to get her some medical assistance.

“The most striking thing for me was a woman probably my mother’s age running with her work tools being chased by a young ICE agent, running for her life,” he told KTLA. “It was just very impactful for me.”

On Sept. 9, witnesses captured federal agents targeting occupants of a Camero parked outside of Van Nuys Mexican restaurant for unknown reasons.

In that instance, masked agents shattered the driver’s window and detained two men, both of whom were said to have green cards or lawful permanent residents. A pregnant woman, a U.S. citizen, was also detained but later released.

Tom Homan, the White House Border Czar, has repeatedly emphasized that immigration enforcement operations will continue to ramp up. With SCOTUS’ temporary ruling on roving immigration patrols in L.A. County, DHS now has permission to target people based on their race, ethnicity and the language they speak.

Critics of the Trump administration’s tactics have raised alarm bells about people with no criminal history being detained and that hardworking folks trying to support their families are indiscriminately being arrested.

According to NBC News, more than 58,000 undocumented immigrants have been taken into custody since Trump took office. About 30% of those detained have criminal convictions, while 25% had pending criminal charges.

Bleeding Heartland is keeping the authors’ names confidential, as well as the location in Iowa where these detentions occurred.

June 16, 2025 began like any other morning for two hardworking men in an Iowa community. As dawn broke, the first—a restaurant employee driving to work—was boxed in by two unmarked cars. Masked figures jumped out, ordered him from his vehicle, and whisked him away.

Three friends, trailing behind, watched in horror, as it appeared their fellow worker was being kidnapped. One friend ran to move the abandoned car off the street, unaware that other masked men lurked nearby. He, too, was seized and driven away. Only two witnesses in the second car remained to tell the tale.

Friends and families did not learn these men’s whereabouts for thirteen hours, when their names were found on ICE’s (Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of the US Homeland Security) detainee roster at Polk County Jail—a facility paid by ICE for housing ICE detainees. After 48 hours there, they were transferred to Pine Prairie Correctional Facility in rural Louisiana for four more days.

Relatives feared the worst: forced deportation to El Salvador’s CECOT terrorism center. Eight days post-abduction, a family member in El Salvador sent a photo of the two reunited with loved ones in their country of birth. Thankfully, both were released to family members in El Salvador and spared the CECOT prison.

ICE has been carrying out similar detentions resembling abductions around the country since January 20. Daily ICE arrests in Iowa have nearly tripled in the last six months compared to 2024; this rate of growth places Iowa twelfth in the nation. Despite at least 430 ICE arrests in five months in Iowa, only about five incidents have been reported in the press. Fear silences witnesses, yet we must not remain silent.

What happened to these Iowa neighbors violates their constitutional rights. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit any government deprivation of “life, liberty, or property without due process.” This protection applies to everyone within U.S. jurisdiction, regardless of citizenship. Border crossing without papers is a misdemeanor, not a felony. ICE cannot unilaterally declare it a crime or bypass due process.

ICE’s tactics—masked agents, unmarked cars, no judicial warrants—evoke images of the Gestapo. Only a state or federal judge (not an immigration judge, who is under Homeland Security) may issue a lawful warrant. Administrative orders from ICE lack the force of constitutional law and can be refused.

Allies and immigrant families must prepare by visiting the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice website for Know-Your-Rights cards and related information. This page from the ACLU of Iowa is also useful.

In addition, refugees and immigrants should always carry documents proving their legal status and entry dates.

Stopping these abuses requires action by U.S. citizens and other allies. We must make nonviolent “good trouble”:

Petition and protest to members of Congress. Tell them that immigrants are vital to Iowa’s growth and vitality, and that ICE’s due-process violations contradict the “Iowa nice” ethos.

Pressure the Iowa Department of Public Safety to rescind its 287(g) agreement with ICE, signed in March 2025, which deputizes selected state troopers to arrest immigrants on ICE’s behalf without proper warrants.

Urge the sheriffs of the six counties with jails that house ICE detainees to end those agreements with ICE. Polk, Pottawattamie, Linn, Woodbury, Muscatine, and Hardin Counties have such agreements. Constituents should meet with their local sheriffs and demand that they end or not renew their contracts with ICE.

Organize community allies to educate neighbors about their rights and establish rapid-response plans for ICE raids.

The Trump administration plans to ramp up detentions under the so-called “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” Effective October 1, 2025, that law nearly quadruples funding for detention centers, triples border-wall spending, and adds 10,000 ICE officers.

The rampant use—and abuse—of this “shadow docket” exploded after Trump’s three appointees during his first term solidified the current six-vote far-right majority on the Supreme Court.
The Trump administration filed 41 during his first term, generally to swat away challenges to extensions of executive power, and the Supreme Court granted 28.
When Joe Biden became president in 2021, however, the Supreme Court reversed course, repeatedly granting emergency petitions opposed by the administration.
It is clear that the Supreme Court is committed to using all its tools to dismantle democratic institutions and formalize a dictatorial regime.","On September 8, the six-justice fascist majority on the United States Supreme Court repudiated with no explanation whatsoever the constitutional principle that government agents must have individualized “reasonable suspicion” based on something more than ethnicity, employment or whereabouts to seize a person for investigation of immigration status.

This appalling ruling adds to the growing list of recent Supreme Court “emergency” interventions in pending lawsuits, most of which favor the Republican Party and particularly the expansion of executive powers under President Donald Trump, who openly seeks to wield dictatorial power.

Traditionally, the Supreme Court presides above the nation’s lower courts like a Colossus of Rhodes, granting “petitions for certiorari” to review between 50 and 100 cases of the several thousand submitted that term, starting on the first Monday of October and ending before the July 4 holiday. Each case should have already been fully litigated in the lower courts and present an important question of law that is either in conflict or unsettled in the lower courts. The resulting decisions are published in detailed written opinions that serve as binding legal precedents for future cases and, not infrequently, are accompanied by concurrences or dissents to elaborate on the reasoning of individual justices.

Until quite recently, the Supreme Court rarely granted emergency petitions, an “extraordinary” judicial power that is supposed to be used sparingly, and only to maintain the “status quo” and to prevent “irreparable injury” while the glacial judicial processes work themselves out. The rampant use—and abuse—of this “shadow docket” exploded after Trump’s three appointees during his first term solidified the current six-vote far-right majority on the Supreme Court.

The previous administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama filed only eight emergency petitions over the first 16 years of this century. The Trump administration filed 41 during his first term, generally to swat away challenges to extensions of executive power, and the Supreme Court granted 28.

When Joe Biden became president in 2021, however, the Supreme Court reversed course, repeatedly granting emergency petitions opposed by the administration. The two most notorious rulings, both during his first year in office, terminated an eviction moratorium intended to stop the spread of COVID-19 and forced immigrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico while their applications were pending.

Later in Biden’s term, the Supreme Court majority used the shadow docket to vacate a lower court ruling by a three-judge panel that included two Trump appointees, reinstating Alabama pro-Republican congressional gerrymandering, preventing US Border Patrol agents from removing razor wire laid along the the Rio Grande at the direction of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, and blocking the restoration of 1,600 voters summarily struck from Virginia voter rolls under a Republican-backed program targeting supposed noncitizens.

In its first 20 weeks, the current Trump administration filed 19 emergency petitions, the same number the Biden administration filed over four years, and the Supreme Court ruled for Trump on 84 percent of them.

Particular outrage followed last week’s shadow docket order that blocked a temporary restraining order (TRO) entered last July by Los Angeles federal judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong to prevent roving ICE patrols from seizing people based solely on “(1) apparent race or ethnicity, (2) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location; or (4) the type of work one does,” and then holding them without access to courts or their attorneys.

The majority’s shadow docket order says absolutely nothing about Judge Frimpong’s 52-page explanation for her TRO, nor the Ninth Circuit’s 61-page order upholding it. Both are grounded in the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement of “probable cause,” which expresses the fundamental democratic principle that the government cannot seize human beings without “individualized suspicion” that they engaged in unlawful activities, as well as the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process, including access to courts and legal counsel.

Although there was no opinion for “the Court,” Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh filed a concurring opinion claiming that racial and employment profiling is justified because “10 percent of the people in the Los Angeles region,” which he estimates to be 2 million, are “illegal immigrants” responsible for “myriad significant economic and social problems.”

Kavanaugh’s numbers are vague and inflated. US Census estimates for 2023 are that undocumented immigrants comprise 7.1 percent of the greater Los Angeles population, about a million people, which includes growing percentages from all regions of Asia, Europe and Africa, as well as Latin America.

Kavanaugh’s claim of “myriad significant economic and social problems” derives from right-wing talking points, not evidence. A recent study by the University of California Merced reports that for California as a whole, only 22 percent of undocumented immigrants have less than five years of residency. Nearly two-thirds have lived in the state for more than a decade, including 44 percent with over 20 years of residence. The value of their labor to California’s economy is estimated at $275 billion annually.

Kavanaugh dismissed the litany of horror stories recounted in the lower court record about the methods used by ICE agents during their arbitrary sweeps, claiming without evidence that for “stops of those individuals who are legally in the country, the questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are US citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.”

For Kavanaugh, and presumably the other five fascists who voted with him, the Fourth Amendment requirement of probable cause allows Trump’s ICE Gestapo to demand, “Your papers, please!” based solely on someone’s ethnic appearance, language or accent, employment or whereabouts.

“To the extent that excessive force has been used” by a federal agent, Kavanaugh added, “the Fourth Amendment prohibits such action, and remedies should be available in federal court.”

This comment is particularly rich coming from a Supreme Court justice who has voted with the majority to block civil rights suits against federal police under the landmark 1971 case of Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, not to mention virtually all constitutional claims against local police, especially those concerning excessive force, by expanding “qualified immunity” into a virtual bar for recovery.

Lauren Bonds, the executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, told CNN, “What we’ve seen is, term after term, the court limiting the avenues that people have available to sue the federal government.”

“It’s bordering on impossible to get any sort of remedy in a federal court when a federal officer violates federal rights,” Patrick Jaicomo, a senior attorney at the libertarian Institute for Justice, told CNN.

Kavanaugh began his right-wing legal career as a lawyer for Kenneth Starr’s phony investigation of then-President Bill Clinton, who was impeached for denying consensual oral sex in the oval office. At an event held at a Waco, Texas community college on September 11 to honor Starr, who died in 2022, Kavanaugh gaslit the audience with the claim that the Constitution’s “framers recognized in a way that I think is brilliant, that preserving liberty requires separating the power. No one person or group of people should have too much power in our system.”

He was refuted by demonstrators across the street, who held signs such as “BK—Trump Flunky” and, with reference to last year’s notorious ruling giving Trump broad presidential immunity, “Shame on you. No one is above the law.”

In the August 2025 Gallup survey, the Supreme Court’s approval rating fell to 39 percent, the first time it has ever been below 40 percent, including record lows of 11 percent among Democrats and 34 percent for independents.

Willian Alberto Giménez González, who came to Chicago from Venezuela in 2023, was detained Friday when he went to a barbershop in the Little Village neighborhood, according to the petition filed in U.S. District Court.

He’s being housed at the Department of Homeland Security’s processing center in west suburban Broadview, the petition stated.

Kevin Herrera, Giménez González’s lawyer, said Saturday he believes the arrest was related to his client’s participation in a 2024 lawsuit against Home Depot, Inc. and the city of Chicago that contends security personnel profiled and struck Giménez González while he was outside a store seeking day work.

That lawsuit is pending at the same Dirksen U.S. Courthouse where Giménez González filed his petition Sunday.

Federal authorities said in a statement Saturday that Giménez González was in the country illegally and had been ordered deported by an immigration judge last year after he failed to show up to court.

“There is nothing unjust about enforcing the law and ensuring this illegal alien adheres to the laws of the United States,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a written statement. “ICE arrested Willian Alberto Giménez González for being in the country illegally.”

Giménez González’s petition stated he was “absent from an immigration hearing” in Memphis, Tennessee, in April 2024 “due to extraordinary circumstances,” and was ordered removed from the country “in absentia.”

He’s since appealed the ruling and his next hearing is set for July 2026 in Chicago, according to the petition.

In addition to a request barring deportation, the petition also asked a federal judge to prohibit Giménez González’s transfer to a different processing location outside Illinois. Federal officials have three days to respond.

His plight comes nearly a week after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced the Chicago-based immigration crackdown. It’s unclear how many people have been arrested in the area, but advocates have said the number of calls to their hotlines has been unusually high. The administration of President Donald Trump contends it has detained the “worst of the worst” in the operation.

At a protest Saturday outside the Broadview facility, Herrera said, “These are trying times for the legal system and the rights it protects.”

“But the community assembled here knows that people hold the powerful to account,” he said. “We will fight for Willian, and we will see to it that he is free to be with us in Chicago and to contribute to the city in all of the ways he has since he arrived. That’s a promise.”

Democratic U.S. Reps. Delia Ramírez and Jesús “Chuy” García also attended the event.

“Willian has to be released if we are a country of freedom and justice,” Ramírez said in Spanish. “Freedom and justice is what we say when we make our commitment to this country. Justice says Willian has to be in the house with (his wife) Mary, today.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CTC-L-Great-Lakes-Naval-protest009.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-09-14 23:56:49.776639

The protests came after a deadly ICE operation in nearby Franklin Park, Illinois, that killed one man during an attempted arrest.

Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Milwaukee's Federal Building, organized by the Milwaukee Fights Back Coalition, a group of grassroots and labor organizations opposing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

The demonstration was sparked by an ICE operation Friday in Franklin Park, Illinois, where federal officials say an officer shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez. Authorities said Villegas-Gonzalez allegedly injured an ICE agent during an attempted arrest. According to a family GoFundMe, Villegas-Gonzalez died shortly after dropping off his sons at school.

""We saw what unfolded on Friday, where ICE agents invaded Franklin Park, Illinois and murdered Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez,"" said Alan Chavoya from the Freedom Road Socialist Organization.

The incident added fresh urgency to calls for accountability from immigration advocates who question the targeting practices of ICE operations.

""Over 90% of people being detained by ICE have no criminal background, so what's this whole thing of targeting criminals?"" Chavoya said.

Ether Cavaera from Milwaukee Alliance Against Racism and Political Repression emphasized the human impact of the operations.

""We are talking about ICE ripping people from their families,"" Cavaera said.

Katie Wagner, a protester from Menomonee Falls, said she joined the demonstration because of her concerns for the country and wanted her voice heard.

""We need to send a really strong message that we don't want ICE acting illegally in our city,"" Wagner said.

Wagner added that listening to others' experiences has shaped her perspective.

""When I hear what their experience is, I have to believe them. I have to know that is what they are experiencing. That's not what I experienced, but I have to have compassion and dare I say the dirty word, empathy for other people,"" Wagner said.

For protesters like Cavaera, the message to Milwaukee leaders was clear that this demonstration was just the beginning.

""Be prepared, that if you're not doing your job and protecting those Milwaukeeans and those citizens, we will be having this exact march outside your office,"" Cavaera said.

The protesters said they will continue to mobilize until ICE operations end in every city.

In response to recent protests, Homeland Security officials said ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in Chicago has led to the arrests of undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes, including assault and driving under the influence.

She reportedly accused the administration of creating ""chaos"" with a policy that she agreed was rushed.

""This order ensures that service providers can focus on what matters most: providing safe, stable housing and support to people in crisis.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy in Rhode Island granted a temporary restraining order to halt the allegedly illegal restrictions on federal housing funding through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's ""Continuum of Care (CoC) Builds"" program, according to court records.

""The order ensures that providers and communities will not be barred from competing for lifesaving housing resources simply because they are located in jurisdictions that don't adopt the administration's ideological agenda, while the litigation continues,"" wrote the National Alliance to End Homelessness, which is suing the government with the Women's Development Corporation, in a statement Friday after the TRO was handed down.

""For decades, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)'s homelessness programs have supported states, localities, and service providers in building permanent supportive housing to reduce homelessness,"" the statement said. ""The Trump-Vance administration's sudden addition of extreme, new grant criteria sought to deny funding to entire communities based on political considerations, including whether jurisdictions support sanctuary protections, harm reduction practices, or inclusive policies for transgender people.""

In their complaint, lawyers for the groups — which are being represented by Democracy Forward, National Homelessness Law Center, Lawyers' Committee for Rhode Island, and ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island — describe how Congress appropriated $75 million for HUD to build permanent supportive housing for people in need. The department identified ""qualified projects"" and was ""prepared to award these essential funds"" through federal grants before it allegedly ""reversed course"" last week as the grants are set to expire on Sept. 30.

""I think that it's unfortunate that we're here on these things that are done so last minute by these agencies,"" McElroy, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said Friday during a hearing held over Zoom, according to Reuters. She reportedly accused the administration of creating ""chaos"" with a policy that she agreed was rushed.

The government is allegedly seeking new applicants based on ""newly announced criteria,"" according to the groups' lawsuit, which was filed Thursday.

""Under these new criteria, HUD will only award those funds for projects in jurisdictions aligned with the Administration's broader social policy views and to applicants that will commit to them,"" the complaint says. ""And HUD is rushing the funds out the door, promising to award them during a seven day period on a first-come, first-served basis for projects that clear its ideological threshold.""

According to the groups, the government now disqualifies from consideration ""any entity seeking to build housing in a jurisdiction with policies the administration disfavors,"" per the complaint. This means there will be no funding for projects in a city or state that has not adopted the administration's ""draconian approach to local homelessness policies"" and agreed to help enforce federal immigration law.

""Even in jurisdictions with policies the administration deems acceptable, entities effectively cannot compete for funding unless they profess agreement with the administration's view that sex is binary and immutable and foreswear operating safe injection sites or similar programs designed to reduce the harm from drug use — even with wholly nonfederal funds,"" the complaint alleges.

The groups argue that the government is violating the Constitution and does not have the authority to hold back funds in this way. They asked the court Thursday in the complaint to halt the ""current rushed, unlawful award process"" and preserve the funds at issue from expiration, allowing for their ""prompt award"" for projects that meet ""lawful"" criteria.

European governments are stepping up talks on whether to send asylum seekers to countries outside the EU under expanded “safe third country” rules. The Council of Europe has warned that this could put migrants in danger, including torture or death.

A draft deal in the EU Council would give member states more freedom to reject asylum claims if another country is labeled safe, even if the migrant has little or no link to it.

At the same time, the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Chief Michael O’Flaherty has warned that shifting asylum processing elsewhere can cause “severe trauma and prolonged suffering” for people moved under these plans.

Broader leeway for declaring countries “safe”

The “safe third country” rule, updated in the EU’s Migration and Asylum Pact in May 2024, is now up for more changes. Under the current system, asylum seekers can only be sent to a country if they have some link to it, like family or past residence.

The new draft compromise, reviewed by Euractiv, would loosen this rule. It says links could include family, prior residence, cultural or language ties, or “other similar ties.”

It also widens the meaning of “transit” to cover cases where someone only passed through an airport or entered the EU after staying in another country.

Unaccompanied children, who were previously excluded, could also be transferred if the move fits international and EU law. The text calls these cases rare but removes the EU-wide ban.

These talks build on the May 2024 reform, which already allowed countries outside the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention to be labeled safe, and even let states be considered safe only for certain groups or regions.

Council raises human rights concerns

The Council of Europe, a 46-nation human rights body based in Strasbourg and separate from the EU, has strongly warned against sending asylum seekers to third countries.

O’Flaherty said that these policies “expose men, women, and children to significant risks of severe trauma and prolonged suffering.”

He highlighted threats such as torture, arbitrary detention, blocked access to asylum, and large-scale deportations once migrants arrive.

The Council urged governments to consider the harm such transfers may cause and to uphold their human rights and democratic obligations.

It also stressed that many migrants sent under these deals have no real ties to the destination country, raising serious fairness and ethical issues.

Global backdrop, national experiments

The Council of Europe’s warning comes as more governments test policies that shift migration control to other countries. Since January 2025, the United States under President Donald Trump has signed deals to deport migrants to South Sudan, Eswatini, El Salvador, and Rwanda. Critics pointed out that most of these migrants have no real connection to those countries.

The United Kingdom also tried to set up a plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, but the Labour government under Keir Starmer dropped it after taking office in July 2024. More recently, the UK and France agreed on a deal: London can return migrants caught in the Channel to France, while Paris can send the same number back across the border.

Italy has gone further. In 2023, it opened two centers in Albania—one in Gjader and one in Shengjin—to handle asylum claims from migrants rescued in the central Mediterranean. Other EU countries have shown interest in copying this approach.

Rise of externalization highlighted

Human rights groups and intergovernmental bodies warned that these policies often overlook the realities awaiting migrants in destination states. According to the Council, asylum seekers sent abroad face heightened risks of ill-treatment, with limited access to legal support and uncertain protection guarantees.

Outsourcing asylum processes also raises questions about whether states are shifting responsibilities that should remain under their own jurisdiction.

The organization stressed that while governments are under pressure to manage irregular migration, solutions must not violate fundamental rights.

Legal, political challenges inside EU

The proposed compromise text is being debated within the Council, where member states are split between those seeking stricter controls on migration and those emphasizing human rights safeguards.

Some capitals viewed expanded “safe third country” transfers as a way to deter irregular arrivals and ease domestic political pressure.

Others worried about potential violations of international obligations, particularly the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids returning individuals to places where they risk persecution.

The negotiations form part of the wider rollout of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, due to apply from summer 2026. The pact also includes a new return regulation and an updated list of safe countries of origin, which remain under negotiation.

Implications for people on the move

For short-term and long-term visitors to the EU, the ongoing negotiations signal a tightening environment where border checks and cooperation with non-EU countries may increase.

The upcoming launch of the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS), expected in 2026, will already require non-EU nationals from visa-exempt countries to obtain pre-travel clearance.

Observers noted that expanded “safe third country” policies could interact with ETIAS by reinforcing the EU’s broader strategy of pre-screening and externalising migration control.

Migrants seeking protection may find themselves diverted to states with which they have no real ties.

This risks creating uncertainty for those fleeing conflict zones and could complicate the legal landscape for individuals already in Europe but awaiting asylum hearings.

Shaping the future of EU migration policy

Europe is at a turning point in how it handles migration. The Council of Europe has warned that sending people to a “safe third country” could expose them to torture, detention, or loss of the right to seek asylum.

At the same time, EU governments are discussing new rules that would make it easier to send asylum seekers to countries outside the bloc. These decisions will affect not just borders, but also how Europe defines its values.

The debate over the “safe third country” idea comes down to a basic question: who decides where safety begins and ends—and what kind of Europe will that choice create?",https://etias.com/assets/uploads/imagery/blog/refugees-sitting-behind-metal-fence.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 20:56:45.309192

While all looked normal on the route, there was an underlying fear that federal agents may try to conduct immigration enforcement during the parade. Heightened concerns follow the Department of Homeland Security's launch of ""Operation Midway Blitz"" to ""target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois.""

During the parade, dozens and dozens of colorfully decorated floats made their way down a two-and-a-half mile stretch of 26th Street.

Crowds of people lined the street -- watching the horses and dancing -- all in honor of Mexican heritage.

But there were fewer people than years past.

""Now it’s really slow, slowing down a lot,"" vendor Kevin Franco said.

One woman NBC Chicago spoke to was passing out flyers – encouraging residents to know their rights in case of any run-ins with federal agents.

""We know a lot of people are scared,"" said Isabel Aguilar with the Progressive Latino Institute. ""We have to let them know they have rights, and if they are scared, there is always a way they can someone to help.""

To our knowledge, there were no arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement or any federal authorities.

The parade appeared to have gone on without any major issues.

Still, the feeling of uncertainty remained for some people in this neighborhood… worried for their friends, family and neighbors.

""It’s really unfortunate what’s going on with ICE, but if we keep doing this, they can back off and realize you can’t break this community for anything,"" said paradegoer Joshua Lopez.

""...But that’s why us, who were born here, are here to show our face, and we’re here,"" she stated.

City officials were fully prepared with plans to ease the traffic and any issues due to Mexican Independence Day festivities. Typically, a large number of people participate in car caravans around the city and downtown.

CADOJ cited L.A. County Board of Supervisors v. Superior Court, a 2016 case in which the California Supreme Court ruled “real-time disclosure of ongoing spending amounts can indirectly reveal clues about legal strategy, especially when multiple amounts over time are compared.”

But government transparency experts say taxpayers have a right to know what the state is doing with their money.

“We as an organization have always thought that ruling sweeps far too broadly,” said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, in an interview with The Center Square. “How much money is spent on public agency litigation is an important thing that the public should be able to know.”

The Center Square requested CADOJ disclose how much it has spent on its lawsuits against the Trump administration, including both through internal resources and outside counsel.

CADOJ confirmed that it has spent the $5 million allocated by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “Trump-proofing” legal fund passed in a January special legislative session and that it has records of how much it has spent.

“While the Department has records responsive to your request for how much has been spent so far on the lawsuits against the current federal administration, the Department declines to produce cost records that are privileged attorney-client communications, or reflect attorney work product, both of which are incorporated into the PRA and made exempt from disclosure by Government Code section 7927.705,” wrote Deputy Attorney General Mayara Si to The Center Square. “Disclosing cost totals could provide insight into litigation strategy or legal consultation, especially in the context of active and ongoing litigation.”

“The Department can confirm, however, that it has spent the $5 million that were allocated to the Department from the Department of Finance pursuant to SBX1-1 at the time the SB X1-1 Annual Report was finalized,” Si wrote.

CADOJ shared its first annual report on “Trump-proofing” spending published on August 1, 2025, which stated the agency had not yet contracted with any outside counsel on these federal lawsuits.

“The $5 million in SBX1-1 funds that the Department has received to date has contributed to – but in no way has been sufficient to cover – the costs of the litigation,” wrote CADOJ. “The Department has not used any SBX1-1 allocated funds to contract with outside counsel for the purposes of legal representation in connection with any federal accountability matter.”

However, with CADOJ reporting that it had not yet spent any funds on outside counsel as of July 31, it’s unclear how sharing how much it has spent on internal staff in its lawsuits against the federal government would reveal legal strategy.

“The caselaw allowing agencies to withhold attorney billing statements in some circumstances applies only to bills from outside counsel, not the time agency lawyers may have spent on any given matter,” Snyder said. “The people deserve to know how agency employees spend their time, at least at the aggregate level, because those employees’ salaries are paid by taxpayers. It’s hard to imagine how an aggregate total of time spent by agency lawyers could implicate attorney-client privilege concerns.”
