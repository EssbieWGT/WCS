On November 6, the Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee held a hearing on three bills, Senate Bills (SB) 508, 509, and 510, that if passed, would act as a magnet for more illegal immigration and impose new burdens on state and local law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with federal immigration officials. These bills would affect how officers interact with illegal aliens, what information government agencies can share, and which procedures officers must follow when conducting immigration-related actions.

SB 508 prohibits officers from conducting immigration enforcement actions in what the bill calls “sensitive locations.” The list of these locations includes schools, colleges, and other educational institutions, places of worship, hospitals, courthouses, and facilities assisting children, pregnant women, victims of crime, or individuals with significant physical or mental disabilities. The legislation does allow enforcement in these locations only if there is an imminent threat to public safety or a court order.

Such a broad definition of “sensitive locations” creates significant operational challenges for law enforcement. If a smuggling suspect works at a hospital, drops children at school, or regularly attends services at a place of worship, officers would be unable to apprehend them at these locations even with probable cause for arrest. Individuals with outstanding immigration violations could effectively shield themselves from consequences by remaining in these protected zones. These restrictions will make routine enforcement actions more difficult, and more dangerous for all involved.

SB 509 focuses on information sharing, prohibiting state and local agencies from providing data to federal authorities that could be used for immigration enforcement. This provision would fundamentally alter how Michigan law enforcement operates in cooperation with federal partners by barring state and local agencies from sharing basic identifying information, arrest records, or custody status if that information could be used for immigration enforcement purposes. Without access to crucial intelligence gathered by Michigan law enforcement, ICE and Border Patrol will be forced to operate blindly.

SB 510 is similar to a bill recently passed in California. It requires officers conducting immigration enforcement actions to wear uniforms and forbids masks or personal disguises. The stated goal is to increase transparency and accountability. However, law enforcement officials note that in some investigations, disguise or plainclothes operations are necessary, especially considering an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against immigration law enforcement officials across the country.

While supporters of SB 508, SB 509, and SB 510 argue that the bills protect vulnerable populations and ensure privacy, Michigan’s recent smuggling case highlights potential consequences of limiting enforcement authority.

Manuel, an undocumented immigrant in North Carolina, is still reeling from two close calls with immigration enforcement as President Donald Trump’s police state unfolds nationwide.

The first close call, on Nov. 16, was at a police checkpoint in Raeford, North Carolina, a rural area in Hoke County where the population is less than 5,000. In a state where more than two dozen law enforcement agencies have signed on to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as part of the federal agency’s 287(g) program, a seemingly innocuous driver’s license checkpoint can serve as a funnel into detention and deportation.

“Thank God, we managed to get through it,” Manuel told Prism over WhatsApp, noting that he was in a car with two labor organizers. He asked to use a pseudonym for fear of deportation. “I was very scared.”

The second close call came on Nov. 17 when Manuel was on his way to work. The former North Carolina farmworker now works in construction near Newton Grove in Sampson County, another rural region of the state home to a sizable immigrant population. A co-worker sent Manuel a photo of a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) truck parked at a nearby restaurant. Manuel immediately headed home and alerted other workers to do the same.

Deciding to miss work isn’t an easy decision as the holidays approach, but Manuel said he didn’t feel as if he had a choice. Many in North Carolina’s immigrant communities are choosing to remove themselves from public life until “things return to normal,” Manuel said.

But it’s hard to know when that will be. Since June, the Trump administration has bombarded American cities with large-scale, indiscriminate, and often unlawful immigration raids targeting Latino communities. With little more than racial profiling and disdain for Democrat-run cities guiding the way, unvetted, untrained, and trigger-happy federal agents have been hard at work terrorizing local communities and apprehending immigrants and citizens alike at workplaces, businesses, and locations once considered off limits, such as churches and schools.

Trump’s mass deportations began in Los Angeles and have expanded to Chicago; Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; and New York City. Beginning Nov. 15, Charlotte—North Carolina’s largest city that is home to the state’s most sizable immigrant population—became the first Southern locale targeted with widespread immigration raids.

But ICE and CBP agents have also been spotted in rural areas such as the one where Manuel lives and works. As the impacts of the widespread raids quickly ripple outward, North Carolinians are mobilizing to stem the flow of enforcement operations in their communities.

“Snatch people up and ask questions later”

In a statement Sunday night, the migrant justice organization Siembra NC reported that Nov. 16 was “the day the most immigrants were arrested in a single day in state history.” ICE and CBP have detained more than 130 people in Charlotte thus far, with enforcement in the city expected to continue.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools educator Mechelle Vaughn told Prism that this school week has been “extremely tough.” Vaughn, a member of Public School Strong, an organization that advocates for North Carolina public schools, told Prism that English-language learners make up a large percentage of her elementary school students. Almost 21,000 children in the district were absent from school this week, and those who came to class were clearly in emotional pain, the educator said.

“It is really, really difficult when students tell you how scared they are, and when one tells you that they know that their mommy’s not going to be home when they get there because ‘they are going to get her,’” Vaughn explained. “Today it was call after call after call to the office, with parents crying because they are scared. I was crying because I could hear the fear in their voices; some were afraid their children would be taken getting off the bus.”

Parents’ fears are not unfounded. During school hours on Tuesday, Vaughn received confirmation that ICE agents were at a nearby mobile home park where students lived. She contacted the Charlotte Mecklenburg Association of Educators and Public School Strong, which are helping support Siembra NC’s ICE watch and safety patrol rapid response. Educators and members of Siembra NC quickly arrived at the mobile home park to ensure that students getting off the school bus would be safe.

“The ICE agents had already left, but there was concern that they may be back, and we were also told that people were apprehended,” Vaughn explained. “We just kind of all knew we had to jump into action, and we came up with a plan for what we would do if ICE came back. We weren’t going to let our kids off the bus.”

The public school teacher told Prism that immigrant educators across the district are also afraid to report to work, including those who have permission to live and work in the U.S.

“It’s a very scary time. They snatch people up and ask questions later,” Vaughn said.

Axios reported that New Orleans was likely the Trump administration’s next Southern target. However, the North Carolina publication The Assembly confirmed that federal agents planned to descend on the state capital this week—and descend they did.

For locals tracking enforcement operations on the ground in the Raleigh area, ICE and CBP sightings began rolling in early on Nov. 18. Masked agents were seen carrying out enforcement at an apartment complex on Navaho Drive in midtown. Later in the afternoon, in nearby Durham, Siembra NC confirmed multiple detainments downtown and further north on Avondale Drive, an area beloved for its immigrant-owned businesses.

Local and state officials have been quick to condemn this week’s raids. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a video statement Nov. 16 that the raids are “not making us safer” and that they are “stoking fear and dividing our community.”

“We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks,” Stein said.

At a Durham City Council meeting this week, Mayor Leo Williams read a joint statement from his office, the Durham County Board of Commissioners, and the Durham Public Schools Board of Education decrying the raids.

“We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights, and compromises safety,” Williams said. “Our schools, neighborhoods, and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages, and experiences that define Durham.”

While Raleigh and Durham are often grouped as a single metro area, they have decidedly different cultures, with Durham housing a vast network of grassroots organizers focused on migrant justice. More broadly, the city serves as North Carolina’s progressive organizing hub—an effect of the region’s legacy of Black freedom struggles.

While locals such as Iván Almonte anticipated that wide-scale immigration enforcement was coming down the pike in Durham, the organizer with Respuesta Rápida de Durham told Prism that immigrant communities have been pummeled in recent years, making it difficult to build sustainable infrastructure for the effective rapid response network needed in moments like this.

“It’s one thing after another,” Almonte said in a phone interview. “The attacks against our communities are unfair.”

The organizer also told Prism that North Carolina’s current fight is “bigger than ICE”: Locals are also fighting a web of anti-immigrant laws, bills, and policies. Almonte’s organization now meets with local groups and leaders on a daily basis to coordinate how best to meet the needs of immigrant communities in the region, with legal aid emerging as a top priority.

Earlier this week, the community organizer conducted a Facebook Live event that was attended by hundreds of immigrant community members. Many of the attendees are longstanding Durham County residents, immigrant business owners, and homeowners who must now consider legal action to ensure their children in the U.S. will inherit their property if they are abruptly taken by ICE. Others who attended the Facebook Live wanted help navigating the power of attorney process so that they could decide who would care for their children if they were detained. Many were concerned that if they kept missing work to avoid immigration enforcement, they would also lose their housing, though there is no legal aid that can assist with this new reality.

“These are people established in the U.S. who are facing being torn apart from their families, and it’s devastating,” Almonte said. “Immigrants from Central America and other countries fled violence, and now they are being hunted by ICE and Border Patrol in their own communities. It’s traumatizing.”

This was echoed by Ilana Dubester, the founder and executive director of El Vínculo Hispano, a nonprofit organization in Siler City that serves Latino communities across Chatham, Alamance, Randolph, Lee, and Harnett counties.

“We know it’s just a matter of time until we’re hit with enforcement,” Dubester said. “We anticipate that they will target areas where Latinos work, where they shop, where they worship. I think the goal is to make it feel like nowhere is safe.”

Dubester is fielding reports of immigration enforcement in more rural areas of the state, including Mount Airy, near the Virginia border, where she heard confirmed reports on Nov. 18 that ICE was in the area.

Leticia Zavala, a former farmworker and current coordinator with the North Carolina farmworker organizing group El Futuro Es Nuestro, also has her eye on rural areas that are home to thousands of the state’s farmworkers. Advocates are on edge, given that a few months ago, immigration raids were carried out on California farms, leading to hundreds of detainments and one farmworker’s death during a particularly chaotic workplace raid.

Zavala told Prism that she hasn’t heard of any enforcement taking place on farms, but in recent weeks, she’s received an alarming number of reports from H-2A agricultural workers alleging harassment. These are primarily Mexican farmworkers who have temporary visas to perform agricultural work in North Carolina, and, according to Zavala, many are reporting that federal immigration agents are hassling them as they attempt to return to Mexico once their season is over.

“They are fingerprinting them, asking to see their documents, and taking pictures of them for no apparent reason,” Zavala said.

Dubester is also fielding calls from terrified and confused community members. As immigration enforcement plays out across North Carolina, the Brazilian immigrant’s overarching goal is to keep the community informed—even if that means having to confirm ICE sightings herself.

“Being a naturalized American citizen used to give me a huge amount of assurance of my rights in this country, but right now those rights don’t feel 100% guaranteed,” Dubester said, noting the dozens of American citizens who have been detained by ICE in recent weeks. This includes an incident in Charlotte in which federal agents stopped a U.S. citizen twice, shattering his car window and even briefly detaining him.

“There’s no longer a guarantee of safety, as a Latina doing this work,” Dubester said. “But it won’t stop me from doing what I need to do.”.

“We’re still showing up”

This isn’t the first time the Trump administration has carried out retaliatory immigration raids in North Carolina as apparent punishment for the state’s left-leaning policies.

During the first Trump administration, voters in the state elected a series of Black sheriffs who refused to cooperate with ICE, which led to a series of workplace raids and other enforcement actions mostly targeting undocumented workers. While local organizers and residents who spoke to Prism expressed feeling overwhelmed and saddened by the latest round of enforcement, they also said they remain committed to protecting their neighborhoods.

Across Durham and Mecklenburg counties, community patrols are forming—including some outside of formal organizing spaces. Locals are making plans to accompany immigrants to court hearings, and many are already shopping for immigrant families and picking up their children from school to reduce their risk of encountering federal immigration agents.

One local resident, an immigrant mother with children in Durham public schools who requested anonymity for safety reasons, told Prism that it’s important for North Carolinians to understand that they don’t have to wait for local organizations to take action. “If you see a need in your community, there’s nothing stopping you from meeting it,” she said.

The woman, who is now carrying her passport in case she’s stopped by federal agents, told Prism that attendance is down considerably this week across Durham public schools. She is hoping that community patrols will make parents feel safer sending their children to school with trusted community members.

Previously considered “sensitive locations,” schools, hospitals, and places of worship were once protected from immigration enforcement. But in January, Trump rescinded the policy that largely governed enforcement at these locations, replacing it with a directive “that gives ICE agents unbridled power to take enforcement actions in any of these spaces,” the National Immigration Law Center reported. Faith leaders across North Carolina are now on high alert, especially after reports from Siembra NC that immigrants were detained outside of two Charlotte churches. This includes a man who was volunteering to perform church cleanup.

Rev. Breana van Velzen is the executive director of Durham Congregations In Action (DCIA), a multifaith organizing network that includes hundreds of clergy members. Van Velzen told Prism that at the beginning of the year, DCIA was alerted that the Trump administration would likely prioritize Durham for immigration enforcement because of its status as a “sanctuary city.” Faith leaders immediately partnered with Siembra NC and the social justice organization Ready the Ground for Know Your Rights.

“We’ve been holding trainings for 10 months, including one on Saturday with almost 400 local residents,” van Velzen said. “Now these community members are putting what they learned into action, doing patrols and documenting ICE in the area. In some cases, we’ve been able to scare ICE agents away, and in others, we were able to film detentions so that we could at least alert families their loved one was taken. We’re as ready as we can be.”

In recent days, the reverend has told locals who are tracking immigration enforcement in the region that they can print out copies of the Department of Homeland Security’s Form G-28 in case they can get a person’s signature before immigration agents cart them away.

“The form can help people who are getting detained get a lawyer,” van Velzen explained. “If you can get the paper in front of them—even if they just sign an X for their name—you can send the form to a lawyer or organization so they have legal aid and someone who will advocate for them and make sure they don’t get disappeared.”

Churches, mosques, and synagogues across the state have a leg up when it comes to safety protocols and scenario planning because of the nature of the attacks they experience, according to the reverend, and because many of their members have also experienced persecution and state violence. But no amount of preparation will lessen the blow if ICE carries out enforcement inside places of worship, van Velzen said.

Under the first Trump administration, North Carolina led the country in the number of immigrants who lived in churches while fighting their deportations. The state was even home to a radical network of sanctuary leaders who organized against ICE together. Samuel Oliver-Bruno was one of those leaders, and his tragic fate remains a source of trauma for local organizers.

Oliver-Bruno was in sanctuary at CityWell United Methodist Church in Durham for 11 months when he left the church on Nov. 23, 2018, to attend what was supposed to be a routine biometrics appointment for deferred action. Instead, Oliver-Bruno was violently detained by plainclothes immigration agents. Members of the Durham community rallied around him and even attempted to stop ICE from taking Oliver-Bruno by surrounding agents’ cars. But it was to no avail. Oliver-Bruno was quickly deported to Mexico, where he died shortly after, separated from his wife and son. It was later found that federal immigration agencies monitored the sanctuary leader’s social media and colluded to detain him.

The anniversary of Oliver-Bruno’s detainment is approaching as federal immigration agents again descend on the state of North Carolina and threaten the lives of thousands of immigrant families.

“Many of us are really scared, but we’re still showing up,” van Velzen said. “I’m proud of our city, and I want people to know that clergy are ready to be called upon for whatever is needed. Tell us what you need and where to go, and we will show up.”

Gris.” She immediately translated: “We are here reporting from Shelltown, San Diego.
But the immigrant community in San Diego has felt some version of this fear for a long time, Orozco added.","Three teachers drove through a quiet neighborhood in southern San Diego, the sun not yet fully up over the horizon. They drank coffee and talked about their jobs. The start of the school day was still an hour or two away.

Suddenly, mid-conversation, they spotted something: what appeared to be an undercover Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, driving right past them.

To an untrained eye, the unmarked SUV didn’t look out of place among the dozens of other cars lining the residential street. But the educators saw what many might miss: the completely tinted windows of the unmarked Dodge Durango (a popular choice for law enforcement), the small strip of lights near the front of the car, the steel prisoner partition faintly visible inside (dividing the front seat from the back). Sure enough, the SUV’s driver picked up a handheld radio.

Watching this, high school teacher Marysol Duran clicked her own walkie talkie to life.

“We have identified a potential,” she reported to others in her unit, following closely behind. “He is on 39th and Gamma. We will keep close watch.”

Duran, and other members of her organization, are not just teachers. They’re also members of the Association of Raza Educators, a group of activists that regularly patrols southern California streets to keep an eye out for ICE. When they spot undercover agents, who may be in the area conducting surveillance or actively planning to arrest or detain someone, they alert the surrounding community: via social media, group chats – and sometimes a giant megaphone.

The fall morning they spotted the Dodge Durango, the teachers were patrolling a several-mile radius near half a dozen local schools. That choice of location was intentional. Only two months before, at least four parents were arrested or detained by immigration officials near schools in San Diego county alone. Outside one Chula Vista elementary school, an undocumented mother, who had allegedly overstayed her visa, was arrested during morning drop-offs as her children watched from the car.

ICE’s San Diego field office did not respond to several requests for comment regarding the suspected undercover vehicle or any other San Diego arrests near school sites.

In the US, children have the right to a free public education from kindergarten to 12th grade, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Although immigration officers were previously limited in their ability to make arrests in or near “sensitive locations”, like schools and churches, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded those Obama and Biden-era guidelines earlier this year.

So when the three teachers noticed the potential ICE agent in October, they turned their car around and followed. The Dodge parked and the teachers did, too. Juan Orozco, a high school counselor, watched from the driver’s seat. Duran sat next to him, and Aremi Lopez, an elementary school teacher, clutched a megaphone in the backseat.

After a few minutes, the Dodge sped away without warning. The teachers drove after it.

“Buenos días, compañeros,” Duran reported in a series of live social media updates. “Estamos en la comunidad de Shelltown. Estamos aquí reportando, parte de la Association de Raza Educadores y Unión del Barrio, y tenemos movimiento: un Dodge Durango. Gris.”

She immediately translated: “We are here reporting from Shelltown, San Diego. We have identified a Dodge Durango, grey, that has been surveilling our community.”

Fear among students and parents across southern California is at an all-time high, particularly after the supreme court ruled earlier this fall that federal agents can stop and detain residents in Los Angeles simply for speaking Spanish, appearing Latino or working certain types of jobs. Now, there have been instances where students don’t come to school because they, or their parents, are scared to leave the house, Orozco said.

“We live in a state of fear, [whether you’re a] citizen or not a citizen: plumber, professional, mother, grandma, everyone,” he said. “And we shouldn’t live like that.”

But teachers, and a handful of their students, are also quietly and consistently mobilizing in big and small ways: by hosting morning patrols near local schools, organizing know-your-rights seminars, and keeping each other informed about the presence of ICE.

“We said, ‘Hell no, we have to resist,’” Orozco said. “We have to stand for dignity and protect this safe place for us: schools.”

‘They’re coming after all of us’

In the small library of a nearby San Diego high school, 14-year-old Azda* sat across from her sister, 19-year-old Guadalupe*. Behind them, many of the books on the shelves and posters on the wall had activist themes; an illustration of Che Guevara peeked out from the top shelf. In the hallway outside the library, a hand-painted banner read “education not deportation”. The school is located only a few miles from where the suspected undercover ICE vehicle was spotted a week prior.

While Azda just started her freshman year of high school, and Guadalupe her second year of college, the sisters often have more on their minds than other teenagers might.

Because of where they were born, Azda is a citizen, but Guadalupe is undocumented. They’ve always worried that one day ICE may pick up their mother, who is also undocumented.

“I do fear for her,” Guadalupe said of her mother. “But not only just when she’s dropping off her kids at school, it’s every second of the day.”

Growing up, their family had a specific action plan in case of emergency, like other parents in California might prepare for earthquakes or wildfires. But instead, Azda and Guadalupe’s mother prepared them for ICE. If she was deported, their mother told them, they would need to immediately seek help from their aunt, or close friends who lived nearby. Then, to avoid breaking up the family, all of them would need to “flee together” back to Mexico.

Azda and Guadalupe have tried to explain this looming specter of ICE and deportation to their younger siblings, in ways they might be able to understand. When it comes to their little brother, who is four years old, they’ve chosen their words carefully.

“We have to simplify these big concepts to him,” Guadalupe said. “We just say, like, ‘Okay, la migra, they do bad things. They take families – se llevan a las mamás [they take mothers].’”

The language of ICE protests has even worked its way into the four-year-old’s budding vocabulary. He’ll sometimes walk around the house, they said, chanting: “La chota, la migra. ¿La migra, porque dia?” [Or: “Immigration, why are you here?”]

This year, as ICE agents have circled San Diego neighborhoods, businesses and school zones, Azda and Guadalupe have felt perpetually on edge. Everywhere they go, whether to school, or the grocery store, or to hang out with friends, they’ve learned to scan for signs of undercover ICE vehicles: Are those overly tinted windows? Does that SUV have a different kind of license plate?

That sense of unease follows Azda when she goes home, too. As she scrolls through Instagram, reels of dancing and cooking videos bleed into shaky footage of people from around the country being dragged away by ICE. Often, their spouses or children stand off to the side, screaming and crying. But recently, after seeing one of those videos, Azda got angry. She put down her phone and wrote a poem, titled La Migra.

“Todo lo que te digan es una mentira. ¿No saben que esta es nuestra tierra también?” [Or: “Everything they tell you is a lie. Don’t they know this is our land too?”]

Azda’s high school, which is uniquely involved in anti-ICE activism and patrolling, has encouraged her burgeoning sense of advocacy. A majority of the school’s students, if not all, are undocumented themselves or come from mixed-status families, according to staff members there. Azda has attended meetings about how to patrol around her school for ICE, and has walked around her own neighborhood with her aunt to look for “suspicious cars or suspicious people”.

She also recognizes that because she’s a US citizen, unlike her sister and mother, she has an added layer of security when it comes to protesting or being outspoken about immigration issues.

“I don’t feel like I have to do this, I feel like I want to be the one to do it,” Azda said. “Because if I’m not, then who is?”

Guadalupe attends monthly Association of Raza Educators meetings, but thinks her school in particular – San Diego City College – could do more than just hosting a few know-your-rights sessions.

“It’s something that we have to keep actively engaging with. It can’t just be a one-time workshop,” she said. “You can’t just do things by yourself. If something happens to you, you need to have this group of people backing you up.”

As a kid, Guadalupe sometimes felt a gulf between her and her siblings when it came to their differing legal statuses. Now, though, it feels as if they’re all under threat.

“La migra [immigration] and the state are attacking anyone that’s brown. They’re attacking anyone, even US citizens,” she said. “So I don’t feel that division no more. It’s like they’re coming after all of us.”

‘The right to an education’

The three educators on the early-morning ICE patrol agreed: students across different age groups, from high schoolers to younger elementary school students, have had similar responses to the immigration crackdown. Fear, they said, is an equalizing force.

“They’re all stressed, scared,” Orozco remarked from the driver’s seat, before they spotted the undercover ICE vehicle. “They don’t know what this means.”

San Diego has seen far more immigration activity in 2025 than in years past; three times as many people were arrested by ICE in just the first half of this year compared to all of 2024, NBC reported. More than 50% of the 2025 arrests involved people with no criminal convictions.

But the immigrant community in San Diego has felt some version of this fear for a long time, Orozco added. Unión del Barrio, the southern California-based political organization that founded the Association of Raza Educators, first started conducting community patrols to scan for law enforcement more than three decades ago. And the recent supreme court ruling merely formalized the racial profiling that’s been happening behind the scenes for years, he said.

When he was 12 years old, in the early 1980s, Orozco remembers waiting at a bus stop in downtown San Diego. An unmarked white van – with the telltale metal prisoner partition inside – pulled up unexpectedly in front of him. What he believed to be immigration agents got out and threw Orozco in the back.

“And I started kicking and screaming, kicking and screaming,” he said. “Then they pulled off to the side and the two officers said: ‘Say the Pledge of Allegiance.’ I started saying it and they let me go.”

Orozco walked shakily back to the bus. Bystanders were shocked. “It looked like a kidnapping,” he said.

One of the goals of the early-morning teacher patrols is to prevent similar situations from happening – or to at least alert people when they do.

But after the three educators followed the undercover Dodge down a few streets, they eventually lost track of it. At an intersection, Duran and Orozco looked left to right, and examined the parked cars in driveways for signs of recent movement. But the Dodge was gone.

“There’s the relief that although we did lose [the vehicle], we did at least change their plans,” Duran said. “And they might not have had the luck to execute whatever they were expecting to.”

On a policy level, there is some hope on the horizon: in late October, the San Diego city council voted to move forward with an ordinance that, once passed, would require federal law enforcement to obtain a judicial warrant in order to access any non-public area of city-controlled property, which would include the inside of city-run public schools. The ordinance would not apply to the outside of schools, or to surrounding neighborhoods.

Another similar law was passed at the state level in September, although some immigration experts say it may be too soon to tell what kind of impact the new legislation will truly have on ICE operations. The Association of Raza Educators and other groups are also preparing for the eventual fallout from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which allocated billions to be spent hiring as many as 10,000 new immigration officers across the US.

As the teachers ended their morning patrol and headed back to their original meeting point, the neighborhood began to fill with families. Parents walked hand-in-hand with their children to an elementary school nearby.

“You see the beauty of our community,” Duran said, watching the scene unfold from the passenger seat. “Just doing what any other human being would do in the United States: taking their children to school because they have the right to a free education.”

With the patrol over, Duran, Orozco and the other educators and volunteers quickly packed up their gear: their mounted car cameras, their walkie talkies, their megaphones.

It was 7am, and they needed to make their way to their real jobs – the school day was starting soon.

Agents seen near Hoover Elementary

What we know:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were in the area of 31st and Market streets, close to Hoover Elementary School.

The Oakland Unified School District told KTVU, ""We have confirmed ICE activity in the West Oakland community.""

Parents notified

Dig deeper:

Parents received an alert on the ParentSquare platform notifying them of the activity.

""We got confirmation that there is ICE activity in the neighborhood. They are on 31st and Market Street knocking on doors. The kids are safe and secure at school. Please do no come to the school. We will alert you when things are quiet in the neighborhood again,"" the notification read.

Despite the district’s request to stay away, a group of parents and community advocates gathered in the area and were posted at every corner.

Jeff Ernstfriedman, whose daughter is a second-grader at Hoover Elementary, said he went to the school after receiving the alert and was told the campus was on lockdown.

""I personally saw camouflage individuals going door to door. I didn’t see them take anyone out. I did see the community was able to raise enough of an issue for them, and they stopped,"" Ernstfriedman said.

He described the situation as alarming but said he believed students were safe.

""I feel they are safe here. This is the safest place to be if they’re already here. It’s unfortunate that it happens, but it’s scary,"" he said.

Community vows to keep watch

While school officials urged parents not to come to campus until the situation calmed down, advocates said they planned to stay put to monitor for any potential federal activity.

Ernstfriedman said when community members asked agents to leave, one reportedly replied that they were ""there to protect the homeland,"" and then thanked the residents for doing their part, but asked them to let agents do theirs.

(WTVD) -- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have shifted their immigration enforcement focus away from Raleigh and stay in Charlotte, according to a source familiar with operations. This comes after sparking fear and protests across the Triangle.

Reports from the Triangle included federal agents apprehending people in Cary and North Raleigh.

Businesses across the Triangle also closed for the day out of caution. Several chose not to open on Wednesday. Some shops along Chatham Street in Cary were shuttered, and others in downtown Raleigh, like El Toro Loco Taqueria, posted online that they were closing for the safety of the Latino community.

Durham Public Schools (DPS) reported low attendance numbers Tuesday among Latino students district wide.

""They are fearful of walking to school and getting detained or questions. Somebody putting a gun in their face,"" Carmon Ramon, a counselor with DPS, said. ""They are fearful of their parents going to work.""

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said in a statement on Monday that federal agents were expected to continue their operations in her city on Tuesday after they fanned across nearby Charlotte over the weekend.

Cowell, a Democrat, said the federal action was not requested.

""As the capital city, it is important to us that everyone who lives, works, plays, and learns in Raleigh feels safe,"" Cowell said. ""We have been made aware that Customs and Border Protection are coming to Raleigh. While the Raleigh Police Department is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law.""

The immigration enforcement surge in the Charlotte area has led to the arrests of over 250 illegal immigrants as of Monday, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told ABC11 in a statement.

Greg Bovino, the commander-at-large of CBP, is blaming North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein for what he said was an increase in violent rhetoric that federal agents are facing in their immigration enforcement blitz in the state.

Bovino took to social media on Tuesday to slam Stein, a Democrat who released a statement over the weekend asking residents of the Tar Heel State to report any ""inappropriate behavior"" they witness from federal agents.

""If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement, who will continue to keep our communities safe after these federal agents leave,"" Stein said.

In a social media post, Bovino told Stein, ""You need to check yourself,"" and cited an online video of a woman threatening to use a screwdriver to stab U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents if they pull her over.

""Governor Stein, you caused this,"" Bovino said in the post. ""Let me say that again, Governor. When you spout lies about a lawful law enforcement operation, you spark something in weaker-minded people like this who may act upon your direction.""

Bovino did not specifically say what statements from Stein prompted his social media response.

On Sunday, Stein issued a statement, saying, ""We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling, and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks.""

Bovino's warning to Stein came after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cited two incidents this week in Charlotte in which people allegedly rammed the vehicles of federal agents or drove directly at the agents.

Federal agents are expected to stay in North Carolina until Friday, according to preliminary information from federal authorities. By the end of the week, about 200 agents are expected to be redeployed to New Orleans to begin ""Operation Catahoula Crunch"" in the Big Easy, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

November 19, 2025

Dear Majority Leader Thune, Minority Leader Schumer, Speaker Johnson, Minority Leader Jeffries, Chair Collins, Vice Chair Murray, Chair Cole, and Ranking Member DeLauro:

On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 240 national organizations to promote and protect the rights of all persons in the United States; our Census Task Force co-chairs, Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC and NALEO Educational Fund; and the 48 undersigned organizations, we write to highlight several essential issues affecting the success of the 2030 Census and availability of useful, accurate Census Bureau data to guide policymaking, as you finalize the Fiscal Year 2026 Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill (as a stand-alone measure or part of an omnibus package):

We urge funding for the Census Bureau at or above the amount requested in the president’s budget and allocated in the House Appropriations Committee CJS mark: $1.6765 billion.

Conferees must exclude section 556 of the House CJS bill. The directive to exclude undocumented immigrants from the congressional apportionment base would violate the U.S. Constitution and dash any chance for an accurate census in all states.

Conferees must also exclude section 605 of the House CJS bill. This provision would limit attempts to collect data from households for the census and surveys to two inquiries. The effect on data quality and accuracy would be catastrophic.

I . Full funding for the Census Bureau is essential to keep robust 2030 Census planning on track.

Sound investments now will help to ensure the future success and cost efficiency of the 2030 Census. An insufficient funding level for the Census Bureau will disrupt census planning at a pivotal point in the decade, undermining a carefully developed research and testing agenda that will significantly increase costs later in the decade and put accuracy at risk. It also would diminish efforts to strengthen other vital Census Bureau surveys that produce data on which public and private sector decisionmakers (including members of Congress) rely every day. For example, the American Community Survey (ACS), the ongoing part of the decennial census, is a trusted source of accurate and regularly updated demographic, socioeconomic, and housing data used by governments, businesses, and the nonprofit sector nationwide. Failure to fund even modest improvements to the ACS will continue to erode data quality, even as Congress itself relies on ACS data to allocate trillions of federal assistance dollars annually to states, localities, and families.

FY 2026 is particularly pivotal in the ramp-up to the 2030 Census, as the Census Bureau prepares to conduct the 2026 Census Test, the only large-scale field test of outreach, methodological, and operational improvements for the next census before the dress rehearsal in 2028. A robust 2026 Census Test is essential to ensuring the accuracy of the 2030 Census and containing overall costs, goals that Congress supports on a bipartisan basis. The window of opportunity to research methods to reach groups at risk of being missed, including renters and young children, as well as increasingly distrustful population groups in rural areas and low-income neighborhoods, on American Indian reservations, and in Black, Hispanic, and other historically undercounted communities, will close soon.

II. The U.S. Constitution requires a count of all persons living in the U.S, for apportionment purposes.

Section 556 of the House Appropriations Committee CJS mark cannot remain in a final FY 2026 bill. Every census since the first enumeration in 1790 has included citizens and non-citizens for the purpose of congressional apportionment. Section 556 would require the Census Bureau to exclude undocumented persons living in the United States from the tabulation of state population used to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives after each census. Throughout the nation’s history, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have concluded that excluding undocumented immigrants or all non-citizens from the apportionment base would be unconstitutional and contrary to the 14th Amendment’s clear command to count the “whole number of persons in each State” for apportionment. While the constitutional infirmity of section 556 cannot be overcome, it is worth noting that asking about immigration status on the census questionnaire — which would be required to meet such a directive — is unnecessary and would raise concerns among all respondents, both native-born and immigrant, about the confidentiality and privacy of information provided to the government. This will have a chilling effect on participation and keep many residents from responding, jeopardizing the accuracy of the census used for many non-apportionment purposes in every state and community. We strongly urge you to remove section 556 from the final FY 2026 CJS appropriations bill.

III. Limiting household contacts in the census and surveys would result in unreliable and unusable data that guides critical decision-making in all sectors.

Section 605 of the House Appropriations Committee CJS mark limits contact with households to two “inquiries,” significantly restricting the Census Bureau’s ability to collect information from households and businesses that do not respond quickly to censuses and other surveys. If enacted, section 605 would fundamentally transform how the Census Bureau conducts virtually every census and associated survey. Particularly alarming, the proposal could shut down counting efforts in the decennial census after only a third of households have responded, based on the 2020 Census experience. Equally alarming, incomplete follow-up for the ACS could deprive towns, rural communities, and tribal areas of any useful data, while Economic Census data that serve as a baseline for Gross Domestic Product and other key economic indicators could be compromised. Valuable socio-economic data for smaller population groups, such as people with disabilities and veterans, also could be curtailed. In short, section 605 would force the Census Bureau to stop contacting households and businesses after two attempts to secure a response in every census and survey, no matter how low the initial response rate. The enactment of section 605 would result in lower response rates for Census Bureau surveys, thereby disrupting the collection of foundational statistics that support our democratic institutions and economy. Without sufficiently high response rates in many areas, the Census Bureau will not be able to publish demographic and economic data of acceptable quality and reliability, threatening informed private sector decision-making and the prudent allocation of federal program funds to every state, county and city, and community in the country.

For these reasons, we strongly urge any final Fiscal Year 2026 CJS package to ensure Census Bureau funding that matches or exceeds the president’s budget request and the House mark of $1.6765 billion and excludes sections 556 and 605 of the House CJS appropriations mark. Thank you for considering our views as Congress moves towards completing the FY 2026 appropriations cycle.

Sincerely,

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights

Nida Allam, the chair of the Durham Board of County Commissioners, said border agents were in the city to stoke fear, not fight crime.

Tens of thousands of public school students have been reported absent. And businesses in immigrant communities shuttered as border agents patrolled the streets.

North Carolina has become the latest focus of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, as federal agents surge into Charlotte and spread out across other Democratic-led cities in the notorious swing state, including Durham and Raleigh.

Located hundreds of miles from the southern and northern borders, North Carolina doesn't often generate national attention for immigration related issues, leading residents and local officials to question why the state that voted for Donald Trump in the last three presidential elections is being targeted.

The Department of Homeland Security said it launched “Operation Charlotte’s Web” to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

But Charlotte is not considered a sanctuary city, and the state has some of the strictest immigration provisions in the country, experts said, including a mandate passed last year requiring local jails to hold arrested immigrants for a limited time so they can be picked up by federal authorities.

“No cities in the state have sanctuary policies, if they did they would be violating state law,” said Rick Su, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina who specializes in immigration and local government.

Su also noted that no city in North Carolina was included on the Justice Department’s list of ""sanctuary jurisdictions,"" which the agency defines as areas with “policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Over the weekend, federal agents arrested over 130 undocumented immigrants in Charlotte, including several dozen with previous charges ranging from driving under the influence to aggravated assault, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). USA TODAY is unable to independently verify those figures as the agency has not released the names of those arrested, or their exact charges.

After the weekend raids, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein criticized the operation as inducing “widespread fear” and said it is “not about public safety.”

“They’re driving around Charlotte in unmarked cars wearing paramilitary garb, masks, stopping people on the street randomly based on the color of their skin,” Stein said. “This is not promoting safety in our communities. The people of North Carolina deserve to be safe.”

Charlotte reeling from immigration sweeps as enforcement expands

Federal agents began surging into Charlotte neighborhoods on Saturday, Nov. 15, spurring business closures across immigrant communities as protesters took to the streets to decry the operations.

Homeland Security officials have not said how many agents have been sent to the state or how long the heightened enforcement will last.

The operations are being led by Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who coordinated immigration raids in Chicago that triggered lawsuits and fierce backlash over what many described as agents' aggressive enforcement tactics.

Bovino, who, according to a federal judge, admitted to lying about a rock-throwing incident used to justify the deployment tear gas on protesters, is from western North Carolina.

Since the enforcement began in Charlotte, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District said over 30,000 students – about 20% of the student population – were absent on Monday, Nov. 17, according to preliminary data. Officials have not tied the low attendance numbers directly to the immigration enforcement. According to data from the school district, 31% of the student population identifies as Hispanic.

Videos of border agents conducting arrests have drawn scrutiny, including one of masked agents smashing the window of a U.S. citizen and pulling him to the ground. The man, Willy Aceituno, was brought into a Border Patrol vehicle and released after he showed agents documentation proving his citizenship, he told the Associated Press.

“I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I’ve seen,” said Mayor Vi Lyles in a statement on X. She added that her office is working to determine “what more we can do to support our community while working within complicated legal boundaries.”

At a city council meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 18, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said immigration authorities were spotted in Wake and Durham counties. She urged people to call the Raleigh Police Department if they feel unsafe or see something illegal.

In Durham, local officials held a news conference and spoke out against the federal intervention. Nida Allam, the chair of the Durham Board of County Commissioners, said border agents were in the city to stoke fear, not fight crime.

“Durham is over 1,300 miles from the border,” Allam said. “None of this was about securing our borders, none of it was about enforcing the law. It was a show of force meant to scare people.”

Charlotte, a recent flashpoint in the debate around crime in US cities

This is not the first time Charlotte has found itself at the center of national debates around public safety.

In August, the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a public train in Charlotte drew national headlines and the attention of the White House. Trump seized on the incident as an example of rampant violent crime in Democratic-led cities, pointing to the suspect’s lengthy criminal history.

In Charlotte, rates of violent crime have fallen sharply this year, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. The agency said through the first nine months of 2025, Charlotte saw a 20% reduction in violent crimes including as homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

So far this year, Durham and Raleigh have seen rates of violent crime either stay level or dip when compared with 2024, according to their respective police departments.

In its recent statements, the Department of Homeland Security has sought to tie its immigration enforcement in North Carolina to public safety and policies that they say allow criminals to roam the streets.

Research has shown that, on average, immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal, under U.S. law.

""Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”

In a statement posted to its website, DHS also accused local law enforcement in North Carolina of refusing to comply with almost 1,400 detainer requests by immigration officials to hold arrested suspects for 48 hours.

It is true that for years, Mecklenburg County, which encompasses Charlotte, did not honor such detainers. But that changed last year when the majority-Republican legislature overcame a veto and passed a measure forcing sheriff's offices to hold arrested immigrants temporarily for federal authorities.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has publicly feuded with immigration authorities over enforcement but he has maintained that his office is complying with detainer requirements.

In recent months, he said he has sought to improve communication with federal immigration officials. In late October, McFadden called a meeting with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement's regional leaders.

""I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,"" McFadden said after the meeting, according to local media reports.

Last week, McFadden announced publicly that two federal officials told him Border Patrol agents would soon be arriving in Charlotte. He added, “specific details regarding the federal operation have not been disclosed.”

The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, argues that USCIS’s August 2025 “voter registration ban” violates both the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment by discriminating against speech promoting voting rights for naturalized citizens.​​

For decades, the League has been a trusted partner at naturalization ceremonies, registering hundreds of thousands of newly sworn-in Americans to vote. In 2024 alone, League volunteers attended 2,789 naturalization ceremonies and helped 122,141 new citizens register—roughly 8 percent of all people naturalized that year.​

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by:

But on August 29, 2025, USCIS announced without notice or public comment that only state and local election officials—not nonpartisan civic groups—would be permitted to provide voter registration services at administrative naturalization ceremonies.​​

“Purposely excluding groups like the League from administrative naturalization ceremonies is a deliberate move by this administration to deny new citizens access to the democratic process,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters of the United States.​

The lawsuit names USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as defendants, along with their respective agencies.​

Pattern of Sexual Violence in Immigration Detention

The legal challenge comes amid mounting evidence of systemic sexual abuse of women detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection—abuses that advocacy groups say often go uninvestigated and unpunished.

Between 2010 and 2017, migrant women filed more than 1,224 complaints of sexual assault by ICE officials covering nearly all states with immigration detention facilities. Recent data obtained by investigative journalists reveals 308 sexual assault and abuse complaints filed by immigrants detained in ICE facilities nationwide between 2015 and 2021. More than half of all abuse allegations were directed against staff members.​

In one harrowing 2020 case at an El Paso detention center, guards systematically sexually assaulted detained women in security camera “blind spots,” forcibly kissing them and touching their intimate parts. When one 35-year-old Mexican woman reported the abuse to a captain, he dismissed her. Guards told her “no one would believe her” because the assaults occurred where no footage existed.​

That woman was deported while investigations were ongoing, effectively silencing a key witness.​

At Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, five women accused a male nurse of sexually assaulting them during medical examinations between 2021 and early 2022. The women alleged the nurse exploited his position to force them to expose themselves and inappropriately touched them without medical justification. When two women reported the abuse while still detained, they faced aggressive interrogations, threats of extended imprisonment, and food being withheld.​

A year after their complaint was filed, the nurse remained employed at the facility.​

In Florida’s Glades County Detention Center, seven immigrant women filed a federal lawsuit in 2021 alleging that male guards would watch them shower or enter living areas unannounced for sexual voyeurism. One woman also reported sexual harassment by the facility’s psychiatrist.​

A 2023 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that sexual assault allegations in ICE facilities were stable between 2018 and 2022, though allegations against facility staff significantly increased. The research revealed that sexual assault occurred in ICE detention at a rate up to 3.5 times higher than in the general U.S. population.​

Only 2.4 percent of sexual abuse complaints filed with the DHS Office of Inspector General between 2010 and 2016 were investigated.​

Border Patrol Agents Accused of Abuse

Border Patrol agents have also faced allegations of sexual misconduct and violence against migrant women.

Internal Department of Homeland Security documents obtained by Human Rights Watch in 2021 detailed over 160 reports of misconduct and abuse of asylum seekers by CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and ICE officials, primarily between 2016 and 2021. The reports included allegations of physical, sexual, and verbal abuse.​

In one instance, an asylum officer reported that a young girl was “forced to undress and touched inappropriately by a guard in the Ice Box wearing green,” referring to a border holding cell. The documents do not indicate how DHS responded to the allegation.​

In August 2024, Border Patrol agent Shane Millan, 53, was arrested and charged with violating women’s constitutional rights after allegedly coercing several women to reveal their chests during virtual processing for entry into the United States. Prosecutors said Millan instructed women on at least three occasions to remove their clothing and display their bare chests via webcam, claiming it was standard procedure when it was actually “driven by his own personal gratification”.​

And in February 2025, former CBP officer Aaron Thomas Mitchell was convicted of kidnapping and civil rights offenses after abducting and sexually assaulting a teenage girl while identifying himself as law enforcement.​

A report analyzing Border Patrol complaint outcomes found that most allegations of sexual misconduct resulted in “no action taken,” including cases where agents allegedly solicited sexual favors in exchange for entrance to the U.S. or made minors remove their clothing.​

“They Treat You Like You Are Worthless”

The American Civil Liberties Union has documented nearly 200 allegations of sexual abuse from immigration detainees since 2007 alone. Yet the Department of Justice explicitly excluded immigration detention facilities from coverage under the Prison Rape Elimination Act in proposed regulations.​

“Without PREA’s protection, immigrants in detention remain vulnerable to abuse,” the ACLU warned.​

The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission found that immigrant women in detention are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. Despite this, in April 2025, the Department of Justice terminated all funding for the National Prison Rape Elimination Act Resource Center, which trained auditors and provided resources to sexual assault victims. The funding was restored only after a preliminary injunction in litigation.​

Whistleblowers revealed that the closure of DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties resulted in the abandonment of at least 25 sexual abuse complaints.​

Human Rights Watch researcher Clara Long described the conduct reported in internal government documents as “jaw-dropping,” adding: “These internal government documents make clear that reports of grievous abuses—assaults, sexual abuse, and discriminatory treatment by US agents—are an open secret within DHS”.​

League Calls Ban Unconstitutional

The League’s lawsuit argues that USCIS issued the voter registration ban without following the Administrative Procedure Act’s required notice-and-comment process and without providing any reasoned justification. The ban also violates the First Amendment by restricting core political speech and discriminating based on viewpoint, content, and speaker identity, the complaint alleges.​

“The ban discriminates—based on viewpoint, content, and the identity of the speaker—against speech promoting the right to vote for new citizens, and tramples on the League’s freedom of association,” the lawsuit states.​​

USCIS claimed the change was necessary to ensure “nonpartisanship” and reduce administrative burdens, but the complaint notes that state and local election officials in numerous states are themselves partisan actors elected on a partisan basis. The ban also identifies no existing problems with the nonpartisanship of groups like the League.​

Since the ban took effect, state and local League chapters have been forced to cancel at least 166 planned voter registration events where volunteers expected to register approximately 10,000 new voters.​​

The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the ban unconstitutional, set it aside as unlawful, and enjoin DHS and USCIS from enforcing it.​

The League is represented by Campaign Legal Center, which has previously litigated to protect nonpartisan voter registration work in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Missouri and Montana.​","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z-NW!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6b66552-35b1-465a-a5a3-6ea5efaeee15_300x168.jpeg",N,,2025-11-19 13:58:21.967084

The Immigration Defense Network (IDN) gathered at Bro-Tex Inc., a paper and textile company located at 830 Hampden Ave., at 9 a.m. The organization is asking authorities for clarity on Tuesday morning's raid, which ICE says involved conducting a search warrant connected to an ongoing criminal investigation. IDN wants to know how many people were detained in the Tuesday morning raid, and what type of property was confiscated.

Among the speakers at the gathering was Mayor-elect Kaohly Her, who said she was not speaking from a political platform but as someone who has lived the immigrant experience.

""I want you all to know I am standing with you, not as somebody who is in government but as somebody who is in an impacted community who has watched people from my own community who are American citizens get detained by ICE for days until they can prove that they were American citizens,"" Her told the gathered crowd of more than 200.

""When that happens to our community it is not just that they were detained and released, that they lose jobs from not being able to go to them, that their families that relied on them cannot, the children that need their parents to be there to give them transportation to school do not have them, that there are huge ripple effects when our families are targeted in this way,"" Her said.

Marco Hernandez, outreach coordinator for the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, spoke of tactics used by federal agents and the Trump administration to strip away the civil rights of those seeking status.

""The conduct we've seen around the country is disturbing. Masked ICE agents have been tearing families apart and terrorizing communities,"" Hernandez stated. ""Here in Minnesota, more than 200 people have been detained outside the immigration court at Fort Snelling this year. People making use of one of their very few legal pathways that people have to acquire status, only to be arrested by ICE when their cases are prematurely canceled and they walk out of the courtroom.""

Armed agents wearing vests from ICE and the FBI descended on the building that houses Bro-Tex LLC early Tuesday, and were seen moving in and out of the building. Witnesses said they saw people being detained.

While ICE would not comment on people being taken into custody, a man who identified himself as Jesus Trejo told a KARE 11 photojournalist that his father, Isaias Villagrana Flores, and uncle were taken into custody after agents entered the business.

""They took my dad, he comes to work, he supports his family. A good guy, no criminal,"" Trejo said, fighting to hold back tears. Trejo said his dad called his mother and said agents ""stormed"" the building.

""They'll see the outcome of what they've done, what they've taken away,"" Trejo said. He said his father has worked at Bro-Tex for years.

It did not take long for messages to get out via text and social media platforms, and a crowd of hundreds swarmed the scene, blowing whistles and screaming at the federal agents. Some activists challenged a line set up by agents, which led to some nose-to-nose confrontations, pushing and shoving. Eventually, one agent pulled a can of pepper spray and doused multiple protestors in the face.

The operation was one of several by ICE in recent months that have community organizers concerned. A raid at a Minneapolis restaurant in June led to similar hostilities between activists and agents. In October, a Latino roofer was pulled off a job site by ICE, and one month later in Northfield, a man was taken from a vehicle.

KARE 11 spoke with the Trump administration's nominee for Minnesota's U.S. Marshal, former Anoka County Sheriff James Stuart, on the rise in ICE activity in Minnesota. He maintains that removing undocumented immigrants is something that has been going on for years, and worries about the current backlash involving the practice.

A New York federal judge struck down a Justice Department lawsuit this week that sought to end a law that prevents immigration officials from arresting individuals in New York State courthouses.

U.S. District Judge Mae D'Agostino dismissed the lawsuit from the Trump administration lawsuit that argued the 2020 Protect Our Courts Act and two state executive orders that limit state employees' cooperation with the federal government were unconstitutional. The decision marks a major setback for the president’s efforts to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in the city and state.

The 41-page ruling released on late Monday evening flatly rejected the Trump administration’s arguments that POCA and the executive orders were unconstitutional and went against the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, referred to as INA.

Core to the Justice Department’s argument was that federal law supersedes any conflicting state law, and state officials were required to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

But D'Agostino, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, saw otherwise and ruled that the state’s sovereignty in these matters is protected by the 10th Amendment.

“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the decision reads. “The Executive Orders and POCA reflect Defendants' decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law – a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment and not preempted by the INA.”

The decision for now puts to rest the question of whether federal immigration authorities will appear in New York’s state and local courts. D'Agostino’s ruling will have no effect on ICE operations at 26 Federal Plaza, which is under federal jurisdiction.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who was listed as a defendant iin the lawsuit, celebrated the decision.

“Everyone deserves to seek justice without fear,” James said in a statement. “This ruling ensures that anyone can use New York’s state courts without being targeted by federal authorities.”

The decision was also applauded by numerous legal aid organizations, including the Legal Aid Society, The Bronx Defenders, Brooklyn Defender Service and the New York Civil Liberties Union.

“Today’s decision confirms what we’ve said for months: courthouses are no place for ICE agents to arrest people,” Amy Belsher, director of Immigrants’ Rights Litigation at the NYCLU, told the Eagle in a statement. “This is a significant victory, but the work doesn't end here: the NYCLU is fighting in the courts to ensure ICE is also prohibited from conducting arrests in immigration courts.”

Other advocacy groups, like the New York Immigration Coalition, said Monday’s ruling was a significant win but called for lawmakers to continue advocating for further legislation prohibiting local law enforcement from working with federal immigration agents.

“When ICE arrests people who show up for their court cases, it disincentivizes people from following the legal processes set forth in our country,” Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, said. “Judge D'Agostino’s ruling is an important step towards maintaining the integrity of local and state courts in New York.”

“New York must further its commitment to the safety of all New Yorkers by passing the New York For All Act, and the federal government must stop its unlawful detentions of New Yorkers at federal immigration courts throughout the state,” Awawdeh added.

New York State does not have a specific immigrant sanctuary law, but does have laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials.

POCA was signed into law by former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in December 2020. The law prohibits arrests in and around New York State courthouses without a judicial warrant, with a specific intent towards migrants. The law does not pertain to federal courts or immigration courts.

The two Executive Orders named in the suit, 170 and 170.1, were also signed by Cuomo in 2017 and 2018 respectively. They restrict warrantless civil arrests in New York State buildings and limit state employee cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The Justice Department filed the 17-page lawsuit against the state, the attorney general and Governor Kathy Hochul in June 2025.

""Governor Hochul has been clear: You don't make New York State safer by targeting families, children and hardworking individuals,” a spokesperson for the governor told the Eagle in a statement. “The court made the right decision in upholding New York’s sovereignty, and the state will continue to work with federal and local law enforcement in cracking down on violent offenders while keeping our communities safe and enforcing our laws.""

Legal advocates and immigration attorneys have said ICE arrests during immigration hearings have had a chilling effect on immigrants seeking to obtain citizenship through the proper channels. Preventing federal agents from making arrests in state and local courthouses, advocates argue, will likewise prevent that same chilling effect for local criminal and civil cases.

“As public defenders, we are bolstered by the Court’s dismissal of the federal government’s lawsuit challenging New York’s Protect Our Courts Act,” Lucas Marquez, director of Civil Rights and Law Reform at Brooklyn Defender Services, said in a statement. “POCA ensures that New Yorkers who attend court to address critical issues in their lives can do so safely without interference from federal immigration agents, and codifies the long-standing privilege against civil arrests in courthouses.”

Several years after the deportation order, he was convicted of rape, in 1972.

Sanford grandfather, born in refugee camp, nabbed by ICE after 70 years in U.S.","A 79-year-old retired Sanford optician who faces deportation for his criminal past after living in the United States since he was five will remain in federal custody while an immigration judge decides whether she can rule on his request to be released on bond.

“There is a legal issue in your case that is a little complicated that I am going to have to think about, so I won’t be making a decision on your bond today,” Judge Romy Lerner told Paul John Bojerski at a bond hearing Tuesday at the Krome Detention Center in Miami.

“Unfortunately, no matter what I decide, the government may appeal my decision, which may involve you remaining in detention even if I were to grant the bond,” she added.

A lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security at the hearing confirmed that she would appeal a decision made in Bojerski’s favor. If the judge grants bond, the government will appeal. If the judge later rules that Bojerski’s current deportation order is no longer valid — as his attorney argues — the department will issue a new one and seek deportation to a third country, she said.

Gayle Bojerski, 82, said she talked to her husband after the hearing. “He sounded good. and he can handle it,” she said. “That’s all we can do.”

Bojerski, born to Polish parents in a displacement camp in war-torn Germany in 1946, came to the U.S. with his family in 1952 where they were granted lawful permanent residency.

He was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Oct. 30 and sent to Alligator Alcatraz, based on a deportation order issued over 50 years ago that U.S. immigration authorities failed to act on. The order was issued after Bojerski’s conviction for larceny and accepting stolen goods in the 1960s. Several years after the deportation order, he was convicted of rape, in 1972.

The US revoked his permanent residency status but couldn’t execute the deportation order because the countries where he and his parents were born — Germany and Poland — refused to accept him. Immigration authorities allowed him to stay in the U.S. on a supervisory order that requires him to check in with officials whenever asked.

His lawyer, David Stoller of Orlando, argued that the deportation order is no longer valid because in 1988 Bojerski and his wife, Gayle, went to Canada for their honeymoon and reentered the US successfully — essentially fulfilling the obligations of the order. They were not questioned or held by immigration officials at that time.

DHS officials argued that Bojerski had no proof that he re-entered the country legally, and therefore was here illegally.

Sanford grandfather, born in refugee camp, nabbed by ICE after 70 years in U.S.

But Stoller argued that the burden is on the government to prove that Bojerski attempted or succeeded to enter the country without inspection by immigration officials.

“The government just can’t say ‘you’re here, we’ll agree that you left and came back, you don’t have proof you reentered legally so we’ll just assume that you didn’t’.” Stoller said. “And to the extent that the assumption would be made, we have affidavits explaining exactly how he came back to the states … lawfully.”

Stoller said Bojerski posed no danger to the community because the “last time this gentleman had any trouble I was two years old.”

Despite his criminal history, Lerner questioned the need to detain an elderly man. “At this age, stage and health situation. I have concerns about that,” the judge said.

Bojerski has severe back problems and vascular stenosis and requires pain medications and blood thinners, which his family said he has not received regularly since he was sent to Alligator Alcatraz on Oct. 30. At Krome, he fell out of his wheelchair, Stoller said.

Bojerski is not a flight risk, Stoller added, noting that when ICE dug up his file in 2008, it was able to reach him at the phone number and address in his file.

“They asked him to come in, which he did, and he has done every single time in the subsequent 16-17 years.” Stoller said. “He knew that the possibility existed on Oct. 30 that he might be detained and he went there knowing what he was facing and knowing he had an obligation to show up when and as required and he will continue to do so.”

Bojerski tried to gain permanent residency as a spouse of a U.S.-born citizen in 2009, but the application was denied. He has never applied for citizenship, Stoller said.

The DHS lawyer said his rape conviction from 1972 made him a danger to the community but agreed he was not a flight risk.

The rape charge stemmed from an incident at a fraternity party, where several other students sexually abused a young woman, his wife said. Bojerski said he didn’t participate but was arrested along with the others, who took plea deals. He didn’t take a plea deal because he believed he did nothing wrong, she said.",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TOS-L-Bojerski-bond-hearing-01-e1763495120770.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-19 14:57:21.755834

(AP) — A federal judge in Florida is pushing for a resolution in a lawsuit over whether detainees at an immigration center in the Florida Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz” are getting adequate access to attorneys.

U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell last Friday ordered a two-day conference to be held next month in her Fort Myers courtroom, with attorneys present who have the authority to settle. The judge asked for an update at a hearing next Monday.

“The court will not entertain excuses regarding leaving early for flights or other meetings,” the judge wrote about next month's conference.

The lawsuit filed by detainees against the federal and state governments over legal access is one of three federal cases challenging practices at the immigration detention center that was built this summer at a remote airstrip in the Florida Everglades by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

In a separate environmental lawsuit, a federal appellate court panel in September allowed the center to continue operating by putting on hold a lower court’s preliminary injunction ordering the facility to wind down by the end of October. The appeal was put on hold during the government shutdown but resumed last week.

A third lawsuit claims immigration is a federal issue and Florida agencies and private contractors hired by the state have no authority to operate the facility.

President Donald Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. While the facility was built and operated by the state and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing Florida for $608 million.

In the legal access case, attorneys representing detainees at the Everglades facility are seeking a preliminary injunction that will make it easier for their clients to meet and communicate with their individual attorneys.

They claim that detainees' attorneys must make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other detention facilities where the lawyers can just show up during visiting hours; that detainees often are transferred to other facilities after their attorneys have made an appointment to see them; and that scheduling delays have been so lengthy that detainees are unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.

Florida officials said in a motion to dismiss that the case is now moot since the concerns initially raised by the detainees and their attorneys have been addressed. Any delays were due to trying to construct a facility for thousands of detainees in a remote area with little infrastructure, they said.

As the Trump administration spearheaded a surge in what many human rights advocates describe as unlawful and discriminatory raids, detentions and deportations, more immigrant families report avoiding activities outside their homes, such as taking children to school, going to work, or receiving health care, compared to two years ago.

“Immigrants’ avoidance of activities outside the home are likely driven in part by heightened immigration enforcement activities,” wrote the report’s authors, “as well as policy changes that have allowed immigration enforcement activity in previously protected areas, including places of worship, schools, and health care facilities and to allow ICE to pursue arrests without a warrant.”

Four in 10 immigrants, including 7 in 10 undocumented immigrants, said they personally worry they or a family member could be detained or deported, compared to about 2 in 10 in 2023. About 4 in 10 immigrants also said they were worried about their immigration status being revoked and being separated from children or family members.

These fears extended to children in immigrant families, with about a quarter of immigrant parents saying their children have expressed worries or concerns about something bad happening to someone in their family because they are an immigrant. The share rose to 6 in 10 among likely undocumented immigrant parents and to about 4 in 10 among Hispanic immigrant parents.

“My family, friends, and colleagues are worried, stressed, and scared every single time we step out of our homes as we don’t want to be the next family to be deported,” said a 40-year-old Nicaraguan immigrant woman in Illinois who was quoted in the survey.

More immigrant families are also struggling financially since Donald Trump took office. About half of immigrants say they have had problems paying for essentials like housing, food and health care, as well as earning a living, in the past year — up from 3 in 10 who said the same in 2023.

Texas’ map that adds five Republican pickup opportunities is now blocked unless the Supreme Court intervenes.

Judges will convene Wednesday to consider blocking North Carolina’s new map that could give Republicans another seat. And a similar hearing is two weeks away in California, where voters passed a new map that adds as many as five pickup opportunities for Democrats.

In each state, lawmakers contend they redrew the maps for partisan advantage. Federal courts have no authority to strike down partisan gerrymanders.

But the challengers insist the changes were really about race.

In Texas, a 2-1 ruling Tuesday that the state’s new map is a likely racial gerrymander moves the ball to the Supreme Court.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) vowed to “swiftly appeal” to the justices.

“The Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans’ conservative voting preferences – and for no other reason. Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearing,” Abbott said in a statement.

Texas’s candidate filing deadline is fast approaching on Dec. 8, less than three weeks away. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) confirmed the state will bring an emergency appeal asking the high court to immediately revive the map.

The justices’ consideration will come as they work behind the scenes on drafting their decision on Louisiana’s congressional map, a long-running battle that predates the recent redistricting blitz.

Louisiana’s case raises far-reaching questions about the future of race in redistricting that could impact the new challenges.

As Texas heads to the Supreme Court, the battle over North Carolina’s newly minted congressional map is headed into the spotlight. A hearing will unfold in Winston-Salem, N.C., Wednesday afternoon.

Passed last month, the map redraws the state’s First Congressional District, currently represented by North Carolina Democratic Rep. Don Davis, to be more conservative.

The district has elected a Black representative for more than 30 years, and the case focuses on how the new design decreases the Black voting-age population by 8 percentage points. The map is challenged by two groups.

The first comprises Black and Latino voters represented by Elias Law Group, a powerful Democratic election law firm led by Marc Elias. They argue North Carolina unconstitutionally used race and failed to account for population deviations since the five-year-old census data.

“The racial effects of the 2025 redraw cannot be explained by partisanship,” they wrote in court filings.

The second group comprises voters, the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and watchdog Common Cause. They argue the map violates the First Amendment because it frustrated the groups’ right to petition and was passed as retaliation for the groups’ existing challenge to North Carolina’s previous map.

“Redistricting does not occur in a First Amendment-free zone,” they wrote in court filings.

The hearing is before a three-judge panel all appointed by Republican presidents: U.S. Circuit Judge Allison Rushing and U.S. District Judge Richard Myers, both Trump appointees, and U.S District Judge Thomas Schroeder, an appointee of the second former President Bush.

As Democratic lawyers attempt to strike down North Carolina’s map for unconstitutionally diluting Black voting power, Republican lawyers will attempt to strike down California’s map for unconstitutionally boosting Hispanic voting power.

The Trump administration and the state GOP will attempt to topple the map championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that could provide Democrats with as many as five additional House seats.

“They’re trying to create seats based on race,” Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News’s Sean Hannity last week. “And they can’t do it, and we’re going to hold them accountable just like any other state.”

The panel overseeing the California case comprises U.S. Circuit Judge Kenneth Lee, a Trump appointee, U.S. District Judge Wesley Hsu, an appointee of former President Biden, and U.S. District Judge Josephine Staton, an appointee of former President Obama.

And just remember: We’re only about four years away from the next census, when the whole process will start anew.

IN FOCUS

Reagan judges emerge as Trump’s fiercest judicial critics

An unexpected class of jurists have emerged as the fiercest critics of President Trump’s assault on the legal system: appointees of former President Reagan.

Often the seniormost judges on their courts, Reagan judges have wielded their experience as a weapon in impassioned opinions striking down the president’s policies and in once rare public remarks.

One such jurist, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf, resigned from his senior position on the federal bench in Massachusetts earlier this month to dedicate his time to fighting back against the president.

He wrote in The Atlantic that his public service began in 1974, a “time of dishonor” for the Justice Department at the end of President Nixon’s term. But what Nixon once did “episodically and covertly,” Trump now does “routinely and overtly,” the former judge said.

“My reason is simple: I no longer can bear to be restrained by what judges can say publicly or do outside the courtroom,” Wolf wrote, calling Trump’s conduct “contrary to everything that I have stood for” in his time as a prosecutor and judge.

“The White House’s assault on the rule of law is so deeply disturbing to me that I feel compelled to speak out,” he added. “Silence, for me, is now intolerable.”

He’s not the only fed-up Reagan-appointed judge.

U.S. District Judge William Young made headlines in September with his blistering rebuke of Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activists, the effect of which is to “unconstitutionally chill freedom of speech.”

The judge quoted a portion of Reagan’s Inauguration speech in the ruling that says, “freedom is a fragile thing and it’s never more than one generation away from extinction.” He contended that Trump understands the importance of the message but draws from it a “darker, more cynical” meaning.

“I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,” Young wrote. “Is he correct?”

Similarly, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour wrote in a decision striking down Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order that, to Trump, “the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals.”

Coughenour took a rare step in July to speak out publicly alongside another judge overseeing Trump cases against threats they’ve faced as a result.

“It’s just been stunning to me how much damage has been done to the reputation of our judiciary because some political actors think that they can gain some advantage by attacking the independence of the judiciary and threatening the rule of law,” the judge said.

Their outspokenness has drawn some criticism.

Mike Davis, a Trump ally and head of the conservative Article III Project, wrote in a Fox News op-ed that Wolf, the judge who stepped down to speak out against Trump, is a “wolf in wolf’s clothing” — a callback to the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s famous dissent in a case about the separation of powers.

Davis claimed that Wolf is “no judicial conservative,” pointing to the Senate blue slips practice that lets home-state senators weigh in on a president’s nominations to district courts and U.S. attorneys’ offices. Both senators from Massachusetts at the time Wolf was appointed to the bench were Democrats, he said.

Rob Luther, a law professor at George Mason University, wrote in posts to X about Wolf that any federal judge who gives up “actual power” to join Trump’s crowd of critics “severely misunderstands power.” He joked that Wolf’s status as a retired Reagan-appointee with the backing of those Democratic senators is “likely at peak market value.”

“I hope more federal judges follow now-retired Judge Mark Wolf’s lead and take their anti-Trump activism off the bench so that (Trump) can replace them,” he said in another post.

“Step right up, please!”

A mystery in the Supreme Court’s passive voice

Did Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson continue her independent streak in the Supreme Court’s recent handling of the food stamp lapse during the government shutdown?

When the full court extended a pause on an order requiring the Trump administration to pay full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the government shutdown, Jackson publicly dissented.

That in itself made the junior liberal justice’s disagreement clear. But a language change elsewhere in the court’s order suggests the division may have gone deeper. We’ll add an underline to the important part:

“The application for stay presented to Justice Jackson is referred to the Court.”

It’s subtle, but that passive voice is highly unusual. It may give away the inner workings of the court’s deliberations.

To explain why, let’s walk through the emergency appeal process:

When someone files one at the Supreme Court (formally called an “application”), by default, it goes to the justice assigned to the area of the country where the case originated.

The divisions align with the boundaries of the federal circuit courts, so they are known as the “circuit justice.” Chief Justice John Roberts handles three circuits, Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh have two and the others each have one.

Read the full assignments here.

The circuit justice can act on an emergency appeal alone, and they often do for ministerial and low-profile ones. If they deny it, the applicant can then try another justice, and another one, until they fail with all nine. (In practice, the full court will vote to cut off anyone who tries to start going down the line.)

Or, the circuit justice can refer the appeal to the full court. That’s the general practice for any filed by the sitting presidential administration.

When the Trump administration filed its SNAP emergency appeal, the case came from Rhode Island. Jackson was the circuit justice.

At first, Jackson acted alone. She paused the order for a few days so a mid-level appeals panel could weigh in.

Just before Jackson’s pause was set to expire, a funding deal in Congress appeared in

sight. This time, the full court took a vote. It extended the SNAP pause a few more days — and over Jackson’s dissent.

That’s the order that included passive voice indicating the application “is referred to the Court.”

We checked, and in every other application brought by the second Trump administration, the order has read “by her referred to the court” (or “by him” when the circuit justice is male).

The dynamic did appear in one other recent high-profile case, though it wasn’t brought by the administration.

When the American Civil Liberties Union sought to block a round of imminent deportations under Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act this spring, the case arose from Texas and went to Alito. The full court voted to temporarily block the deportations over Alito’s dissent.

“There is before the Court an application,” the order began.

Jackson’s shift suggests the possibility that she wanted to act alone and did not agree to send it to the full court for a vote, only for her colleagues to overrule her.

Was it a meaningless edit, or does it reveal the internal deliberations? Neither the majority nor Jackson explained their reasoning.

‘Fake elector’ cases get new life

A few weeks ago, the 2020 election subversion cases were on their last legs.

We wrote in October that the state cases against Trump’s allies and the so-called “fake electors” had faced sharp blows, leaving prosecutors with big decisions about how — and whether — to proceed.

Well, now, we’ve got some answers.

By Friday, Georgia’s Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council (PAC) had to pick a new prosecutor to oversee the state’s case against Trump, his allies and the alternate electors or see it potentially dismissed, thanks to the disqualification of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D).

Pete Skandalakis, PAC’s executive director, announced that he himself would take on the prosecution after the search was fruitless.

“Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment,” he said in a statement.

So, the prosecution’s future is in Skandalakis’s hands, from picking up where Willis left off to dismissing the charges altogether.

It’s not the first time that’s been the case.

After Willis was disqualified from charging Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones (R) for headlining a fundraiser for his political rival, Skandalakis similarly appointed himself. He ultimately declined to bring charges.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee set a hearing for Dec. 1 to discuss next steps in the case, including whether Skandalakis intends to pursue a superseding indictment on the state’s behalf.

A day prior, Nevada’s top court revived the state’s criminal case against its six “fake electors” after a venue fight put the prosecution in purgatory for more than a year.

The original case was filed by Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford (D) in Clark County, a Democratic-leaning division that includes Las Vegas. However, a state judge dismissed it last year after finding that the charges should have been brought in Carson City, where the sham Electoral College votes were cast.

The Nevada Supreme Court reversed that decision and sided with Ford, ruling that Clark County is the proper venue because the fake electors’ alleged offenses were complete when the federal court there received the certificates, not when they were mailed.

A status conference is set for Dec. 10 before the state judge to discuss the top court’s order.

And soon, more pivotal decisions will be made.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) faces a Friday deadline to appeal to the state’s top court a ruling ordering her office to return its case against the state’s pro-Trump electors to a grand jury or see it dismissed, after a mid-level appeals court declined to weigh in.

Local outlets took comments Mayes made earlier this month, which referred to the case in past tense, to suggest she’s leaning toward letting the prosecution fizzle out.

“I certainly don’t want to give it up,” the Arizona attorney general told 12 News when reminded how she once fiercely defended the case. “It is certainly not something that I want to do.”

However, Mayes told a local radio station she would “caution folks against reading into my comments.”

Asked about her remarks and planned next steps, her office declined to comment.

5 top docket updates

Comey wins grand jury bid: A federal magistrate judge pointed to possible government misconduct as the reason he ordered the Justice Department to turn over grand jury materials to former FBI Director James Comey as he fights criminal charges. The district judge overseeing the case paused his directive until prosecutors have the chance to object, and those issues are weighed.

Meta antitrust: A federal judge ruled that Meta does not have an illegal monopoly over personal social networking, finding the tech giant competes in a wider social media market that includes the likes of TikTok and YouTube.

Trump appeals over Portland deployment: The Trump administration began an emergency appeal that seeks to halt an order permanently barring the president’s federalization and deployment of the National Guard to Portland.” Meanwhile, a ruling could come anytime from the Supreme Court over Trump’s Illinois deployment after the final briefs were filed Monday.

Purdue Pharma bankruptcy deal cleared: A federal bankruptcy judge said he would approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy plan it refashioned after it lost at the Supreme Court last year. The deal settles thousands of opioid lawsuits against the drugmaker and includes up to $7 billion in contributions from the wealthy Sackler family, who will relinquish control of the company but will not be completely immunized from lawsuits.

California climate laws blocked: An appeals court blocked California state laws that would soon require companies to disclose information about their emissions and climate risks. The Chamber of Commerce and industry groups had already gone to the Supreme Court and quickly withdrew their appeal with the justices.

In other news

Real hot girl suit: A trial began Monday in Megan Thee Stallion’s defamation suit against an online commentator she claims harassed her alongside fellow rapper Tory Lanez, who was convicted on gun charges after shooting her, reported independent legal journalist Meghann Cuniff – whose fans have dubbed her “Meghann Thee Reporter.”

Divas up: Former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) and Anna Sorokin, better known as fraudulent wealthy heiress Anna Delvey, posed at a Veteran’s Day event last week at a bar in D.C. Both onetime fabulists were formerly incarcerated but let out of prison early — Sorokin for good behavior, and Santos following a sentence commutation from Trump.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

IN: Asylum ‘metering’

The high court took up one new case at its recent conference, Noem v. Al Otro Lado. We previewed in last week’s edition.

The justices will decide the legality of a now-rescinded immigration policy called “metering.”

From 2016 to 2021 (started under Obama, used during Trump 1.0, rescinded by Biden), immigration officials managed an influx of migrants by turning people away without considering their asylum claims.

But federal law guarantees that a migrant who “arrives in the United States” may apply for asylum and must be inspected.

So, how did the policy work? Immigration officials turned the noncitizens away while they were still on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Justice Department argues an individual doesn’t “arrive” in the United States until actually crossing the border. It appealed to the justices after a legal challenge succeeded in a lower court.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer acknowledged the Supreme Court’s decision won’t have an immediate impact, but he cited a likelihood “metering” could return as an immigration policy in the future.

OUT: New Orleans prison

As the Supreme Court term kicked off, we previewed Hutson v. United States, an appeal of a court order requiring Louisiana and New Orleans to construct an 89-bed prison facility to improve inadequate housing for inmates with mental health needs.

In nearly two months since, the court kept punting whether it would take the case. On Monday, the suspense ended.

Only three justices voted to hear the New Orleans sheriff’s appeal, one short of what’s required.

Those three votes came from the court’s conservative wing: Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.

Alito called the court-ordered construction “illegal from the beginning.” Additionally, Alito wrote the lower court got “the inquiry backwards” when Louisiana years later sought to dissolve the order under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a 1995 law that curbs prisoner lawsuits.

“This case cried out for our review. By failing to intervene, we leave New Orleans to pay for the Fifth Circuit’s serious errors,” wrote Alito, joined by Thomas.

Gorsuch didn’t join the dissent and did not publicly explain his reasoning.

MAYBE: Water rights

The Supreme Court wants the Trump administration’s views on whether to take up Nebraska v. Colorado, a battle between the two states over water rights.

Nebraska officials accuse Colorado of unlawfully threatening Nebraska’s water supply along the South Platte River.

The Constitution and federal law give the Supreme Court “original jurisdiction” (meaning the power to decide a case first) over lawsuits between states.

These days, the high court maintains a policy that it has discretion to take up those cases. The Trump administration’s opinion on what to do is likely to carry serious weight in most justices’ consideration.

That is, except for two. Thomas and Alito believe the court is required to take up lawsuits between two states (see examples from 2025, 2021, 2020 and 2016). So regardless of how they feel about the water dispute, expect them to dissent again if their colleagues refuse the case.

PETITION PILE

Petitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.

The Supreme Court will consider roughly 180 petitions to take up cases at this week’s conference, the final one before Thanksgiving.

Let’s start with several petitions the court weighed last week that are “relisted” again this week. It is a potential signal the court will take up the case, or a justice is drafting a dissent and needs more time to finish it:

Eminent domain: In Hoffmann v. WBI Energy Transmission, a group of North Dakota ranch owners are seeking to collect nearly $400,000 in attorneys’ fees incurred during their legal fight with a natural gas company. The company used its eminent domain authority to take some of the ranch owners’ land for a pipeline. Everyone agrees the owners are entitled to compensation, but a lower court ruled that does not include legal fees.

Aquatherapy: In Doe v. Dynamic Physical Therapy, an anonymous man is seeking to revive his damages lawsuit against a Louisiana provider that during the pandemic allegedly refused his request for aquatic physical therapy because he is HIV positive. Under Louisiana law, claims against providers during a health emergency must clear a higher legal bar, so lower courts dismissed the man’s lawsuit. He says it improperly overrode his claims under federal disability laws.

Title IX: Crowther v. Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia raises whether school employees can sue under Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education. MaChelle Joseph, a longtime Georgia Tech women’s basketball head coach fired over emotional abuse accusations, and a fired Augusta University professor are seeking to revive their sex-discrimination lawsuits under Title IX. But a lower court ruled they instead must bring claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which more generally protects against employment discrimination.

Some notable first-time listings:

Trump’s bid to uphold his birthright citizenship restrictions, Cameroonian journalist Simon Ateba’s challenge to the Biden administration revoking his White House hard pass, Alliance Defending Freedom’s challenge to a school district’s policy that doesn’t inform parents’ when their child uses different pronouns at school, Alabama’s defense of its congressional map and whether private parties can enforce a key Voting Rights Act provision.

ON THE DOCKET

Don’t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here’s what we’re watching for now:

Today:

Former FBI Director James Comey’s motion to dismiss his charges for selective and vindictive prosecution is set to be argued before a federal judge in Alexandria, Va.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., is set to consider relief for a group of migrants deported to the El Salvadoran mega-prison CECOT under Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, in addition to next steps in his contempt inquiry. They migrants have since been moved to Venezuela.

Another D.C. judge is set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing in a challenge brought by four migrants who live in the nation’s capital and were arrested by immigration authorities without warrants.

A federal judge in California is set to hold a summary judgment hearing in a challenge brought by Stanford’s student newspaper and two anonymous students who allege the administration is unconstitutionally deporting students for their pro-Palestinian advocacy.

Federal judges in North Carolina are set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing over North Carolina’s new congressional map that could give Republicans an additional seat.

A federal judge in Chicago is set to hold a hearing about revealing a government informant in the case against Juan Espinoza Martinez, an alleged Latin Kings member accused of putting a bounty on the head of a top immigration enforcement official.

Thursday:

A federal judge in Maryland is set to hold an evidentiary hearing in the case of mistakenly deported man Kilmar Abrego Garcia as she weighs whether to dissolve a preliminary injunction that would allow the government to deport him again.

Anibal Hernandez Santana, a retired lobbyist accused of firing a gun into an ABC affiliate office in Sacramento, Calif., the day after activists protested the network’s removal of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing, is set to be arraigned on state charges.

Friday:

Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton is set to appear before a federal judge in Greenbelt, Md. for the first hearing since he entered his not guilty plea.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) faces a deadline to appeal to the state’s top court a ruling that ordered her to return her case against the state’s so-called “fake electors” to a grand jury or see it dismissed.

Monday:

The Supreme Court will announce orders.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal of a district judge’s finding that the administration may not exclude journalists based on their opinions, stemming from its efforts to block the Associated Press’s access over its decision not to abide by the president’s change of the Gulf of Mexico’s name to the “Gulf of America.”

In its defense of President Donald Trump’s executive order limiting access to birthright citizenship, the Justice Department claims that the government’s policy would bring the United States in line with the modern global trend. It is true that most countries do not grant citizenship at birth to people born within their borders with as few restrictions as the United States. But that isn’t new: The United States has been a global outlier since the 14th Amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution in 1868.

Understanding which countries grant citizenship primarily based on the location of birth, and which don’t, helps make sense of the 127-year-old approach that the Justice Department is asking the court to reconsider. This also reveals the troubling history of why certain countries have chosen not to recognize birthright citizenship in the first place.

***

Trump’s birthright citizenship order, which denies U.S. citizenship to some children born in the United States based on the citizenship or immigration status of their parents, has faced legal challenges since shortly after the president signed it in January. In June, the court weighed in on the administration’s side regarding a technical – albeit important – procedural issue, and over the past five months courts considering a new round of lawsuits have uniformly concluded that the executive order is likely illegal. In its petition asking the court to review decisions from two federal courts – the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire – the Justice Department argues that broad access to citizenship at birth “degrades” and “dilutes” U.S. citizenship. “Presumably for those reasons, hardly any developed country retains a theory of citizenship similar to the United States’ current approach,” the U.S Solicitor General, D. John Sauer, writes in the government’s petition.

The solicitor general’s claim isn’t so much incorrect as it is misleading. Sauer doesn’t cite any source or give any examples, so it is impossible to be sure which countries he considers “developed.” Germany, Japan, and most Nordic countries, for example, historically relied on biological relationships to determine citizenship. In practice, a citizen’s child would obtain citizenship at birth based on the parent-child relationship even if the child was born outside the country of citizenship. Called jus sanguinis – a Latin term meaning “right of blood” – what matters most under these citizenship practices, which remain common, is a child’s genetic inheritance. Current law in the United States features jus sanguinis options for some children born abroad to U.S. citizens.

By contrast, the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause, which ties citizenship to the place of birth, is an example of a jus soli citizenship law – a Latin phrase that means “right of the soil.” Since at least 1898, when the Supreme Court issued its decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, courts and executive branch agencies have interpreted the citizenship clause as granting U.S. citizenship to everyone born in the United States except for the children of foreign diplomats, invading military forces, and Native Americans.

Like in the United States, jus soli citizenship laws are common throughout the Western Hemisphere. Canada and Mexico both extend citizenship to children born within their borders. Alongside Argentina and Brazil, South America’s two largest economies, the five wealthiest countries in the Americas recognize a broad jus soli citizenship right. Except Mexico, each of these countries exempts children born to diplomats.

Despite being far from unusual in the Americas, jus soli citizenship originated in the United Kingdom. In 1608, Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke announced that Robert Calvin, who was born in Scotland, was a citizen of the king’s entire realm rather than simply of Scotland. “Whosoever is born within the King’s power or protection, is no alien; but Calvin was born under the King’s power and protection; ergo he is no alien,” Coke wrote in Calvin’s Case. Importantly, Coke qualified this broad recognition of citizenship through birthplace by excluding children born to invading enemies. A child born to someone who successfully attacks “any castle or fort” isn’t treated as a citizen “though he be born within his dominions, for that he was not born under the King’s ligeance or obedience,” Coke added.

The immediate impact of Coke’s decision in Calvin’s Case was that Robert Calvin could claim property in England on the same terms as any English male. Over the long run, the theory of citizenship based on the location of birth that Coke announced in 1608 also proved convenient to a country that would go on to spread its reach across the world. The U.K.’s broad jus soli policy ensured that its own emigrants could count on their children receiving U.K. citizenship no matter where in the kingdom they lived.

Nevertheless, almost 400 years after Calvin’s Case, the United Kingdom narrowed its citizenship law. As Sauer notes in his petition to the court, “[e]ven the United Kingdom, which pioneered near-automatic birthright citizenship, abandoned that approach in 1983.” By the last decades of the 20th century, the U.K. had stopped invading new territories, subduing their populations, and stretching its global reach through generation after generation of emigrants. Rather than send its own native-born residents abroad, residents of the remaining Commonwealth countries, as well as residents of the U.K.’s former colonies, began heading to the U.K. To limit who acquired citizenship, in 1981 Parliament enacted a law, the British Nationality Act of 1981, that tied a child’s citizenship to birth in the U.K. and the citizenship or immigration status of their parents. That law, which combines jus soli and jus sanguinis principles, went into effect on Jan. 1, 1983 and remains in effect today.

Indeed, the division between countries that rely primarily on jus soli citizenship and those that use jus sanguinis reflects their histories of colonization. Most countries that default to jus soli citizenship share a common history of European colonization, including displacement and near annihilation of native populations. The United States, like the rest of the Americas, fits this description. By contrast, few countries that prioritize jus sanguinis citizenship were colonized by European powers.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-19 13:58:51.801605

The Senate has now officially received the bill, passed in the House, which calls on the justice department to release the complete Epstein files. On Tuesday the upper chamber passed the legislation with unanimous consent – which means it now heads directly to Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.

As I noted in my last post, we’re not clear on when that will be, since his schedule hasn’t been updated.

Comey's lawyers argue that Trump's public comments prove case is a personal attack

Lawyers for James Comey are arguing that the case against the former FBI director is nothing more than a personal attack, born out of Donald Trump’s desire to prosecute his political adversary.

“This is an extraordinary case and it merits an extraordinary remedy,” Comey’s defense lawyer, Michael Dreeben, said today at a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Dreeben added that the president’s public comments about Comey are “effectively an admission that this is a political prosecution and not based on evidence”.

A reminder that Comey is charged with lying to Congress in 2020, and has pleaded not guilty.

On Monday, another federal judge found evidence of “government misconduct” in how Lindsey Halligan, the interim US attorney general for the eastern district of Virginia, secured criminal charges against the former FBI director, and ordered that grand jury materials be turned over to Comey’s defense team.

House set to repeal funding bill provision to allow senators to sue government over phone records

Later today, we’re expecting a vote in the House that would repeal a provision tucked into the stopgap spending bill passed last week (which ended the record-breaking government shutdown) that allows senators to sue the federal government because their phone records were subpoenaed in 2023 by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Most Republicans in the House have derided the measure, while the Senate majority leader, John Thune, remained convinced it was necessary. “The House is going to do what they’re going to do with it,” he said of the lower chamber lawmakers. “It doesn’t apply to them.” However, a number of GOP senators have indicated they’re happy to do away with the provision. This even includes some of the eight lawmakers whose phone data the FBI sought and obtained as part of Jack Smith’s investigation.

That vote is currently scheduled for 8:15pm ET.

One quick note, there haven’t been any changes to Donald Trump’s schedule today, per the press pool. Which means, as of now, the president doesn’t have any time allotted to sign the bill forcing the justice department to release the full batch of Jeffrey Epstein files.

We’ll keep you updated if things change throughout the day.

Exclusive: State department to cut 38 universities from research program over DEI policies

Joseph Gedeon

The state department is proposing to suspend 38 universities including Harvard and Yale from a federal research partnership program because they engage in diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices, according to an internal memo and spreadsheet obtained by the Guardian.

The memo, dated 17 November, recommends excluding institutions from the Diplomacy Lab – a program that pairs university researchers with state department policy offices – if they “openly engage in DEI hiring practices” or set DEI objectives for candidate pools.

Elite institutions including Stanford University, Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Duke University and the University of Southern California are among those marked for suspension, effective 1 January 2026. Other targeted schools include American University, George Washington University, Syracuse University and several University of California campuses.

An accompanying spreadsheet, reviewed by the Guardian, uses a color-coded system to evaluate 75 universities on a four-point scale, with institutions showing “clear DEI hiring policy” marked in red for suspension and those with “merit-based hiring with no evidence of DEI” marked in green to maintain partnerships.

The suspensions follow Trump’s near year-long campaign against DEI in higher education. In January, he declared diversity programs “illegal” and ordered agencies to force universities receiving federal grants to certify compliance or lose funding, with a 21 April deadline. In April, he moved to terminate accreditors that require DEI practices, threatening universities’ ability to access federal student aid.

Trump administration crafting plan with Russia to end war in Ukraine - report

The Trump administration is working with Russia to craft a plan to end the war in Ukraine, according to a report by Axios.

Citing unnamed US and Russian officials, a 28-point peace plan is inspired by Trump’s deal to end the war in Gaza. According to Axios’ sources, the plan’s 28 points fall into four general buckets: peace in Ukraine, security guarantees, security in Europe, and future U.S. relations with Russia and Ukraine.

Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is leading the drafting of the plan Trump’s envoy and has discussed it extensively with top Russian diplomat, Kirill Dmitriev. The aim, according to Dmitriev is to produce a written document along those lines before Trump and Putin next meet, according to Dmitriev.

According to Axios’ Barak Ravid, Witkoff also met with Ukraine’s national security adviser, Rustem Umerov, in a meeting earlier this week in Miami, Florida.

This comes as an overnight strike by Russia on western Ukraine killed 25 people and left 73 people injured, according to Ukrainian interior ministry

Larry Summers steps down from OpenAI board following release of Epstein emails - report

Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary and Harvard professor, told Axios on Wednesday that he was resigning from the OpenAI board following the publication of a series of email exchanges he had with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

His resignation comes one day after Charlie Stadtlander, the New York Times’ executive director for media relations and communications, said the publication was cutting ties with him amid new revelations about his relationship with Epstein from documents released by members of the House last week.

The documents revealed that Summers maintained a friendly relationship with Epstein long after the disgraced financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008, and continued to correspond with him until 5 July 2019, the day before Epstein was arrested on sex-trafficking charges.

“In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,” Summers said in a statement to Axios. “I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress.”

The Senate is expected to formally vote on Wednesday on a bill that would force the full release of the investigative files related to Epstein. Some of the documents that have already been released appear to suggest that Donald Trump “knew about the girls” procured for Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring and that he had once Trump “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house.

Former FBI director James Comey to appear in court

Former FBI director James Comey is set to return to court on Wednesday, where his lawyers will argue that Donald Trump unlawfully directed the Justice Department to prosecute as a form of malicious retribution.

Comey was charged with lying to Congress in 2020 just days after Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, with his attorneys arguing that the charges are an example of vindictive prosecution.

On Monday, Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick ruled that the justice department engaged in a “disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps” on its way to indicting Comey and directed prosecutors to produce to defense lawyers all grand jury materials from the case.

Mike Pence says 'I did my duty' in UK talk touching on January 6, tariffs and MBS visit

Former Vice President Mike Pence is speaking at Chatham House in London, reflecting on the US and its place in the world today.

He was diplomatic when discussing Donald Trump, saying he remained proud of the record of the Trump-Pence administration, though “it didn’t end the way I wanted it to” – Pence split from Trump when he refused to block certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 as rioters incited by Trump chanted “hang Mike Pence”.

“I will always believe, by god’s grace, that I did my duty that day in January 2021,” Pence said to loud applause.

However, Pence said he disagreed on Trump’s statements on Tuesday during a White House visit with Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump brushed off questions from a reporter about a US intelligence assessment that the prince had approved the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US green-card holder and Washington Post columnist, saying “things happen” and that bin Salman “knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that”.

“I would not have made that statement,” he said without much more detail, adding that the visit would have gone much differently had he been in the Oval Office.

Pence also distanced himself from Trump’s global tariffs, saying he believes that while tariffs “have a use as a means of facilitating negotiation…I believe in free trade with free nations.”

“The simple truth is at the American founding, taxes on tea were kind of an issue,” he said as the crowd laughed. “Those were tariffs. By the time they got around to that second draft of an American government in 1787 that we call the constitution of the United States, the one thing they wanted to make clear was that no one person could impose import tariffs and taxes on the American people, that it would be done by the elected representatives of the American people. I’m hopeful that our supreme court will draw the same conclusion.”

Democrats and Republicans celebrate passage of bill to release Epstein files

Hello and thank you for joining us on the US politics live blog. I’m Vivian Ho and I will be bringing you the latest news over the next few hours.

The Senate agreed on Tuesday by unanimous consent to approve legislation that would force the release of investigative files related to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The move came mere hours after a 427-1 vote in the US House to pass the bipartisan measure that Donald Trump had been fighting for months.

“Americans are done being lied to. These survivors deserve full transparency. Every document, every truth, every name,” Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump ally who split from the president over the Epstein files, posted on X on Tuesday.

The scandal over the Epstein files has dogged Trump since his return to the White House. For months, the president has dismissed the uproar over the government’s handling of the Epstein case as a “Democrat hoax”. Over the weekend, he relented and urged Republican lawmakers to vote for the measure that many of their constituents demanded they support.

“I don’t care when the Senate passes the House Bill, whether tonight, or at some other time in the near future, I just don’t want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the victories that we’ve had,” the president posted on Truth Social on Tuesday.

The Senate majority leader, John Thune, told CNN that the bipartisan bill will likely be sent to Trump’s desk for signing on Wednesday, after the House formally transmits the bill and the Senate officially approves it. Trump told reporters on Monday that he would sign the bill.

Congressman Ro Khanna, a Democrat who sponsored the bill alongside Republican congressman Thomas Massie, posted on X that Trump “should have the survivors who made this possible at the bill’s signing.”

“Against all odds, the survivors kept fighting,” Khanna said. “This victory is theirs.”

In other developments:

Backlash related to the Epstein files, some of which have already been made public by members of the House, has begun: the New York Times said it will be cutting ties with the former treasury secretary Larry Summers after documents revealed that Summers maintained a friendly relationship with Epstein long after the disgraced financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008.

Trump is set to speak at a US-Saudi forum focused on investment on Wednesday. After a White House visit on Tuesday from Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, Trump said that the US and Saudi Arabia have entered into a security agreement that would ease weapons transfers between the two countries and elevate Saudi Arabia to a “major non-Nato ally,” Politico reports.

This came after Trump brushed off questions from a reporter about a US intelligence assessment that the prince had approved the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US green-card holder and Washington Post columnist. Marty Baron, the former executive editor of the Washington Post, called Trump’s remarks “a disgrace”. “‘Things happen,’ he said. Actually, someone made them happen. And that was the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. He had Jamal Khashoggi assassinated, and then he and his government lied about what happened.”

Federal judges are set to hear arguments on Wednesday afternoon to determine a preliminary injunction request in two consolidated challenges to North Carolina’s congressional map, which was redrawn with the aim of adding more Republicans to Congress. On Tuesday, a panel of federal judges ruled that Texas cannot use 2025 congressional maps, which added five Republican districts, for the 2026 midterms and must use the 2021 boundaries. Judge Jeffrey Brown wrote: “Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.”

A new Marquette Law School survey finds more people are favoring Democrats than Republicans in the anticipated 2026 vote for Congress.

The Trump drag on the GOP A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular.
Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party.","Heading into the 2026 midterm elections, there are some very big warning signs for Republicans in the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.

The survey of 1,443 adults, conducted from Nov. 10-13, found:

Democrats holding their largest advantage, 14 points, since 2017 on the question of who respondents would vote for if the midterm elections were held today;

President Trump's approval rating is just 39%, his lowest since right after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol;

A combined 6-in-10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the government shutdown; and

Nearly 6-in-10 say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices — and no other issue comes close.

""I don't think rent prices or food prices are at the forefront like they should be,"" said Nicole Stokes of Dallas, Texas, who participated in NPR's poll and voted for Trump last year. ""You know — the American people — it's our pockets that are getting ripped apart to fund things.""

From the political parties and Congress to the Supreme Court and the media, other respondents said they had little to no confidence in these critical institutions.

""I feel lost,"" said poll respondent Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tenn., who calls himself a ""lapsed Democrat."" ""The parties don't speak to me anymore.""

He said he often feels unseen by the Democratic Party, but, given the alternative, he plans to keep supporting Democratic candidates — for now.

The disillusionment extends to how people see those in the opposite political party. Big majorities of Democrats and Republicans said the other party is ""dishonest"" and ""closed-minded"" about politics.

All of it makes for a volatile political stew heading into the holidays, but with Republicans in charge of all the levers of power in Washington, Democrats have the clear advantage a year out from next year's midterm elections.

Democrats in the driver's seat for control of Congress

Coming off huge wins up and down the ballot across the country in this year's off-year elections, Democrats lead Republicans, 55%-41%, when people were asked who they would vote for in their district if the election for Congress were held today.

It's the largest Democratic advantage on this question, known as the congressional ballot, in the Marist poll since November 2017. The parallel is striking, considering that was at the same point in Trump's first term as this poll now. Democrats wound up winning 40 House seats in 2018.

What's more, independents chose Democrats by a 33-point margin on this question. It's all quite the reversal of fortune from a year ago when, just before the 2024 elections when President Trump won back the White House, the parties were tied on the congressional ballot.

Historically, Democrats have needed a sizable advantage on the congressional ballot to signal that they would do well in upcoming midterms.

Consider:

In the fall of 2022, with Democratic President Biden in the White House, Democrats' lead ranged from 0 to 4 points. They lost nine House seats;

In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats' lead ranged between 6 and 12. They won 40 seats;

In 2014, when Democrat Barack Obama was president, Republicans had a 5-point advantage. The GOP gained 13 seats.

All that said, with redistricting, the number of competitive seats has shrunk significantly, so major gains are less likely than they were in previous years. Trump has also encouraged conservatives in red states to try and create more Republican districts in rare mid-decade redistricting.

Democrats have responded in kind, so the landscape for control of the House for next year remains uncertain at this point.

The Trump drag on the GOP

A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular. Not only is he at 39% approval, the lowest of this second term in the Marist poll, but he gets just a 24% rating with independents as well.

Overall, almost half of those surveyed — 48% — said they strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing. That's also the highest of this term and the highest since just after Jan. 6, 2021.

The president has seen low ratings for his handling of various policy areas, including the economy and foreign policy, and people think he's gone too far on immigration.

Trump has said on more than one occasion in this second term that while campaign advisers told him prices were the most important issue, he always felt it was really immigration. But respondents in the NPR survey are sending a clear message: they think the cost of living should be Trump's top priority.

Almost 6-in-10 — 57% — said lowering prices should be his top priority. Immigration is a distant second at 16%. Even a plurality of Republicans (40%) said lowering prices should be the priority compared to immigration (34%).

Despite Trump's slide in approval ratings, he's holding up well with his base — 9-in-10 Republicans continue to say they approve of the job he's doing.

Stokes, the Trump voter from Dallas, said a year into his presidency, said she's pleased by his attempts to tackle illegal border crossings and restrict U.S. foreign aid, but she is concerned that the president hasn't made the economy a focus.

But her support of Trump doesn't translate to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party.

""They're not in tune with anyone on the ground,"" Stokes said. ""I don't really see anyone in [the House] or in the Senate that's really for the American people right now.""

It's not just Trump. Democrats and others get low marks

Trump's approval is low and so is confidence in the office he holds — 61% said they have little to no confidence in the institution of the presidency.

But the scores were even poorer for other key institutions. Worst among them was Congress — 80% said they had little to no confidence in it, followed by the media (75%), the Democratic Party (71%), the Republican Party (65%) and the Supreme Court (62%).

This is yet another poll that shows Democrats have a problem with their base. While 80% of Republicans have ""quite a lot"" or a ""great deal"" of confidence in the GOP, just 57% of Democrats said the same of their party.

Despite long supporting liberal candidates, Dowdy, the Democrat from Memphis, argues the party has become disconnected from everyday voters.

""They don't interact with working people,"" he said, ""regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or building homes or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live... They have no connection to the real people. And there's no attempt to try and reach that.""

And yet, Democrats have a wide advantage on the congressional ballot, which, coupled with the electoral gains earlier this month, indicate that left-leaning voters may rally to Democrats' side when faced with having to choose between them and Republicans.

Democrats and Republicans see each other as ""dishonest"" and ""closed-minded""

It's no wonder political acrimony is as high as it is in the country; people have very little respect for where the other side is coming from.

The survey found that more than 8-in-10 Republicans and Democrats described people in the other political party as ""closed-minded""; more than 7-in-10 Republicans and roughly two-thirds of Democrats also see the other as ""dishonest"" when talking about politics.

Independents have better views of Democrats than Republicans. They said Republicans were more dishonest and closed-minded than Democrats with a majority of independents (54%) saying Republicans were ""mostly dishonest"" compared to more than 6-in-10 saying Democrats were ""mostly honest"" when it came to politics.

Nearly 7-in-10 independents also described Republicans as mostly closed-minded, while a majority (53%) said Democrats were mostly open-minded.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5616x3159+0+293/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9e%2F75%2F027c0c3046f9bd50f8d3ffc63f00%2Fgettyimages-2245835281.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:59:15.415056

In other cases, neither public records nor government information explained why they were considered threats to public safety.","CHICAGO — A federal judge has ordered over 400 people detained by immigration agents to be released by Friday as part of an ongoing lawsuit that accused agents of violating a consent decree governing warrantless immigration arrests.

The decision comes after the Department of Homeland Security released a list last week identifying 610 people still in custody after arrests by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June and Oct. 7.

The list was required by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who ordered the release of everyone on it on a $1,500 bond unless they were deemed a public safety risk by ICE or if they had a prior removal order.

Homeland Security attempted to block or delay the releases while the federal government appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Cummings denied the request, stating in his late Tuesday order that ICE didn’t show irreparable harm nor that it could win on appeal. The judge also wrote that the plaintiffs faced concrete harm if the releases were delayed.

The release will apply to 442 people detained by ICE between June and Oct. 7 who have not yet been deported and not deemed a public safety threat, according to court documents.

ICE identified 57 people who were deemed “high public safety risk” and are therefore to remain in detention, Cummings ruled.

The list provided by Homeland Security includes a Risk Classification Assessment for each person, which reviews a person’s criminal history, immigration record and community ties to recommend whether they should be detained or released while their case moves forward, according to a 2012 report from the department. But questions around how risk is calculated by the government remain, as the rubric has changed several times since its inception.

The system assigns separate ratings for public-safety risk and flight risk — each ranging from low to high — and then issues a final overall score, also from low to high. Department of Homeland Security officials did not answer questions about how these ratings are determined.

Of the 610 people on the list, ICE assigned final risk assessments as follows: 21 high, 58 medium/high, 39 medium/low and 488 low. Separately, ICE assigned the following public safety risk as follows: 42 high, 87 medium and 473 low.

Homeland Security initially identified 16 people on the list to remain in custody after receiving a “high public safety risk” designation from ICE. The list states those people were arrested for criminal charges ranging from driving under the influence to assault with a gun. But the government later deemed all but one of them to be low or medium threats to public safety.

On Friday, Homeland Security expanded its list to include 39 additional people it labeled as posing a high public safety risk, but it offered no explanation for those designations. In a response, attorneys for the National Immigrant Justice Center noted Saturday that ICE’s own risk assessment rated several of those people as low or medium-low risk overall and asked the judge to require the Department of Homeland Security to justify each of the added cases.

Attorneys for the National Immigrant Justice Center and ACLU of Illinois, who are plaintiffs in the case, have repeatedly criticized ICE’s risk rating system as unclear and inconsistent.

Researchers have also raised concerns. A 2022 study published in the Columbia Human Rights Law Review found that between 2012-2015, ICE changed how the tool scored people, including what counted as a higher-risk offense, which pushed more people into detention categories instead of release.

A 2020 study meanwhile found the tool routinely failed to follow its own risk logic. A review of three major risk-scoring revisions showed Homeland Security rewrote scoring rules so more people were labeled “medium” or “high” risk. The study also found the risk assessment hid key information from judges and misclassified some people, resulting in the detention of many medically vulnerable migrants.

Block Club was unable to verify most of the government’s allegations of criminal conduct through searching publicly available court records and arrest databases. Even when Block Club found criminal cases involving people flagged in the immigration data, the charges were often different from those listed by the government.

For example, an individual listed as a high “national security” risk was charged in February with causing a traffic crash and lacking a valid driver’s license. Another person accused by the government of assault with a gun was charged with a misdemeanor domestic violence offense after threatening to stab a man this year.

Block Club found records showing some of the people deemed high risk had been arrested on felony charges, including sexual abuse and home invasion. In other cases, neither public records nor government information explained why they were considered threats to public safety.

However, arrests highlighted by the government could have happened in other areas or might not be readily found by the public.

By Wednesday, Homeland Security is mandated to produce an expanded list of more than 3,000 people arrested and detained by Border Patrol in the Chicago area.

The judge said he would consider whether damages were necessary at a later date.
In a witness statement, Abu said he suffered “paranoia and flashbacks” in the separation system, and in segregation “[my] mental health has deteriorated to the point that I am experiencing constant thoughts of suicide and self-harm”.
Separation centres, which currently house 12 prisoners, according to the judgment, have come under increased scrutiny this year.","Shabana Mahmood and David Lammy have been found to have breached a prohibition on inhuman or degrading treatment with respect to a prisoner who spent months segregated from other inmates, in what is believed to be a legal first.

Sahayb Abu was confined to his cell at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, for 22 hours a day and prevented from associating with other prisoners for more than four months after Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, allegedly attacked prison officers at HMP Frankland.

Abu, a convicted terrorist serving a life sentence, was already being held in a separation centre for prisoners believed to be at risk or radicalising others, which has also been described as small group isolation, but was moved to even more restrictive conditions following the attack by Abedi in April.

In what is believed to the the first instance of ministers being found in breach of article 3 of the European convention on human rights, Mr Justice Sheldon found that Lammy, the justice secretary, and Mahmood, his predecessor, should have considered Abu’s existing mental health issues before he was moved.

In his written judgment, the judge said: “In the context of a prisoner who has a history of trauma and where there was a failure to obtain an assessment of his needs even though he was known to have mental health issues, and a failure to provide him with any therapeutic treatment to address his trauma, a contravention of article 3 is made out, notwithstanding the importance of the aim behind the segregation regime.

“The suffering that the claimant has experienced goes way beyond the inevitable element of suffering that is connected with segregation: an otherwise legitimate form of treatment. An individual who is segregated from others and deprived of the usual activities available to prisoners (education, work, communal prayer) will inevitably suffer isolation and an element of distress and anxiety. What the claimant experienced was much more severe than that: he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, brought on (at least in part) by the segregation.”

He said that his judgment did not mean that the same segregation regime would contravene article 3 in the case of a prisoner with an ordinary level of resilience, but the “claimant was not such a prisoner, given his history of trauma and associated mental health needs”.

The judge said he would consider whether damages were necessary at a later date.

In a witness statement, Abu said he suffered “paranoia and flashbacks” in the separation system, and in segregation “[my] mental health has deteriorated to the point that I am experiencing constant thoughts of suicide and self-harm”.

Separation centres, which currently house 12 prisoners, according to the judgment, have come under increased scrutiny this year.

In another judgment, handed down in January, the high court found that the decision to place Denny De Silva, who was serving a life sentence for a gangland murder, in a separation centre was unlawful as it had relied on allegations of radicalisation activities in prison by De Silva, without establishing whether or not they were true. In comments that were also referred to in the Abu case, Mrs Justice Hill said: “Research indicates that small group isolation regimes can produce serious and adverse psychological effects similar to solitary confinement.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8e2b45c6d8beb717aa8f9655cbac592d6749896/512_0_2560_2048/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b43a73608ff5348c2d5f8efb2edc5704",N,,2025-11-19 11:59:44.949990

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.","A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.

In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.

“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.

Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.

They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.

The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.

In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.

States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.

Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.

“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.

But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.

“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.

Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.

Knowing where a target will be

Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.

Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.

“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.

In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.

“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”

An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.

McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.

Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.

Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.

Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.

Trump administration court actions

But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.

The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.

U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.

“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.

The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.

In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.

Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses

Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.

Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.

“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.

Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”

Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.

“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.

Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.

“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.

“It is absolutely unacceptable that the Trump administration is dragging its feet on the awarding of these vital security grants,” said Congresswoman Pou. “As domestic extremism and terrorist threats to synagogues and other religious and community centers explode, Congress appropriated these grant funds to help support readiness. Americans have an unshakeable right to worship in peace and security. Congress deserves answers and our nation deserves action from this administration.”

In their letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the recently resigned former head of FEMA, Pou and her colleagues demand transparency and answers from the Trump government.

“We are alarmed that the administration has not awarded the $275 million that Congress made available for NSGP in fiscal year 2025 given the escalating threats that nonprofit organizations – including synagogues, churches, and mosques – continue to experience,” the Members wrote. “Further, FEMA continues to disregard the congressionally mandated outreach, engagement, and educational assistance to advise nonprofits on how to apply for NSGP.”

Members expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s refusal to share basic program information with Congress: “In further departure from precedent, the administration has yet to share with Congress which nonprofits received NSGP awards from the National Security Supplemental funding, despite awards having been made months ago and repeated bipartisan requests. Congress has invested historic levels in NSGP and the administration’s refusal to share information with Congress hurts the ability of Congress to properly assess resource needs.”

Congresswoman Pou is also the top Democrat on the House panel tasked with overseeing the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the 2028 Summer Olympics, and celebrations of America’s upcoming 250th birthday. Throughout 2025, she has helped lead efforts to ensure security for these events and that they receive full support from the federal government.

A copy of the letter signed by Congresswoman Pou and 33 House Democrats is available here. The text is below.

Dear Secretary Noem and Mr. Richardson:

We write to you out of shared concern about the status of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) awards.

FEMA was required by law to publish the FY 2025 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for NSGP by May 14, 2025, but chose not to comply. The administration finally released the FY 2025 NSGP NOFO on July 28, but it lacked basic information necessary to move the application process forward and to fruition, such as when FEMA planned to administer the application process, make award decisions, and release funding to nonprofit organizations. To date, FEMA still has not shared this information with States or nonprofit organizations, nor has FEMA indicated whether the period of performance for awarded projects has already begun. States have repeatedly asked FEMA for this information, and they have received no response. This has also created a chilling effect on faith-based and nonprofit organizations that are hesitant to participate in an opaque application process.

We understand that FEMA plans to continue to withhold the $275 million in FY 2025 NSGP funds and, prior to the government shutdown, awards for nonprofit organizations were scheduled to take several months. Further, FEMA continues to disregard the congressionally mandated outreach, engagement, and educational assistance to advise nonprofits on how to apply for NSGP. As of the date of this letter, FEMA has not held a single webinar to advise nonprofits on how to apply for these needed funds. Because of FEMA’s delays and lack of coordination and communication with States, many States have already opened and closed the application period for nonprofit organizations, meaning that any outreach from FEMA at this point would be too late. Other States have not opened the application process and have not communicated with faith-based and nonprofit stakeholders, leaving the process and the potential applicants in limbo.

In addition, FEMA’s FY 2025 NOFO introduced vague, new requirements and conditions that have created confusion among States and nonprofits, leaving applicants uncertain about whether their proposals would be qualified or disqualified for funding and what constituted compliance in order to receive payments from FEMA. For example, the NOFO includes language implying that eligibility for funding could depend on cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement efforts—a significant departure from past practice. FEMA also now requires States to collect and submit additional information about each nonprofit organization before awards can be made and each time nonprofits need to be reimbursed—steps that could significantly slow the process for both States and nonprofits and add undue administrative costs and burden. Such provisions have created concern that faith-based and community organizations might not be able to receive timely reimbursements from FEMA, if they receive any reimbursement at all, discouraging them further from applying for funds.

We are also deeply concerned by reports that DHS may be discriminating against Muslim organizations. In August 2025, DHS reportedly cancelled NSGP funding that had been awarded to over 40 Muslim organizations and banned their eligibility for future funding, citing “alleged affiliations with terrorist activities.” More recent reporting indicates that these cancellations may have been part of a broader attempt by DHS leadership to ban FEMA funding for all Muslim organizations. DHS has not presented evidence sufficient to justify disqualifying these organizations from receiving grant funding.

We are alarmed that the administration has not awarded the $275 million that Congress made available for NSGP in FY 2025 given the escalating threats that nonprofit organizations—including synagogues, churches, and mosques—continue to experience. This delay comes at a time when our Nation continues to see nonprofits targeted by bad actors, which the NOFO itself acknowledges. In August, a Minneapolis Catholic Church was the site of a mass shooting that left 2 children dead and injured 21 other people.6 In September, a man opened fire and set ablaze a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, killing 4 people and wounding 8.7 The U.S. has also seen a rise in violent antisemitic attacks, including the hostage taking incident at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas in 2022, and the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. earlier this year. Now is not the time for NSGP resources to be withheld from communities, nor the NOFO and grant guidance to continue to remain incomplete.

In further departure from precedent, the administration has yet to share with Congress which nonprofits received NSGP awards from the National Security Supplemental funding, despite awards having been made months ago and repeated bipartisan requests. Congress has invested historic levels in NSGP and the administration’s refusal to share information with Congress hurts the ability of Congress to properly assess resource needs.

Therefore, we urge DHS and FEMA to take the following actions:

Immediately clarify the timeline for the FY 2025 NSGP applications, address all other open issues or incomplete grant guidance to the State Administrative Agencies and nonprofit sub-applicants, and expedite application completion and awards to nonprofits.

Immediately remove the vague NOFO requirements that unduly burden States and nonprofit organizations and may ultimately prevent nonprofits from accessing funds.

Immediately provide Congress with the full list of nonprofits that received NSGP awards this year and continue to provide this information each time awards are made in the future.

Immediately begin outreach, engagement, and educational assistance to nonprofits to share essential information about the NSGP application process.

Immediately rescind any guidance or directives that have resulted, or could result, in violations of anti-discrimination laws within NSGP.

FEMA must take immediate steps to get the FY 2025 NSGP back on track so that FY 2026 can proceed without the present delays, inconsistencies and uncertainties, and lack of uniformity and predictability that have previously been the hallmarks and guardrails for a program serving several thousand faith-based and nonprofit applicants each grant cycle. The Administration’s own budget for FY 2026 endorsed continued NSGP funding, reflecting a shared commitment to keeping communities safe and ensuring funds reach those who need them most.

Sincerely,

In the space accorded for this blog post I will focus on Article 8 ECHR.
There is therefore already domestic law which establishes how Article 8 ECHR is to be balanced against the public interest.
In particular, we will need to look closely at precisely how the Government intends to define family life.
If family life is strictly limited to parents and children, as the Home Secretary suggests, then this would be in conflict with Article 8 ECHR.","Backlash against the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) is heavily driven by immigration and is often a direct reaction to it. This is not a new phenomenon, but the politics are escalating, both domestically and internationally. On the international plane nine states issued a joint letter earlier this year challenging the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) migration jurisprudence and it is reported that further discussions about potential reform of the ECHR are ongoing. On the domestic plane, both the Conservative Party and Reform have announced that if they win the next election they intend to tackle immigration by withdrawing from the ECHR. Against this political backdrop, the Labour Government has announced its proposals. In Restoring Order and Control: A statement on the government’s asylum and returns policy it proposes to reform the asylum system; limit the right to respect for private and family life in Article 8 ECHR in domestic law; reexamine the interpretation of ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’ for the purposes of Article 3 ECHR as part of international initiatives; and bring forward legislation on modern slavery. There is, and will be in the coming months, much to discuss, but what is clear is that change is afoot.

In the midst of this political maelstrom, it is imperative that debate and analysis is premised on a clear understanding of the legal issues. In an excellent report for the Bonavero Institute, Victoria Adelmant, Alice Donald and Basak Çali highlighted the problematic ways in which immigration law and human rights are presented in media coverage. Alan Greene has also recently suggested that the way in which politicians discuss human rights is a form of ‘kayfabe’, a staged performance which ‘allows politicians to ground reality in a fictional story of their own creation rather than objective truth’. He points to various statements by politicians about immigration as exemplary of this but concludes that ‘when stepping from the kayfabe to the real world, these arguments must come into contact with reality’ and that ‘it is here where the technocratic defences of human rights come into their own.’ This blog post might therefore be seen as part of that technocratic examination, or to quote Greene again, to be ‘bringing facts to a vibes fight’.

The Government’s proposals have grave implications for many aspects of immigration law, and I will explore some of these issues elsewhere; some insights into the constitutional implications can also be found in Mark Elliott’s blogpost. In the space accorded for this blog post I will focus on Article 8 ECHR. In particular, the Government’s proposal to limit the right by: (i) strengthening the public interest test; and (ii) defining ‘family’ for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR. I will argue (i) that domestic law already defines the public interest test, and it is difficult to see how this can be strengthened in ways that are compatible with the Convention; and (ii) that the Government’s definition of ‘family’ is neither necessary, nor will it inevitably lead to the desired result. In respect of Article 3 ECHR, readers would be well advised to read Natasa Mavronicola’s earlier analysis on the prospect of losing this right.

Strengthening the public interest test

The Government’s first proposal is to bring forth legislation setting out ‘to Home Office decision makers, and the courts, how to properly balance the public interest against’ Article 8 ECHR. One might legitimately ask, however, whether this is not already provided for in domestic law. Since 2012, Immigration Rules have set out how Article 8 ECHR should be balanced and these provisions were inserted into the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (NIIA) by s.19 of the Immigration Act 2014. There is therefore already domestic law which establishes how Article 8 ECHR is to be balanced against the public interest. In particular, s.117A NIAA provides that a court or tribunal must have regard to s.117B NIAA in all cases, which states, amongst other things, that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public interest. Section 117A also provides that a court or tribunal must have regard to s.117C NIAA in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals. Section 117C NIAA states that deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest unless one of three exceptions applies. Those exceptions require, in respect of sentences of less than four years, that there are either ‘very significant obstacles to integration’ or that the effect of deportation on a partner or child would be ‘unduly harsh’. Moreover, in cases where someone has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, only ‘very compelling circumstances over and above’ those other two exceptions will suffice. The severity of these thresholds has been addressed in the case law. See, for example, the observation in SSHD v Treebhawon and Others, at [37], that very significant obstacles to integration ‘is a self-evidently elevated threshold, such that mere hardship, mere difficulty, mere hurdles and mere upheaval or inconvenience, even where multiplied, will generally be insufficient in this context’. As well as the Supreme Court’s confirmation in HA (Iraq), at [41-45], that

‘unduly harsh’ does not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or merely difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold. ‘Harsh’ in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It is the antithesis of pleasant or comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the adverb ‘unduly’ raises an already elevated standard still higher.

These provisions (albeit in the form of Immigration Rules at the time) were accepted by the ECtHR in Unuane v United Kingdom as not in themselves incompatible with Article 8 ECHR on the basis that they do not preclude the domestic courts and tribunals from employing the criteria set out in the Convention case law for assessing whether an expulsion is necessary and proportionate. Importantly, however, in Unuane the ECtHR stated (at [79]), that

where the domestic courts do not carefully examine the facts, apply the relevant human rights standards consistently with the Convention and the Court’s case-law, and adequately balance the interests of the applicant against those of the general public, the Court remains empowered to give the final ruling on whether an expulsion measure is reconcilable with Article 8.

Consequently, it will be necessary to see whether the Government’s proposal for a ‘fundamental reset’ which ‘narrows the circumstances in which an individual’s Article 8 rights would outweigh the public interest in removing them’ is consistent with the human rights standards established in the ECtHR’s case law.

In contemplating what the Government’s proposals might look like it is helpful to recall that the Labour Government is not the first to suggest curtailing Article 8 ECHR. Indeed, this was a core part of the former Conservative Government’s proposals for repealing the HRA and replacing it with a Bill of Rights. Some insight into the issues that the Labour Government might now face may thus be found in responses to the former Conservative Government’s proposals. In 2021-2022 in my role as Director of the Centre for Public Law at the University of Cambridge, I and twenty-nine other members of our centre produced an extensive response to that consultation in which we observed, amongst other things, that it was unlikely that the proposals could require the courts to do anything other than what they were doing under the existing legal framework. We suggested that anything more restrictive was likely to lead to the ECtHR finding violations of Article 8 ECHR.

Defining family

The Government is also proposing to bring forth primary legislation stating that ‘[f]amily, for the purposes of Article 8, should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’. Some insight into what is driving this proposal might be found in Lord Wolfson’s legal advice for the leader of the Conservative Party, which was published by the Conservative Party as the Wolfson Report in September 2025. The advice in that report is structured around a series of tests promulgated by Kemi Badenoch in June 2025 as the means of deciding whether the UK should remain a signatory to the ECHR. The choice of tests, the framing of those tests, and the interpretation of the outcomes of those tests is, of course, political.

One of the five tests presented and used in the Wolfson Report is the ‘sovereign borders test’. In respect of which the Report states at [16-17] that the UK could, free from the purported constraints of the ECHR, ‘adopt more robust policies in this area and still maintain compliance with other international instruments to which the UK is signatory, principally the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture’ (emphasis added). The report cites Australia in support of this contention. Stevie Martin, Stephanie Palmer and I have written in our forthcoming editorial for the December 2025 issue of the European Human Rights Law Review that any suggestion that Australia’s immigration laws, policies and/or practices comply with international rights instruments including the Convention Against Torture is plainly incorrect. Consequently, it is troubling from a rule of law perspective to read statements such as the following, at [73], that: ‘where there is no body capable of providing a definitive conclusion on the interpretation of an instrument, the UK will be in a better position to argue that its actions and policies are compatible with the instrument in question, provided it has bona fide opinion as to the meaning of the instrument’. Particularly when observing that the Report immediately goes on to state that ‘[t]his in part explains how the Australian Government maintains that its border policy is compliant with international law: while it is signed up to the Refugee Convention, it is not a member of the ECHR. As a result, its position cannot be authoritatively second-guessed in any competent international court’ (emphasis added). These repeated references to ‘maintaining compliance’ as opposed to ‘being compliant’, as well as avoiding legal scrutiny, run the risk of venturing into the world of Humpty Dumpty- enabling states to maintain that words (laws) mean just what they say they mean. This was arguably the underlying ethos of the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024.

Returning, however, to the question of family life, the Wolfson Report states (at [45]) that ‘courts have given an extremely broad interpretation to the scope of the concept of “family life” to include relationships between siblings (including adult siblings); aunts or uncles and nephews or nieces; and grandparents and grandchildren.’ Yet any suggestion that the ECtHR accords a broad interpretation to family life in the immigration context is untenable. This is evident if one looks at the ECtHR’s case law and compares it with the three cases cited in the Wolfson report, namely Boughanemi v France; Boyle v United Kingdom; and Marckx v Belgium. None are recent cases and two of the three cases are not even immigration cases (Boyle was a child custody case, while Marckx was about state recognition of the relationship between a mother and her child). It is true that Boughanemi concerned deportation but the ECtHR has clarified in subsequent case law that adult children only have ties with their parents where there is the requisite level of dependency. In fact the ECtHR’s threshold for establishing family life beyond the core or nuclear family (spouses and children that have not yet come of age) is very high and is centred around the concept of dependency (a concept that does not feature in the Wolfson report).

This concept can, however, be seen in Kumari v. the Netherlands and Martinez Alvarado v. the Netherlands. Those judgments were handed down some nine months prior to the Wolfson report, but they were by no means the first occasion on which the Court has stated that: ‘there can be no family life between parents and their adult children or adult siblings unless they could demonstrate “additional elements of dependence, involving more than normal emotional ties”’. Moreover, the severity of the threshold for dependency was already evident in cases such as Savran v Denmark, where an applicant who was receiving treatment for paranoid schizophrenia could not rely upon his close ties with his mother and siblings in order to establish family life. It can also be seen in Senchishak v Finland, where family ties could not be established between an elderly mother who had suffered a stroke and her daughter who was her only surviving relative.

As for the interpretation given by our domestic courts, the single case cited by the Wolfson Report (at [45] fn.75) in support of the claim that a broad approach to family life operates is IA v SSHD, a case which concerned a family from Gaza that sought reunification with a family member in the UK. This case received considerable political attention after it was embroiled in a back-and-forth in Parliament between Kemi Badenoch and the Prime Minister. The application in IA was rejected by the Home Office, following which the First Tier Tribunal found that, although there was family life, this could not outweigh the weight to be attached to the public interest. This was subsequently overturned by the Upper Tribunal, which found flaws in the way in which the judge assessed the significance to be accorded to family life when carrying out the balancing exercise. Given Kemi Badenoch’s views on IA it is not surprising that it made its way into the Wolfson Report. What is surprising, however, is that the Wolfson Report did not mention that permission to appeal was granted by the Court of Appeal in May 2025, precisely in order to enable the court to consider whether family life could extend beyond the core family. The appeal was heard in the Court of Appeal in November and a judgment is pending.

This is the political backdrop to the Government’s proposal, and it will be interesting to see how it develops in the coming months. In particular, we will need to look closely at precisely how the Government intends to define family life. When the Home Secretary made her statement in Parliament announcing the policy she stated that the Government will define ‘what, exactly, a family is – narrowing it down to parents and their children’. This, however, is a narrower approach to family life than that stated in the policy document which provides that family life ‘should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’. If family life is strictly limited to parents and children, as the Home Secretary suggests, then this would be in conflict with Article 8 ECHR. If, however, the Government proceeds with the model set out in its policy document then this could align with what the ECtHR currently provides (namely, additional elements of dependence, involving more than normal emotional ties) in which case there is arguably no change at all other than putting this interpretation on a legislative footing. Alternatively, the Government’s notion of an ‘exceptionally close link’ could bring into play different values from ‘dependency’. I have written in my chapter on immigration in a book that I recently co-authored with Stevie Martin and Stephanie Palmer that the ECtHR’s approach suggests that family ties are ‘only established where there is extensive physical and financial dependency. Indicating that the ECtHR approaches dependency as if something akin to an infantile relationship within a stable family set-up is required.’ Dependency for the ECtHR thus suggests a hierarchical relationship based on vulnerability and need, whereas the Government’s concept of ‘exceptionally close link’ may place the emphasis on strong emotional ties without the need for dependency. In this respect the Government’s proposed definition could in fact encompass a different, and potentially broader category of persons than those recognised by the ECtHR. This is clearly not what is intended.

We thus await further details in respect of these proposals, draft legislation and a section 19 HRA statement in respect of such legislation. These proposals will be subject to immense scrutiny, and clarity will be demanded as to precisely how the proposed changes are going to operate in ways that ensure that domestic law remains, as this Government intends, compatible with the ECHR.

Scott Wiener, a Democrat and congressional hopeful, would enable people to file a lawsuit or seek redress against local, state and federal officers for violating their constitutional rights.
Currently, Cal State caps the base pay of its 22 campus presidents at a salary that’s no more than 10% above what their predecessors made.
But Cal State says the policy leads to uncompetitive compensation.

Erin Foote, a union board member for California State Employees Union: “I am mad.","A San Francisco state senator unveiled legislation Tuesday that aims to give Californians the right to seek damages from federal agents, as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement across the U.S.

The bill authored by Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat and congressional hopeful, would enable people to file a lawsuit or seek redress against local, state and federal officers for violating their constitutional rights.

Wiener, at a press conference: “This (federal) administration is attempting to wield unchecked power to illegally kidnap and deport people, to punish the administration’s political opponents using government resources, to freeze university funding and to fire thousands of federal workers en masse.”

The measure works to promote what’re known as Bivens lawsuits, a precedent established by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1971, which permits individuals to sue federal officers for violating their constitutional rights. But in the years since, the high court has curtailed Bivens actions, making it difficult for people to bring forth claims and recover damages.

In October ProPublica found that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained during immigration sweeps — some of whom were reportedly beaten and shot. Little recourse is available for victims, though in a rare case, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department arrested a federal immigration enforcement officer last week after he held a teenage boy at gunpoint and detained him.

Wiener’s proposal comes a day after the Trump administration filed a lawsuit to block a new California law written by Wiener that bans law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing face coverings.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned other agencies that criminals have posed as immigration agents to carry out crimes, but the U.S. Department of Justice said California’s law threatens the safety of federal officers.

The California State University’s board of trustees plans to vote today on whether to change the university system’s executive pay structure in a way that would boost their wages — a potential overhaul that has drawn blowback from Cal State’s unionized staff and faculty, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.

Currently, Cal State caps the base pay of its 22 campus presidents at a salary that’s no more than 10% above what their predecessors made. Raises for sitting presidents are also no higher than 10%. The average base pay for presidents ranges from $370,000 to more than $500,000.

But Cal State says the policy leads to uncompetitive compensation. Trustees are deciding on a plan that would raise the executive base pay (along with overall wage increases for other Cal State workers), and add a 15% incentive-based pay bump that executives would be eligible for.

The proposal comes during a time when Cal State is facing limited budgets, layoffs and program cuts.

Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist and former hedge fund manager, said today that he is running to be California’s next governor, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.

Steyer kicked off his campaign with a video where he pledges to preserve the state as a place for business and innovation, while also lowering California’s cost of living by making corporations pay “their fair share.”

Steyer: “The Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living. Californians deserve a life they can afford.”

The mega-donor for California Democrats spent more than $12.8 million in support of Proposition 50, making him the second-largest independent ad buyer in state history. As an outspoken critic of Trump, Steyer poured millions in a national ad campaign that advocated for the president’s impeachment during his first term. Steyer also ran for president in 2020 before ultimately dropping out of the race.

Federal authorities are denying more of certain work visas and green cards, vetting professionals’ social media platforms, and applying enhanced scrutiny to foreign employees’ credentials and work plans in the United States, according to interviews with 15 immigration attorneys, a federal official and three policy analysts. Visa holders also have been subject to more searches, interrogations and denials of entry at airports and border crossings, as well as deportation proceedings and visits to their employers by federal agents, the attorneys and experts said.

The administration this year rolled out a travel ban on 19 countries, a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, and mandatory in-person interviews for most business and temporary work visa applicants at U.S. consulates in their home countries - a policy change that lawyers say could lead to longer wait times.

Officials also announced a “continuous vetting” policy aimed at all 55 million U.S. visa holders.

For foreign professionals, the crackdown has meant new levels of anguish and fear - indefinite separation from partners and children living in the United States, termination of employment offers, lost income and dashed opportunities.

“My patients are also suffering, and I’m suffering,” said Mustafa Alawad, a 27-year-old Sudanese doctor in Cairo, who was denied a visa after receiving a job offer from an internal medicine residency program at a community hospital in Huntsville, Alabama. The Trump administration denied him a visa because of a ban on visitors from Sudan. So Alawad has been unable to join his fiancée, a dentist, who is already in the United States.

Apple, Accenture, Lyft, Snapchat, Advanced Micro Devices, Pinterest, Silicon Laboratories, Rambus and Datadog have all warned for the first time in recent weeks that the new immigration and visa policies imperil their corporate performance, a review of earnings calls and quarterly reports by The Washington Post found. None of the companies responded to requests for comment.

“Laws and regulations, including immigration,” could “materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain a highly skilled, global workforce,” Apple told investors on Oct. 31. Hospitality and biotechnology firms issued similar alerts.

The State Department has not released data on visa issuances since May, and the latest data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which tracks visa applications and denials, is from June. The available data does not show any notable shift in the number of work visa applications and denials compared with last year, but attorneys say some of the crackdown began more recently.

Major groups representing U.S. employers, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Society for Human Resource Management, declined to comment or did not respond to questions. But the chamber sued the Trump administration last month over its $100,000 H-1B visa fee, in its first lawsuit against this administration.

“This stringent enforcement and stringent examination of what has always been perfectly legal visa categories is new,” said Jeff Joseph, president of American Immigration Lawyers Association. “But companies are too afraid to go out there and say, ‘Look what’s happening.’ … Companies are relying on litigation from the chamber and trade orgs to avoid retaliation.”

Kimberley Best Robidoux, a lawyer at WR Immigration in San Diego, said that after President Donald Trump took office this year, there was an uptick in deportation proceedings against foreign professionals on work visas during what had typically been a 60-day grace period for those switching employers or changing their immigration status.

“We have definitely seen the administration turn the benefits-based visa programs into enforcement tools,” Robidoux said. “This administration is using all the tools in their toolbox in a way where previously the prior administrations may have been using more discretion.”

The administration says these changes are intentional.

“Since day one, President Trump has been clear that he will put Americans first by tightening our immigration laws to ensure that our workers are not displaced, companies are not offshoring labor, and our national security is not compromised,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to The Post. “The heightened scrutiny in the visa approval process is an administration-wide effort to implement President Trump’s America First agenda, a mandate from nearly 80 million Americans who were tired of being sidelined by the Democrats.”

The State Department is applying more scrutiny across the board rather than cracking down on specific work visa types and regions, a senior department official told The Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity to brief the media. The official said the administration is taking security and public safety seriously, including looking at things like drunken driving and assault charges. Authorities are using social media vetting and other tools in new ways to catch these issues, the official said.

“We don’t see scrutiny as a bad word. … Compared to previous administrations, we do have more scrutiny. National security is more of a priority than ever,” the official said.

The State Department is also scouring for visa fraud because some companies or individuals have applied for business visas, known as B-1s, instead of H-1Bs, even when that was not appropriate. Business visas are unlimited, while H-1Bs are capped.

Despite the new scrutiny, the official told The Post, interview wait times were down in many nations and 80 percent of countries had wait times of 60 days or less for a visa appointment.

Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement to The Post that the agency conducts deportation proceedings and unannounced worksite visits “to restore integrity and ensure the security of our nation’s immigration system.” It added: “The agency is committed to using its [Notices to Appear] authorities against removable aliens and denying or revoking H-1B petitions of those who refuse to comply with site visits.”

Immigration lawyers said professional visa categories appear to be receiving more scrutiny and denials than others, including temporary nonimmigrant visas for high-skilled professionals, such as H-1Bs, J-1s, L-1s and O-1s. The latter is nicknamed the “genius visa” and is designated for individuals of “extraordinary ability” in the sciences, arts, athletics, business and other areas.

The crackdown - heightened denials and enhanced vetting and questioning - has also hit employment-based green cards, including EB-1s, a category for foreigners with extraordinary abilities, three lawyers told The Post, affecting top scientists and engineers working in artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, payment systems, defense and cybersecurity.

“We’re seeing cases denied for people who build the systems our economy runs on,” said Sameer Khedekar, an immigration lawyer in Silicon Valley. “These are the people who are building the products that hundreds of millions of users use.”

Immigration officials denied one top software engineer at Capital One an EB-1 visa in August, according to a copy of his lawsuit against the government, which was reviewed by The Post. The engineer, an Indian national, had lived in the United States for years, performing “a critical role” in “the development and implementation of cutting-edge AI-driven financial technologies,” the suit said. He had also written articles for scientific journals, peer-reviewed research and judged prestigious contests in his field. Capital One declined to comment.

Applicants from countries identified by the State Department as national security threats, including China, Iran and Venezuela, also are seeing heightened vetting, lawyers said.

For companies, the scrutiny has resulted in delays in project development and hiring, and increased costs associated with managing visa uncertainties, said Alexander Jovy, a lawyer at Global Immigration Partners, who specializes in business visas. Some firms have shifted their hiring plans as a result. Meanwhile, foreign professionals working in the United States have expressed reluctance to travel internationally because of fears about being barred from reentry into the country.

“The United States is the market where people want to start businesses and want to be innovative and be pushing the envelope,” said Cecilia Esterline, immigration analyst at the Niskanen Center, a moderate think tank in Washington. “And if we lose the people who are able to do that, I think we risk our stature internationally, our competitiveness.”

Jeremy Beck, co-president of NumbersUSA, a group that lobbies for restricting immigration, supports the Trump administration’s narrowing of legal immigration programs, especially amid a souring economy and mounting layoffs.

“The case for large-scale guest worker programs, temporary work visas and permanent work visas is as weak now as it’s been since at least the Great Recession,” Beck said. “They are restoring credibility to the system, increasing the public’s trust that the system is working as it should. Those are good things. But it’s not clear that it’s going to radically change the numbers.”

Still, the administration has sent mixed messages. Last week Trump partially defended the H-1B program in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, saying, “You also do have to bring in talent.”

“You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory, we’re going to make missiles,’” Trump said. “It doesn’t work that way.”

Sharadha Kodem, an immigration lawyer in Irving, Texas, who files work visa petitions mostly for Indian and Southeast Asian nationals, said three of her clients on valid H-1B visas were denied entry by U.S. customs agents after they had been temporarily working remotely in their home country to deal with a family or medical emergency. They have been unable to return to the United States, where they have spouses and children and own homes.

“This didn’t happen under Biden,” Kodem said. “We came out of the first term of the Trump administration going through hell and beyond for our clients. Then it was much more relaxed during the Biden administration, and now the crackdown has started again.”

The resolution follows weeks of residents voicing concerns about police actions and involvement with federal immigration enforcement activities.

“This isn't the finish line. This is the starting line,” Mayor Jim Schwantz assured the crowd in the council chambers. “We're going to continue to build on this going forward.”

In addition to the resolution, Village Manager Reid Ottesen announced several steps the village is taking to rebuild trust with its immigrant community.

He said officers will now ask federal agents for identification and verification of which agency they represent.

The village also launched a bilingual webpage (English and Spanish) with information about immigration rights, resources and frequently asked questions.

Deputy Police Chief David Brandwein will lead efforts to meet with community members to explore ways the village can nurture its relationship with the entire community.

Council Member Joe Falkenberg addressed perceptions of inaction by the council by saying he has reached out to residents who spoke up at recent meetings.

Schwantz said some will think the resolution doesn’t go far enough, while others will think it goes too far.

That was reflected in the public comment at Monday’s meeting.

Palatine area resident Valeria Delgado, a daughter of immigrants, a graduate of Fremd High School and Harper College with a master’s degree from Loyola University, illustrated the climate of fear generated by the presence of federal agents.

She said one father of three, whose 3-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with autism, now shops for groceries only after 11 p.m.

She also mentioned the plight of a woman whose daughter is completing her confirmation at a local Catholic church. She said they have had to miss Mass due to reports of federal agents in the area.

“Their human right to go to church has been currently violated,” she said. “Just let that sink in a little bit.”

Palatine resident Laura Hernandez called the resolution a good first step but said she wants to see more engagement with the Hispanic community.

“Passing a resolution is just a paper,” she said. “We need more doing and less talking.”

But Palatine resident Frank Skorski argued that illegal means illegal.

“For some reason, the federal government and the state of Illinois has decided that people who come here illegally deserve certain rights. I disagree.

Impact of fee increases New fees for asylum applications or increases to already established fees have become a fixture of immigrant policy in Trump’s second term.
Citizenship and Immigration Service reported it had 1,446,908 pending affirmative asylum applications at the end of 2024.","When President Donald Trump signed “The Big Beautiful Bill” into law in July, the massive legislation included an overhaul of several immigration-related fees for applications and forms commonly used to seek asylum, appeal court decisions and apply for work permits.

The fee increases and the establishment of new ones are part of the Trump administration’s sweeping changes to the immigration system.

The cost of appealing an immigration judge decision rose from $110 to $900, while the fee for people seeking temporary protected status jumped from $50 to $500.

To some Indiana immigration attorneys, the immigration-related fee increases or new fees came with seemingly no warning and appeared to be more of a deterrent to immigration than a way to cover agency costs.

John Broyles, a partner with Indianapolis-based Broyles & Ricafort, PC, said he had several questions and concerns regarding the fee increases.

“What was wrong with the original fees? Were they not covering the costs?” Broyles said.

Broyles said there was no analysis provided or any explanation he had seen as to why there needed to be fee increases, something he believes is being done to disincentivize people from applying for asylum or filing other immigration-related applications.

Some fees are five times higher than before, he noted.

Sarah Burrow, director at Lewis & Kappes, called the fee increases “devastating” and “terrible,” with an impact felt by the most vulnerable population.

Burrow said her firm has clients in court that have been in federal custody and not able to work, with their families hit with as much as $1,500 in additional fees.

For someone filing an asylum application fee, the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill changed the application from being free to carrying a $100 cost.

“$100 is a lot of money, especially for someone who may be a new arrival,” Burrow said, adding, “there is nothing beautiful about what this administration is doing in the context of immigration, not a single thing.”

In late October, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued an order in Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, et al. temporarily staying the annual asylum fee, according to the USCIS.

Impact of fee increases

New fees for asylum applications or increases to already established fees have become a fixture of immigrant policy in Trump’s second term.

Trump’s Sept. 19 proclamation included imposing a $100,000 annual fee on new H-1B visas and rolled out a $1 million “gold card” visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.

Like the asylum fee, the H-1B visa fee drew its own legal challenge.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration, alleging that Trump’s new $100,000 visa fees for the H-1B program, widely used by Silicon Valley, violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for D.C..

About 85,000 new H-1B visas have been available each year, although Congress exempts universities from that cap, with the government receiving about 425,000 H-1B visa petitions in 2024.

By comparison, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service reported it had 1,446,908 pending affirmative asylum applications at the end of 2024.

Burrow said the rise in asylum application fees are most often mentioned by clients.

She said she didn’t think anyone could have anticipated such large fee increases or the imposition of fees for applications that previously had no cost attached.

The Lewis & Kappes attorney also noted that USCIS announced it was phasing out check and money order payments.

USCIS announced in August it would accept only ACH debit transactions or credit card payments after Oct. 28.

“We have a responsibility to the American people to operate as efficiently and securely as possible,” said USCIS Spokesman Matthew Tragesser in a news release. “Over 90% of our payments come from checks and money orders, causing processing delays and increasing the risk of fraud and lost payments. America deserves better, and we intend to deliver.”

Broyles said he had a client in a non-lawful permanent resident cancellation case who paid a $130 filling fee prior to the Big Beautiful Bill’s passage.

He said if the client, who won her case, filed the case today, she would have to pay $1,630.

“I’m not sure my client could afford that,” Broyles said.

Broyles stressed that he has been practicing for 27 years and has seen periodic fee adjustments, but not something as dramatic as fee disparities with the aforementioned case.

“They’re a lot. It’s all just the overall plan of this administration to discourage people at any means to remain here,” Broyles said.•",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/immigration-law.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:59:21.954016

In her morning news conference on Tuesday, Sheinbaum was asked about Trump’s statements a day prior, when he expressed displeasure with Mexico and mused about taking forceful action.

“It’s not going to happen,” Sheinbaum replied in Spanish.

She proceeded to explain that she had made her position clear “many times” in telephone conversations with Trump and his secretary of state, Marco Rubio.

“He has suggested on several occasions or has said, ‘We offer you a United States military intervention in Mexico or whatever you need to combat criminal groups,'” she explained.

While she said she would accept collaboration and intelligence-sharing with the US military, she repeated her stance that no outside intervention would be allowed on Mexican soil.

“We do not accept an intervention by any foreign government,” Sheinbaum continued. “I’ve told him on the phone. I’ve said it with the State Department, with Marco Rubio.”

A response to Trump

Her comments come on the heels of an Oval Office meeting between Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Monday. The Republican president used the public appearance to address his expanding military campaign against drug cartels and criminal networks in Latin America.

When a reporter asked if he was considering “potentially launching strikes in Mexico”, Trump answered in the affirmative.

“To stop drugs? It’s OK with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs,” Trump said. “I looked at Mexico City over the weekend. This is some big problems over there.”

He then made a reference to the US bombing campaign that began on September 2.

At least 21 deadly missile strikes have been conducted against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing 83 people.

United Nations officials and other legal experts have denounced the military campaign as an illegal form of extrajudicial killing.

Trump, however, suggested the campaign could eventually include strikes on land-based targets in Mexico.

“ If we had to, would we do there what we’ve done to the waterways? You know, there’s almost no drugs coming into our waterways any more,” Trump continued.

“ Would I do that on the land corridors? I would absolutely. Look, every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives, not to mention the destruction of families.”

While Trump has repeatedly used that number — 25,000 — to justify the boat bombing campaign, there is no factual basis for that figure.

Provisional data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that fatal drug overdoses have declined in recent years, with 73,960 deaths recorded during the 12-month period ending in April.

The Trump administration has also provided no definitive evidence to prove who was on board the bombed vessels, nor that they were linked to drug trafficking.

The identities of the victims remain largely unknown, though families in countries like Venezuela, Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago have asserted that their loved ones disappeared after the attacks. Some have claimed their relatives were only fishermen.

Two survivors were repatriated in October, one to Colombia and another to Ecuador, the latter of which released the man without charging him with a crime.

Trump has long threatened to broaden his bombing campaign to include land-based targets. But he declined to say whether he would ask permission before striking Mexico, should he choose to do so.

“ I wouldn’t answer that question,” he told a reporter in the Oval Office on Monday. “I’ve been speaking to Mexico. They know how I stand.”

He later added, “ Let me just put it this way. I am not happy with Mexico.”

Framing cartels as ‘enemy combatants’

Since taking office for a second term, Trump has claimed extraordinary powers to justify his increasingly aggressive actions against drug cartels, going so far as to claim the US is in a state of war with traffickers.

Only Congress can formally declare war in the US. But in August, Trump reportedly signed a secret order allowing the military to take action against the cartels, leading to renewed fears in Mexico.

Sheinbaum, at the time, told her constituents there would be “no invasion”.

Then, on October 2, Trump issued a memo to Congress asserting that Latin American cartels were “enemy combatants” in a “non-international armed conflict”, laying out his administration’s legal argument for the ongoing attacks in the Caribbean and Pacific.

Trump has also categorised various drug cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations” throughout his second term, though that designation alone does not justify military action under international and domestic law.

In Monday’s Oval Office remarks, Trump reiterated his position that he viewed the US as being in an armed conflict.

“ We know the addresses of every drug lord. We know their address. We know their front door. We know everything about every one of them. They’re killing our people. That’s like a war,” Trump said.

The US has a long and controversial history of military intervention in Latin America, and in recent years, there has been renewed interest on the US right to send armed forces into Mexico.

In 2023, for example, then-presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, a prominent Republican leader, said he would deploy US special forces across the border to Mexico to fight drug-trafficking cartels.

“And I will do it on day one,” DeSantis told Fox News at the time, musing on his plans for the presidency.

Fears that Trump could spearhead such an action stretch back to his first term, from 2017 to 2021, when he first considered using the “foreign terrorist organisation” designation.

Then-Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Sheinbaum’s predecessor, likewise had to quell concerns that Trump would pursue foreign intervention as a result.

On Tuesday, Sheinbaum echoed Lopez Obrador and denied that any US intervention was on the table.

“There is collaboration, and there is coordination,” Sheinbaum replied. “But there is no subordination, nor can we allow an intervention.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-10T152700Z_217724980_UP1ELBA16WY23_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-WORLDCUP-MEXICO-1763481290.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-19 11:59:25.457892

In November, DHS fast-tracked new policy giving federal officers greater authority to arrest protesters both on and off federal property.","PORTLAND, Ore. — Clouds of smoke. Tear gas. Pepper spray. For months, federal officers have used less-than-lethal weapons and tactics against protesters outside the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, facility in Portland.

Demonstrators accuse the officers of using excessive force and instigating confrontation. The federal government says it’s simply protecting its property.

But a closer look reveals something deeper — a little-known federal agency with broad authority and a system that allows the Department of Homeland Security to pull in elite, specially trained tactical teams to help police protesters.

At the center of the response is the Federal Protective Service, or FPS. The agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for guarding federal buildings and ensuring the safety of employees and visitors.

In Portland, that means protecting the ICE facility. The government-leased building in the South Waterfront neighborhood has been the focal point of anti-ICE protests since early June.

Normally, there are four FPS inspectors, along with an undisclosed number of private security officers assigned to the Portland ICE office, according to the agency’s deputy regional director.

But over the past few months, the number of federal officers protecting the ICE building has surged to as many as 197 officers in a single 24-hour period, according to court records.

And the officers protecting the ICE building aren’t all FPS employees. Many came from other parts of DHS through what’s known as cross-designation. The mechanism allows FPS to bring in officers from other DHS agencies including Customs and Border Protection, Bureau of Prisons, and the Secret Service.

Video evidence indicates specially trained units such as U.S. Border Patrol BORTAC and a special response team from ICE have been on the ground in Portland.

Critics explain that many of these specially trained officers, who normally rely on military tactics, aren’t used to facing off with protesters.

“It actually creates a lot of danger and conflict, and that results in the various sorts of civil rights abuses and aggressive policing that we're seeing,” said Spencer Reynolds, formerly senior counsel in the Liberty and National Security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law and a former DHS intelligence attorney.

“These agents are not trained for crowd control,” Reynolds said. “They’re trained to go and do remote interdictions and the like.”

To better understand the crowd dynamics and interaction between protesters and federal officers, KGW reviewed dozens of video clips and social media posts. We spoke with eyewitnesses, listened to trial testimony and got a guided tour of the ICE facility — although access was limited.

Many nights outside the ICE facility in Portland follow a familiar pattern. Officers emerge from the front gate, then push out in a U shape or wedge formation, clearing the way for vehicles to enter or exit the ICE building.

Although protesters are sometimes antagonistic, video appears to show officers, at times, responding with disproportionate force.

On October 2, Leilani Payne stood in front of officers on the street after they cleared the exit, allowing a car to leave the property. She complied.

But after the 19-year-old allegedly shouted insults and swore at the officers, one of them blasted her with chemical spray in the face. Payne said she had trouble breathing and suffered burning in her eyes, ears and throat.

In some instances, federal officers appeared to attack when there was no apparent threat.

Videos show protesters who crossed the blue line marked “US Government, Do Not Block” being tackled by a team of officers.

On August 13, protester Daryn Herzberg was standing outside the driveway, when a federal officer tackled him from behind. His body slammed into the pavement from the unexpected shove. Smoke was deployed. Herzberg said he was taken into custody and cited for failure to comply.

In 2023, DHS updated to its use-of-force policy. It allows officers to use force “only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative” exists, and they can only use a level of force that is objectively reasonable.

On several nights, the policy appeared to be tested.

Officers blanketed the street with smoke and tear gas, used flash-bangs, pepper balls and other less-than-lethal munitions. Their actions often seemed to make the situation worse instead of calming it down.

On October 18, a large crowd of peaceful protesters gathered outside the ICE facility following a ""No Kings"" rally. KGW zoomed in and slowed down the video.

It showed a federal officer who fired a less-than-lethal round into the ground, ricocheting toward the ICE building. That triggered federal officers to deploy tear gas on the crowd. The intent of tear gas is dispersal, but misuse or abuse can cause injuries or inflame tensions even more.

KGW sent the Department of Homeland Security videos of the incidents described in this story. In response, a spokesperson issued a written statement.

“ICE and CBP are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” the statement said. “Our officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training.”

As of mid-November, court records indicate federal prosecutors have charged 36 people with crimes related to the ICE facility in Portland since June. Some of those cases involved assaults on federal officers, arson and property damage.

Federal law gives U.S. Homeland Security broad authority to protect federal buildings, with no clear limit on how far off-site officers can operate.

On Sept. 30, video showed a team of 20 federal officers spread out on the street away from the building’s entrance. One protester was arrested, then dragged back toward the building. Later, that same video showed another large group of federal officers walking toward the ICE building. They too had made an arrest.

The video went on to show federal officers returning to the street and marching more than a block from the ICE building and out of camera view.

At the same time, Homeland Security has used helicopters and drones to circle overhead, frustrating neighbors and inflaming tensions.

The conflict over immigration policy and attempts by President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops helped mobilize a new strategy among protesters: inflatable costumes. But even those in costume have faced off with federal officers.

On Oct. 2, Seth Todd said he was peacefully protesting in a frog suit when an officer aimed chemical spray directly at his costume’s air vent.

Protesters and local officials accuse the federal government of abusing its authority.

On October 6, Portland city attorney Robert Taylor wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice. “In Portland, we appear to be witnessing the federal government engaging in unconstitutional uses of force in violation of the Fourth Amendment against otherwise peaceful demonstrators exercising their First Amendment rights,” Taylor wrote.

Similar complaints were made during the 2020 racial justice protests in Portland, which centered around the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse.

A government audit by the DHS inspector general found that many of those federal officers deployed to Portland in 2020 were not sufficiently trained or prepared for the operation. Many of the same border and security forces have returned to Portland — this time to protect the ICE building.

“We can tell by the activities that are happening today that really not a lot has changed,” said Reynolds.

In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision.","The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services wants to expand a Biden-era policy known as public charge that could further curtail immigrants' use of public benefits.

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.

Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.

""Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,"" the proposal states.

Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.

""This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,"" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. ""By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.""

Politics of social safety net programs

The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.

People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.

Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.

U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.

Executive order targeted benefits

In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""

Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.

Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.

Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a ""public charge"" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.

In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision. It meant that using benefits such as the SNAP, housing aid or transportation vouchers would not count against green card applicants.

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.","A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.

In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.

“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.

Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.

They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.

The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.

In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.

States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.

Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.

“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.

But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.

“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.

Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.

Knowing where a target will be

Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.

Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.

“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.

In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.

“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”

An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.

Trump’s National Guard deployments raise worries about state sovereignty

McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.

Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.

Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.

Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.

Trump administration court actions

But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.

The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.

U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.

“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.

The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE arrests fell in August despite show of force in DC, Los Angeles

The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.

In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.

Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses

Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.

Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.

“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.

Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”

Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.

“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.

Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.

“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ice-courthouses1763546780.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=zzbtpd_2,N,,2025-11-19 14:58:11.380741

It's unclear whether the person responsible for the stickers could be charged under a new state law making it a felony to threaten law enforcement.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison Police are investigating stickers that appeared on campus encouraging violence against federal immigration agents.

Republicans are pointing to the imagery as another example of the hostile climate conservatives face on college campuses.

UW-Madison is removing the stickers and condemns violence of any kind, university spokesperson John Lucas said. He said he was aware of two or three stickers being removed.

One of the stickers showed a man wearing a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shirt and face mask, with red streaks that appear to be blood near his head. ""The only good fascist is a dead one,"" the text read.

Freshman William Hong spotted a sticker on a lamp post outside Memorial Library on Nov. 13. He said he was disgusted because he believed ICE in most cases is just trying to keep America safe. He ripped the sticker off but chalked it up as protected speech.

Hong is a board member of the UW-Madison chapter of Turning Point USA, the conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September. He said the campus climate since then has been mixed, with some progressive students celebrating Kirk's death in chalk messages left around campus and others who were more respectful. He said most instructors have created an unwelcome environment in his classes, but many students are open to civil conversations.

Howard Schweber, a UW-Madison professor who is an expert in free speech, said the stickers were unlikely to be constitutionally protected expression. The question of criminal charges would hinge on whether the person putting up the stickers either intended for the work to be perceived as a threat or acted recklessly by taking the chance that it would be perceived that way.

""Ask yourself whether it is likely that an ICE agent seeing this sticker would feel threatened,"" he said. ""If that is likely, then it is not hard to say that the person putting up the sticker was at least reckless about the possibility that a threat would be perceived.""

Schweber said the state would have a strong case for a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge. He was less sure about a new law adopted in February making it a felony to threaten judges or law enforcement officers because it seemed to need to be directed at a specific individual or group.

""That might be a question Wisconsin courts have to figure out,"" he said.

There’s a chance the stickers could reach a criminal level if they cause extensive damage to property, UW-Madison Police spokesperson Marc Lovicott said, but the incidents reported so far appear to be misdemeanor vandalism cases.

The imagery was first reported by the Madison Federalist, a new student newspaper.

Both Republicans running for governor condemned the sticker on X, formerly Twitter. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany said UW-Madison ""cannot keep quiet and pretend it's normal"" Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann said he wasn't surprised by the rhetoric and said it degraded the state flagship's reputation.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lodged an arrest detainer for Jimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez, a twice deported criminal illegal alien from Honduras and repeat sex offender, convicted of indecent exposure in 2018 and now facing charges of cruelty toward a child and lewd or lascivious acts with a minor.

Jimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez

Local investigators caught Velasquez Gomez on a Medford, New York TJ Maxx surveillance camera system, groping multiple young girls between the ages of 7 and 11, and touching his genitals in the store over the course of several months. During the three separate recorded incidents, child victims were allegedly touched and squeezed on their buttocks by the pedophile when they stepped a short way from their parents while in the store.

The 7-year-old victim asked permission to look around the toy aisle to which her mother agreed. As she stood in the aisle, Jimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez walked toward her and allegedly touched and squeezed her buttocks with his hand.

The 11-year-old victim was with her parents in the store and walked a short distance away to look for a gift for a friend. She observed a man holding his genitals through his clothes. A short time later, the illegal alien allegedly walked toward her and grabbed her buttocks with his hand as he passed.

The 9-year-old victim was shopping with her mother and asked permission to look around the toy aisle while her mother was at the end of that same aisle looking at clothes. Jimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez allegedly approached the child, pulling up the bottom of her sweatshirt, and squeezing her buttocks.

“The accounts of these child victims are sickening-- this serial child molester stole the innocence of his child victims and terrorized families,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This is exactly who we mean when we say we’re targeting the WORST OF THE WORST criminal illegal aliens terrorizing our communities. President Trump’s administration removed this pedophile in 2019. Following his illegal reentry into the country and recent arrest for sex crimes against children, ICE lodged an arrest detainer with local authorities to ensure he is never released onto American streets to prey on more innocent children. Secretary Noem will not allow pedophiles to victimize innocent children.”

Velasquez Gomez was initially encountered by U.S. Border Patrol in April of 2005 near Cotulla, Texas, and was removed from the United States on May 12, 2005. He committed a felony by illegally reentering the U.S. and was removed by the Trump administration in 2019. He has since committed another felony by illegally re-entering the U.S. for a third time at an unknown time and location.

But for both of these U.S. citizens, the trauma lingers.","SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

As President Trump expands his aggressive immigration crackdown to more cities across the country, dozens if not hundreds of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents had been detained or arrested and sometimes held for days. NPR's Adrian Florido recently spoke with two of them about their experience.

ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: It's been five months since Javier Ramirez, a U.S. citizen, was tackled and arrested by immigration agents, but he still wakes up in the middle of the night gasping for breath, pumping his fists into the air as if he's fighting off an attacker.

JAVIER RAMIREZ: Panic attacks. I still feel that fear, you know, that it might happen again just for looking Mexican or, you know, Latino. They could again come up to me and just start questioning me.

FLORIDO: On June 12, masked Border Patrol agents out patrolling for immigrants to arrest walked into the auto junkyard east of Los Angeles where Ramirez was working. He saw them from the other side of the junkyard and walked through rows of broken cars to get to them.

RAMIREZ: I actually didn't see the guns or anything like that until literally I was literally close to them. That's when I'm like, oh, OK. Wow, people with guns? That means no, you know? Don't get close. You know, raise your hands.

FLORIDO: A security camera captured what Ramirez says is an agent telling him, in vulgar Spanish, don't be an idiot. Do you all have papers?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).

FLORIDO: Then he alleges he heard one of the agents say to another one...

RAMIREZ: I just hear him, like, hey, just get him. He's Mexican. And that's when they threw me down to the ground.

FLORIDO: Ramirez struggled and pleaded to be let go. The agents moved him and other workers out to the sidewalk as a crowd gathered. His brother heard the commotion from his own tow truck yard down the street and came over and started to film.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: He's a USA citizen, my man.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah, he's a U.S. citizen.

RAMIREZ: We're all U.S. citizens.

FLORIDO: The agents loaded Ramirez into a van. He recalls how he managed to use his cellphone to call local police despite being handcuffed.

RAMIREZ: I'm calling 911. Hey, what's your emergency? Like, hey, I'm being kidnapped. I'm in a black van.

FLORIDO: He says the dispatcher told him police had already been called about this but couldn't help because these were federal agents.

RAMIREZ: I'm like, if they are, I'm a U.S. citizen. Why would they take a U.S. citizen?

FLORIDO: Ramirez was held in a downtown LA prison for more than four days. He was charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer. But the charge was later dropped. Ramirez believes agents fabricated it to cover up for racially profiling him.

RAMIREZ: They pretty much seem like - you know what? - he's a U.S. citizen. We messed up. So in order for them to not look bad, they amended these accusations.

FLORIDO: Ramirez's lawyer is Michael Carrillo. He's also representing 10 other U.S. citizens or green card holders who've been arrested or detained by immigration agents. They're each seeking a million dollars in damages from the federal government.

MICHAEL CARRILLO: What's happening is that the Latino community - especially those with darker skin like myself, maybe that speak Spanish, listen to Spanish music - we are being racially profiled. What we've seen in these cases is that they stop, they detain people, sometimes arrest them, detain them for days and then ask questions later. That's not right.

FLORIDO: In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said allegations that its agents racially profile are, quote, ""disgusting, reckless and categorically false."" The department does not release data on how many U.S. citizens it has detained or arrested. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem recently denied that any have been rounded up.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KRISTI NOEM: There's no American citizens have been arrested or detained. We focus on those that are here illegally. And anything that you would hear or report that would be different than that is simply not true and false reporting.

CARRILLO: Totally false. It's just wrong. If she were to call my office and talk to these 10, 11 citizens that we represent, they would say, hey, I've been detained. I've been arrested. I've been thrown in custody for five days. So, to me, it was an outrage to hear that.

FLORIDO: Last month, reporting by ProPublica found at least 170 U.S. citizens who'd been detained or arrested, though it was likely an undercount. Since then, there's been reports of others. Many have been let go within minutes or hours. Others have been arrested and held for days. Lawsuits alleging racial profiling and rights violations are piling up. Carrillo says he's outraged by the racism he says he sees - ICE and Border Patrol agents raiding places like car washes and Home Depots because they assume they'll find immigrants working there, using the fact that someone speaks Spanish to justify their suspicion that someone is here illegally.

CARRILLO: It's just like Andrea. They detained her and immediately started speaking Spanish to her.

FLORIDO: He's talking about Andrea Velez. In late June, her mother dropped her off at her job at a shoe company in downtown Los Angeles, just as immigration agents were raiding street vendors nearby. She looked up and saw a masked agent wearing a Hawaiian shirt running toward her as he chased someone.

ANDREA VELEZ: And that's when he grabbed me and he slammed me to the sidewalk. I just remember the impact of how hard it was because it took me a while to get up.

FLORIDO: The agent arrested her. As he restrained her, she says a bystander began recording.

VELEZ: He was filming, and he says, I'm going live. So that's when I proceeded to say my name and that I was a U.S. citizen. And then I even said my mother's name because I knew that maybe she was wondering - I was probably not going to come home that night.

FLORIDO: The agent who arrested her, and another one, drove Velez to the same downtown prison that Javier Ramirez had been taken to.

VELEZ: Once we got into the parking structure, they started talking to me in Spanish like they had not heard me before speak English. And I was like, I speak English, too.

FLORIDO: Velez was charged with assault on a federal officer and held for two days. Like Ramirez, the charge against her was eventually dropped. But for both of these U.S. citizens, the trauma lingers.

VELEZ: I still have a little bit of trouble just going outside by myself. Like, they could come, like, at any moment and just attack you again. And just trying to cope with, like, the anger of why? Why did it happen? Because it's not supposed to happen here.

FLORIDO: She started seeing a therapist to cope. Javier Ramirez did, too. He says his family's humor is also helping.

RAMIREZ: I have one of my cousins right now, and he's like, every time, hey, I brought you your soda just how you like it, without ice. So, you know, it's (laughter) - now they...

FLORIDO: But Ramirez is angry. He says his rights were violated.

RAMIREZ: ...You know, as U.S. citizens. And that's what actually makes me mad, you know, 'cause what's the whole point of the Constitution if they're not gonna go by it?

FLORIDO: He knows it'll be hard to hold federal agents accountable through claims for damages or lawsuits, but he says he has to try. Adrian Florido, NPR News, Los Angeles.

ICE leads interior investigations and removals; Border Patrol stops illegal entry.

Border Patrol sits inside CBP; ICE operates as a separate DHS agency nationwide.

Both agencies can detain and arrest; uniforms can appear similar.

Immigration operations are on their fourth day in Charlotte, with more than 100 arrests reported so far, and they’re expected in Raleigh on Tuesday, Nov. 18.

While current activities have been attributed to both U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) interchangeably, the two agencies differ in a few key ways.

However, both are federal immigration-enforcement agencies under the Department of Homeland Security, they both have the authority to detain and arrest people for immigration violations and they wear similar uniforms, which can make it difficult for the public to distinguish between them.

But how are they different? Here’s what you need to know.

Are Border Patrol and ICE in Charlotte, Raleigh?

Yes, though ICE agents have been in Charlotte since earlier this year, The Charlotte Observer reported.

However, only Border Patrol has been linked to current immigration crackdown efforts in Charlotte. Border Patrol is also expected in Raleigh this week.

How is ICE different from Border Patrol?

There are three main ways ICE and Border Patrol differ:

Mission: ICE’s mission centers on criminal investigations, immigration enforcement and removal operations inside the U.S. rather than just at the border, according to the agency’s website. U.S. Border Patrol is specifically tasked with preventing illegal entry between ports of entry, intercepting people crossing the border and stopping smuggling of contraband.

Structure: Border Patrol is a subset of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which handles both customs and immigration at the border. ICE, on the other hand, is its own agency under the Department of Homeland Security.

Enforcement: Border Patrol agents are mainly involved in apprehending people as they attempt to cross the border or at checkpoints, whereas ICE’s role is more investigative and long-term, according to the Migration Policy Institute. They probe for document fraud, conduct I-9 audits of workplaces, detain people in interior facilities and carry out removals.

How is Border Patrol in NC if it’s not near a border?

Although North Carolina isn’t near an international border, customs and Border Patrol agents are still legally authorized to operate well inside the U.S., the Observer previously reported.

“Their ability to operate nationwide ensures border patrol can enforce immigration laws, combat smuggling and address national security threats anywhere in the United States,” Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman told the New York Times. “And that immigration enforcement is not limited to border regions when individuals who evade detection at the border can still be apprehended.”

They are scheduled to return toward the end of the month, with the full sweep beginning in early December.","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown dubbed “Swamp Sweep” that aims to arrest roughly 5,000 people across southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

The deployment, which is expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1, marks the latest escalation in a series of rapid-fire immigration crackdowns unfolding nationwide — from Chicago to Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina — as the Trump administration moves aggressively to fulfill the president’s campaign promise of mass deportations.

In Louisiana, the operation is unfolding on the home turf of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, a close Trump ally who has moved to align state policy with the White House’s enforcement agenda. But, as seen in other blue cities situated in Republican-led states, increased federal enforcement presence could set up a collision with officials in liberal New Orleans who have long resisted federal sweeps.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to run the Louisiana sweep, has become the administration’s go-to architect for large-scale immigration crackdowns — and a magnet for criticism over the tactics used in them. His selection to oversee “Swamp Sweep” signals that the administration views Louisiana as a major enforcement priority for the Trump administration.

The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the operation. “For the safety and security of law enforcement we’re not going to telegraph potential operations,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.

In Chicago, Bovino drew a rare public rebuke from a federal judge who said he misled the court about the threats posed by protesters and deployed tear gas and pepper balls without justification during a chaotic confrontation downtown. His teams also oversaw aggressive arrest operations in Los Angeles and more recently in Charlotte, where Border Patrol officials have touted dozens of arrests across North Carolina this week after a surging immigration crackdown that has included federal agents scouring churches, grocery stores and apartment complexes.

Planning documents reviewed by the AP show Border Patrol teams preparing to fan out across neighborhoods and commercial hubs throughout southeast Louisiana, stretching from New Orleans through Jefferson, St. Bernard and St. Tammany parishes and as far north as Baton Rouge, with additional activity planned in southeastern Mississippi.

Agents are expected to arrive in New Orleans on Friday to begin staging equipment and vehicles before the Thanksgiving holiday, according to the people familiar with the operation. They are scheduled to return toward the end of the month, with the full sweep beginning in early December. The people familiar with the matter could not publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

To support an operation of that scale, federal officials are securing a network of staging sites: A portion of the FBI’s New Orleans field office has been designated as a command post, while a naval base five miles south of the city will store vehicles, equipment and thousands of pounds of “less lethal” munitions like tear gas and pepper balls, the people said. Homeland Security has also asked to use the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans for up to 90 days beginning this weekend, according to documents reviewed by the AP.

Once “Swamp Sweep” begins, Louisiana will become a major testing ground for the administration’s expanding deportation strategy, and a focal point in the widening rift between federal authorities intent on carrying out large-scale arrests and city officials who have long resisted them.

“The amici” are united by a shared goal which is to promote the welfare and safety of children and youth affected by immigration detention.
They include Children’s Defense Fund, the Kairos Center for Religion, Rights, and Social Justice, EdTrust–New York, the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, and Children’s Rights.
Children’s Defense Fund-New York Director Khin Mai Aung said, “Immigration detention is no place for children and youth.","Five leading child advocacy organizations have filed an amicus brief in federal court supporting a Bronx teen from Ecuador who is currently being held by the United States Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). His case was heard at a White Plains federal court on Monday, Nov. 17. We’ve reached out to the advocates for an update on the latest court proceedings and will share any updates we receive.

Established as a part of the Refugee Act of 1980, ORR initially supported refugees, asylees, unaccompanied refugee minors, and Cuban and Haitian entrants. However, over time, as designated by Congress, ORR’s mission grew to serve many different populations from around the world.

In 2003, Congress expanded ORR’s role to serve unaccompanied alien children. Through the Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau, ORR provides for the care and custody of unaccompanied alien children who enter the United States from other countries without an adult guardian. ORR is legally required to provide for their care until they are placed with a vetted sponsor, usually a parent or relative, while their immigration cases proceed.

ORR also offers longer-term resettlement benefits and services to support arrivals’ successful transition to life in the U.S.

An amicus brief is a legal document submitted by a third party who is not involved in a lawsuit but has a strong interest in the case’s outcome. These “friend of the court” briefs typically provide additional legal arguments, and technical information or perspectives to help the court make a decision on a matter before it.

On October 23, according to advocates for the student, immigration officers detained the 16-year-old during a scheduled immigration check-in at 26 Federal Plaza, which he attended with his lawyer. They said he had been living in the Bronx with extended family following his mother’s decision to self-deport earlier this year.

The New York public high school student, an 11th grade English language learner, had previously been granted “Special Immigrant Juvenile” status by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in April, which provides a path to permanent residency.

EJCC v. Joyce, submitted by Children’s Defense Fund, the Kairos Center for Religion, Rights, and Social Justice, EdTrust–New York, the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, and Children’s Rights, urges the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to grant the teen’s request for release from an ORR congregate care facility in The Bronx without restrictions on his liberty.

Attorneys Katherine Rosenfeld and Nick Bourland of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel LLP filed the brief on behalf of the five organizations (“the amici”).

“The amici” are united by a shared goal which is to promote the welfare and safety of children and youth affected by immigration detention. Their work focuses on protecting minors from the serious harms of detention and safeguarding their educational rights. They include Children’s Defense Fund, the Kairos Center for Religion, Rights, and Social Justice, EdTrust–New York, the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, and Children’s Rights.

The amicus brief and the teen’s attorneys, The Door’s Legal Services Center and the New York Civil Liberties Union, argue that the student’s unnecessary detention threatens to harm his mental health and education.

They said the teen is currently enrolled in classes at ReStart Academy, an alternative education program that partners with ORR. According to the academy’s website, it serves “the most vulnerable students” that “have become disengaged from school.” However, before his detention, they said the teen was performing at grade level, actively participating in school, and on track to graduate on time.

The organizations that filed the brief argue that, given his strong academic record, placing him in an alternative education program is inappropriate for his learning needs. “When children and young people are detained, including in ORR congregate facilities, and separated from their communities and schools, empirical research shows that such detention is deeply traumatizing and has long-term negative impacts on brain development and on that child’s trajectory through life,” the brief reads.

The five organizations share a common goal of promoting the welfare and safety of children affected by immigration detention say they bring decades of experience advocating for youth in these settings, and added that the purpose of the brief is to provide the court with accurate information about the harms suffered by detained children, including those held in ORR facilities.

They said that in a March letter to the Trump administration, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other national medical organizations concluded that “even short periods of detention can cause psychological trauma and long-term mental health risks” for children.

Children’s Defense Fund-New York Director Khin Mai Aung said, “Immigration detention is no place for children and youth. EJCC’s detention is especially harmful, as he is missing out on a critical part of junior year despite performing at grade level, and should be at home attending his community high school.”

Meanwhile, Children’s Rights Deputy Litigation Director Leecia Welch, said, “Children torn from their parents and communities and confined in isolating, dehumanizing facilities endure unspeakable trauma. The confinement of EJCC, who has a loving home waiting for him, is particularly cruel and must come to an end. Every minute children spend in these institutions is a minute too long, stealing vital time from their lives and futures.”

As Northwest Bronx Indivisible and some independent supporters recently participated in the “No Kings” Day rally in Midtown Manhattan on Oct. 18, in part protest at the handling of immigration policy by the Trump administration.

Daniel Guenzburger, one of the members spoke to Norwood News about the group’s opposition to deporting immigrants without due process and their active support for another young Bronx detained local student and immigrant, Dylan, a Marble Hill high school student at ELLIS Preparatory Academy who was taken into custody by law enforcement in May and held, as reported, despite public outcry.

Another female member of the group had also talked about the importance of solidarity with Dylan, saying, “Dylan, himself, continues to sit in that GO center in Moshannon in Pennsylvania. He’s in detention, dispirited, and I know that we are giving him heart with the kind of thing we’re doing for him today.” For more on Dylan’s situation, click here, here and here.

Some protestors at the No Kings Day rally in Manhattan alleged the Trump administration quota for immigrants was getting smaller, compounding the difficulty for those applying for a visa.

See attached graph further below of immigration numbers under different administrations since 1850. It had been widely reported at one point that more deportations took place under the Obama administration than under the first Trump administration though this may change by the end of the second Trump administration. Click here for some further analysis of the topic.

As reported, the president, by way of another executive order, recently cracked down on future H1B visa applications, visas typically obtained by “alien nonimmigrant workers” sponsored by an employer in a niche industry sector like, for example, healthcare.

U.S. Customs and Border Control agents have been deployed in Wake and Durham counties.

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell confirmed multiple sightings of immigration enforcement agents in Raleigh and Durham at a city council meeting Tuesday afternoon.

Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam posted a video on social media that showed a confrontation with Border Patrol agents who were taking people into custody at a shopping center on Avondale Drive in Durham.

"" What I saw was painful and infuriating,"" Allam said at a press conference later that evening. ""Customs and Border Patrol agents were heavily armed, masks covering their faces, kidnapping three men right here in Durham, refusing to show a warrant, refusing to explain anything. They acted like they were in a war zone — not in a neighborhood where families were shopping and working. Durham is over 1,300 miles from the border. None of this was about securing our borders. None of it was about enforcing the law. It was a show of force meant to scare people.""

Members of Siembra NC, an immigrant worker rights group, said there have been at least a dozen arrests made in the Triangle Tuesday. The group hosted a press conference with various community leaders at the All My Children child care center in Durham, where Border Patrol officials had been sighted in the parking lot, said Elisha Muhammad, the center's program director.

Muhammad said they told parents not to pick up their children and had the building under lockdown until 5 p.m.

""The school that we run — they're preschool, they're younger than preschool,"" she said. ""It's really sad they have to live in fear of attending school to be with their friends, to get their education.""

The actions in the Triangle follow immigration enforcement agents arresting more than 130 individuals in Charlotte last weekend. In an operation it calls ""Charlotte's Web,"" Department of Homeland Security claimed that 44 of them had criminal records.

As WFAE reported Monday, it is unclear how long the immigration enforcement operation surge will last in the Charlotte area and it's had a chilling effect in immigrant communities, prompting businesses to lock their doors and folks to stay home instead of going to school or work. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system reported nearly 21,000 absences on Monday.

""While the Raleigh Police Department is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law. I can confirm that RPD has not participated in any immigration planning activities,"" Cowell said in a statement Monday night. ""Above all, Raleigh is a safe city, with crime down year-over-year. Public safety is a priority for me and this City Council.""

The Triangle branch of the Party for Socialism and Liberation announced Tuesday morning that they are organizing a rally at Moore Square in Raleigh at 5 p.m. to protest the presence of immigration enforcement activity in the area.

Gov. Josh Stein also released a statement that his office is aware of border control agents coming to Raleigh.

""Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,"" Stein posted on Facebook. ""Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.""

Other NC Democrats have released statements decrying immigration enforcement tactics, while state Republican leaders have expressed support for them.

The North Carolina Association of Educators, along with its Wake chapter, also called on state leaders to protect students and their families.

""We also must be clear about what is happening: the Trump Administration is intentionally stoking racial fear to push a billionaire-backed political agenda,"" the organization wrote in a statement Tuesday morning. ""Fear is being used as a tool to fracture working-class communities — to pit Black, Brown, and white families against one another. In Wake County, we refuse to let that strategy succeed. We are committed to building a multiracial working-class coalition that stands united to protect public school families and defend our community. When we stand together across race and background, fear loses its power.""

Emilin Gaona was behind the counter at La Zacatecana, a small, tidy, family-owned bodega. She said her family almost hadn’t opened the store this morning. A lot of their workers were too afraid to come in, she said, because of the news that the Border Patrol would be active in Raleigh.

Gaona said she and her mother decided to open anyway because many people in the community rely on the small store to pay bills and send money internationally. But she said they had had almost no business as of midday.

Gaona was born in the United States, but she’s still nervous about the federal agents.

“I was kind of scared to even drive over here because, like, they see you, they see brown, they’re stopping you,” Gaona told NC Newsline. “They don’t let you show your papers. They don’t really care about that. They just take you.”

Gaona’s 12-year-old sister is a U.S. citizen, too. She said her sister had seen what was happening on her phone and didn’t want to go to her Garner school this morning.

“She was crying because she was scared. She was afraid. And I get it, I understand,” Gaona said. “But we can’t really stop our lives either, and we just have to keep going.”

Next door, the Elvia hair salon was closed. Two doors down, the Tres Hermanos grocery store was open, but there wasn’t a single customer browsing its aisles or ordering at the meat counter. The manager declined to be interviewed, but said business was very, very slow.

It was the same story all across Garner, a working-class suburb of Raleigh with a sizable Latino population.

At the Home Depot, the contractor parking area – usually packed – was nearly empty. Most of the shops at the International Foods plaza, a major Latino shopping center, were closed at midday. A taekwondo studio had a sign in its window: “No class today and tomorrow due to the situation ongoing in our cities.”

NC Newsline asked Gov. Josh Stein Tuesday why he believes North Carolina is being targeted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Stein said he doesn’t know.

“We’ve reached out to the White House. We haven’t gotten any word,” Stein said after an event in Benson on Tuesday. “We’re not hearing directly from [U.S.] Customs and Border Patrol, so we don’t know for sure where they’re going, how long they’ll be here, where else they’re going.”

Stein, a Democrat, accused Border Patrol agents of “operating in the shadows” in the recent sweep in Charlotte.

“If this were targeted to going after known people who are criminals or known people who are drug traffickers who are engaged in violent crime, that would be a good thing,” Stein said. “But they’re just sweeping sidewalks. They’re sweeping parking lots. They’re going into stores and churches.”

“This is causing widespread fear, widespread uncertainty,” Stein added. “This is not about public safety.”

NC Newsline also asked U.S. Customs and Border Patrol why they’re targeting North Carolina. The agency did not immediately respond.

However, Greg Bovino, the commanding CBP agent who has led operations in Chicago and now Charlotte, has instead targeted Stein through social media posts and TV hits.

He accused the governor of using “heated rhetoric” in a Fox News appearance Tuesday. And he later reposted a video of a woman threatening agents with a screwdriver on X, writing: “Governor Stein, you caused this.”

“I put a lot of the blame on our elected leadership,” Bovino told Fox News.

Lander was arrested with 10 state lawmakers on Sept. 18 by Department of Homeland Security Police after an hour-long standoff in the elevator bank of the 10th floor of the building, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has several holding cells for recently detained immigrants.

Following an appearance in federal court Tuesday morning, federal prosecutors offered Lander and the other elected officials a deal to drop the obstruction charges against them if they avoid being arrested inside a federal building for six months, the lawmakers said.

While the state lawmakers agreed to the deal, Lander refused it.

“I believe the crime is not what we were doing. The crime on that day was on the other side of the 10th floor door, where ICE agents are keeping our neighbors in cruel detention conditions,” he said, speaking to a gaggle of reporters outside the federal courthouse after the appearance Tuesday. “That’s why we were there. That’s what we wanted to see.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately return a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Southern District of New York declined to comment.

Among those who agreed to the deal were left-leaning members of the legislature, including state senators Jabari Brisport, Gustavo Rivera and Julia Salazar and assemblymembers Emily Gallagher, Jessica Gonzalez Rojas, Marcela Mitaynes, Tony Simone and Claire Valdez.

“We were afforded due process today, but so many have been robbed of that right,” Valdez said, referring to ICE’s arrests of immigrants that have been spiking since May.

On the day of their arrests, Lander and the state lawmakers were demanding to inspect conditions of ICE’s holding cells, where THE CITY had reported on rampant overcrowding where detainees were described in one video as being held “like dogs in here.”

A federal judge’s order in August, however, appears to have improved conditions for detainees and restricted the number of people ICE can keep there at once.

“It’s just a continuation of absolutely draconian immigration enforcement from this federal administration.
“New Yorkers are not going to allow Tom Homan and his brown shirted ICE agents to occupy our city with impunity,” said the outgoing comptroller.","Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said on Tuesday that he will be ramping up ICE’s operations in New York “soon” beyond the courtroom hallways of 26 Federal Plaza.

Homan made the ominous statement during a Nov. 18 appearance on Fox News, during which he said that he himself would be coming to the Big Apple in the “near future.”

“I plan on being in New York City in the near future. We are going to do operations in New York City,” Homan said. “We will be coming to New York City; we are already there now, but we will increase the enforcement presence in New York City again because they are a sanctuary city, and we know that we have an issue there.”

The Trump administration has long opposed New York City’s sanctuary status because it limits local agency cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts.

This comes on the heels of last month’s ICE raid along Canal Street in Chinatown that saw a slew of vendors arrested along with four American citizens who were cuffed by federal agents as a spontaneous protest erupted over the detainments.

Residents have also reported an increased sightings of masked men, presumably ICE agents, dragging people off the street and shoving them into unmarked vehicles.

Mamdani team pushes back on Homan’s ICE threat

A spokesperson for Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani stated that the incoming administration will do everything in its power to protect those it will soon serve.

“New York City’s more than three million immigrants are central to our city’s strength, vitality, and success. The Mayor-elect remains steadfast in his commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of every single New Yorker and upholding our sanctuary laws,” Dora Pekec, Mamdani’s spokesperson, said.

Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams’ office did not immediately respond to amNewYork’s request for comment. Adams and Homan have met multiple times since President Trump’s re-election last year to discuss ways the city government could cooperate with the federal government on stopping illegal immigration.

Meanwhile, other New York elected officials vowed not to be intimidated by Homan or the Trump administration.

“It’s just a continuation of absolutely draconian immigration enforcement from this federal administration. We won’t be intimidated. We have a responsibility more than ever to protect New Yorkers from threats like this from the federal government,” Senator Julia Salazar told amNewYork.

City Comptroller Brad Lander also spoke to amNewYork, adding that people can aid layers of protections against ICE by placing “employee only” signs on doors at places of work, something that will force the Feds to obtain warrants in order to enter portions of the premises. Still, he also echoed Salazar’s comments, adding that locals will not be intimidated either.

“New Yorkers are not going to allow Tom Homan and his brown shirted ICE agents to occupy our city with impunity,” said the outgoing comptroller. “We’re not going to let them violate the rule of law, abduct our neighbors without judicial warrants, without identifying themselves, while wearing masks without due process, grabbing people into cars, taking parents while their kids are in school. We’re not going to let that happen. And you can see New Yorkers rising up in that way all over the place.

A representative for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools tells PEOPLE that 30,339 students were reported absent from their schools on Monday, Nov. 17.

CMS, who originally reported the number as being close to 21,000, added that this reporting remains unofficial as a variety of factors go into the official count, such as whether or not this includes preschool-aged children, whether students doing virtual learning are counted and more.

WBTV noted that 31% of the student population in the area identifies as Hispanic, per data from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.

The sudden fall in student participation on Monday followed a recent increase in ICE raids in the area under a plan announced as “Operation Charlotte’s Web” by The Department of Homeland Security on Saturday, Nov.15.

NBC News reported that multiple businesses shuttered during the raids as ICE agents moved into the area to ""target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State,"" per the DHS release.

The announcement of the ICE operation prompted the CMS school district to publicly share on Sunday Nov, 16, that schools would continue in person this week.

“Please know there has been no immigration enforcement activity on CMS property, and we have not received any notice that such actions are planned,” CMS Assistant Communications Officer Tom Miner said in a Facebook video. “Therefore, schools will operate on a normal, in-person schedule tomorrow. We will continue to closely monitor immigration enforcement activity in Mecklenburg county.”

Miner added that if there was “an emergency situation” at any of the district’s campuses, the authorities would “reconsider remote instruction at that time.” He added that the school district “does not ask about immigration or citizenship status during enrollment,” and does not “share student information unless required by law.”

Miner also stated that, “Immigration officials cannot access staff, students, or private areas without a valid warrant or subpoena.”

The reported drop in student numbers comes after many were detained by ICE in restaurants, grocery stores, Home Depot parking lots and an east Charlotte church, reported The Charlotte Observer.

The Department of Homeland Security tells PEOPLE that more than 200 people were detained in the first three days of ""Operation Charlotte's Web.""

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles spoke out in a Monday press conference, and directly addressed Donald Trump over the raids.

“The city of Charlotte is one where we believe in fairness and dignity, and we are one of the largest cities in the country and we work very hard to do it right,” Lyles said, per WCNC. “If I were to talk to the president, I would say to him, ‘Look at our city, look at our people,’ and make sure that he has the understanding that all of you and I have.”

In a message to Charlotte residents, she added, “Let’s do whatever we can to be safe.”

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said that ICE had moved into the state's capital city on Monday night with plans for raids on Tuesday, Nov. 18.

“While the Raleigh Police Department is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law,” Cowell said in a statement, per The News & Observer. ""I can confirm that RPD has not participated in any immigration planning activities.”

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein condemned the raids across the state on X on Monday night.

“Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,” Stein wrote. “Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.”

He also urged the residents in Raleigh to “remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement.”",https://people.com/thmb/o5twvCnGtGQUqFAd9hfSPTMfhWI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(686x351:688x353)/charlotte-police-perimeter-ice-agents-operations-charlotte-111825-6568dfe036214ea9aa03ece42edaf145.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 00:56:51.158959

The latest bust happened in Kansas. Agents arrested 31-year-old Akhror Bozorov, a criminal illegal alien from Uzbekistan wanted for belonging to a terrorist organization, according to a Department of Homeland Security news release.

An arrest warrant was issued by Uzbekistan for Bozorov in 2022 for being a member of a terrorist organization. He is accused of distributing terrorist propaganda calling for jihad online and recruiting terrorists to join the jihad movement, according to the release.

He was arrested Nov. 9 while working as a commercial truck driver in Kansas.

“Not only was Akhror Bozorov – a wanted terrorist – released into the country by the Biden administration, but he was also given a commercial driver’s license by Governor Shapiro’s Pennsylvania. This should go without saying, but terrorist illegal aliens should not be operating 18-wheelers on America’s highways,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

“Biden and Mayorkas allowed countless terrorists to come into our country. President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target these national security threats.”

DHS’s news release says that Bozorov entered the U.S. illegally in February 2023. After being arrested by U.S. Border Patrol, he was released by the Biden administration and granted “work authorization” in January 2024. Bozorov was issued a commercial driver’s license on July 25, 2025, in Pennsylvania.

Not the first ICE raid arresting truckers

Oklahoma, in particular, has been a hotbed of activity for ICE arresting truckers.

According to a news release from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spent a week in late September arresting 130 truck drivers for various violations at the Beckham County Port of Entry.

“Oklahomans deserve safe highways,” Corporation Commission Chair Kim David said. “We appreciate the opportunity to assist ICE and DPS Troop S by removing non-compliant and dangerous drivers from our roads. By working together as law enforcement partners, we’re reducing risks for every driver.”

The operation, dubbed Operation Guardian, fired back up in early November.

ICE announced that a two-day operation in Oklahoma that yielded 70 arrests, including 34 truck drivers. According to ICE, 26 truck drivers had been improperly issued CDLs, and the other eight were operating a commercial motor vehicle without a license.

Targeting illegal CDL holders, companies that hire them

The candidly named No CDLs for Illegals Act was introduced by Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., on Oct. 28.

HR5863 would require CDL candidates to present proof of citizenship, lawful permanent resident status or a valid work authorization document. The bill would prohibit a state from issuing a CDL to an individual who is not domiciled in the state, and it would require states to use the SAVE system to verify a non-citizen applicant’s immigration status. States would be obligated to deny any applicants if the SAVE system doesn’t confirm lawful presence in the United States.

Both the House and Senate acted decisively today to pass a bill forcing the Justice Department to release its files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The House approved the bill in a near-unanimous vote of 427-1. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was the lone “no” vote. Hours later, the Senate agreed with unanimous consent to pass the measure.

Amid mounting pressure from his base, President Donald Trump reversed course and said he would sign the legislation if it passed both chambers, and encouraged House Republicans to vote in favor.

In his first visit to the White House since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed bin Salman received a warm welcome from Trump, who contradicted U.S. intelligence and said the Saudi crown prince “knew nothing” about the killing.

Mr. Trump has belittled Mr. Mamdani for months, calling him a danger to New York.

Speaking on Fox News, the official, Thomas Homan, said that he was targeting New York City because of its so-called sanctuary policies, which prevent local law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration authorities on most matters.

“We know we have an issue there with public safety,” Mr. Homan said of New York. “If they don’t want to assist and they want to keep pushing back and impeding our efforts, then we’re going to just send more teams there. We’re going to flood the zone.”

The city’s sanctuary laws, most of which were passed in 2014 when Bill de Blasio was mayor, strictly limit communication and cooperation between the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and city departments.

Mr. Homan’s warning came as New York’s leaders have been preparing for the possibility that Mr. Trump will deploy the National Guard or more immigration agents to New York after Mr. Mamdani’s victory on Nov. 4.

Mr. Mamdani, a Democrat and democratic socialist, ran for mayor arguing that only he could stand up to Mr. Trump, whom he described as a threat to democracy. Mr. Trump has belittled Mr. Mamdani for months, calling him a danger to New York. (Mr. Mamdani reached out to the White House recently to set up a meeting with the president.)

Gov. Kathy Hochul, who met with Mr. Mamdani last week to discuss Mr. Trump’s threats, said on Monday that state officials had been conducting exercises ahead of a potential federal deployment, adding that the city’s business leaders, some of whom have ties to Mr. Trump, would have a “very important” role to play.

“I’ve had conversations with a lot of business leaders and saying, ‘When the time comes, make sure that you also convey your concerns about what this would do to destabilize New York City and the outsize impact that this would have across America,’” she said in Albany on Monday.

New York officials have held phone calls with their counterparts in Chicago and Los Angeles to learn from their experiences confronting a surge in federal agents. Those discussions have focused, in part, on ensuring that any protests remain peaceful, to avoid the scenes of violence that could give Mr. Trump a pretext for deploying troops.

“They highlighted how important it is to get ahead of the narrative,” said Ana María Archila, a co-director of the progressive Working Families Party, who has participated in some of the calls. “Trump is looking for a fight. He wants the images of the fight in the streets.”

Since the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown started, much of the enforcement in New York City has taken place at federal immigration courts. But agents have also arrested people in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods and towns across the state, including on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley.

This month, Border Patrol agents conducted an operation targeting commercial truck drivers on Interstate 90 near Buffalo. They arrested 37 men who they said were undocumented and had been issued commercial driver’s licenses, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The federal government buttressed its deportation campaign with an infusion of billions of dollars for immigration enforcement efforts as part of Mr. Trump’s domestic policy law. Shortly after it passed in July, Mr. Homan visited New York City with Kristi Noem, the U.S. homeland security secretary, to blame Mayor Eric Adams and the city’s sanctuary laws for the shooting of an off-duty customs officer in Manhattan during an attempted robbery.

As New York City officials prepared for the potential arrival of the National Guard, county clerks in other parts of the state expressed dismay that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency had abruptly canceled naturalization ceremonies, probably complicating the process for some immigrants.

At least seven counties were affected, said Timothy C. Idoni, the Westchester County clerk. The clerk’s office there has held such ceremonies for more than 40 years. On Friday, Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican whose district includes parts of Westchester, wrote a letter to Joseph B. Edlow, the director of the citizenship agency, seeking to reverse the decision.

Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the agency, said that the county courts did not meet federal requirements to conduct naturalization ceremonies. Applicants scheduled to take part in ceremonies would receive new appointments, and their naturalization processes would continue, Mr. Tragesser said.

Mr. Idoni said that applicants would now probably have to travel to 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan to complete the final citizenship requirements and to receive naturalization certificates instead of participating in celebratory events arranged by their communities. The building in Manhattan has offices for the citizenship agency as well as for ICE, and it has become the epicenter of immigration arrests in the city.

“Heaven knows what they face down there, with all the things that are going on with immigration issues,” Mr. Idoni said. “We’re all very upset.”

When a small, bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced a petition in July to maneuver around Speaker Mike Johnson's control of the House floor, it appeared a longshot effort - especially as Trump urged his supporters to dismiss the matter as a ""hoax.""

But both Trump and Johnson failed to prevent the vote. The president in recent days bowed to political reality, saying he would sign the bill. And just hours after the House vote, senators agreed to approve it unanimously, skipping a formal roll call.

The decisive, bipartisan work in Congress Tuesday further showed the pressure mounting on lawmakers and the Trump administration to meet long-held demands that the Justice Department release its case files on Epstein, a well-connected financier who killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges he sexually abused and trafficked underage girls.

MORE | Epstein survivors speak out ahead of House vote, take aim at Trump

For survivors of Epstein's abuse, passage of the bill was a watershed moment in a years-long quest for accountability.

""These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight. And they did it by banding together and never giving up,"" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as she stood with some of the abuse survivors outside the Capitol Tuesday morning.

""That's what we did by fighting so hard against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, in order to make this vote happen today,"" added Greene, a Georgia Republican.

In the end, only one lawmaker in Congress opposed the bill. Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican who is a fervent supporter of Trump, was the only ""nay"" vote in the House's 427-1 tally. He said he worried the legislation could lead to the release of information on innocent people mentioned in the federal investigation.

The bill forces the release within 30 days of all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in federal prison. It would allow the Justice Department to redact information about Epstein's victims or continuing federal investigations, but not information due to ""embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.""

Even before the bill's passage Tuesday, thousands of pages of emails and other documents from Epstein's estate have been released from an investigation by the House Oversight Committee.

Those documents show Epstein's connections to global leaders, Wall Street powerbrokers, influential political figures and Trump himself. In the United Kingdom, King Charles III stripped his disgraced brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein.

Trump's reversal on the Epstein files

Trump has said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, but tried for months to move past the demands for disclosure.

Still, many in the Republican base continued to demand the release of the files. Adding to that pressure, survivors of Epstein's abuse rallied outside the Capitol Tuesday morning. Bundled in jackets against the November chill and holding photos of themselves as teenagers, they recounted their stories of abuse.

""We are exhausted from surviving the trauma and then surviving the politics that swirl around it,"" said one of the survivors.

Another, Jena-Lisa Jones, said she had voted for Trump and had a message for the president: ""I beg you Donald Trump, please stop making this political.""

The group of women also met with Johnson and rallied outside the Capitol in September, but have had to wait months for the vote.

That's because Johnson kept the House closed for legislative business for nearly two months and refused to swear-in Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona during the government shutdown. After winning a special election on Sept. 23, Grijalva had pledged to provide the crucial 218th vote to the petition for the Epstein files bill. But only after she was sworn into office last week could she sign her name to the discharge petition to give it majority support in the 435-member House.

It quickly became obvious the bill would pass, and both Johnson and Trump began to fold. Trump on Sunday said Republicans should vote for the bill.

Yet Greene told reporters that Trump's decision to fight the bill had betrayed his Make America Great Again political movement.

""Watching this turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart,"" she said.

How Johnson handled the bill

Rather than waiting until next week for the discharge position to officially take effect, Johnson held the vote under a procedure that requires a two-thirds majority.

But Johnson also spent a morning news conference listing off problems that he sees with the legislation. He argued that the bill could have unintended consequences by disclosing parts of federal investigations that are usually kept private, including information on victims.

""This is a raw and obvious political exercise,"" Johnson said.

Still, he voted for the bill. ""None of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency,"" he explained.

Meanwhile, the bipartisan pair who sponsored the bill, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., warned senators against doing anything that would ""muck it up,"" saying they would face the same public uproar that forced both Trump and Johnson to back down.

""We've needlessly dragged this out for four months,"" Massie said, adding that those raising problems with the bill ""are afraid that people will be embarrassed. Well, that's the whole point here.""

Senate acts quickly

Even as the bill cleared his chamber, Johnson pressed for the Senate to amend it to protect the information of ""victims and whistleblowers."" But Senate Majority Leader John Thune quickly shut down that notion.

As senators gathered in the chamber Tuesday evening for the first votes of the week, it became clear no one would object to passing the bill as written.

Just before Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called to pass the bill by unanimous consent, Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican who is close to Trump, walked in the chamber and gave Schumer a thumbs-up. He then walked over to Schumer and shook his hand.

""This is about giving the American people the transparency they've been crying for,"" said Schumer, D-N.Y. ""This is about holding accountable all the people in Jeffrey Epstein's circle who raped, groom, targeted and enabled the abuse of hundreds of girls for years and years.""

In recognition of that fact, and in recognition of Petitioner’s entitlement to an adjudication of his asylum application (still pending), an immigration judge closed Petitioner’s removal proceedings in 2021, so that Petitioner could wait out the years-long backlog on his claims.

“Notwithstanding, on July 3, 2025, Petitioner was detained by Immigration & Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’).

“Petitioner is not an ‘arriving alien.’ He has not been ‘arriving’ in this country for almost a decade. Respondents make no cogent argument to the contrary. Accordingly, section 1225 cannot apply.

Tammy Duckworth, accused by the Department of Homeland Security of misrepresenting himself as a lawyer, has been fired, according to a letter to DHS from the Democratic senator.

Homeland Security said that Edward York, a constituent outreach coordinator of Duckworth’s Metro East office, identified himself as an attorney at the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement office in St. Louis last month when he was seeking to speak with a Macoupin County man recently been detained by ICE.

“Upon reviewing the matter, I can confirm that neither I nor my leadership team was aware of, authorized or directed what your letter describes as the employee’s conduct,” Duckworth wrote in a letter sent on Monday. “My office has terminated the employment of said employee, effective November 17, 2025.”

Duckworth’s office could not be immediately reached for a comment on Tuesday, and an attorney for York declined to comment.

ICE detained Ismael Ayuzo Sandoval last month for violating four prior deportations and having been convicted in a 2008 DUI case. His detention prompted a rally in the small community of Staunton. Residents described Sandoval, 41, as a prominent member of the community and a successful restaurant owner. Sandoval has been held in ICE custody in Ste. Genevieve.

“On October 29, 2025, ICE arrested Ayuzo in Staunton, IL,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement last week. “He was transferred to ICE St. Louis for processing where a Duckworth staffer allegedly tried to remove him from ICE custody by claiming to be his attorney.”

In its letter sent last week, Homeland Security said York requested a G-28 form, which is used to authorize a licensed attorney or an accredited representative to act on behalf of a client, and asked that Sandoval sign it. Sandoval completed the form, and York then left, according to DHS.

However, ICE was not able to verify that York was an attorney.

Four days later, attorney Marleen Mendez Suarez’s office in Collinsville submitted an unsigned G-28 form for Sandoval to the federal government. In the letter, DHS said York advertised himself as an employee of the Suarez law firm.

“It appears as if Mr. York may have collaborated with the firm to cover his misrepresentation,” the letter from Todd Lyons, acting director of the agency, said.

Suarez could not immediately be reached for comment.

Clay Higgins (R-La.)
“These are your average Americans, and you want to know what the Epstein files represent?
She later said she was referring to the Epstein files more generally.
The Epstein files have been a hugely divisive congressional fight in recent months, with Democrats pushing for the release and Republican congressional leaders largely refusing to take the votes.
Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, said the Trump administration will be forced to release the files with an act of Congress.","The long-standing fight to demand the Justice Department release all documents tied to its investigation into late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein shifted to President Trump on Tuesday after the House and Senate, within hours of each other, voted overwhelmingly to publicize the files.

Trump, who tried to thwart the release of the records for several months, reversed course Sunday night and indicated that he plans to sign the measure when it reaches his desk. For that to happen, the Senate and House needed to approve the measure — and on Tuesday that happened with near-unanimous support in both chambers, at the urging of Epstein survivors.

The action, however, did not come without some tension.

Hours before the House vote, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said he would support the measure even though he believed it did not do enough to protect the privacy of the victims. Calling the bill “flawed,” Johnson then called on Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) to fix the bill in the upper chamber before sending it to the president’s desk.

But amending the bill would have further delayed passage of the measure, prolonging a hugely divisive congressional fight. The Senate ultimately decided to quickly pass the bill without making any changes — or a recorded vote — after a successful procedural maneuver led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

“Epstein victim groups have made clear that they support this bill as written, without amendments,” Schumer said. “We should listen to them and pass this bill quickly.”

The House vote was 427 to 1, with Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) the only nay vote.

The votes were the culmination of a months-long fight that began when House Democrats, joined by a small group of Republicans, forced a vote on the transparency bill over the objection of Trump and Republican legislative leaders.

The effort underscored how the Epstein saga and the Trump administration’s handling of the files were fueling a rift within Trump’s political base, which in the end was strong enough to force top Republicans to cave.

In an emotional speech on the House floor, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, argued the Epstein scandal is unlikely to end anytime soon because it has resonated deeply with many Americans — including those in the MAGA movement — who feel disenfranchised from the powerful people who control the government.

“These American women aren’t rich powerful elites,” Greene said in her speech. “These are your average Americans, and you want to know what the Epstein files represent? It represents the failures of the federal government and Congress.”

Speaking with reporters in the morning outside the Capitol, Greene also said, “The real test will be, will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?”

Ahead of the votes, several Epstein abuse survivors urged lawmakers to support the release of the records. They gathered outside the Capitol as they made their emotional plea.

“It’s time that we put the political agendas and party affiliations to the side. This is a human issue, this is about children,” said one survivor, Haley Robson. “There is no place in society for exploitation, sexual crimes or exploitation of women in society.”

Republicans follow Trump’s lead

Republicans for months balked at calling for the release of the Epstein files, joining Trump in claiming the issue was being brought up by Democrats as a way to distract from Republicans’ legislative successes. Some Republican lawmakers repeated those claims when debating the measure Tuesday, saying the vote was a “political show” led by Democrats who wanted tarnish Trump’s reputation.

Although Trump urged Republicans to support the measure ahead of the vote, his administration could have released the files without an act of Congress. At an Oval Office event Tuesday, Trump did not answer when a reporter asked him why he hadn’t done so yet. The president instead called the ABC News reporter “terrible” and for her network’s broadcast license to be revoked.

Trump’s tirade highlighted how the president is feeling about the Epstein scandal, which he says is a “Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics” to distract from his legislative agenda. His remarks came after he had a drastic reversal and urged Republicans to vote to release the documents, saying there was “nothing to hide.”

Trump’s reversal came days after 20,000 documents from Epstein’s private estate were released by lawmakers in the House Oversight Committee. The files referenced Trump more than 1,000 times.

In private emails, Epstein wrote that Trump had “spent hours” at his house and “knew about the girls,” a revelation that reignited the push in Congress for further disclosures.

Trump has continued to deny wrongdoing in the Epstein saga despite initially opposing the release of files from the federal inquiry into the conduct of his former friend, a convicted sex offender and alleged sex trafficker. Epstein died by suicide while in federal custody in 2019.

Many members of Trump’s MAGA base have demanded the files be released, convinced they contain revelations about powerful people involved in Epstein’s abuse of what is believed to be more than 200 women and girls. Tension among his base spiked when Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said in July that an “Epstein client list” did not exist, after saying in February that the list was sitting on her desk awaiting review. She later said she was referring to the Epstein files more generally.

Trump’s call to release the files now highlights how he is trying to prevent an embarrassing defeat as a growing number of Republicans in the House have joined Democrats to vote for the legislation in recent days.

The Epstein files have been a hugely divisive congressional fight in recent months, with Democrats pushing for the release and Republican congressional leaders largely refusing to take the votes. The issue even led to a rift within the MAGA movement.

Democrats have accused Johnson of delaying the swearing-in of Rep. Adelita Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, because she promised to cast the final vote needed to move a so-called discharge petition, which would force a vote on the floor. The speaker has denied those claims.

Robson, one of the survivors, questioned Trump’s about-face on the vote.

“While I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I’m grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill, I can’t help [but] be skeptical of what the agenda is,” Robson said.

The bill would prohibit the attorney general, Bondi, from withholding, delaying or redacting “any record, document, communication, or investigative material on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”

But caveats in the bill could provide Trump and Bondi with loopholes to keep records related to the president concealed.

In the spring, FBI Director Kash Patel directed a Freedom of Information Act team to comb through the entire trove of files from the investigation, and ordered it to redact references to Trump, citing his status as a private citizen with privacy protections when the inquiry first launched in 2006, Bloomberg reported at the time.

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, said the Trump administration will be forced to release the files with an act of Congress.

ECHR: an instrument of peace causing discord All EU nations as well as non-EU member United Kingdom are signatories to the ECHR, which is not directly related to the European Union.","Several EU members in recent months have repeatedly voiced a desire to change — or at the very least — reinterpret certain guidelines pertaining to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) so they can adapt their own national laws in ways that would allow them to further restrict asylum and implement related immigration controls.

Earlier this year, nine EU member states came together to issue a call to the bloc to change its interpretation of the ECHR, which governs many fundamentals relating to asylum law for those countries signatories to the convention — especially in all matters relating to the human rights of migrants and refugees.

Italy, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland joined forces and demanded that the EU streamlines its laws to expel foreign criminals — even if this means that guidelines issued under the ECHR have to be reexamined and adapted accordingly. Great Britain is also beginning to think along those lines, although it is no longer and EU member state.

The nine nations in particular want the European Court of Human Rights, which is the final instance for ruling on ECHR-related matters, to revise and relax its guidelines on the deportation of such criminals to countries, which are not deemed safe.

In their view, an asylum seeker forfeits their right to protection if they significantly break the law of the country which hosts and protects them.

Examples of clashes between EU and ECHR

Some EU nations, such as France, have faced frustrations when trying to further tighten their asylum laws, as constitutional and legal experts rejected tabled bills, which were incompatible with the ECHR.

Other members of the bloc, like Greece, have faced criticism for using emergency measures to stop the processing of asylum applications earlier this year in Crete amid a sudden rise in arrival numbers, with the European Court of Human Rights reminding the Mediterranean nation that it can only suspend such asylum procedures for a limited window of time.

Italy, meanwhile, has repeatedly run into legal trouble at multiple levels — mainly national — with its plan to proactively intercept some migrants in international waters in the Mediterranean and then take them to two purpose-built facilities in Albania for remote processing; those deemed ineligible for asylum could then be returned directly from non-EU member Albania with far less red tape than is involved in Italy.

Many of the legal hold-ups relating to the Albania process ultimately have to do with what the ECHR does and does not allow — or rather, the interpretation of various Italian judges thereof.

UK: push for even greater ECHR changes

Separate to this development, Britain has also repeatedly voiced staunch demands to change certain ECHR fundamentals or be allowed to change its interpretation of the laws — with some politicians even threatening to exit the treaty altogether.

This week, the UK's government once again announced it hoped to introduce sweeping changes to its asylum law, some of which may at the current time not entirely be in line with some legal ECHR basics.

Among several new restrictions tabled to be introduced, the UK hopes to introduce a system whereby asylum seekers pegged to be deported can always be sent back to their country of origin; if the country of origin refuses to accept their own people back, the British government might go as far as banning anyone from that country from being issued with visas, as part of a proposed tit-for-tat policy, according to UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.

This blanket refusal, among other proposed changes, might however be in breach of ECHR guidelines, at least at the present moment.

Among EU nations, Denmark has recently expressed the view that it would be happy to join forces with Britain to push for a re-examination of how the ECHR is applied.

ECHR Article 3: What qualifies as 'torture'?

Details on concrete proposed changes to the ECHR are currently only known from UK lawmakers and not from European ones, although it is likely that they will overlap.

British authorities want in particular to see changes, amendments or legally binding reinterpretations to Article 3 of the treaty, which deals with the prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, and Article 8, which governs the right to family life.

Multiple deportations of criminal asylum seekers have been blocked due to an interpretation of Article 3, whereby sending someone back to a country from which they have escaped would constitute a form of torture; Britain argues that it is in its own public's best interest to allow such deportations to prevent future crimes and to serve as a deterrent to other foreigners who might consider engaging in criminal activities.

ECHR Article 8: A family affair

Article 8 of the ECHR meanwhile has been used to justify family reunifications, which Britain and other countries currently critical of the ECHR do not want to ban altogether but to make considerably more difficult, for example by introducing certain income thresholds to qualify applicants to send for immediate family members.

In the past, some attempts at limiting family reunification rights have been halted by citing Article 8; the same law has also been cited in the past — in connection with other laws — to prevent the deportation of entire families to safe countries or countries which have been deemed safe once again.

The Home Office says, for example, that currently in Britain, ""there are around 700 Albanian families whose asylum claims have been rejected, yet their removal is not currently being enforced by the Home Office, despite Albania having a gold-standard of cooperation with the UK on returns and being a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).""

""Article 8 rights are currently leading to high numbers of arrivals from those who would not otherwise have the right to live in the UK,"" a press release by the Home Office earlier this week further highlights.

The definition of a 'safe country'

The definition of safe countries in general is also a thorn in the side of many European nations that are hoping to tighten their asylum laws, as squaring that with their membership of the ECHR has repeatedly proven problematic.

Many individual governments across Europe, as well as the EU itself, have designated lists of countries they consider 'safe' and are therefore destinations for possible deportations of nationals from that country, who have been refused protection by the host country.

In April 2025, the European Commission proposed to formalize this, including Bangladesh, Kosovo, Egypt, Morocco, Colombia, India and Tunisia on the list of safe countries.

This broadening of safe nations has been justified in legal documents from the European Commission by stressing that it would not interfere with individual assessments of asylum, as a country might not be safe for all inhabitants of a certain country, depending on their individual circumstances and experiences, which may have led them to claim protection elsewhere.

However, the EU also tried to argue as an extension to those changes that any country could be considered 'safe' if 20 percent or fewer applicants from that country generally were granted protection in the EU, which the human rights organization Amnesty criticized as a loophole of the proposed regulation.

A statement from Amnesty in July 2025 underlined: ""The fact that up to 20 percent of those applying for international protection from these countries are recognized as refugees indicates that these places are in fact not safe for all.""

CJEU ruling and Italy's Albania plans

Another example for the ongoing debate on safe countries of origin is a judgment from August this year by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding Italy's attempts to designate certain countries 'safe' — such as Bangladesh and Egypt.

The judgement underlined that migrants should always have the right to challenge such designations in court, and that countries must make accessible the information they used to reach the designation of 'safe' for each individual case, according to a statement from the International Bar Association (IBA), which is the global voice of the legal profession.

The new EU Pact on Asylum and Migration, which is due to come into effect next year, sets out to strengthen the right of designation of 'safe' countries, but the CJEU judgement, according to some legal experts quoted by the IBA, might still strengthen challenges to the pact in the future.

""The buried treasure in the [CJEU judgment] is the effectiveness of a challenge, and access to documents,"" says Steve Peers, a professor of EU and human rights law at Royal Holloway, University of London, who commented in the IBA article on the issue.

""With the new EU Pact, it might be easier to say a country is safe but it will [also] be easier to challenge this in individual cases.""

Changes to ECHR possible — but at what cost?

The Council of Europe (CoE), which oversees the application and implementation of the ECHR, has responded to these recent developments by declaring that it is ""absolutely ready"" to consider discussing changes to the treaty.

Its secretary general, Alain Berset, said that it might be time for the organization ""to change and adapt,"" while firmly stressing, however, that this could also weaken the international organization, which was formed in the wake of World War II to stop future conflict.

""These are complex challenges, and democracies must always remain open to reflection through the appropriate institutional avenues,"" Berset said earlier in the year.

The ECHR can be — and has in the past been — amended by adding new so-called protocols.

With different member states having varying migrant population and native population rates, there is also a risk that a ""one size fits all"" approach to these challenges would not leave all signatory states equally satisfied.

ECHR: an instrument of peace causing discord

All EU nations as well as non-EU member United Kingdom are signatories to the ECHR, which is not directly related to the European Union.

The ECHR is a treaty dating back to the early 1950s, which provides a loose but binding framework to protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of people, whose governments are part of the Council of Europe (CoE), which is headquartered in Strasbourg, France.

The Council of Europe has 46 member states, and its main body, the European Court of Human Rights, which is also based in Strasbourg, is in charge of making sure that all its signatory states comply with the legal framework set by the ECHR.

All 27 EU nations have to be signatories to the Council of Europe; however beyond the UK, non-EU members include such nations as Turkey, Armenia and Montenegro.

Until its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia was also a member; it has been suspended since.

Sen. John Thune defends airdropped provision allowing senators to sue the government

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., defended including a provision in the government funding bill that would allow senators to sue the federal government if their phone data was accessed without their being notified, saying he doesn’t know what he would do if the House were to pass a bill to rescind the provision.

""The House isn’t implicated in what we did. It just simply applies to the Senate,"" Thune said. ""What this does is enables people who are harmed, in this case, United States senators, to have a private right of action against the weaponization of the ... by the Justice Department.""

Pressed on the fact that many senators who could use the new ability to sue have said they support rescinding it and won’t use it to sue, Thune said: “I think the penalty is in place to ensure that in the future, if you get a Justice Department who did what Jack Smith did and weaponized the federal government against the Article I branch of the government — members the Article I branch the government — there is a remedy in place. There’s a recourse in place.”

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who is on the Appropriations Committee and whose bill included the provision, said he didn’t know it was in there until after he voted for it.

“I support repealing it. I didn’t support the provision that was put in there,” Mullin said. “It shouldn’t be retroactive. But I think now it maybe — may repeal the whole thing and have to put different language in it and not make it retroactive.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., admitted he worked with Thune to include the provision but said he would support rescinding it.

“Look, the bottom line is Thune wanted the provision, and we wanted to make sure that at least Democratic senators were protected from [Attorney General Pam] Bondi and others who might go after them,” Schumer said. “So we made it go prospective, not just retroactive, but I’d be for repealing all the provision, all of it, and I hope that happens.”

Inside a closed-door meeting of House Republicans today, Rep. Jen Kiggans, of Virginia, a swing district member who is a linchpin of the party’s narrow majority, stood up and made a plea.

“Doing nothing on health care is not the right answer,” she later told NBC News, summing up her message to colleagues. “I would really appreciate if we could have a timeline because we know that the end of the calendar year is coming, and I don’t want to see people’s premiums go up. I don’t want to see people lose their health insurance.”

The remarks drew an unspectacular reception.

“Average,” Kiggans replied when she was asked how it was received. “We line up, we have our one minute to state our case. Usual reaction.”

Republicans are careening to a health care cliff with no solution in hand. An estimated 22 million people in the United States are about to see their health insurance premiums soar by, in some cases, thousands of dollars per month, as billions in funding for the Affordable Care Act expires Dec. 31. The expiring funds, costing about $35 billion per year, were first passed during the pandemic to subsidize insurance payments, capping premiums for a “benchmark” ACA, or “Obamacare,” plan at 8.5% of income.

Indiana governor says he'll back Trump's endorsing primary challengers against state senators who oppose redistricting

Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement today that he will back an effort by Trump to endorse primary challenges against state lawmakers who don't support GOP-led redistricting efforts in the state.

“I will support President Trump’s efforts to recruit, endorse, and finance primary challengers for Indiana’s senators who refuse to support fair maps,"" Braun said.

Trump criticized Republican state lawmakers on social media Sunday for not pressing ahead with redistricting efforts and urged that Republicans who opposed new congressional maps lose their seats.

In his statement today, Braun praised state House Speaker Todd Huston and GOP state representatives who supported redistricting under pressure from Trump and said he would “explore all options” to compel a vote in the Senate to approve new maps. Sen. Rod Bray said last week that the Senate was shy of the votes needed to advance redistricting efforts.

Bray did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Braun's statement.

Trump also took direct aim at Bray yesterday, posting on social media: ""A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn’t care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity.""

Sherrill resigns House seat following gubernatorial win

Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., announced her resignation from her House seat today after she won the New Jersey governorship this month.

Sherrill opted to step down effective 11:59 p.m. Thursday, rather than wait until closer to her inauguration as governor in January. The move is expected to trigger a special election for her seat.

“It has been an honor to serve the residents of the 11th Congressional District since 2019,” Sherrill wrote.

“Public service is a public trust. I look forward to continuing to serve the residents of the 11th District and all New Jerseyans as Governor next year,” she added.

Senate unanimously agrees to send Epstein bill to Trump's desk

The Senate unanimously agreed to pass the Epstein files bill and will send it to Trump once it receives the legislation from the House, which approved it earlier in the day.

No more voting action by Congress is needed for it to go to Trump’s desk.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., put forward a unanimous consent motion, which passed with no objections.

Democrats target federal officials accused of civil rights violations in new legislation

Seizing on allegations that federal law enforcement officials committed constitutional violations as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown, Democrats have launched an effort to allow civil rights claims against rogue agents.

Lawmakers today reintroduced legislation that would ensure federal officials, including immigration agents and other law enforcement officers, can be sued individually for constitutional violations.

The bill, introduced in the House and the Senate by Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., would amend a post-Civil War-era law that allows such claims against state and local officials to make it clear that federal officials are covered, too.

Education Department takes a major step forward in the Trump administration’s plans to dismantle it

The Education Department is handing off some of its biggest grant programs to other federal agencies as the Trump administration accelerates its plan to shut down the department.

It is a major step forward for the administration’s dismantling of the department, which has mainly involved cutting jobs since Trump called for its elimination with an executive action in March.

Six new agreements signed by the Education Department will effectively move billions of dollars in grant programs to other agencies. Most notable is one that will put the Labor Department over some of the largest federal funding streams for K-12 schools, including Title I money for schools serving low-income communities.

National Press Club denounces Trump's remarks about Jamal Khashoggi

The National Press Club rebuked Trump in a statement this afternoon after he claimed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had nothing to do with the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi even though U.S. intelligence reached that conclusion.

""For reporters around the world — and for those who risk their lives to report on powerful figures, governments, and global events — statements that appear to minimize or excuse the killing of a journalist have real-world consequences,"" the National Press Club said. ""They can embolden those who wish to silence reporters, and they can undermine the essential principle that journalists must be able to work without fear of violence or retribution.""

Asked about Khashoggi's murder earlier, Trump told reporters: ""You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,"" referring to Crown Prince Mohammed.

Trump was responding to ABC News reporter Mary Bruce, who asked about the crown prince's alleged involvement in Khashoggi's killing. Trump initially responded by saying, ""Fake news."" When Bruce later asked Trump about Epstein, he derided her as a ""terrible person and a terrible reporter"" and said she couldn't ask any more questions.

House rebukes Chuy Garcia's re-election move

The House has voted to formally disapprove of Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., for his ploy to handpick his successor.

The measure passed by a vote of 236-183, with four members registering as ""present.""

Fellow Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, of Washington, offered the resolution. It took aim at Garcia’s actions this fall, which set up his chief of staff as the sole Democrat on the primary ballot to replace him in a deep-blue district.

Garcia had filed paperwork to run for re-election in 2026, then announced he was retiring after the filing deadline. His chief of staff, Patty Garcia, had filed her own paperwork to run for the seat just hours before the same Nov. 3 deadline. The two are not related.

House Democratic leadership, led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, backed Garcia and opposed the disapproval resolution.

Sen. Gallego to read part of Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre's memoir on the floor

Now that the House has voted to compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files, Senate Democrats aren’t wasting any time in their chamber.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he'll move to unanimously pass the Epstein resolution on the Senate floor, though any one senator can object to that.

And soon, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., is expected to take to the floor to bring attention to one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre.

Gallego will read excerpts of Giuffre’s memoir, ""Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice."" The book was released in October, months after she died by suicide in April. Her publisher released an email from Giuffre saying that it was her “heartfelt wish” that the book be released ""regardless” of her circumstances.

Gallego will quote this excerpt, according to plans shared first with NBC News:

Lone 'no' on Epstein measure explains his vote

Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., the lone “no” vote out of the 428 votes cast on the Epstein bill, posted a message on X explaining his decision.

""I have been a principled 'NO' on this bill from the beginning. What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,"" wrote Higgins, a former police officer.

""As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people — witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc. If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt. Not by my vote,"" he added.

The bill's co-authors, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have said the legislation already has protections for the victims, who've supported the measure.

House overwhelmingly passes Epstein transparency bill

The House passed the Epstein measure by an almost unanimous bipartisan vote of 427-1.

The bill would compel the Justice Department to release all its records related to the late convicted sex offender.

The House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed the files earlier this year, but the Justice Department has not yet turned all the documents over.

The measure will now move on to the Senate, where House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has called on his colleagues to make some changes to the bill, including increasing protections for victims. Democrats have blasted that suggestion as a stalling tactic and called on the Senate to pass it as is.

If it is signed into law, the bill would require the Justice Department to release in a searchable and downloadable format “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell within 30 days.

Khashoggi's widow says Saudi crown prince should 'apologize' to her for husband's death

Responding to Trump's defense of Mohammed bin Salman today on X, Khashoggi’s widow said the crown prince should meet directly with her and apologize for her husband's death.

""There is no justification to murder my husband. While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press,"" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi said. ""The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.""

The CIA determined that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi’s murder. The crown prince has said he took responsibility for the death in his role as Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader but has denied that he directed it.

House vote to release Epstein files has begun

The House has started voting on the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

The measure seemed ready to pass by a voice vote when Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., asked that the votes be recorded. The process is expected to last 15 minutes, and a two-thirds majority is needed to pass it.

Trump praises Saudi crown prince during White House visit

A a meeting in the Oval Office, Trump praised Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and claimed that the crown prince “knew nothing” about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in 2018. The meeting displayed a deepening alliance between the two leaders, with the crown prince announcing that his country plans to invest $1 trillion in the United States, up from an expected $600 billion.

New international student enrollments at U.S. colleges fall 17% amid Trump visa restrictions

The number of international students newly enrolled at U.S. colleges and universities fell 17% this fall amid new visa restrictions by the Trump administration, a report found.

U.S. colleges and universities reporting declines in new enrollments cited multiple contributing factors, including visa application concerns (96%) and travel restrictions (68%), according to the report released yesterday by the nonprofit Institute of International Education, which surveyed 825 U.S. higher education institutions.

India remains the largest source of international students after overtaking China last year, with more than 363,000 students in the 2024-25 school year. There were almost 266,000 students from China, while South Korea was the third-largest source with more than 42,000, according to the IIE report, which is sponsored by the State Department.

The Trump administration has been sending mixed messages on visa policies for international students. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. would “aggressively revoke” visas for Chinese students, but in August Trump said he planned to allow 600,000 Chinese students into the country — a figure more than double the number in the U.S. now, sparking uproar among some conservatives.

In a surprise announcement in September, Trump also said he was raising the fee for H-1B skilled worker visas to $100,000, prompting concern in countries such as India, which accounts for more than 70% of H-1B visa recipients including students who use them to stay in the U.S. after graduation. Trump later defended the H-1B visa, arguing this month that foreign labor is sometimes needed because the U.S. lacks “certain talents.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment sent outside business hours. A spokesperson told Reuters that Trump is “strengthening our country’s visa programs to put American national security first.”

The U.S. had almost 1.2 million international students from more than 200 places of origin in the 2024-25 school year, the report said, making up about 6% of the total student population of more than 19 million. International students, who often pay full tuition, are considered an important source of revenue for universities facing government budget cuts.

Federal court blocks Texas Republicans’ redrawn congressional map

A panel of federal judges has barred Texas from using its redrawn congressional map, which Republicans enacted earlier this year in an effort to shore up the party’s narrow House majority in next year’s midterm elections.

The court ordered Texas to use its previous map that was drawn in 2021 instead. The ruling, signed by Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, is likely to be appealed.

An appeal would go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to the ruling, teeing up a legal fight that could decide control of of the House.

The decision is a major blow for Trump, who called on Texas Republicans over the summer to draw a new map that could result in the party gaining up to five seats, triggering a nationwide redistricting battle across the country.

Democrats introduce bill to limit donations for White House ballroom construction

Two Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation to impose donation restrictions on the controversial $300 million ballroom project that resulted in the demolition of the East Wing of the White House.

The legislation was introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif.

If passed, the bill would bar donations from companies or people ""that present a conflict of interest"" and impose a two-year pause before a donor can lobby the federal government, among other restrictions, their news release said.

The bill would also require the National Park Service to publish donor names. Currently, ballroom donors can be anonymous.

In a statement, Warren said that the bill would ""put an end to what looks like bribery in plain sight."" Garcia also slammed the White House for not revealing all donors, saying in a statement that ""the people’s house could be funded by shady figures, corrupt money, and bad actors.""

The White House didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on the legislation.

NBC News has previously reported how the donations are being funneled through the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit that typically takes on uncontroversial projects.

Comcast Corp., the parent company of NBCUniversal, was included on a White House list of ballroom donors.

Trump attacks ABC reporter after Epstein questioning

Trump lashed out at ABC News' chief White House correspondent in response to a question asking why he wouldn't release the Epstein files immediately.

""You start off with a [Mohammed bin Salman], who is highly respected, asking him a horrible, insubordinate and just a terrible question,"" the president said, referring to correspondent Mary Bruce's initial question about the Saudi crown prince's alleged involvement in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The crown prince has denied ordering the killing, but has said he took responsibility for the death as Saudi Arabia's de facto leader.

The president then answered that he had ""nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein,"" repeating that he ""threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert.""

Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1980s, '90s and early 2000s before he said he barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago for recruiting young female employees away from the resort.

""You just keep going on the Epstein files,"" Trump said, claiming the sex abuse scandal is ""a Democrat hoax."" The president then said the network's license should be revoked.

""I think the license should be taken away from ABC, because your news is so fake and it's so wrong,"" Trump said. ""And we have a great [FCC] commissioner, the chairman, who should look at that.""

NBC News has reached out to ABC News for comment on Trump's attacks on the network and its reporter.

Last December, ABC agrees to pay $15 million in a settlement with Trump following a legal dispute over an interview in which the president alleged anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him.

Trump says he has 'nothing to do' with family business in Saudi Arabia

Trump denied any conflicts of interest between his family businesses and Saudi investments in the U.S., saying that ""what my family does is fine"" when asked about the issue by a reporter at the White House.

""I have nothing to do with the family business,"" the president said. ""What my family does is fine. They do business all over. They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually. I'm sure they could do a lot, and anything they've done has been very good.""

The Trump Organization, run by the president's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump has multiple active projects in the Middle Eastern country, including plans for Trump Towers in both Jeddah and Riyadh. The president has also hosted tournaments for LIV Golf, the Saudi-backed competitor to the PGA, at his golf courses.

Saudi crown prince says Iran wants to make a deal with the U.S., Trump says he's 'open to it'

The Saudi crown prince said during his bilateral meeting with Trump that he believes Iran wants to make a deal with the U.S., an apparent reference to a Iranian denuclearization agreement.

""We will do our best to help to reach a deal between the rest of America and Iran,"" he said. ""By the way, Iran does want to make a deal. I can say, I think they very badly want to make a deal.""

Trump said he would be ""open to it,"" adding, ""It would be a nice thing to have a deal with Iran, and we could have done it before the war, but that didn’t work out ... but they would very much like, I mean, they may say something else, but they would very much like to have a deal.""

Trump says Saudi crown prince 'knew nothing' about murdered journalist

Trump said that Crown Prince Mohammed knew ""nothing"" about journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in Saudi Arabia in 2018, despite the CIA's determination that the crown prince directly ordered Khashoggi's death in 2018.

""You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,"" Trump said, referring to Khashoggi. ""A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but [bin Salman] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.""

The crown prince called Khashoggi's death ""painful for us in Saudi Arabia"" and said the country has taken ""all the right steps"" in investigating the journalist's death.

The crown prince said that his country has ""improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that, and it’s painful and it’s a huge mistake"" and that they are ""doing our best that this doesn’t happen again.""

Bin Salman has denied ordering the killing, but has said he took responsibility for the death as Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader.

Crown prince says Saudi Arabia will invest $1 trillion in the U.S.

The Saudi crown prince said in the Oval Office with Trump that his country plans to invest $1 trillion in the U.S., up from an expected $600 billion.

""We’re going to announce that we are going to increase that $600 billion to almost $1 trillion for investment, real investment and real opportunity,"" he said, adding that it would involve investment in technology, AI and other areas.

Trump responded, ""We appreciate it very much.""

Appeals court upholds dismissal of Trump's CNN defamation suit

A federal appeals court today upheld a lower court's dismissal of Trump's $475 million defamation suit against CNN for referring to his false 2020 stolen election claims as ""the big lie.""

""Trump has not adequately alleged the falsity of CNN’s statements. Therefore, he has failed to state a defamation claim,"" the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling.

""Trump’s argument hinges on the fact that his own interpretation of his conduct — i.e., that he was exercising a constitutional right to identify his concerns with the integrity of elections — is true and that CNN’s interpretation — i.e., that Trump was peddling his 'Big Lie' — is false. However, his conduct is susceptible to multiple subjective interpretations, including CNN’s,"" the three-judge panel ruled.

Trump had contended in his suit that linking him with the phrase was essentially comparing him to the Nazis and Adolf Hitler, who's credited with coining the term. U.S. District Judge Raag Singhal disagreed in a 2023 ruling in which he dismissed the suit.

“CNN’s use of the phrase ‘the Big Lie’ in connection with Trump’s election challenges does not give rise to a plausible inference that Trump advocates the persecution and genocide of Jews or any other group of people,” the judge wrote.

A spokesman for Trump's legal team said in a statement that “there is no doubt that Fake News CNN defamed President Trump,"" and that he will ""continue to hold the mainstream media accountable and will pursue this case against CNN to its just and deserved conclusion.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson says he wants the Senate to amend the Epstein files bill

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said this morning that while he plans to vote in favor of the bill that would compel the Justice Department to release the files on Jeffrey Epstein, he wants the Senate to amend the legislation.

At a GOP leadership press conference, Johnson argued that the legislation the House is voting on this afternoon ""fails to fully protect victim privacy.""

""I’m going to read you an excerpt out of our legal document we put together to explain: Congress should give the attorney general broader authority to redact all the victim information. The discharge doesn’t do that,"" Johnson said.

One of the bill's sponsors, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., this morning called Johnson's claim is a ""red herring,"" saying that survivors of Epstein's abuse ""have always been in favor of this legislation."" He said that if the Senate wants to strengthen the bill's protections, ""that's fine with us.""

The current measure says that the attorney general ""may withhold or redact the segregable portions of records"" including those that contain ""personally identifiable information of victims,"" but it's not technically required.

Johnson also said the bill doesn't prohibit the release of child sexual abuse materials. ""We can't go for that,"" he said.

The speaker rejected the notion that his sudden support of the legislation is a reversal for him.

""No, it’s not a reversal,"" he said, adding that he had issues with the bill's language since the beginning of the process. ""I’ve been for maximum transparency, but again, there’s a reason you have rules and processes here to ensure that this is not done haphazardly, and I was not satisfied.""

Top Trump super PAC to start TV ads in Tennessee special election

The top outside group aligned with Trump’s political operation is starting TV ads in a deep-red House special election in Tennessee to boost the Republican contender there.

The super PAC MAGA Inc. has placed more than $200,000 of TV and radio ads so far to support Republican Matt Van Epps in the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, according to ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Trump carried the district by 22 points in 2024. Then-GOP Rep. Mark Green resigned earlier this year, triggering the special election.

MAGA Inc. jumped into the race last week with more than $15,000 in phone-banking, its first spending on any election so far this year. That expense has grown to more than $100,000 so far, according to FEC filings.

Also last week, Trump held a tele-rally for Van Epps to energize Republicans as early voting began. Van Epps faces Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the Dec. 2 special general election.

What to expect from Trump's meeting with Saudi crown prince

As Trump meets with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman today at the White House, a senior White House official says the two leaders are expected to discuss deals on America’s AI infrastructure, nuclear energy, and defense sales, as well as Saudi Arabia's commitment of $600 billion in investments.

Additionally, Trump has said the U.S. would sell Saudi Arabia F-35 fighter jets. The president also “hopes” that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords, the official said.

Saudi crown prince arrives at the White House

Upon his arrival at the White House, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was greeted with a ceremony that included much more pomp and circumstance than that given other world leaders so far this term.

The ceremony included a red carpet, a color guard on horseback carrying Saudi and U.S. flags, and the Marine band playing live from the Truman Balcony.

The crown prince's visit marks the first time he has returned to the White House since 2018, after the CIA concluded that he directly ordered the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Trump greeted him outside the South Portico of the White House, where Vice President JD Vance and Secretaries Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, Scott Bessent, Howard Lutnick, Chris Wright and chief of staff Susie Wiles were also present.

After a flyover of F-35s, the two leaders entered the White House and went to the West Colonnade, where Trump could be seen showing off the newly installed Presidential Walk of Fame — a display of presidential portraits — to the crown prince.

The leaders then posed for a photo in front of U.S. and Saudi flags before entering the Oval Office.

Working Families Party to support primary challenger to Sen. John Fetterman

Pennsylvania’s Working Families Party is making plans to support a primary challenge to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman when he is up for re-election.

The state party announced today that it plans to start recruiting “working class leaders into a candidate pipeline” as well as volunteers and raise money for a challenge in 2028.

“We deserve real working class leadership in the U.S. Senate. Senator Fetterman has sold us out, and that’s why the Pennsylvania Working Families Party is committed to recruiting and supporting a primary challenge to him in 2028,” Shoshanna Israel, the mid-Atlantic political director of the Working Families Party, said in a statement.

Israel also wrote that Pennsylvanians “deserve a Senator who won’t enable Trump or vote with Republicans to rip health care away from over 400,000 of our neighbors.”

NBC10 reached out Fetterman’s office for a comment and has not yet received a response.

Trump’s Gaza peace plan wins global backing. Now comes the hard part.

To hear Trump tell it, this was “one of the biggest approvals in the history of the United Nations,” a “moment of true historic proportion” that would “ lead to further peace all over the world.” But the gravity of the United Nations Security Council’s endorsement of the U.S. Gaza plan raised renewed questions today over how it will actually work.

Most pressingly, it is not clear whether those at the heart of this conflict — the Palestinians and the Israelis themselves — actually support its end goals.

Hamas, which still controls around half of the strip, outright rejected the resolution and said it robs Palestinians of their own agency, effectively allowing Trump free reign over the Gaza Strip for the next two years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed its passage, but previously said he rejects its talk of “Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”

On a practical level, the proposal says it will require the creation of several as-yet-non-existent bodies, including the “Board of Peace” headed by Trump, and the International Stabilization Force, or ISF, whose troops could be drawn from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and as far away as Indonesia.

House could vote today on a resolution of disapproval for Rep. Chuy Garcia

The House could vote today on a resolution by Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., to disapprove of Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., over his ploy to handpick the successor for his congressional seat.

Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, offered a motion to table Gluesenkamp Perez’s resolution, which would have effectively killed the effort. But the tabling motion was defeated 206-211, with Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, joining Gluesenkamp Perez in voting against it.

After the tabling vote, Gluesenkamp Perez debated Democrats who support Garcia.

“And the question at hand is, do we condone a subversion of an election because it is playing by the rules?” she said on the House floor. “That’s not what we’re here to do.”

Garcia rose to speak, saying he “wasn’t expecting to stand here to debate my retirement.” He said he “decided that it was time to dedicate more of my time to the people who have sacrificed the most,” listing his wife, children and grandchildren. He said he wanted to focus on helping his wife manage her multiple sclerosis, as well as take care of his grandson whom he and his wife adopted following the death of their daughter.

Gluesenkamp Perez responded: “I feel deeply for the sacrifice that it’s taken him to serve his community. That does not legitimize the way in which he left his seat and choosing his successor and refusing to be forthright with his constituents.”

Massie warns Senate not to 'muck' up Epstein bill

Massie warned the Senate to not ""muck"" up the Epstein bill after it passes the House.

“It may be tempting for them to get cute and to do things that will limit the release of these documents,” Massie said. “They are afraid that people will be embarrassed. Well, that’s the whole point here. They need to be brought to justice, and embarrassment is no reason to stop it.”

Massie also criticized the nearly two-month delay in newly elected Rep. Adelita Grijalva's swearing-in, which prevented him and other supporters of the bill from getting enough signatures to force the chamber to vote on it. He added that he thought in holding the vote on the bill, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ""wants to save face.""

Virginia Giuffre's brother calls her 'a beacon of hope' in emotional remarks

Sky Roberts, the brother of Epstein survivor Virginia Giuffre, delivered emotional remarks about his late sister, saying that she became ""a beacon of hope"" for other survivors of sexual assault and that tactics to silence his sister ""did not work.""

""Virginia's story is one that should have been filled with promise,"" Roberts said. ""But instead, it became a harrowing tale of exploitation and survival.""

Giuffre, who by suicide earlier this year, was one of the most prominent survivors of Epstein’s abuse. Since her death, her brother has become an advocate for his sister's legacy.

""The most destructive wound they inflicted was that of forced complicity, a betrayal of self that was crafted by her abusers,"" Roberts said, who paused at times during his remarks to hold back tears. ""But I stand here today declare that their tactics of fear and intimidation did not work.""

""Virginia’s spirit could not be broken,"" Roberts said. ""She became a beacon of hope, a warrior, fighting not just for herself, but for every survivor who suffered in silence.""

Epstein survivor criticizes Trump's focus on Democrats' relationships with Epstein, calls his actions 'a national embarrassment'

Epstein survivor Jena-Lisa Jones strongly criticized Trump for directing the Justice Department to investigate Epstein’s connections to prominent Democrats and others.

“I beg you, President Trump: Please stop making this political,” Jones said. “It is not about you, President Trump. You are our president. Please start acting like it. Show some class, show some real leadership, show that you actually care about the people other than yourself.”

Jones said she voted for Trump, but added “your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.”

“It is time to take the honest, moral ground and support the release of these files, not to weaponize pieces of the files against random political enemies that did nothing wrong, but to understand who Epstein’s friends were, who covered for him, what financial institutions allowed his trafficking to continue, who knew what he was doing but was too much of a coward to do anything about it,” she said.

Reached for comment on the speakers' criticisms of Trump, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson repeated the president's claim that “Democrats and the media knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them while President Trump was calling for transparency, and is now delivering on it with thousands of pages of documents as part of the ongoing Oversight investigation.”

But before his dramatic reversal on the release of the files last weekend, Trump had called the push to release the files a ""hoax"" and criticized those who continued to focus on Epstein. Survivors and a group of lawmakers are also still pushing for the release of private Epstein files held by the administration.

Epstein survivor delivers message to Trump: 'I am traumatized, I am not stupid'

Haley Robson, a survivor of Epstein, began her remarks by noting that while people see the survivors as adults, she emphasized they were fighting for themselves and other victims as the children who were left behind, showing a picture of herself as a child.

Robson thanked the lawmakers championing the effort, saying that to watch Republicans going against their party and risking their careers was ""unbelievable to watch.""

Robson said that if Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who supported the vote to release the Justice Department's Epstein case files, decided to read names of people connected to Epstein on the House floor, she would stand next to her.

Robson delivered a message to Trump, saying she was ""skeptical"" of his ""agenda,"" even though he flipped his stance on the House vote.

""I am traumatized, I am not stupid,"" she said in her message to Trump. She said he had put them through ""so much stress.""Reached for comment on speakers’ criticisms of Trump, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson provided a statement repeating Trump's claim that “Democrats and the media knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them while President Trump was calling for transparency, and is now delivering on it with thousands of pages of documents as part of the ongoing Oversight investigation.”

But before his dramatic reversal on the release of the files last weekend, Trump had called the push to release the files a “hoax“ and criticized those who continued to focus on Epstein. Survivors and a group of lawmakers are also still pushing for the release of private Epstein files held by the administration.

Epstein survivors press conference begins

Reps. Ro Khanna, Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene each thanked Epstein survivors and lawmakers who supported efforts to release the Epstein files.

Greene, who had a public rift with Trump over the files, talked about being called a ""traitor"" by the president. She emphasized that a traitor is someone who serves foreign countries and themselves, but a patriot serves the country and people like ""the women standing behind me.""

She predicted a unanimous vote in the House to release the files, but said ""the real test will be will the Department of Justice release the files,"" or would the files be ""tied up"" in investigations.

Trump says he won’t rule out sending troops into Venezuela

Trump says he has not ruled out putting American forces on the ground in Venezuela, but he’s also holding out the possibility he’d speak with the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, whom the administration accuses of running a cartel, an allegation Maduro denies.

House is expected to vote on the Epstein files bill around 2 p.m.

The House is set to vote around 2 p.m. on the bill that would compel the Justice Department to release files related to the Epstein case.

The bill needs the support of two-thirds of the House members because the legislation is being considered under suspension of the rules, an expedited process typically used when a measure is expected to have enough votes to advance. Typically, a discharge petition like the one a majority of House members used to force the vote on the bill would require seven legislative days of waiting.

“Almost everybody” will vote for the legislation, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told NBC News last night, adding that leaders aren’t telling members how to vote.

If passed, the bill would head next to the Senate.

Immigration arrests in Charlotte have sparked fears, leading businesses to close

Jonathan Ocampo has called this Southern city home for six years, but, after immigration enforcement descended here over the weekend, the American citizen of Colombian descent said he doesn’t leave the house without his U.S. passport.

“I’m carrying it here right now, which is sad,” he told NBC News. Ocampo said he worries that his father, a citizen who has been in the country for 40 years, could be targeted because of being Hispanic-looking and speaking what he described as very broken English.

“It’s just scary,” he said.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 130 people have been arrested since Border Patrol began an immigration enforcement push it calls “Operation Charlotte’s Web” on Saturday, putting many residents and business owners of the state’s largest city on edge. A popular Latino bakery was closed Monday over fears of Border Patrol activity. Several small businesses in a shopping center also shut their doors Monday after immigration authorities were seen smashing the car window of a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, Willy Aceituno, over the weekend.

Rep. Thomas Massie warns new DOJ investigations could prevent the release of more Epstein docs

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who spearheaded the Epstein discharge petition, suggested last evening that new Justice Department probes Trump directed to explore Epstein’s ties to other high-profile figures could block the release of more documents.

“I’m concerned that now he’s opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That’s my concern,” Massie told reporters outside the Capitol.

“I’m afraid they’re going to try to use a provision of the law that allows you not to release these materials if they’re subject of an ongoing investigation and would harm, the release of which would harm the ongoing investigation,” he added.

Trump directed the Justice Department on Friday to investigate Epstein’s ties to notable Democrats.

Asked about Trump encouraging Republicans to vote for Massie’s measure — a sudden reversal of his position on releasing the Epstein files — Massie said it’s because “for four months, [Trump] thought the best thing for him was to keep the file secret, and somebody convinced him that the best thing for him was to release the files.”

“If they’re serious about it, they should release them right now. It’s that simple,” he said.

Trump encouraged House Republicans over the weekend to pass the measure, saying, “We have nothing to hide.”

As for how the vote today will go, Massie predicted his bill will pass with a veto-proof majority.

Zelenskyy, U.S. envoy will visit Turkey in a new bid to end the Russia-Ukraine war

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that he will travel to Turkey this week in an attempt to jump-start negotiations on ending Russia’s invasion, which began nearly four years ago.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff will join him in Turkey, a senior Turkish official told The Associated Press, but the Kremlin said that Russia won’t be sending anyone.

Turkey provided a setting for low-level talks between Ukraine and Russia earlier this year, though the only significant progress in Istanbul was on exchanging prisoners of war. U.S.-led international peace efforts have brought no breakthrough, either.

Zelenskyy said that he would be in Turkey tomorrow, a day after visiting Spain, where he hoped for pledges of new support today.

“We are preparing to reinvigorate negotiations, and we have developed solutions that we will propose to our partners,” Zelenskyy said on social media, without providing details. “Doing everything possible to bring the end of the war closer is Ukraine’s top priority.”

Heavy new American sanctions on Russia’s all-important oil industry, devised to push Putin to the negotiating table, are due to take effect Friday. The sanctions against oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil seek to starve Putin’s war machine of cash and halt its grinding war of attrition, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives in Ukraine.

‘I am deeply ashamed’: Larry Summers to step back from public commitments after new Epstein emails

Larry Summers, who was treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, said yesterday that he will be stepping back from public commitments following the recent publication of his correspondence with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said in a statement.

The House Oversight Committee last week released more than 20,000 emails from Epstein’s estate, which included extensive correspondence between the disgraced financier and Summers. The most recent one was from the day before Epstein was arrested in 2019.

“While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me,” Summers added in his statement.

Hundreds of federalized National Guard members are set to leave Illinois and Oregon

Hundreds of federalized National Guard members sent to Illinois and Oregon will return to their home states as early as this week, a defense official told NBC News yesterday.

The official said that 200 California National Guard members activated for the greater Portland area will head back home, leaving 100 members of the Oregon National Guard in place. In Illinois, 200 Texas National Guard members will depart the state, leaving 300 Illinois Guard members there.

The remaining guards will be conducting training, but are not on mission to protect federal property or personnel.

Saudi crown prince returns to U.S. for first time after diplomatic isolation

Whether viewed as a visionary reformist or a murderous despot, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, will be taking a huge step toward rejoining the international community when he meets with Trump at the White House today.

Crown Prince Mohammed, 40, became an international pariah after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government, in 2018, though Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.

Then-President Joe Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2022 and controversially fist-bumped him, an image that went viral, at a time when most leaders had shunned the crown prince. The crown prince said in 2019 that he took “full responsibility” for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch, but denied ordering it.

But it is the crown prince’s trip today, his first during Trump’s second term, that will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.

House poised to pass a bill to force the release of the Epstein files in a bipartisan vote

The House is poised to vote overwhelmingly today for legislation to compel the Justice Department to release all its records related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a major victory for the lawmakers in both parties who’ve been leading the push for months.

The measure, which last week secured enough bipartisan support to head straight to the House floor, got another boost over the weekend, when Trump reversed his position and urged Republicans to support it.

The bipartisan duo who co-authored the legislation — Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif. — are working to secure a veto-proof majority in the House, and they predict that as many as 100 Republicans could vote for it. The number could climb even higher now that Trump has given his blessing.

“Almost everybody” will vote for it, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told NBC News, adding that leaders aren’t telling members how to vote.

But when Mr. Chalco Chango’s son showed up, the agents arrested him, too.
Mr. Chalco Chango crossed the southern border into the United States with his son in 2023.
In his declaration to the court, Mr. Chalco Chango described, in vivid detail, feeling helpless while in isolation in the jail.","For at least five days, a blind Ecuadorean man who was arrested this month in New York City by U.S. immigration authorities was held in isolation at a county jail, locked in his cell for 24 hours a day and deprived of his cane.

“I feel so terrible I cannot see and that I cannot walk, read or do things on my own,” Carlos Anibal Chalco Chango, 40, said last week in a declaration prepared by his lawyers based on their conversations with him.

On Monday night, after days of pressure from the lawyers, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency relented: Mr. Chalco Chango was released from the Orange County jail in upstate New York. It was a surprising move by an agency that rarely releases detainees under President Trump.

The two-week effort by his lawyers to free him came amid pitched legal battles playing out across the United States, as lawyers file emergency motions to have ICE release migrants who are being subjected to mandatory detention.

Unlike Mr. Chalco Chango, many of the more than 60,000 immigrants in detention don’t have lawyers. Most are forced to fight deportation alone, leaving many to consider the Trump administration’s offers to leave the country voluntarily to avoid months in jail.

What distinguished the Ecuadorean man’s case was his disability.

ICE agents arrested Mr. Chalco Chango on Nov. 4 as he was leaving his home in Corona, Queens, an immigrant-rich neighborhood where advocates and local officials have documented an increase in arrests of mostly Hispanic men this month.

The federal immigration agents were seeking to arrest Mr. Chalco Chango’s 20-year-old son, and they approached the older man to show him a picture of their “intended target” on a cellphone, according to government filings.

Mr. Chalco Chango told them that he was blind and could not see the image, according to his lawyers, who said the agents pushed him against a wall, handcuffed him and put him inside a car. An agent told him in Spanish to call his son and tell him to turn himself in, his lawyers said. Then, the agent said, Mr. Chalco Chango would be free to go.

But when Mr. Chalco Chango’s son showed up, the agents arrested him, too. Both men were whisked away to 26 Federal Plaza, the ICE offices in Lower Manhattan, setting off the legal saga to release him.

The federal government said in filings that the agents had “engaged in a consensual conversation” with Mr. Chalco Chango, who they said “freely admitted to the officers” that he had no legal status.

Mr. Chalco Chango crossed the southern border into the United States with his son in 2023. Border Patrol agents who encountered them released them to seek asylum, according to filings.

After his Nov. 4 arrest, Mr. Chalco Chango was placed in a holding cell at 26 Federal Plaza, where he was barred from having his cane or using a text-to-audio phone app that could help him read legal documents.

After a judge, Andrew L. Carter Jr. of Manhattan federal court, ruled that Mr. Chalco Chango could not be removed from the country, ICE moved him on Nov. 8 to the Orange County jail.

There, officials said they had “serious concerns” about safely accommodating him in the jail’s general population because of his blindness, according to a court filing by the office of Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

In a letter on Monday informing Judge Carter of Mr. Chalco Chango’s release, the government said it considered the case moot, a suggestion that no further proceedings over his detention were necessary. The judge directed the parties to send him a joint letter by Thursday addressing whether they agreed that the case was moot, though Mr. Chalco Chango’s separate immigration case still appears unresolved.

Paige Austin and Harold A. Solis, lawyers at Make the Road New York, an advocacy group representing Mr. Chalco Chango, said in an interview on Tuesday that they wanted assurances from ICE that their client would not be detained in the future.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In his declaration to the court, Mr. Chalco Chango described, in vivid detail, feeling helpless while in isolation in the jail.

He thought his cell might have a clock, he said, but he could not see it. He could, however, detect when people were outside the cell by the shadows they cast.

So when he saw shadows, he added, “I try to ask through the door — what time is it?”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/18/multimedia/18met-immigrant-blind-pzqf/18met-immigrant-blind-pzqf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 18:58:06.598598

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.

Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.

""Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,"" the proposal states.

Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.

""This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,"" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. ""By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.""

Politics of social safety net programs

The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.

People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.

Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.

U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.

Executive order targeted benefits

In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""

Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.

Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.

Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a ""public charge"" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.

In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision. It meant that using benefits such as the SNAP, housing aid or transportation vouchers would not count against green card applicants.

Topline:

The man accused of igniting a fire that led to the deadly and destructive Palisades Fire in January will remain in custody without bond, U.S. Judge Rozella Oliver decided Tuesday in Los Angeles. Jonathan Rinderknecht has been in custody since his arrest in Florida on Oct. 7.

Where things stand: Rinderknecht was indicted by a federal grand jury in October and is charged with one count of arson, one count of timber set afire and one count of destruction of property by means of fire. Rinderknecht pleaded not guilty in mid-October and faces anywhere from five to 45 years in federal prison if convicted. His trial is set to begin April 21, 2026. His lawyers recently asked the court to allow him out of custody as he awaits trial.

Argument against release: In a filing on Monday, prosecutors said Rinderknecht is a flight risk because of his familial ties to France, as well as a danger to the community. The filing states that Rinderknecht threatened to burn down his sister’s home and that he purchased a gun and threatened to kill his brother-in-law. Prosecutors also raised the fact that a judge determined in October that the suspect’s mental health had declined.

The allegations: Authorities allege Rinderknecht set fire to brush near the Skull Rock Trailhead in the Santa Monica Mountains at around midnight Jan. 1, starting the Lachman Fire. Though the fire was held to just 8 acres and was believed to have been extinguished, authorities say it flared up once again amid strong, dry winds a week later. That fire grew into the Palisades Fire, which killed 12 people and destroyed more than 6,800 structures.

Go deeper: How could the Palisades Fire have reignited after a week? Experts explain

California law requires banks to let homeowners delay their mortgage payments for up to one year as they recover from the January fires. But that period rapidly is coming to a close, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass says the timeline should be much longer.

On Tuesday, Bass asked mortgage companies to voluntarily extend relief for another three years, which would bring the total forbearance period to four years after the Palisades and Eaton fires destroyed thousands of homes.

“Many impacted residents remain in temporary housing and face mounting financial strain,” Bass said in a news release. “They're piecing life together while having to negotiate with contractors and wait for insurance claims to come through.

""Asking them to shoulder mortgage payments on top of all that would force them into an impossible — and unacceptable — choice.”

How mortgage relief currently works

Under Assembly Bill 238, signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September, homeowners affected by the Palisades or Eaton fires can request mortgage forbearance for up to 12 months. The law extended a previous 90-day forbearance period that banks agreed to honor after the fires.

Bass’ office said she wants the banks to agree to let homeowners take another three years of deferred payments and put them on the back end of their mortgage.

The mayor also is requesting that banks refrain from charging fees or penalties and leave mortgage holders’ credit scores unaffected by the extended relief period.

‘This is not like a free lunch’

Richard Green, director of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, said he’s not sure Bass will convince banks to agree to these terms. And he said homeowners would need to closely scrutinize any relief plan.

Depending on the details around interest payments, he said, some homeowners could exit the forbearance period owing more on their mortgage than their property is worth.

“Consumers would have to understand that this is not like a free lunch,” Green said.

He compared Bass’ proposal to President Donald Trump’s recent suggestion about creating a 50-year mortgage to address nationwide housing affordability concerns. Both plans adjust financing terms without tackling the fundamental reason housing costs so much, he said.

“It's not a great deal,” Green said. “We need to be able to build more housing faster, whether it's in the aftermath of a disaster or not.”

Temporary relocation money is running out

Last month, a nonprofit group called Department of Angels released a survey of thousands of fire survivors that found about 80% of residents displaced by the Eaton Fire and about 90% of those displaced by the Palisades Fire still have not returned to their previous homes.

Many now are paying rent for temporary housing in addition to their regular mortgage payment. The survey found that within the next year, 23% of Altadena residents and 29% of Pacific Palisades residents will run out of insurance payments that cover the cost of that new rent.

The Trump administration unveiled a sweeping plan Tuesday to sidestep Congress and outsource large pieces of the U.S. Department of Education, telling lawmakers and staff that it would shift work dedicated to, among other things, elementary and secondary education, postsecondary education and Indian education to other federal agencies.

All three of those offices were originally placed at the department by Congress when it created the agency in 1979, and these moves are being made without Congress' consent.

According to two people who were briefed on the plan by the Trump administration, and who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, the administration has forged six new agreements between the Education Department and other agencies, offloading day-to-day operations of congressionally-required programs while retaining a small contingent of staff at the department.

For example, under these new agreements, much of the work of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, which includes managing Title I, a key federal funding stream that helps schools support low-income students, would shift to the U.S. Department of Labor, as would much of the work of the Office of Postsecondary Education.

The U.S. Department of the Interior would take on much of the work of the department's Office of Indian Education.

The U.S. Department of State would take on international education and foreign language studies programming.

Responsibility for the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) program, which offers childcare on college campuses to low-income student-parents, would move to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

In a USA Today op-ed published Sunday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon wrote of this kind of agreement: ""We'll peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage programs and empowering states and local leaders to oversee the rest. These partnerships are commonplace across the federal government to improve service delivery and increase efficiency.""

In July, the Education Department announced one such agreement with the Labor Department, in which Labor took on responsibility for adult education and family literacy programs previously administered by the Education Department, though an Education Department release insisted, ""The programs will be managed alongside [Education Department] staff, with continued leadership and oversight by [the Education Department].""

Tuesday's agreements do not include a handful of the department's signature responsibilities, including special education, student civil rights enforcement and student loans.

Opponents of the administration's move say, given that Congress created these offices and explicitly located them inside the Education Department, the White House cannot legally move their work without Congress' approval.

U.S. Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a senior member of the Senate education committee, said in a statement, ""This is an outright illegal effort to continue dismantling the Department of Education, and it is students and families who will suffer the consequences as key programs that help students learn to read or that strengthen ties between schools and families are spun off to agencies with little to no relevant expertise and are gravely weakened—or even completely broken—in the process.""

In briefing lawmakers and staff, the department insisted that these programs' statutory responsibilities would remain at the department, even if the work would be done elsewhere.

It's unclear if retaining a modicum of department staff, in partnership with other agencies, will be enough to convince the courts the administration is following federal law.

According to NPR's two sources, the briefing was led by Lindsey Burke, now deputy chief of staff for policy and programs at the department, who also co-authored the education section of the conservative government blueprint, Project 2025, outlining how to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.

""The federal Department of Education should be eliminated. When power is exercised, it should empower students and families, not government,"" Burke wrote.

There will likely be legal challenges opposing Tuesday's moves.

While most soldiers carried religious items on them, as a young Army officer deployed overseas, I had a pocket U.S. Constitution in the lining of my helmet because I believed so deeply in the values I swore an oath to defend.

""I had a pocket U.S. Constitution in the lining of my helmet because I believed so deeply in the values I swore an oath to defend.""

This year marks the 250th birthday of the Army, Marines, and Navy. We can’t let our armed forces, which were created to defend our liberties, devolve into an arm of someone’s political pursuits. But that’s what we have seen take place this year. President Donald Trump and his administration have sent troops into our communities and enacted policies that roll back civil rights progress.

Already we’ve seen President Trump federalize National Guard troops and other service members to cities under the guise of keeping communities safe. Often, this is happening without the consent of state governors and officials. As a veteran, I am working every day to stop this abuse of power.

Military Troops Do Not Belong on Our Streets

I’m joining the dozens of veterans on Capitol Hill for the same reason I first joined the military years ago: to protect and defend the Constitution. The oath didn’t end when I took off my uniform, and as commander in chief, President Trump also took an oath to protect the Constitution.

In the United States, the federal military should not be used for domestic law enforcement. That is a fundamental principle embodied in the Posse Comitatus Act, one that helps separate our democracy from dictatorships abroad. History shows what happens when we cross that line. The tragedy at Ohio’s Kent State University in 1970, when National Guard troops shot at student demonstrators, proves that putting military troops in our communities can result in disastrous consequences. National Guard troops should be reserved for genuine emergencies, not deployed to our cities to serve the president’s political whims. Kent State continues to serve as a reminder of what happens when we comingle military troops and policing of civilians.

President Trump’s ongoing use of militarized force is not about safety; it’s about asserting power. Over the summer, his administration sent troops and armed federal agents into Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. His administration continues to threaten to send them to Chicago, and Portland despite objections from city and state leaders.

Military troops -- and armed federal agents in masks who appropriate military uniforms -- do not make our communities safer or safeguard our rights. These deployments erode the public’s trust in a non-partisan military when our neighbors struggle to understand why troops are patrolling their communities, or to distinguish between National Guard and federal agents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents often wear military-style uniforms or gear, creating confusion that further erodes public trust. True safety comes from strong and supported communities, not from local militarization. That’s why so many veterans, active-duty service members, and military families have joined the ACLU and others in condemning these dangerous and escalatory actions.

The Politicization of the Military Must Stop

Time and again, we’ve seen how, when the military crosses the line to civilian law enforcement, the fabric of our democracy decays. The Trump administration’s dangerous misuse of the military does not begin or end with troops deployed to our cities. It extends to the politicization of the military itself.

In September, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth summoned hundreds of senior military leaders to Quantico and delivered remarks attacking the principles of equity and accountability. President Trump followed with a disturbing address urging troops to use U.S. cities as “training grounds” to fight the “enemy within.” These are not the words of leaders strengthening national defense; this is a weaponization of the military that threatens our Constitution.

Secretary Hegseth’s agenda goes further. He has moved to weaken service members’ ability to report assault, harassment, and discrimination. He also called for combat standards to “return to the highest male standard,” even though all combat roles have been gender-neutral since 2016. He spent his first months in office purging the highest levels of the military of women leaders and Black senior officers, as well as axing the Women, Peace, and Security Program that was started in the president’s first term.

As one of the few women who served in a combat arms role before it officially opened up, these attempts to dismantle progress towards the military becoming more welcoming are barbaric. The strength of our military has always come from its professionalism and unity of purpose, not from political loyalty. When leaders use the armed forces to promote a partisan political agenda, they betray the values our service members swear to defend.

When we plague the military with politics, we reduce the effectiveness of a force that is supposed to be ready for real emergencies. Our troops deserve leadership that values service to the Constitution over service to any specific president. It’s what we took an oath to do.

How We Can Act

America must be a place where everyone is safe in their neighborhoods and free to speak their minds. When troops are on our streets, we make one of our founders’ biggest fears – that a leader will send his army to police the people – a dangerous reality. Congress must act now to protect our freedoms by pulling troops out of our cities. It has the power to restrict any future deployments into our cities.

I stand with the veterans on Capitol Hill. We must lawfully protest troops on our streets and end the politicization of the military. I know my fellow veterans are not alone in asking our government to do right by our troops. All Americans must join together, on Capitol Hill and beyond, to urge the Trump administration to withdraw federal troops from our neighborhoods now.

Today, we sent a message to Congress in person doing exactly that. We urged them to co-sponsor the Military in Law Enforcement Accountability Act in the Senate and the National Guard Proper Use Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. These are vital steps to curbing the president’s ability to deploy National Guard troops for improper domestic law enforcement.

I am proud of my service to this country. Most of all, I want to ensure our military remains a respected institution in service to the people, not a single president, for the next 250 years.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/11/veteran-op-ed-social.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 17:56:44.116627

Trump and members of his administration had sought to undermine efforts to release the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. And Trump has been dismissive of the push to make the files public, calling the case “pretty boring stuff” in July and repeatedly referring to it as a Democratic “hoax.”

Then, on November 16, he told House Republicans to vote in favour of the release.

His shift came after lawmakers cleared a significant hurdle on November 12, netting 218 signatures on a petition to force a vote on a bill to release the files within 30 days. The House is expected to vote on that bill this week. Previously, it was considered unlikely the legislation would pass in the Senate; it remains to be seen whether Trump’s latest statement will cause senators to reconsider.

Epstein moved in the same social circles as Trump in the 1990s, including attending parties at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private Palm Beach, Florida, club. The two were photographed together in social settings multiple times. They later had a falling out, a rift that some reporters dated to late 2007.

Palm Beach County prosecutors investigated Epstein after reports that a 14-year-old girl was molested at his mansion. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges related to soliciting prostitution from someone under 18. He received preferential treatment during the criminal investigation and served about a year in jail, largely on work release.

In 2018, The Miami Herald published an extensive investigation into the case, and the next year, Epstein was arrested on federal charges for recruiting dozens of underage girls to his New York City mansion and Palm Beach estate from 2002 to 2005 to engage in sex acts for money. He was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, and investigators concluded he died by suicide.

We asked the White House why Trump changed his stance on releasing the files. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, “President Trump has been consistently calling for transparency related to the Epstein files for years – by releasing tens of thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request” and calling for investigations into “Epstein’s Democrat friends”.

Here’s what Trump has said in 2024 and 2025 about releasing the Epstein files.

While campaigning in 2024, Trump said he would release the files

In June 2024, Fox and Friends co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy asked Trump if he would declassify various files, including those related to 9/11 and former President John F Kennedy.

“Would you declassify the Epstein files?” Campos-Duffy said.

“Yeah, yeah, I would,” Trump said.

The clip spread on social media, and Trump’s campaign account also shared it.

During the same interview, Trump also said, “I guess I would.” He added, “You don’t want to affect people’s lives if it’s phoney stuff in there because there is a lot of phoney stuff with that whole world, but I think I would.”

On a September 2024 episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, during a discussion about releasing some of the Epstein documents, Trump said, “Yeah, I’d certainly take a look at it.” He added that he’d be “inclined” to do it and said, “I’d have no problem with it.”

In 2025, Trump was dismissive of the Epstein files

Early in the second Trump administration, Trump officials – including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, who became the FBI director – said they supported releasing the files.

In late February at a White House event, Bondi released what she called the “first phase” of “declassified Epstein files” to conservative influencers. It largely consisted of documents that had already been made public.

In a July 12 Truth Social post, Trump expressed frustration about the Epstein files. Speaking to reporters on July 15 on the White House lawn, Trump said the files “were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by Biden.” We rated that claim Pants on Fire.

Trump said the FBI should focus on investigating other issues, such as voter fraud, and that his administration should “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about”.

In a July 16 interview with Real America’s Voice, a conservative outlet, Trump said, “I think in the case of Epstein, they’ve already looked at it and they are looking at it and I think all they have to do is put out anything credible. But you know, that was run by the Biden administration for four years.”

On August 22, a reporter asked Trump if he was in favour of releasing the files.

“I’m in support of keeping it open,” he said. “Innocent people shouldn’t be hurt, but I’m in support of keeping it totally open. I couldn’t care less. You got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be, people – because he knew everybody in Palm Beach. I don’t know anything about that, but I have said to Pam (Bondi) and everybody else, give them everything you can give them because it’s a Democrat hoax.”

On September 3, a reporter asked Trump a question about efforts to release the Epstein files and if the Justice Department was protecting any friends or donors.

Trump said it was a “Democrat hoax that never ends” and “we’ve given thousands of pages of files”.

This month, Trump called for releasing the files

Trump came out in support of releasing the files after it became clear the House was headed in that direction.

The House Oversight Committee, on November 12, released about 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate.

Trump directed prosecutors to investigate Democrats and told Republicans to vote in favour of releasing the files.

Trump has often noted Epstein’s ties to former President Bill Clinton. In a November 14 Truth Social post, Trump asked the Justice Department to investigate Epstein’s involvement with Clinton.

Typically, prosecutors do not release files during an ongoing investigation, so Trump’s announcement raised questions about whether the Justice Department will withhold certain files even if Congress votes to release them.

When a reporter asked Trump on November 14 about releasing the files, he said, “I don’t care about it, released or not.”

Two days later, in a November 16 post, Trump said, “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.’’",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25198369121958-1-1763447150.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2025-11-18 19:57:19.705409

Partisan gerrymandering has generally been considered legal under court precedent, but dividing congressional maps along racial lines is considered a violation of the US Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

“The public perception of this case is that it’s about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics,” the court’s majority wrote in the opening of its 160-page opinion.

The ruling marked a major setback to efforts to redraw congressional districts ahead of the critically important midterms, which decide the composition of the US Congress.

All 435 seats in the House of Representatives will be up for grabs in that election. With Republicans holding a narrow 219-seat majority, analysts speculate that control of the chamber could potentially switch parties.

Texas, a Republican stronghold, had kicked off a nationwide race to redesign congressional districts in favour of one party or the other.

In June, news reports emerged that the administration of President Donald Trump had reached out to state officials to redraw the red state’s map, in order to gain five additional House seats for Republicans.

Despite hesitations and a walkout by state Democrats, the Texas legislature passed a new, gerrymandered map in August.

That inspired other right-leaning states, notably North Carolina and Missouri, to similarly redraw their districts. North Carolina and Missouri each passed a map that would gain Republicans one additional House seat.

Texas’s actions also sparked a Democratic backlash. California Governor Gavin Newsom spearheaded a ballot campaign in his heavily blue state to pass a proposition in November that would suspend an independent districting commission and instead pass a partisan map, skewed in favour of Democrats.

Voters passed the ballot initiative overwhelmingly in November, teeing up Democrats to gain five extra seats in California next year.

The state redistricting battle has sparked myriad legal challenges, including the one decided in Texas on Tuesday.

In that case, civil rights groups accused the Texas government of attempting to dilute the power of Black and Hispanic voters.

Judges David Guaderrama, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Jeffrey V Brown, a Trump appointee, wrote the majority decision in favour of the plaintiffs.

A third judge — Jerry Smith, appointed under Ronald Reagan — dissented from their decision.

Writing for the majority, Brown said that Trump official Harmeet Dhillon, the head of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, made the “legally incorrect assertion” that four congressional districts in the state were “unconstitutional” because they had non-white majorities.

The letter Dhillon sent containing that assertion helped prompt the Texas redistricting fight, Brown argued.

The judge also pointed to statements Texas Governor Greg Abbott made, seeming to reference the racial composition of the districts. If the new map’s aims were purely partisan and not racial, Brown indicated that it was curious no majority-white districts were targeted.

Tuesday’s ruling restores the 2021 map of Texas congressional districts. Currently, the state is represented by 25 Republicans and 12 Democrats in the US House.

Already, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has pledged to appeal the ruling before the US Supreme Court.

“The radical left is once again trying to undermine the will of the people. The Big Beautiful Map was entirely legal and passed for partisan purposes to better represent the political affiliations of Texas,” Paxton wrote in a statement posted to social media.

He expressed optimism about his odds before the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. “I fully expect the Court to uphold Texas’s sovereign right to engage in partisan redistricting.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25322660177919-1763495102.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-18 21:57:01.864931

Immigration officials respond to Bro-Tex in St. Paul

What we know:

According to reports from the scene from Pioneer Press reporter Frederick Melo, at least one person was removed from a building by federal agents, and a chemical irritant was deployed as protesters ""swarmed"" authorities outside Bro-Tex Inc. in St. Paul.

Video from the scene shared by 50501 Minnesota and Women's March Minnesota on social media features a lot of screaming and yelling, and as federal officials try to leave, protesters try to stop them. Officials physical interacted with protesters, and at least one protester threw an item at a departing vehicle.

A St. Paul City Council staffer confirmed to FOX 9 that federal agents on scene included the FBI, ICE, DEA and HSI (Homeland Security Investigations). St. Paul and Ramsey County were not there nor involved.

Federal agents had cleared the scene prior to noon on Tuesday. A spokesperson for ICE confirmed their investigation to FOX 9 Tuesday afternoon:

""Today in St. Paul, ICE HSI and law enforcement partners conducted court authorized law enforcement activity and served a search warrant in furtherance of a federal criminal investigation. There is no threat to public safety, and the investigation remains ongoing at this time.""

Mayor Carter statement on ICE operations

What they're saying:

Mayor Carter released a statement on Tuesday afternoon calling the federal response ""ICE operations."" The mayor is in ""close communication"" with the city attorney's office and St. Paul Police Department.

""Though we don't have many details right now, I share the concern and fear this raises for our workers, families and entire community,"" Carter said in the statement. ""Remember you have rights.""

At the scene of the ICE operations earlier on Tuesday, Mayor Carter, giving an example of similar raids around the country, said federal agents ""grab a roofing crew"" and are doing so without warrants. It's unclear what happened in Tuesday morning's incident.

The City of St. Paul has immigration resources available on its website.

St. Paul council member demands transparency

What they're saying:

Molly Coleman is on the St. Paul City Council and represents Ward 4, where Tuesday's raid involving federal agents took place. She joined FOX 9's All Day to give her account of the events, and is seeking transparency. She says city officials started to hear about a large federal enforcement mobilization early in the morning. Their initial information suggested it was not an ICE raid, but a lawful, permissible enforcement.

Coleman says the scene escalated due to the size of the law enforcement response and the force they used. The injuries suffered by community members and protesters were largely due to chemical irritants. Some people were shoved to the ground by agents. Coleman says she doesn't know where some community members are, and why others have been detained. She said at least three were placed in a vehicle and detained.

Coleman says they want transparency on what happened, and why.

""As a St. Paul City Council member, if I call the federal government and say tell me where you took our people, they’re not answering, they’re not calling me back. That’s true for elected officials throughout the state at all levels of government,"" Coleman said. ""I think it’s immensely concerning we have a federal government that is so uninterested in telling the truth to the people of St. Paul. It’s a very difficult and troubling situation.""

MN lawmakers react to ICE raid

Local perspective:

The Minnesota House's St. Paul delegation released the following statement following Tuesday's federal response in St. Paul:

""This morning, we have been monitoring incidents with federal agents in our city. We have been in contact with local law enforcement and elected leaders, and we will continue to work with them to protect our community.

""To all our constituents in St. Paul, we want to say: be a good neighbor, take precautions, know your constitutional and civil rights, document any incidents with federal law enforcement, and make sure you protect yourself. If you find yourself in need of assistance, please contact local law enforcement or get in touch with community organizations. Always remember that you have rights.""

Immigration Defense Network to hold vigil on Wednesday

What's next:

In a press release on Tuesday, the Immigration Defense Network said it will hold an ""urgent community vigil"" and press availability at 9 a.m. on Wednesday outside Bro-Tex in response to what happened Tuesday morning.

The Immigrant Defense Network on Tuesday afternoon said federal agents ""stormed"" a workplace, ""detained workers, deployed chemical irritants,"" adding that Tuesday's ""escalation was unacceptable"" because workers were taken from their jobs.

""What happened today is not law enforcement — it is an assault on our community,"" said a representative from the Immigrant Defense Network on Tuesday. ""No one should fear that simply going to work, providing for their family, or standing up for their neighbors will result in federal agents storming a workplace, detaining people en masse, and deploying chemical weapons against Minnesotans.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/11/1280/720/st-paul-protest-ice.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-11-18 16:57:33.396084

Standing outside the Capitol, some of the survivors directed their remarks at Mr. Trump.
In their upside-down telling, Mr. Trump had consistently fought for the release of the Epstein files.
She added, “These are your average Americans.” She said the Epstein files represented the “failures” of the government and Congress to their citizens.
And rightfully so.” Some of Ms. Greene’s colleagues were more interested in simply falling in line, as usual, with Mr. Trump.","Attention now turns to the Senate, which had been keeping the Epstein issue at arm’s length but now plans to take up and pass the bill this week, clearing it for Mr. Trump’s signature. The president, who toiled for months to derail the bill but reversed himself once it was clear it would pass overwhelmingly, has said he would sign it.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said his chamber would move quickly — and probably unanimously — on the bill without considering any changes.

“When a bill passes 427 to 1, and the president says he’ll sign it into law, I’m not sure there’s going to be a need or desire for an amendment process,” he said.

In the House, the sole lawmaker to vote “no” was Representative Clay Higgins, a far-right Republican from Louisiana.

Even as all of them voted to demand the release of the files, Republican leaders dismissed the measure as a “political show vote” driven by Democrats who were only feigning interest in the Epstein saga in the hopes of inflicting political damage on Mr. Trump. And even though the president has said he would sign the bill if it were to reach his desk, its proponents raised questions about whether the Justice Department would ultimately release the files.

“I’ve been opposed to it all along,” Speaker Mike Johnson said at a morning news conference before the vote, standing next to a poster board with five bullet points citing the “dangers” of a measure that he ultimately supported, along with his entire conference.

Acknowledging the reason he had tried for months to keep the bill off the floor, Mr. Johnson said he had no choice but to support a piece of legislation he considered deeply flawed because of the political blowback he would receive for voting no.

“None of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency,” he said.

Representative Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who cosponsored the measure and led the charge to force a vote on it, said the vote was overdue.

“The speaker was dragged to it kicking and screaming, but here we are,” he said. “It’s not necessarily a rebalancing of the branches of government, but a rebalancing of the people against the executive branch.”

The top Senate Democrat said he would push for immediate consideration of the bill Mr. Thune failed to do so in short order.

“The American people have waited long enough,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters, saying the action could come as soon as later on Tuesday. “They want to see what’s in it.”

Proponents of the measure worked to keep pressure on Mr. Trump to follow through and release the files, something that does not require an act of Congress but that he has chosen not to do.

“The real test will be, will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who broke hard with Mr. Trump on the Epstein matter, said at a morning news conference outside the Capitol.

There, she was joined by some of the victims of Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in prison in 2019 while facing sex-trafficking charges. Standing outside the Capitol, some of the survivors directed their remarks at Mr. Trump.

“While I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I’m grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill, I can’t help to be skeptical of what the agenda is,” said Haley Robson, who met Mr. Epstein when she was 16 and has said she recruited friends to his sex-trafficking ring after being abused herself.

The vote capped a monthslong effort by Republicans to make sure that this day never came to pass. Mr. Trump leaned aggressively on three Republicans who signed a petition that made it possible for the proponents to circumvent leadership and force the floor vote to happen.

He called the holdouts personally and had White House officials issue warnings to the rank-and-file that support for the discharge petition would be viewed as a “hostile act” by the administration.

But the pressure campaign backfired. In the case of the three hard-right Republicans — all women — who refused to remove their names, people familiar with their thinking said, it only caused them to dig in more.

In the House, Mr. Johnson vociferously opposed the petition. He claimed that the bill did not do enough to protect victims’ privacy, even though it included language that did so. He said it was unnecessary given that a House committee was investigating the handling of the Epstein case. And for weeks after her special election victory in Arizona, Mr. Johnson refused to seat Representative Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, who had said she would provide the final signature needed to force the vote on the floor as soon as she was sworn in.

Mr. Johnson finally did so last week and Ms. Grijalva signed, putting the petition at the 218-signature threshold to represent a House majority and guarantee a floor vote.

Unwilling to take what was certain to be a humiliating loss on the House floor, Mr. Trump then reversed himself on the matter and called on his party to back the bill.

Many Republicans in Congress followed suit, embracing a bill they claimed to have supported all along.

In their upside-down telling, Mr. Trump had consistently fought for the release of the Epstein files. And so had they.

Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, said the action was “an important vote to continue to show the transparency that we’ve delivered.”

On the House floor on Tuesday before the vote, Democrats noted that Mr. Trump did not need a vote in Congress at all to release the files and accused Republicans of having tried to hide behind procedure to block the vote.

“Donald Trump could release these files on his own,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. He accused Republican leaders of trying to block the vote “for months and months and months.”

Republicans, in turn, highlighted the fact that their own Oversight Committee investigation led to the release of a trove of documents from Mr. Epstein — though they did not mention that it was Democrats who had forced them to begin the inquiry. They claimed that they had opposed the vote because they wanted more justice for Mr. Epstein’s victims.

“We now know that Epstein himself hated President Trump,” said Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, referring to emails Mr. Epstein wrote to his associates regarding the president. “It’s in black and white.”

But the fight has left lasting rifts and grudges within Mr. Trump’s coalition. On Tuesday morning, Ms. Greene defended herself against Mr. Trump’s charge that she was a “traitor” for backing the release of the Epstein files.

“A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves,” she said, standing in front of Mr. Epstein’s victims. “A patriot is an American that serves the United States of America, and Americans like the women standing behind me.”

Later on the House floor, she laid out why the Epstein episode had resonated so strongly with Mr. Trump’s populist base even as the president has sought to change the subject.

“These American women aren’t rich, powerful elites,” Ms. Greene said, speaking from the Democratic side of the chamber. She added, “These are your average Americans.”

She said the Epstein files represented the “failures” of the government and Congress to their citizens. “For far too long, Americans have been put last, and they’re sick and tired of it,” she said. “This is why they don’t trust Congress. This is why they don’t trust the government.”

Ms. Greene noted that she and the three other House Republicans who forced the vote endured attempts at intimidation for months. “This is what the American people are sick of. And rightfully so.”

Some of Ms. Greene’s colleagues were more interested in simply falling in line, as usual, with Mr. Trump. And they were not ashamed to hide it.

Representative Troy Nehls, Republican of Texas, who had staked out a firm “no” position on the release of the files just days ago, dismissing it all as the “Epstein hoax” devised by Democrats to “distract us from the winning of President Trump and his administration,” was unapologetic about his about-face. He conceded that he was merely doing what Mr. Trump had said to.

“It is a hoax by the Democrats against Trump,” Mr. Nehls said on Monday evening, lighting a cigar on the steps of the Capitol.

So then why support it?

“Why not?” he replied. “Trump said just release the damn files. He said do it — release the damn files.”

Megan Mineiro and Robert Jimison contributed reporting.

Additional changes include moving a child care grant program for college students and foreign medical school accreditation to the Health and Human Services Department, and transferring Fulbright programs and international education grants to the State Department. The Interior Department will take over the Indian Education Office.

Shifting duties away from the Education Department aligns with President Trump’s goal of eventually closing the agency, a move opposed by teachers’ unions and student rights groups and one that can only be accomplished with an act of Congress.

Less clear was how moving programs to other agencies aligned with Mr. Trump’s reason for closing the Education Department, which he has said was to give states more power in shaping school policies. A senior official at the Education Department said the changes would streamline bureaucracy so that more dollars would go to classrooms.

“Cutting through layers of red tape in Washington is one essential piece of our final mission,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement, adding that the changes were an attempt to “refocus education on students, families and schools.”

The plan drew some immediate blowback from Republicans, including Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who said in a statement that the “department’s core offices are not discretionary functions.”

“They are foundational,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. “They safeguard civil rights, expand opportunity, and ensure that every child, in every community, has the chance to learn, grow and succeed on equal footing.”

Kevin Carey, the vice president for education and work at New America, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said the changes were “wasteful, wrong and illegal.”

“Secretary McMahon is creating a bureaucratic Rube Goldberg machine that will waste millions of taxpayer dollars by outsourcing vital programs to other agencies,” Mr. Carey said. “It’s like paying a contractor double to mow your lawn and then claiming you’ve cut the home maintenance budget. It makes no sense.”

Administration officials have pointed to the recent federal shutdown to justify the moves, noting that schools remained open and students continued to be taught despite nearly all of the Education Department’s staff having been furloughed.

The department has posted several social media memes making such a point. In an X post last week, the department announced that federal workers were returning to the office, adding, “But let’s be honest: did you really miss us at all?”

Liz Huston, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration was committed to shrinking the agency “while still ensuring efficient delivery of funds and essential programs.”

“The Democrat shutdown made one thing unmistakably clear: Students and teachers don’t need Washington bureaucrats micromanaging their classrooms,” Ms. Huston said.

Republicans in charge of the House and Senate in Washington have signaled little enthusiasm for voting on a bill to close the department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979.

Mr. Trump has also shown little interest in collaborating with Congress in his bid to reshape the federal government, and his administration has continued to seek ways to diminish the Education Department.

“We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said in March after signing an executive order that directed Ms. McMahon to start razing the department.

Ms. McMahon’s first act after joining Mr. Trump’s cabinet this year was to instruct the department’s staff to prepare for its “final mission” of shuttering the agency. The following week, Ms. McMahon fired 1,315 of those workers.

The layoffs decimated the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which was created to enforce Congress’s promise of equal educational opportunity for all students, and eliminated the agency’s research arm dedicated to tracking U.S. student achievement, which for many students is at three-decade lows.

In July, after the Supreme Court cleared the way for mass layoffs at the department, the administration moved adult education, family literacy programs and career and technical education to the Labor Department.

The secretaries follow with a list of questions demanding further information from both departments. They ask whether the Justice Department had “shared, or does it intend to share, information from voter files” with any other federal agency, and whether the Homeland Security Department had received information about voters from other sources.

The Justice Department has embarked on an effort to compile the largest set of national voter roll data it has ever collected, to essentially establish a national voting database. The push, which is meant in part to bolster unsubstantiated claims by President Trump and his allies that large numbers of undocumented immigrants have voted illegally, has worried election officials and voting rights experts who say the data could be used to try to discredit future election results.

Nearly every request for the private data was initially rebuffed by top state election officials, who said they needed more information on how the list would be used, leading the Justice Department to sue at least eight states this year.

In the letter, the election officials cite what they view as potentially contradictory information. They state that Heather Honey, a top election official at the Homeland Security Department and previously a leader of the right-wing election activist movement, told a private gathering of secretaries of state that the department “had not received voter data or requested it” and “had no intention of using voter data.”

The letter continues, “The same day, D.H.S. publicly contradicted her representation and confirmed that they had received this data” and would put it through a program the agency developed that checks immigration status.

The secretaries of state also recounted a meeting in August with a top Justice Department official, who told them that the department “intended to use voter information to assess compliance” with the rules for maintaining federal voter lists.

“The first step to repair any relationship with the federal government is clear and transparent communication,” Jena Griswold, the Democratic secretary of state in Colorado and one of the officials who signed the letter, said in an interview. She criticized many of the administration’s actions regarding elections, arguing that they “make our elections less secure and decrease the level of confidence and trust from Democratic secretaries of state with federal counterparts who used to be trusted partners.”

“We’ll have to see what they say,” she said. “At this point, we want answers.”

Representatives for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since Mr. Trump’s return to office, secretaries of state and other top election officials have confronted significant changes to the relationship between the federal government and states regarding elections.

Beginning in February, as part of sweeping federal cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration eliminated programs that had helped election officials coordinate cybersecurity plans and communicate regarding potential threats. The administration has also placed right-wing election activists like Ms. Honey in critical election positions in the federal government.

At the same time, both the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security have made repeated attempts to obtain the private information of voters kept by states on their voter rolls. This information includes partial social security numbers and driver’s license numbers, information not available on publicly available voter rolls.

And in March, Mr. Trump issued an executive order seeking to require proof of citizenship to register to vote, the return of all mail ballots by Election Day and other changes.

That effort, however, was largely blocked by the courts.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/18/multimedia/18trump-news-promo-5pm-whqb/18trump-news-promo-5pm-whqb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 16:57:16.386468

Last month, Densho’s Courtney Wai, Caitlin Oiye Coon, and Executive Director Naomi Ostwald Kawamura joined survivors, descendants, and community members at the 2025 Crystal City Pilgrimage in San Antonio, Texas. The gathering honored those imprisoned at Crystal City, a Department of Justice (DOJ) and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) facility, including Japanese Latin Americans who were forcibly taken from their homes and who, to this day, have not received redress.

Traveling through Uvalde, Texas on our way south—a region shaped by migration and memory—we were reminded of how the histories of incarceration and immigration intertwine. Under the theme “Neighbors Not Enemies,” speakers at the 2025 Crystal City Pilgrimage reflected on the enduring power of xenophobia disguised as “national security,” tracing its roots from the Alien Enemies Act to the present. Pilgrimage Committee member Karissa Tom grounded the weekend with a powerful reminder: “We know what is legal is not always just,” connecting the experiences of Japanese Americans to broader struggles for justice today, including solidarity with Palestine.

The first day of the pilgrimage began in San Antonio, where Bexar County Judge Peter Sakai—whose family was incarcerated in Poston—opened the program with remarks affirming his commitment to justice for Japanese Peruvians, whose stories often remain overlooked.

San Antonio Mayor Gina Ortiz Jones reflected on the lessons of incarceration, cautioning against the use of “national security” to excuse violations of civil liberties, a warning that deeply resonates in the current national climate.

Pilgrimage co-chairs Hiroshi Shimizu, Brian Shibayama, and Gabi Nakashima—representing three generations of the Crystal City experience—opened the program with remarks reflecting on family and legacy. Shimizu, a former incarceree who was a child at Crystal City, was joined by Shibayama, son of Art Shibayama, and Nakashima, granddaughter of a former incarceree.

Archives Director Caitlin Oiye Coon works with a pilgrim to scan their family’s photographs as part of Densho’s Community Scanning Program—the first held outside of Washington. The program invites community members to preserve family collections and ensure their stories become part of the historical record.

On Day 2 of the pilgrimage, participants visited the former site of the swimming pool at the Crystal City Internment Camp, which also has a marker honoring two Japanese Peruvian girls, Sachiko Tanabe and Aiko Oyakawa, who drowned in 1944. A rusted tank, painted for the 2002 Crystal City Pilgrimage, still stands with the words “And justice for all” and “United we stand,” reminders of ongoing efforts to honor this history.

At the morning ceremony in Crystal City, pilgrims honored those once imprisoned, and remembered those who passed during their internment. Framed by the pilgrimage’s theme “Neighbors Not Enemies,” the gathering reflected on parallels between WWII incarceration and today’s anti-immigrant climate. Monarch butterflies—symbols of migration and hope—appeared during the ceremony.

Pilgrims view the Crystal City Internment Camp exhibit at the My Story Museum—the first permanent history museum in Crystal City, Texas. The museum features exhibits on the 1969 student walkouts and the Chicano Movement, local veterans, and on the camp. During the pilgrimage, the Crystal City Pilgrimage Committee unveiled an expansion of the camp exhibit, America’s Last WWII Concentration Camp, deepening public understanding of this history and its lasting impact.

In addition to viewing local historical markers, pilgrims heard from local activists who spoke about the hyper-militarization of the border and the ongoing struggle for human rights—drawing connections between present-day injustices and the history of incarceration at Crystal City.

On the final day of the pilgrimage, Natalie A. Sanchez-Lopez of the Latino Texas Policy Center reflected on the psychological connections between the U.S.–Mexico border and the Crystal City high school, noting how beliefs like “If there’s a wall, it’ll keep me safe” echo and amplify racism and xenophobia. She emphasized the ongoing need for solidarity and collective responsibility.

The pilgrimage was also, ultimately, a time of learning for us at Densho. We were able to try out our Community Scanning Program outside of Washington for the first time, meeting families who brought forward photographs, letters, and documents to add to the Densho Digital Repository. We were also reminded that our work is rooted in relationships across generations and borders, and within ongoing struggles for justice.

About 100 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control and on standby.
At the forefront of the order was the deployment to D.C. of about 2,300 National Guard troops.","The Trump administration’s strategy of using federal agents and troops to enforce immigration laws and what it says is a bid to reduce crime in U.S. cities has extended to North Carolina. Border Patrol agents made scores of arrests in Charlotte over the weekend and then moved into the Raleigh area on Tuesday.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been heavily involved in many of the cities. National Guard troops have been called in to help in a few of them. In other cities, the federal intervention has involved agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Here is how federal forces have been used in cities:

Charlotte: How long will federal forces be there?

Border Patrol agents made more than 130 arrests in the city over the weekend. The agents are led by Gregory Bovino, a senior official in the agency who is from western North Carolina and who has directed similar operations in Chicago and Los Angeles this year.

The use of the Border Patrol, an arm of Customs and Border Protection that has focused primarily on the nation’s southern border in recent years, is an example of how the Trump administration has expanded the scope of some of its agencies. In the past, the Border Patrol has operated mostly near a land or maritime border, whereas ICE typically operates inside the United States. (The Border Patrol and ICE are each part of the Department of Homeland Security.)

But the Border Patrol’s stated mission is to detect and prevent the illegal entry of people into the United States, so it can make arrests anywhere in the nation, though some of its powers — like the ability to stop and search people — are more limited outside a zone of 100 miles near a border.

Raleigh: Broadening operations in North Carolina

Border Patrol agents expanded their operations in North Carolina on Tuesday by deploying agents to the state’s heavily Democratic Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. The full scope of the operation was not immediately clear. But North Carolina is the first state to be targeted that is considered a political battleground state.

The federal crackdown on illegal immigration that began in the Chicago area in early September goes on, though it has been tamped down somewhat by the courts. Before he departed, Mr. Bovino and federal agents that included Border Patrol personnel had in recent weeks taken some of the most aggressive actions yet.

A federal judge condemned agents for using unnecessary force that included using tear gas and pepper spray against Chicago residents without giving them proper warning, and for pointing guns at civilians who were not a physical threat. The judge also said Mr. Bovino had lied to her about his tactics. The Justice Department argued that the tactics were justified because some protesters had become violent.

President Trump has sought to deploy National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas to the city, too, but that effort remains tied up in the courts. Last weekend, the federal government said it was sending 200 Texas National Guard troops back home who had yet to be deployed on Chicago streets.

Overall, the federal operation in the region has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests. But the sweeps have rounded up American citizens and legal residents, too.

Memphis: Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, welcomes intervention

Memphis is the only Democratic-led city in a state with a Republican governor that has seen federal forces move in. On Monday night, a judge in Tennessee temporarily blocked the National Guard from participating in federal actions in the operation, which Mr. Trump and state officials have said has focused on combating serious crime. (The state is expected to appeal the ruling before the pause takes effect.)

But the use of the Guard was just one part of a broad federal task force, which is otherwise unaffected by the ruling. More than a dozen agencies have taken part since it began in late September, including the F.B.I.; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, resulting in more than 2,600 arrests. Some of those arrested have been undocumented immigrants, and residents have reported seeing immigration agents throughout the city.

Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, has welcomed the federal effort and agreed to deploy the Guard. But many local Democratic officials in Memphis, while acknowledging that crime has been a longstanding issue, have said that serious crime was already on the decline and that using the Guard was unnecessary. Still, many have made a point of working with the extra federal resources.

Protests in Memphis have been far more muted than in other cities in part because many groups have focused their efforts more on informing residents, hoping to lower the number of arrests or stops by federal agents.

Los Angeles: After raids in June, immigration sweeps go on

Nowhere has the presence of federal forces been more apparent than in Los Angeles, home to the country’s largest population of undocumented immigrants. Raids across Southern California in June led to huge protests that prompted President Trump to send 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to the city. Mr. Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw that operation, left the Los Angeles area in September to lead operations in Chicago and then Charlotte. But federal agents have remained in the area and continue to conduct immigration sweeps.

County and city officials have said that they have received almost-daily reports from residents of immigration sweeps from South Los Angeles to the Inland Empire region east of the city. Since June, federal agents have made nearly 9,000 immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Local leaders have said that the arrests and continued presence of federal immigration agents in the area have instilled fear among immigrant communities.

Portland, Ore.: Modest protests continue outside ICE facility

The Trump administration ramped up its immigration enforcement in the city around June, and a small but persistent group of protesters has held daily demonstrations outside Portland’s ICE building ever since. Skirmishes with the authorities led to the closing of that building for more than three weeks at one point, according to the Department of Homeland Security, but protests had largely fizzled by September. Late that month, however, Mr. Trump tried to send National Guard troops to the city, saying that the ICE building and federal workers there needed to be protected from “war-ravaged Portland.”

Portland and Oregon sued, and a federal judge this month issued a permanent block on the deployment. The administration is appealing. Over the weekend, the Pentagon said that it was going to send home about 200 California National Guard troops who had been sent to Portland but never deployed on the streets. About 100 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control and on standby.

Mr. Trump began a takeover of the nation’s capital in August after claiming that crime had gotten out of control (though data suggested crime has dropped in the district). At the forefront of the order was the deployment to D.C. of about 2,300 National Guard troops.

They have also been directed to help efforts to beautify the city, and they have spent parts of the last few months picking up leaves and depositing mulch at parks. The troops are expected to remain well into 2026. The District of Columbia has sued, arguing that the Trump administration has exceeded its authority by ordering in the troops without the consent of Mayor Muriel Bowser, and by using those troops to conduct law enforcement. The judge has not yet ruled on the case.

But Ms. Bowser has welcomed assistance from other federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who have coordinated with the D.C. police to get guns and drugs off the street. The Department of Justice said last week that in the 100 days since the federal takeover, more than two dozen federal and local agencies had made more than 6,000 arrests and seized more than 600 illegal guns.

(CN) — Four Portland-area counties will turn over information regarding immigrants — including lawful permanent residents — who were convicted of violent crimes, a federal judge ruled on Monday.

The ruling follows a petition filed by the federal government in October, in which it accused the counties of refusing to comply with administrative subpoenas issued by Homeland Security Investigations in July.

Under Oregon’s sanctuary laws, state bodies are required to decline any request from a federal agency that relates to immigration enforcement, unless ordered to do so by a judicial subpoena.

“We’re obligated to follow state law,” said Andy Jones with the Multnomah County Attorney’s Office, explaining in a Monday hearing that the court must authorize a subpoena before the county can comply with it in this instance.

Dave Lewis, Washington County attorney, noted that some of the subpoenas request information that isn’t under the county’s control, but rather resides in a state-managed database.

The federal government argued that if the counties don’t have the requested information, they can still comply by simply submitting a declaration saying as much, Susanne Luse with the United States Attorney’s Office said.

“If they’re not in possession, we simply want a statement,” Luse said.

U.S. District Judge Michael McShane, a Barack Obama appointee, noted that the parties appeared to generally agree and remarked that he thought the case might be “more hotly contested.”

Rather, the proceedings largely centered on administrative logistics. If the federal government intends to submit more petitions to the court — which it must to require that state entities comply with the subpoenas — McShane said the process should be streamlined.

“Certainly I don’t want to referee every document request,” McShane said.

McShane granted the federal government’s petition, authorizing the counties — which also include Clackamas and Marion — to turn over the requested information if they have it.

“The scope of enforcement is narrow, and we’re going to keep it narrow,” McShane said.

The information sought by the federal government is specific and “not all that remarkable,” McShane noted.

The federal government originally sought to enforce 10 administrative subpoenas, but the number fell to nine after one of the individuals was arrested. In its petition, the federal government said the information is necessary to locate “dangerous, criminal aliens who are subject to removal from the United States pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act.”

The counties reportedly released violent criminal offenders who may be subject to removal from the country between 2022 and 2023, according to the federal government.

While the counties largely appeared to be on the same page, Marion County — where county seat and state capital Salem is located — presented a separate legal question to the court.

In August, after Marion County received the ICE subpoenas, the county sued Oregon Governor Tina Kotek in federal court seeking guidance on how it should proceed. Specifically, Marion County asked whether it could release the records it gathered in response to the subpoenas, noting that the documents are public records that would be available to anyone who made a public records request.

It raised those arguments again when the federal government filed its petition in October, then asked the court to settle its issues of state law by moving for partial summary judgment in the multicounty case.

The state filed an amicus brief opposing Marion County’s motion, explaining that the state public records law issues raised by the county have nothing to do with the issues raised in the federal government’s petition.

McShane said he would issue a written ruling soon.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/courthousenews.com/2025/10/immigration-ice-police-jacket.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-11-18 16:57:43.480664

According to Bloomington Police Chief Booker Hodges, officers started the three-day sting on Nov. 5. They used several methods to find people who were attempting to solicit a 17-year-old girl for sex.

In all, police arrested 16 men during the investigation, which Hodges called ""Operation Creep.""

Hodges said most of the men came from within the Twin Cities area.

One of the men, he said, is an employee for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who could face federal charges. Hodges said the ICE employee works as an auditor.

""When he was arrested, he said 'I'm ICE, boys,'"" Hodges said during a press conference Tuesday. ""Well, unfortunately for him, we locked him up.""

Not all of the men have been charged.

Hodges added that he knew ""ICE took custody of a few of them but we don't have a way to verify someone's status here at the Bloomington Police Department.""

He added that sting operations have become more difficult in recent years because of advanced technology.

""We need to make sure that we pass some laws that make it so these companies can't continue to have these people on their platforms,"" Hodges said.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and police departments from Eden Prairie, Richfield and the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport assisted with the operation, Hodges said.

Durham officials are on alert after Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said Border Patrol agents will be in the capital city on Tuesday.

Durham Mayor Leo Williams began Monday’s meeting by reading a joint statement by him; Nida Allam, the chair of the Durham County Board of Commissioners; and Bettina Umstead, the chair of the Durham Public Schools Board of Education.

“We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights and compromises safety,” Williams said. “Our schools, neighborhoods and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages and experiences that define Durham.

“We stand together in our commitment to protect, uplift and care for every resident who calls Durham home and reject any policy that threatens that trust and unity that we have built in our community,” he said.

Councilman Nate Baker had stronger words about the arrests, saying immigrants have been used as “pawns in this game that the fascist federal government is playing right now in this country.”

“They are being terrorized,” he said. “What we see on television is only a fraction of the terror that is happening in homes across this country and in cities where action is being taken in clear violation of human rights and undermining safety, as our governor spoke earlier.”

Baker said that the City Council would do “everything we can.”

“Our immigrant friends and neighbors are the backbone of our city and of our country,” Baker said. “They are so important for our industries, they are so important for our culture and for our society, and they bring so much, and they have the same hopes and aspirations as everyone else, and they have been thrust into the shadows.”

Councilwoman Javiera Caballero, an immigrant from Chile, said immigrant rights has been an issue she has fought “long and hard for my entire time on Council.”

“I have no doubt that Durham will step up and help protect its residents,” she said. “We’ve done it before. We’ll do it again. I think the risks are a lot harder now, more challenging.”

Councilman Carl Rist, the son of a German immigrant, thanked Caballero for keeping the issue at the forefront for the City Council.

“We’re always stronger on this council and in our public bodies in Durham when we speak with one voice,” he said.

In February, the Border Patrol confirmed the arrests of 11 people, including three young Indian immigrant men, in a Durham neighborhood, The News & Observer previously reported. Neighbors who witnessed the event said they saw tactical gear and masked agents in cars with tinted windows. Details about the arrests, including the men’s identities, were not released.

In July, Caballero and Rist joined other Durham officials and grassroots organization Siembra NC in front of the Durham County Courthouse to alert the community after four plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were seen, frightening some residents.

Months later, the Durham City Council passed a resolution declaring the city a Fourth Amendment Workplace to protect city workers from potential ICE arrests.

On Friday, Durham County Sheriff Clarence Birkhead said the Sheriff’s Office was unaware of any planned operations in Durham.

“I want to reiterate that Durham County does not participate in the 287(g) program, and we do not participate in any [Customs and Border Protection] or ICE ‘roundup’” operations,” Birkhead said. “Unfortunately, we are also not informed prior to any such CBP or ICE operations being initiated in local jurisdictions. CBP and ICE agents are federal law enforcement, therefore, they are acting under a federal mandate.”

In the Spotlight designates ongoing topics of high interest that are driven by The News & Observer’s focus on accountability reporting.

In a motion to dismiss the case filed Monday, city attorneys wrote that the Trust Act, which limits the Boston Police Department’s ability to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on non-criminal matters, was both permissible under federal law and an important way to protect residents.

“Boston is safer when residents, regardless of immigration status, know they can call the Boston Police Department to report crime, participate in the economy, and utilize City services — basic functions of civic life that promote the prosperity and stability on which public safety relies,"" they wrote. “Boston has built this trust through decades of community policing and cooperative work with local leaders. The Trust Act protects that success.”

President Donald Trump’s administration filed the lawsuit in September, saying the Trust Act undermined law enforcement and public safety.

On Aug. 5, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi published a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions,” places where local regulations limit police cooperation with ICE, that included the city of Boston and “vowed to bring litigation to end these policies nationwide.” The federal justice department filed a similar suit against New York City in July.

The September lawsuit was not the first time the federal government had attacked the Trust Act since Trump took office in January. In March, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu was called to testify before Congress to defend it alongside the leaders of other so-called “sanctuary cities.”

As Wu said during her Congressional hearing, attorneys emphasized in their motion this week that the Trust Act still allows police to work with ICE on criminal investigations such as in drug or human trafficking cases. While the federal government had argued in its lawsuit that the law violates the federal Immigration and Naturalization Act, city attorneys disagreed, saying that law only permits cooperation, but doesn’t require it.

Any requirement to work with federal immigration enforcement, they wrote, would be a violation of Boston’s rights under the 10th Amendment, which gives state governments large powers of self-governance.

“Municipalities retain the authority not to participate in immigration enforcement,” they wrote. “Boston has declined the INA’s invitation, and the Tenth Amendment protects the City’s authority to do so.”

A Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll from July found that, by and large, Bostonians support the Trust Act’s limitations on Boston Police’s cooperation with ICE. The Trust Act is also in line with a 2017 ruling by Massachusetts’ highest court that found that, under state law, local officials cannot detain a person based on civil immigration law violations alone.

Letitia James, the New York State attorney general and a Democrat, celebrated the ruling.","A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against New York State in hopes of enabling immigration agents to conduct arrests in state and local courthouses.

The judge, Mae A. D’Agostino, ruled late Monday in favor of New York, finding that a 2020 state law and two executive orders that limit civil arrests near local courts and in state facilities were not unconstitutional, as the Department of Justice had argued in June.

The 41-page ruling marked another defeat for President Trump’s efforts to strike down laws passed by cities and states that limit cooperation between localities and the federal government on immigration matters.

In July, a federal judge in Illinois dismissed a lawsuit that had argued that state and local officials there were violating the Constitution by enforcing so-called sanctuary measures. The Justice Department filed a similar lawsuit against New York City’s sanctuary laws in late July that is ongoing.

The ruling on Monday night has no effect on the arrests that federal officers have been conducting in immigration courthouses in New York City, which are federal property. Scores of migrants showing up for routine court hearings have been arrested this year.

“The court made the right decision in upholding New York’s sovereignty, and the state will continue to work with federal and local law enforcement in cracking down on violent offenders while keeping our communities safe and enforcing our laws,” Jess D’Amelia, a spokeswoman for Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement.

New York lawmakers passed the 2020 state law, known as the Protect Our Courts Act, during Mr. Trump’s first term, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began arresting undocumented immigrants at state and local courts. Other states, including California and Washington, have similar policies barring ICE agents from courthouses.

The New York law allows agents to arrest people at or near courthouses only if they have a court order or criminal warrant signed by a judge — provisions that make it much harder for ICE to conduct arrests at the courthouses.

In June, Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Albany that argued that the state law shielded criminals while endangering public safety, saying that the state was helping “prevent illegal aliens from apprehension.”

The lawsuit argued that the state law violated the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which says that the Constitution and federal statutes take priority over any conflicting state laws.

But Judge D’Agostino, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2011, ruled that the state policies were not pre-empted by federal law and that New York was within its rights in deciding not to help the federal government with immigration enforcement.

She wrote that the state’s measures reflected New York’s “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment and not preempted” by federal immigration laws.

Letitia James, the New York State attorney general and a Democrat, celebrated the ruling.

“Everyone deserves to seek justice without fear,” Ms. James said in a statement. “This ruling ensures that anyone can use New York’s state courts without being targeted by federal authorities.”

ICE officials have previously argued that arresting people in courthouses is easier and safer for its officers and the public, in part because people who enter courthouses have been screened for weapons.

The decline in population comes as federal immigration agents sent to the area as part of the Trump Administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement efforts have begun leaving Chicago ahead of a possible return in the spring.
But its intensity has begun to subside as Homeland Security officials have confirmed that a new immigration enforcement surge has begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Broadview facility — which serves as a processing facility where detainees are supposed to be held for only a few hours before being moved to a detention facility elsewhere — has drawn widespread protests in recent months.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Johnson in a hearing Tuesday said there are currently only four people being held at the Broadview facility, a drastic reduction that comes weeks after detainees there testified they had been crammed into rooms filled with more than 100 people for multiple days.

The decline in population comes as federal immigration agents sent to the area as part of the Trump Administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement efforts have begun leaving Chicago ahead of a possible return in the spring.

“I guess they just can’t take our winters,” U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman said Tuesday. “I don’t blame them.”

More than 3,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws have been arrested in and around Chicago during the operation. But its intensity has begun to subside as Homeland Security officials have confirmed that a new immigration enforcement surge has begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Broadview facility — which serves as a processing facility where detainees are supposed to be held for only a few hours before being moved to a detention facility elsewhere — has drawn widespread protests in recent months.

Tuesday’s hearing was part of a class-action lawsuit brought last month by the MacArthur Justice Center and the ACLU of Illinois, who sought a temporary restraining order to address what advocates claim are “inhumane and unlawful conditions” at the Broadview facility.

Gettleman granted that order following a daylong hearing earlier this month in which several former Broadview detainees testified that they were crammed into overstuffed holding rooms with dozens of others, had difficulty contacting their families or attorneys and weren’t able to shower or change their clothes sometimes for multiple days.

Some detainees also said they were coerced into signing voluntary deportation forms after being lied to or threatened by federal agents.

Since then, government prosecutors said ICE has made significant strides toward improving those conditions, though attorneys for the plaintiffs say they’ve still had trouble contacting clients inside Broadview.

Last week, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura McNally and attorneys in the case performed a site visit at the controversial immigration facility.

Attorneys representing the detainees on Tuesday said there were around 20 people held at the facility during that visit, and they mentioned some issues regarding food quality and attorney access still remained.

Johnson told the court though that aside from “a few tweaks outstanding,” ICE is currently complying with Gettleman’s temporary order.

Attorneys for the detainees are now seeking a preliminary injunction which would turn Gettleman’s temporary order into a more permanent one. A hearing on that issue is scheduled for December.

It was not immediately clear if the state still has a legal path to restoring the new map in time for 2026.
This is just the opening gambit in what promises to be a yearslong legal battle over Texas’ congressional map.
The judges have indicated they may want to see how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a major voting rights case before issuing their full ruling on Texas’ maps.
But for Trump, and many of his Republican supporters in Texas, the short-term goal of having this map for the 2026 election was as important as the long game.","Subscribe to The Blast, The Texas Tribune’s premier newsletter, for exclusive reporting, nonpartisan analysis and the first word on political moves across the state.

Texas cannot use its new congressional map for the 2026 election and will instead need to stick with the lines passed in 2021, a three-judge panel ruled Tuesday.

The decision is a major blow for Republicans, in Texas and nationally, who pushed through this unusual mid-decade redistricting at the behest of President Donald Trump. They were hoping the new map would yield control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts — up from the 25 they currently hold — and help protect the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House.

The map cleared the GOP-controlled Legislature in August and was quickly signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott. Several advocacy groups sued over the new district lines, saying lawmakers intentionally diluted the voting power of Black and Hispanic Texans and drew racially gerrymandered maps. Over the course of a nine-day hearing in El Paso earlier this month, they aimed to convince the judges that it was in voters’ best interest to shelve the new map until a full trial could be held.

It was not immediately clear if the state still has a legal path to restoring the new map in time for 2026. Unlike most federal lawsuits, which are heard by a single district judge and then appealed to a circuit court, voting rights lawsuits are initially heard by two district judges and one circuit judge, and their ruling can only be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The decision comes 10 days into the monthlong period when candidates can sign up for the March primary. The filing deadline is Dec. 8.

This is just the opening gambit in what promises to be a yearslong legal battle over Texas’ congressional map. A lawsuit over the state’s 2021 redistricting — including its state legislative and education board seats — went to trial earlier this summer and remains pending before the same three-judge panel. The judges have indicated they may want to see how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a major voting rights case before issuing their full ruling on Texas’ maps.

But for Trump, and many of his Republican supporters in Texas, the short-term goal of having this map for the 2026 election was as important as the long game.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47644/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20250820-redistrict-map-reuters-scaled1763489413.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=wixgi9zF,N,,2025-11-18 13:57:36.301634

Gavin Newsom, challenging a California law he recently signed that prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing masks, a practice that became common this year amid the president’s immigration crackdown.

The suit claims that the mask ban, and a companion measure requiring federal agents to wear identification, are unconstitutional because states do not have the power to regulate federal agencies. It says federal law enforcement agencies will not comply with the pair of state laws, which take effect on Jan. 1, and asks the court to strike them down.

“California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.

Several states have introduced measures to ban masking by immigration agents, but California was the first to pass one into law.

The lawsuit comes as little surprise. Mr. Newsom himself said in July that he was “looking at the constitutionality” of the bill, months before signing it in September. Legal experts predicted it would be challenged in court, where numerous conflicts between California and the Trump administration are now playing out.

“If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people’s rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,” Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, said in a statement.

Supporters have argued that the measure is constitutional because state and local governments can require federal agencies to follow general laws, such as speed limits. The mask law applies to both federal and local law enforcement agents in California.

Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who wrote the bill, vowed to fight to defend it.

“We see I.C.E. and other federal agents going into communities with these ski masks, just terrorizing communities, where you don’t even know if someone is an actual agent or not,” Mr. Wiener said in a video posted on social media.

“It causes fear, and it’s unacceptable in a democracy.”

The lawsuit claims that officers must have the option to shield their identities because of the threats and violence they face on the job. It cites a huge increase in assaults and death threats against officers, and says websites publish agents’ personal information “to harass and threaten them and their families.”

“Now is an extraordinarily dangerous time to serve in federal law enforcement,” the lawsuit said.

It contends that the California laws prohibiting officers from wearing masks and requiring that they display identification “would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities.”

Because federal agencies will not comply with the laws, officers are at risk of criminal prosecution if the laws are not struck down, the suit says.

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel agreed with a lower judge in rejecting Trump’s arguments that the network falsely associated him with Adolf Hitler.

“Trump has not adequately alleged the falsity of CNN’s statements. Therefore, he has failed to state a defamation claim,” the three-judge panel wrote in its unsigned ruling.

The panel included two of Trump’s own appointees, U.S. Circuit Judges Kevin Newsom and Elizabeth Branch. The unanimous ruling was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Adalberto Jordan, an appointee of former President Obama.

Trump filed the lawsuit against CNN in 2022 for $475 million in punitive damages, pointing to online opinion pieces and on-air comments that used the phrase “Big Lie” to describe Trump’s baseless fraud claims after the 2020 election.

CNN has maintained the lawsuit is meritless. A network spokesperson declined to comment on the appeals ruling.

“There is no doubt that Fake News CNN defamed President Trump and all of the tens of millions of Americans who have rightly stated that the 2020 Presidential Election was rigged and stolen by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers,” a spokesman for Trump’s legal team said in a statement.

“President Trump will continue to hold the mainstream media accountable and will pursue this case against CNN to its just and deserved conclusion,” the spokesman continued.

SCOTUS Quick Hits

In its Monday order list, the court announced that it will hear argument in Noem v. Al Otro Lado, a case on federal immigration law and the government’s authority to prevent asylum seekers from entering the United States. For more on the order list, see the On Site section below.

Also on Monday, the Trump administration and lawyers for Illinois and Chicago filed what are expected to be their final briefs on President Donald Trump’s authority to deploy the National Guard to Illinois.

Former Justice Stephen Breyer is scheduled to speak to students at Suffolk University in Boston on Thursday morning. The event is closed to the public.

Morning Reads

Fed Governor Lisa Cook Offers First Defense of Mortgage Records (Nick Timiraos, The Wall Street Journal)(Paywall) — In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, “Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook’s lawyer on Monday provided the first detailed defense of her mortgage applications, arguing that apparent discrepancies in loan documents were either accurate at the time or an ‘inadvertent notation’ that couldn’t constitute fraud given other disclosures to her lenders,” according to The Wall Street Journal. “President Trump has sought to fire cook from the Fed over alleged fraud involving her mortgage applications,” but the “Supreme Court has for now blocked Trump’s attempt to remove her and will hear arguments in January.”

Texas National Guard troops expected to leave Chicago and return home, source says (Dalia Faheid, CNN) — As the Supreme Court weighs Trump’s authority to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, some of the troops that have been there awaiting the justices’ decision are heading home, according to CNN. “Two hundred federalized [Texas National Guard] troops had arrived in the city over a month ago with a mission from the Trump administration to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other US Government personnel – but instead stayed waiting at training bases for weeks” because of the legal battle over the deployment. The changes to the deployment are not expected to affect the 300 troops federalized from the Illinois National Guard.

Supreme Court not ready to tackle prayers at football games again (Maureen Groppe, USA Today) — In its Monday order list, the court announced that it had “rejected an appeal from a Christian high school that was blocked from leading a communal prayer before a state championship football game,” according to USA Today. “The court’s decision not to get involved doesn’t have a practical effect on Cambridge Christian School, which sued the Florida High School Athletic Association in 2015 after its request to pray over the loudspeaker was denied. Since then, Florida passed legislation requiring the athletic association to allow schools to make opening remarks at games it oversees, and the FHSAA has said that includes communal prayers.” However, it does mean that the court at this time will not further clarify what types of public prayers violate the establishment clause; the school had contended that such clarification was needed to ensure that public programs did not needlessly prevent expressions of faith.

US Supreme Court won’t hear patent appeal against Apple, Google, LG (Blake Brittain, Reuters) — Monday’s order list also showed that the court won’t weigh in on a dispute “involving the right to challenge expired patents, leaving in place a win for Apple, Google, and LG Electronics,” according to Reuters. Gesture Technology Partners, which had challenged “a decision to invalidate a patent that it had accused the technology companies of infringing,” had contended that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board does not have the authority to review expired patents and that the case should have been “reviewed by federal courts” instead.

Gupta Wessler Nabs High Court Veteran From Justice Department (Alex Ebert, Bloomberg Law)(Paywall) — A seasoned Justice Department lawyer “with thirteen US Supreme Court arguments on his resume” is moving to “plaintiff-side Washington appellate boutique Gupta Wessler,” according to Bloomberg Law. “Matt Guarnieri is joining as a principal, adding another oral advocate to a practice that is already a routine high court player. In a social media post announcing the hire, the firm said its lawyers have now argued 33 cases before the high court—the most in recent years among plaintiff-side groups.”

A Closer Look: A Brief History of Supreme Court Clerkships

In his latest Empirical SCOTUS column for SCOTUSblog, Adam Feldman explored the idea that a Supreme Court justice’s most lasting legacy is the clerks he or she mentors, because former clerks often go on to exert a significant influence on the federal judiciary, such as by serving as judges (or justices) themselves.

But what you may not have realized when reading that column is that this avenue of influence wasn’t available to the justices until the late 19th century, nearly a century after the court began its work. Until then, there was no budget for justices to have a law clerk. Instead, they each had only a messenger, someone who could run opinion drafts or other dispatches back and forth from their home to the homes of the other justices. (There was no Supreme Court building until 1935 – the court would meet in different locations, although principally within the U.S. Capitol building.)

The Supreme Court’s clerk situation began to change in the 1880s, when Justice Horace Gray joined the court. As Justice Amy Coney Barrett outlined in her book, Listening to the Law, Gray had gotten used to working with a clerk while serving as a Massachusetts state court judge, and he paid out of pocket to continue having one after he was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1882.

Four years later, in 1886, Congress appropriated the funds necessary for not just Gray but for every justice to hire a clerk or stenography assistant. The court’s docket was rapidly expanding, and U.S. Attorney General Augustus Garland had advised lawmakers to offer funds for additional court employees, “emphasizing that cabinet officials and senators had comparable assistants,” Barrett wrote.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the work of these clerks or assistants varied widely depending on which justice they served. Some were more like professional typists, while others did in-depth legal research. All, however, took on some unusual tasks, including running personal errands.

In the 1920s, Congress authorized each justice to hire a second law clerk, and in the 1940s, Congress gave each justice a third. It was around this time that all the justices began relying on their clerks to do more substantive work, such as reviewing cert petitions, a task that is still core to clerks’ work today.

Congress allocated even more money to the court in the 1970s, making it possible for each justice to hire up to four clerks. Four is still the magic number on the court today, although the chief justice is allowed up to five.

In Listening to the Law, Barrett wrote that it would be “impossible” to describe the work of the Supreme Court without describing the contributions made by clerks. In addition to screening potential cases, they help their justice prepare for oral argument, draft opinions, and review opinion drafts from other chambers.

And after their Supreme Court clerkship is done, former clerks often go on to have impressive legal careers, as Feldman wrote. Six of the current justices previously served as Supreme Court clerks (all but Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor.)

Court to Hear Case on Border Crossings

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to review a ruling by a federal appeals court that, the Trump administration contends, “has already caused—and, if left in place, will continue to cause—‘untold interference with the Executive Branch’s ability to manage the southern border.’” The immigrant rights group and asylum seekers who filed the lawsuit had urged the justices to leave the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in place, telling them that the government’s argument “would empower border officials to render” federal law governing the processing of asylum seekers “wholly inoperable at ports of entry.” For more on Noem v. Al Otro Lado, read Amy’s analysis.

Court Won’t Hear Appeals Regarding Prison Construction and School Prayer

Also on Monday, the court, over the objections of three justices, turned down an appeal from the sheriff of New Orleans in a dispute over the city’s obligation to build a new facility for inmates with mental health issues. Sheriff Susan Hutson had sought to end the city’s obligation by turning the court’s attention to a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a federal law that was intended to reduce frivolous lawsuits by inmates, which provides for the cut-off of future-oriented relief after two years. For more on this case and other notable developments from Monday’s order list, read Amy’s analysis.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents will be deployed in the Raleigh area on Tuesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell and Democratic legislative sources briefed by Gov. Josh Stein’s office told The Assembly and INDY on Monday.

“It is the city of Raleigh’s understanding that the Border Patrol and ICE are already in Raleigh and that they will be active tomorrow,” Cowell told The Assembly and INDY. “We have not been informed of nor are we coordinating or helping plan any of this, so we don’t know what activities they’ll be undertaking tomorrow, or really a lot of other details.”

In a statement, Stein said his office “is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh.”

Stein, a Democrat, asked immigration agents “to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations. Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.

“To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement,” Stein added. “Let’s keep each other safe.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, said in a statement that the department does not “discuss future or potential operations.”

“We will not stop enforcing the laws of our nation until every criminal illegal alien is arrested and removed from our country,” McLaughlin said.

Like Cowell, the legislative sources said they were short on details.

“I do know that they are bringing people here,” said one state senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We don’t know how long they plan to be here. But they certainly are making their presence known tomorrow.”

The sources also did not know how many agents CBP would send, or whether their intended target—“Raleigh”—meant the city, Wake County, or the entire Triangle. Durham officials said on Monday that they are planning a press conference for Tuesday morning. (The press conference was canceled as of Tuesday morning; officials said they would release a statement instead.)

The Durham County Sheriff’s Office responded to an inquiry by re-sending a statement it originally provided last week that said the office was not aware of any CBP operations. The sheriff’s office has not responded to follow-up inquiries.

A Durham Police Department spokesperson said he had not heard of immigration officials “coming to Durham to conduct an operation like they are in Charlotte.” Federal agencies are not required to notify local law enforcement about their plans, the spokesperson said.

During Monday night’s Durham City Council meeting, Mayor Leonardo Williams read a statement that affirmed the city’s commitment to protecting immigrants but did not address whether Durham would be targeted.

About 200 CBP agents were deployed to Charlotte on Saturday as part of what the Department of Homeland Security is calling “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Greg Bovino, the North Carolina-raised head of CBP, vowed to “hit Charlotte like a storm.” At least 130 people were arrested in the first 48 hours, according to CBP.

ABC News has reported that CBP agents stationed in Charlotte will be sent to New Orleans this Friday.

Like other cities that immigration officials have targeted this year, Charlotte is led mostly by Democrats. Republicans, including President Donald Trump, blamed the city’s “soft-on-crime” approach for the high-profile killing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska this summer.

Earlier this month, three Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation asked Stein to deploy the National Guard to fight what they called the city’s “increasingly dire” crime problem.

“The men and women who wear the badge in Charlotte have sounded an unmistakable cry for help,” wrote U.S. Reps. Mark Harris, Pat Harrigan, and Chuck Edwards. “Yet you have rejected their cry. The people of North Carolina deserve to know why their governor has refused help while the officers sworn to protect them plead for immediate assistance.”

Stein has not deployed the National Guard.

Violent crime in Charlotte has dropped by 20 percent over the last year, according to the city’s police department. Violent crime has dropped as well in Raleigh and Durham, also Democratic strongholds.

As federal agents moved into Charlotte this weekend, the Trump administration also accused the city’s “sanctuary politicians” of allowing “criminal illegal aliens” to “roam free.” Like Durham and Raleigh’s police departments, Charlotte’s police do not participate in a federal program that authorizes them to enforce immigration laws.

And until recently, the Mecklenburg County jail did not honor “detainers,” or requests to hold immigrants who would otherwise be released for up to 48 hours so that immigration officials can take them into custody. That changed after the Republican-led General Assembly passed laws in 2024 and 2025 requiring sheriffs to honor detainers and notify immigration officials before releasing immigrants held on felony and other charges.

The Trump administration said that North Carolina jails failed to honor nearly 1,400 detainers, which Republicans say put residents at risk.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden has argued that partnering with immigration authorities erodes trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement.

McFadden was one of five Black Democrats who were elected in urban counties in 2018 after pledging not to cooperate with immigration authorities. Also in that group were the new sheriffs of Durham and Wake counties. Those offices—as well as the police departments in Durham and Raleigh—have taken similar approaches to immigration enforcement.

“Border Patrol is in Charlotte for one reason: the need is real,” Kyle Kirby, chair of the Mecklenburg County GOP, said in a statement. “When local Democrats—who control all aspects of local government—refuse to enforce the law, federal agencies have no choice but to step in and protect this community.”

Democrats argue that the immigration agents’ aggressive tactics have terrorized and intimidated Latino residents.

“Everyone wants to be safe in their communities,” Stein said in a video posted on X this weekend. “But the actions of too many federal agents are doing the exact opposite in Charlotte. We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling, and picking up random people in parking lots and off our sidewalks. This is not making us safer.”

Cowell said she wanted Raleigh residents to know that the city’s police are on their side.

“If citizens see things that they think are not lawful, feel threatened—any of those—they can call the police as normal tomorrow,” Cowell said. “And we do have First Amendment rights. We are just trying to encourage nonviolent, peaceful sort of activity tomorrow.”

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to.","The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services wants to expand a Biden-era policy known as public charge that could further curtail immigrants' use of public benefits.

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.

Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.

""Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,"" the proposal states.

Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.

""This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,"" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. ""By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.""

Politics of social safety net programs

The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.

People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.

Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.

U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.

Executive order targeted benefits

In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""

Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.

Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.

Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a ""public charge"" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5027x2828+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2Ff1%2F483a0fc4495aa8af954582280111%2Fgettyimages-1229220583.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:59:43.584121

Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S.
Selections — The Supreme Court is considering whether President Trump has the legal authority to single-handedly impose tariffs.
November 5: CAC President Elizabeth Wydra joined Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to discuss Learning Resources v. Trump.","This month, the Supreme Court is considering two major challenges to Trump overreach—one on its merits docket and one on its shadow docket—and CAC has been involved in both.

At the beginning of November, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the challenge to President Trump’s unlawful tariffs. Our amicus brief ex

plained that President Trump doesn’t have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to single-handedly set global tariffs. As CAC Legal Fellow Simon Chin explained after oral argument, “The Government argues that when Congress passed IEEPA, in 1977, it carried forward authority over tariffs from an older law called the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). But as Neal Katyal, counsel for the private challengers, emphasized at oral argument when citing our brief, a 1933 amendment to TWEA severed that law from its original war powers foundations.”

The stakes of this case are high, as CAC President Elizabeth Wydra emphasized in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. As Elizabeth explained, the Court has “so far, in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs. This will be a test of whether they will actually be the check that the Constitution envisions on the Executive.”

Among Trump’s many other disturbing power grabs has been his deployment of the National Guard in American cities. CAC is fighting back in courts from coast to coast, filing amicus briefs against Trump’s unlawful use of the National Guard in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.

Most recently, CAC filed a brief in the Supreme Court explaining why it should deny the government’s request to stay a district court injunction blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. Our brief explains that Martin v. Mott, a case arising out of the War of 1812, doesn’t insulate the President’s deployment decision from judicial review.

Because the Trump administration relies on Mott in claiming that courts can’t review its decision to deploy the Guard, CAC’s historical research has been a helpful resource in setting the record straight. Our brief was cited as providing a valuable perspective in Slate magazine and the One First newsletter. And when Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, seemingly claimed that Trump had unreviewable “plenary power,” CAC’s Deputy Chief Counsel Brian Frazelle was quick to explain that he was “flat wrong.”

With both the Los Angeles National guard case and the consolidated tariffs cases before the Supreme Court, CAC’s historical research provides key context and insight for the Justices. As Elizabeth suggested, now is the Supreme Court’s chance to show it can serve as a check on the Trump administration’s lawless actions.

Appalachian Voices v. Environmental Protection Agency — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether the Trump administration can unilaterally terminate an entire mandatory grant program created by Congress. Our brief argues that the Constitution’s separation of powers prohibits the President from unilaterally withholding federal funds based on disagreement with congressional policy, and because the Trump administration unilaterally terminated a mandatory grant program, the executive branch violated the Constitution’s separation of powers. C. Circuit Court of Appeals, brief filed November 3.

League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President — WIN — The D.C. District Court held that President Trump’s executive order requiring proof of citizenship on the Federal Form for registering voters violated the separation of powers. Echoing our brief, the court observed that the Elections Clause “provides that Congress—not the President—is the check on States’ authority to regulate federal elections.” C. District Court, decision rendered October 31.

Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections — The Supreme Court is considering whether President Trump has the legal authority to single-handedly impose tariffs. Our brief responds to a historical argument made in support of the tariffs—namely, that the relevant federal law incorporates a traditional presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime that traces back to the nineteenth century and was first codified in the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA)—explaining why this narrative is unsound at every step. Supreme Court, brief filed October 24.

Illinois v. Trump— WIN — In October 2025, the Seventh Circuit denied the administration’s motion for a stay, leaving in place a district court order that prevents troops from deploying in Chicago. In doing so, the Seventh Circuit adopted the reasoning of CAC’s amicus brief to conclude that Martin v. Mott does not foreclose judicial review. The Trump administration subsequently asked the Supreme Court to stay the district court’s order, and CAC filed an amicus brief opposing the administration’s application, reiterating our arguments about why courts can review the President’s decisions to mobilize the National Guard. That application is currently pending. Seventh Circuit, brief filed October 12, decision rendered October 16, brief filed in Supreme Court October 20.

Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto v. HHS — WIN — In a case challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful decision to cut off funding for legal services for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, the Ninth Circuit denied the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. The Court addressed—and rejected—the government’s jurisdictional argument. Echoing our brief, the Court understood the Plaintiffs to challenge the government’s failure to comply with the TVPRA’s mandate, rather than raise a breach-of-contract claim. Ninth Circuit, decision rendered October 10.

Grundmann v. Trump — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether Donald Trump’s attempted firing of the Chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority was illegal. Our brief explains why long-established practice has placed the validity of multimember independent agencies like the FLRA beyond doubt, and also demonstrates that the text and history of the Constitution further underscore the legitimacy of multimember independent agencies. C. Circuit, brief filed October 10.

Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.
There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.
Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".","The government's plans to fast-track the deportation of illegal migrants and a major overhaul of human rights law have been described as ""inhumane"".

Green Party MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns said she was ""really worried"" about Monday's announcement.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood detailed sweeping reforms of the UK's immigration policy, meaning anyone granted asylum will be returned home if their country is deemed safe in the future.

Addressing the House of Commons, the minister said she had a ""moral duty"" to fix the ""broken asylum system"" and ""unite what is today a divided country"".

Chowns responded: ""The right to seek asylum for someone fleeing violence in their home country... is a basic principle of international law and it's also a basic principle of our shared humanity.

""And it appears what the government is trying to do is really lean into this whole narrative that all of the problems in the country are to do with people coming over in small boats.

""It's completely false and it's deeply, deeply concerning.""

Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.

It would mean only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, would be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

And the UK will also join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9b0f/live/617f15c0-c3de-11f0-bbb8-f506e20a7d44.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:59:55.254946

Dudek tells WIRED that though there had been agreements to share data with DHS before—mostly Social Security numbers—the scope of the recent SORN seems unprecedented.
Normally, says Dudek, DHS is able to check certain Social Security numbers against SSA data, within a limited scope.
The government also previously held that Social Security data shouldn’t be used for citizenship purposes.
For instance, if someone receives a Social Security number and later becomes a naturalized citizen, Social Security data would not necessarily reflect that change.","Last week, the Social Security Administration (SSA) quietly updated a public notice to reveal that the agency would be sharing “citizenship and immigration information” with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This data sharing was already happening: WIRED reported in April that the Trump administration had already started pooling sensitive data from across the government for the purpose of immigration enforcement.

This public notice issued by SSA makes that official, months after the fact. The notice is known as a system of record notice (SORN), a document that outlines how an agency will share the data it has, with whom, and for what purpose. This notice is required under the Privacy Act of 1974. Normally, SORNs are issued before any data is shared between agencies, giving the public and government officials sufficient time to offer comment. But WIRED found that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was pulling in data from across DHS, SSA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and state voter data, among other sources, based largely on the US Citizenship and Immigration Service’s (USCIS) Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database.

“There are laws that require the government to inform the public about their use of various kinds of databases and other surveillance technologies,” says Adam Schwartz, privacy litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital privacy and free speech. “If the government starts using the database and does not put out the appropriate disclosure and then later does put out that appropriate disclosure, they still have violated the law.”

The Trump administration has gone to drastic lengths to remake the government in its image. A core component of this has been an effort to vacuum up large swathes of data from across federal agencies, many of which were never meant to be comingled. This has frequently happened regardless of the laws, norms, or procedures that normally govern the access and sharing of sensitive data. The SORN from SSA is just the latest confirmation of exactly how much data is being shared in ways experts tell WIRED is “unprecedented.”

Much of this data sharing begins with misinformation about the data at hand. In the early days of the Trump administration, Elon Musk seized on a misunderstanding of SSA’s data to spread the claim that 150-year-old people were receiving benefits. They weren’t, but DOGE capitalized on the idea that the SSA’s systems were inefficient and fraudulent to burrow into the agency’s data and technology systems. In April, reporting from The New York Times found that in an effort to force immigrants to self-deport, the administration was adding them to the SSA’s database of dead people, effectively meaning that their Social Security numbers could not be used to get jobs or access government services. As part of the effort to combine disparate data across the government to verify citizenship and surveil immigrants, DHS recently published a different but related SORN that effectively transforms SAVE into a voter verification system, which experts also warned could be bypassing the requirements of the Privacy Act.

Leland Dudek, who served as acting commissioner for the Social Security Administration between February and May 2025, led the agency when members of DOGE first appeared. Dudek says he was initially supportive of DOGE and acted as a bridge between SSA staff and members of the DOGE team before becoming disillusioned.

Dudek tells WIRED that though there had been agreements to share data with DHS before—mostly Social Security numbers—the scope of the recent SORN seems unprecedented. Normally, says Dudek, DHS is able to check certain Social Security numbers against SSA data, within a limited scope.

But he says that the SSA does not have a way to deactivate a Social Security number, meaning that it can’t be used to allow someone to work or collect government payments, unless that person has died. Dudek says what appears to have changed within the new SORN is that there is now “a special indicator code that identifies types of questionable data or special circumstances concerning an application for an SSN.” This, he says, appears to mean that there would now be a way to essentially flag a Social Security number and take it out of use, without marking them as deceased.

“You can literally cut off anyone's financial life you want, and you don't need to use the death master file,” he says.

President Donald Trump has focused heavily on cracking down on immigration since his return to office. The administration has canceled Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from countries in Africa and Latin America; deployed the National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement; and claims to have deported more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants. The administration has also sought to collect more data on immigrants, particularly those using government services like housing assistance or food benefits, and Republicans have renewed an effort to add a citizenship question to the US Census. Part of this effort also appears to be the creation of a national citizenship database.

“It seems that DHS was dead set on creating a national citizenship data bank, and for whatever reason, they determined that the Social Security Administration had the largest set of citizenship data across any agency in the government,” says Nikhel Sus, deputy counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). “The American people had no opportunity to weigh in on this dramatic new expansion of the SAVE system before the government illegally repurposed Social Security Administration data.”

CREW is part of a group of organizations currently suing the US government, claiming that the Trump administration is unlawfully consolidating sensitive data across agencies. “These belated systems of records notices only confirm after the fact that the government has run roughshod over the law,” says Sus.

The government also previously held that Social Security data shouldn’t be used for citizenship purposes. In a 2023 letter from the SSA to the Fair Elections Center, a nonprofit focused on voting rights, SSA lawyer Jessica Vollmer wrote that “while SSA records provide an indication of citizenship, they do not provide definitive information on U.S. citizenship,” and that “SSA does not have citizenship information for all individuals who have been issued an SSN.” That authority lies with DHS.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin tells WIRED that “USCIS remains dedicated to securing the nation’s electoral process—by allowing states to efficiently verify voter eligibility, we are reinforcing the principle that America’s elections are reserved exclusively for American citizens. We encourage all federal, state, and local agencies to use the SAVE program.”

SSA did not respond to a request for comment.

“[I am] not aware of something happening on this scale, where there was a total disregard for the required procedures of the Privacy Act,” says John Davisson, director of litigation and senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which is also part of the suit against the government.

Davisson also says that the legal statute that the SORN cites as justification—one that dates back to when immigration was handled by the now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)—does not actually support unrestricted data sharing with DHS. In a 1999 opinion, the Department of Justice limited the kinds of restrictions agencies could put on sharing data with law enforcement. “It essentially says you cannot obstruct an otherwise lawful disclosure of citizenship- or immigration-related information. It does not actually give the Social Security Administration an affirmative grant of authority to disclose information outside of the strictures of the Privacy Act,” says Davisson.

But Davisson says that doesn’t mean there are no restrictions at all. “This administration has attempted to subvert that reading of the statute and to claim that it has carte blanche to obtain from any agency, anywhere in government, whatever immigration or citizenship information it wants.”

Experts tell WIRED that because Social Security data was never collected with the goal of being used for citizenship or immigration purposes, it is also likely to include inaccuracies.

For instance, if someone receives a Social Security number and later becomes a naturalized citizen, Social Security data would not necessarily reflect that change. “There are a lot of reliability concerns when you match disparate data sets across agencies, especially when the data was collected for different purposes,” says Sus. “You could have mismatches. You could have the wrong people's records being incorrectly linked together.” This could mean that people who are legally in or are citizens of the United States could lose their ability to vote or work due to data matching errors.

Dudek, like Sus, says that SSA data is not a reliable way to determine citizenship and could risk disenfranchising people. Dudek says that in order to combine data responsibly, experts would need to clean and cross-match it across other data sources to reduce the risk of false negatives or positives, and agencies would need to disclose risks or biases within the data itself.

“This is yet another breach of trust that will push families back into the shadows and deter them from seeking health care.”","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moved late Monday to make it easier for immigration officers to deny green cards to those who use public benefits like Medicaid or food stamps.

The latest iteration of the so-called public charge rule would strike down the Biden-era version of the rule, which returned the country to long-standing criteria that allowed rejections of green cards for those “primarily dependent” on government assistance, such as those who received cash assistance or help with nursing home care.

The rule does not revert to the 2019 rule crafted under the first Trump administration that allowed immigration officers to reject applicants who used any number of public programs.

But critics say the lack of guidance opens the door to immigration officers arbitrarily rejecting applicants while discouraging immigrants from asking for assistance.

The Monday proposed rule described former President Biden’s policy as a “straitjacket [on] DHS officers,” barring them from considering “all factors and information relevant to an alien’s likelihood at any time of becoming a public charge.”

“Consideration of these, in the totality of the circumstances, will allow officers to more accurately assess an alien’s likelihood at any time of becoming a public charge using their good judgment,” the rule states.

The proposed rule was widely panned by health care groups and immigration advocates.

“By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law. The proposal’s invitation to political bias, coupled with the administration’s out-of-control enforcement assault on immigrant families, make this proposal even more dangerous,” said Adriana Cadena, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition, in a statement.

“The chaos and fear that drive the chilling effect are much worse than last time, so the impact could be even bigger.”

Roughly 1 in 5 Americans are enrolled in Medicaid, while about 12 percent receive food stamps.

The programs are available only to those who are lawfully present in the United States, and with Medicaid, migrants are only able to receive care if their state has agreed to cover the cost.

“The administration is forcing lawfully present immigrant families with low incomes to make impossible choices between preserving their immigration status and ensuring that their kids have what they need to grow and thrive. We know from experience that this policy will reach far beyond those directly covered, harming countless U.S. citizen children,” said George Kelemen with Share Our Strength, which runs the No Kid Hungry Campaign.

“Many families will withdraw from the programs for which they’re eligible for—programs that help feed, house and keep them healthy. This means more kids in America will be at risk of hunger, of losing stable housing, of getting sick.”

The proposed rule says the Trump administration will promulgate a new public charge rule at a later date.

But advocates argue the lack of clear guidance will prompt those reviewing green cards to unnecessarily reject applicants.

“This move is designed to create confusion and uncertainty. The courts have determined that public charge has a very narrow meaning and that it does not apply to benefits like health care that everyone inevitably needs at some point in their life. But now, immigration officials are sure to make inconsistent and arbitrary decisions, forcing families to guess at what programs may or may not count,” said Sarah Grusin, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program, in a statement.

21 hours ago

Kate WhannelPolitical reporter

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has defended sweeping changes to the UK's asylum system, telling MPs the current situation is ""out of control and unfair"".

Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: ""If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.""

Under the plans, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped ""safe and legal routes"" into the UK will be created.

Some Labour MPs expressed concerns, with Nadia Whittome calling the plans ""dystopian"" and ""shameful"", but the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome.

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the proposals were ""positive baby steps"". However, she warned that unless the UK left the European Convention on Human Rights, Mahmood's efforts would be ""doomed to fail"".

Badenoch urged the home secretary to work with the Conservatives, saying she may find their votes would ""come in handy"" if Labour backbenchers did not support the changes.

Over the past year, the government has been forced to backtrack on some of its policies - including cuts to welfare and the winter fuel payment - after objections from its own MPs.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson welcomed the introduction of new safe and legal routes - but accused the home secretary of ""stoking division by using immoderate language"".

Mahmood hit back angrily, telling the MP: ""I wish I had the privilege of walking around this country and not seeing the division that the issue of migration and the asylum system is creating across this country.""

She said she regularly faced racist abuse - using a racial slur she said is used against her - as well as being told to ""go back home"".

So far, around 20 Labour MPs have criticised the plans. Whittome, the MP for Nottingham East, accused the government of ""ripping up the rights and protections of people who've endured unimaginable trauma"".

Folkestone and Hythe MP, and immigration lawyer, Tony Vaughan said making refugee status temporary would create a ""situation of perpetual limbo and alienation"".

Richard Burgon said the measures were ""morally wrong"" and would ""push away Labour voters"".

""Why not recognise that now rather than in another few months and have to make a U-turn,"" the MP for Leeds East said.

Other Labour MPs expressed support for Mahmood. Chris Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live the system had to be fair ""otherwise it'll collapse, and there's nothing progressive about letting that happen"".

MP for Blackley and Middleton South, Graham Stringer, said the home secretary was ""going down the right track"".

He said she would reach a ""compromise"" with Labour MPs but added: ""It might all be for naught if we don't get out of the European Convention on Human Rights.""

Speaking to the BBC later, Mahmood said changing the system was a ""moral mission"" for her.

""If we don't win this argument… we will lose public support for having an asylum system at all and therefore we'll lose something brilliant about this country.

""I'm not willing to put public support for having an asylum system at risk.""

She acknowledged that some Labour MPs had concerns but insisted ""the vast majority of my colleagues agree with me"".

So far this year 111,800 people have claimed asylum in the UK - 39% arrived in a small boat, while 37% arrived by legal means before claiming asylum.

The government says its plans are aimed at reducing the number of people coming to the UK and increasing removals of people who do not have a legal right to be in the country.

The Home Office published the changes in a 30-page document and a few hours later Mahmood presented them to the House of Commons.

Under the proposals, people granted refugee status will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, with their status reviewed every 30 months - half the current time period.

People could be returned to their home country, when it is deemed safe to do so.

The amount of time refugees will have to be in the UK before being allowed to apply for permanent residence will be quadrupled from five years to 20.

Families with children who have been refused asylum will be offered incentives to leave but could be forcibly removed if they refuse to go voluntarily.

Asylum seekers with income or assets would have to contribute to the cost of their stay in the UK.

Mahmood told MPs this would ""end the absurdity where an asylum seeker receiving £800 a month from his family and an Audi was receiving free housing at the taxpayer's expense and the courts judged we could do nothing about it"".

Home Office sources have pushed back against suggestions asylum seekers could have items of sentimental value, such as wedding rings, confiscated to pay for their accommodation.

In order to make it easier to remove failed asylum seekers, the government intends to change the way the European Convention of Human Rights and Modern Slavery Act is applied.

Mahmood also threatened to stop granting visas to people from three African countries - Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia - unless those governments improved co-operation on deportations.

Setting out her plans for capped safe and legal routes, Mahmood said voluntary and community organisations would be given ""greater involvement"" in receiving and supporting new arrivals.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4064/live/42051ef0-c3ee-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 15:58:07.840201

European immigrants were likelier to say that the United States was a great place for immigrants.

A new national survey of immigrants in the country — both documented and undocumented, and varying widely in how and when they arrived — found that about half of all immigrants say they feel less safe since President Trump took office. The survey was done by The New York Times and KFF, a nonprofit that conducts polling and research about health policy.

Among the immigrants surveyed — whether they are here legally or not, or have been naturalized as citizens — concern that they or a family member could be detained or deported has risen significantly since before Mr. Trump’s return to power.

Still, large majorities also say their own future, and that of their children, remains bright, with the concept of the American dream retaining its powerful appeal. About 70 percent said that if they could go back in time, they would still make the choice to migrate to the United States.

The survey captured a snapshot of immigrant life against a backdrop of enormous change in the United States, with many people standing by their choice to come — sometimes illegally — even as their image of the country as a welcoming place has been shaken. Immigrants feel that, across every measure, they are better off in the United States compared with the living conditions that propelled them to leave their homelands.

The survey, of 1,805 immigrants across the country, is a broad look at a group for which there is often very little data to understand their views and experiences, given that the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask specifics about immigration status. The group is also a small share of the population and too difficult to reach to be measured with accuracy by most surveys.

[Read more about how this survey was conducted here and see all the questions that were asked here.]

The poll reflected the breadth of immigrants in the United States, including a significant share who find Mr. Trump’s immigration policies “necessary” and some who are “proud” of increased enforcement. For many Americans, the archetype of an immigrant may be someone who has recently arrived in the country. But a vast majority of immigrants living in the United States — more than 70 percent — have been in the country for 10 or more years, according to the available data from the Census Bureau. A little more than half are U.S. citizens, and 53 percent say they speak English exclusively or at least very well.

The survey found that 60 percent of immigrants, including a majority of those with legal status, say that the United States used to be a “great place” for immigrants but no longer is — a view that is especially common among those from Latin America and Asia. European immigrants were likelier to say that the United States was a great place for immigrants.

Marcos Herrera, 42, moved to Florida from Chile in 2009 to join his Puerto Rican girlfriend. He hoped to continue his studies in mechanical engineering but could not afford to finish his degree and now works as a custodian at Walt Disney World.

Though he became a legal permanent resident and feels mostly safe, he said that he has watched with terror and sadness as other Latinos in Florida have been picked up and deported after years of working hard in the country.

“In the past, there was no fear like there is now,” he said. “Families should not be separated.”

Even as the current view of the country has dimmed for many — amid raids, anti-immigrant rhetoric and masked agents that now permeate American life — their commitment to stay has not.

The share of immigrants, 70 percent, who said that they would still make the choice to migrate to the United States is largely unchanged from two years ago, before Mr. Trump’s push for mass deportations.

For most, especially those who escaped violence, poverty and repression, their view appears to be a matter of perspective.

Large majorities say that their financial situation is better in the United States than the country they left (70 percent), their employment situation is better (65 percent) and educational opportunities are better for themselves and their children (74 percent). Slightly fewer, though still about half, say that their safety is better because they came to the United States.

Most immigrants expressed optimism about their future in the United States, regardless of Mr. Trump’s approach to immigration enforcement. Nearly 80 percent, including a majority of those who are undocumented, said that they were on their way to achieving the American dream or had achieved it already.

“People often compare their decision about moving, or not, compared to where they were,” said Pawan H. Dhingra, a professor at Amherst College who researches immigration and was not affiliated with the survey. So it was not necessarily surprising, he said, that immigrants were both “feeling less safe and still feeling like the American dream is possible.”

Mr. Trump has moved decisively — and divisively — to fulfill his campaign promise to impose a hard-line immigration agenda, after winning in 2024 with support from voters who shifted to the right amid scenes of disorder at the border and an influx of migrants in large cities.

The president has ended paths to asylum, deported people to countries where they are not from and deployed agents in a made-for-TV display of force. The scope of the crackdown has already tested voters who support Mr. Trump’s deportation goals but believe that his methods have been too aggressive.

The share of immigrants who worry that a family member could be detained or deported jumped significantly, to 41 percent, up from 26 percent two years ago, during more lenient Biden-era immigration policies. Concern about deportation has grown since 2023 among citizens and noncitizens, among those here legally and those who are not.

Roughly half of immigrants — including 82 percent of undocumented immigrants — said that they were afraid about what was happening with immigration enforcement; a similar share said they felt angry.

“I feel we had the American dream, until everything in January started to fall apart,” said Leticia Anaya, 60, a Mexican mother who became a U.S. citizen in 2001 and lives in Aurora, Colo.

Ms. Anaya, whose father crossed the border in the 1970s and sponsored her for a green card in 1990, said that her family had made a plan when they heard of U.S. citizens being detained by federal agents. They stored all their documents, including naturalization papers, birth certificates and passports, in a “special box” tucked in a closet at home, she said.

“It’s not like I am very afraid, but it could happen,” said Ms. Anaya, who said she lost her job with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs because of Mr. Trump’s mass layoffs. “I look Hispanic. I have an accent.”

Still, 40 percent of immigrants say that they feel Mr. Trump’s enforcement tactics are necessary, and 15 percent say that the tactics made them feel proud.

Roughly 30 percent of undocumented immigrants say increased enforcement is necessary.

Those who say increased enforcement is needed are disproportionately U.S. citizens, many of whom have been here for decades, the survey found.

“Trump is trying to make this country more valuable instead of bringing anybody that wants to come in and do whatever they want,” said Gustavo Rojas, 42, a citizen who came to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1990 and lives in Boston. “I just think that Biden was slipping too much. Way too much.”

Mr. Rojas, who is unemployed and identifies as a Republican, said that he had struggled to start a career after high school and tried to join the Marines but was discharged because of a schizophrenia diagnosis. He said he believed that he was better off in the United States because of what he described as generous government assistance.

“I think the country’s going in the right direction,” Mr. Rojas said of the immigration crackdown. “It’s not affecting me at all.”

Other surveys have shown that Americans have grown skeptical about the future of the American dream, with 53 percent of respondents in a 2024 Pew Research Center survey saying that it is still possible.

The new survey found that most immigrants — regardless of their immigration status — feel that their children will have a better life. A similar share expressed this in 2023, before Mr. Trump took office.

Sami Takieddine, 46, was born in Britain to parents who fled Lebanon’s civil war in the 1970s. The family moved to the United States in 1980, when Mr. Takieddine was an infant, and found a foothold in New Jersey and Georgia.

Over four decades, Mr. Takieddine notched one milestone after another: He became a citizen, bought a home, sent his two teenage children to good schools and climbed the ranks to become a director at a technology company in Atlanta.

“I think that America stands for, ‘Do good things, be good at what you do, be good to other people and you can really succeed,’” Mr. Takieddine said, adding that the American dream still exists.

Huayun Geng, 49, a software engineer living in Washington State, said that although he had found success in the United States, he worried about the future of his two children, ages 16 and 8.

Mr. Geng, who emigrated from China in 2012 on an H-1B visa and became a legal permanent resident in 2020, said that the country had been made politically unstable by the divide between Democrats and Republicans.

He also worried that the United States had isolated itself as its education system weakened, dulling the nation’s global competitive edge.

“I’m living a better life myself now in U.S. over when I was in China, but I feel like it’s getting harder and harder for people who just came in to achieve the same kind of dreams as I did,” Mr. Geng said. “Now, when I’m looking at my kids, I feel like it will be very hard for them.”

Here are the key things to know about the The New York Times/KFF survey of immigrants:

The survey was conducted among 1,805 adult immigrants nationwide from Aug. 28 to Oct. 20.

The poll includes immigrants who are U.S. citizens, those with visas or permanent residency and those who are likely undocumented, who were identified as not being citizens or having valid visas.

The survey was conducted on the telephone, via the mail and online, and could be taken in English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Haitian-Creole. The survey was designed by researchers at KFF in collaboration with The Times, and was administered by SSRS, a public opinion research company. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked here.

To further ensure that the results reflect all immigrants, not just those willing to take a poll, the poll gives more weight to respondents from demographic groups that would otherwise be underrepresented among survey respondents, like immigrants without a college degree and those who do not speak English proficiently.

The margin of sampling error for all immigrants is about plus or minus three percentage points. In theory, this means that the results should generally reflect the views of the overall population of immigrants, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. The margin of error is larger for subgroups.

What is the difference between a Dillon Rule and Home Rule city?

Can a city like Charlotte restrict ICE or Border Patrol from accessing city data?","Federal Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Charlotte have sparked widespread concern, especially after reports of racial profiling, detentions, and property damage.

Why it matters: Cities have little authority to intervene. North Carolina's Dillon Rule limits their ability to curb federal enforcement, even as community fear grows.

Charlotte leaders met Monday to clarify what local government can legally do and what limits state law imposes.

What legal authority does the city have over ICE and Border Patrol?

The city has limited authority to restrict federal operations due to state preemption under North Carolina's Dillon Rule structure.

""All of the power originates from the General Assembly,"" Charlotte city attorney Andrea Leslie-Fite said at Monday's city council meeting. ""City Council only has as much power as is explicitly granted or inherently granted by state law.""

That means cities like Charlotte cannot issue executive orders or create ""sanctuary"" policies like some Home Rule cities, such as Chicago.

What is the difference between a Dillon Rule and Home Rule city?

A Dillon Rule city like Charlotte can only take actions that the state government explicitly allows by law.

A Home Rule city like Chicago, however, has broad authority to govern itself unless the state specifically prohibits something.

In short, Dillon Rule limits local power; Home Rule grants it.

Can the city block ICE or Border Patrol from using city property?

Not entirely.

Restricted city areas (like offices or secured zones) require a judicial warrant to access.

Public areas (like lobbies or meeting rooms) remain open.

Can a city like Charlotte restrict ICE or Border Patrol from accessing city data?

No. Most city records are public under state law.

What should residents do if confronted by agents or if someone impersonates them?

CMPD is not involved in federal immigration operations and does not assist ICE with civil warrants.

Residents can call 911 or CMPD if they are unsure whether someone is a legitimate federal agent.

What about North Carolina's new immigration law?

House Bill 318, which took effect Oct. 1, 2025, requires sheriffs to determine the immigration status of people arrested for certain crimes and to hold them up to 48 hours for ICE pickup.

""It codifies that relationship and creates an expectation for jail administrators … not the city,"" Fite said

That means CMPD and the city have no role in enforcing detainers — that's under Mecklenburg County Sheriff Gary McFadden.

What's next: On Nov. 24, Charlotte City Council will vote on a measure directing the city manager to quickly deploy short-term funding, in coordination with Mecklenburg County, to local organizations helping residents affected by ICE and Border Patrol activity.

In addition to the funding motion, the committee also voted unanimously to direct the city attorney to develop an educational campaign to inform residents of their rights and available resources.",https://images.axios.com/oHrD2JW_2Mx9SgkmG2KQroAH0eQ=/0x39:3446x1978/1366x768/2025/11/17/1763421035447.jpeg,N,,2025-11-18 11:00:11.961158

Mayor Jonathan Varden said ICE contacted the city two weeks ago to notify officials of a joint operation with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency that included multiple driver’s license checkpoints across Chilton County. ICE also asked whether Jemison’s City Hall Auditorium could be used to process individuals if necessary.

“The city has historically cooperated with local, state, and federal agencies,” Varden said in a statement. “All our laws should be enforced equally across the board, without prejudice, with grace and humility.” Police confirmed the operation took place Tuesday, Nov. 11, and is no longer active.

The mayor acknowledged a protest scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 18. He said the city supports residents’ right to peacefully protest and is working with organizers to ensure the safety of all participants.

Organizers say the protests have led to division and threats within the community. Protest organizer Irbin Hernandez said, “Once we started it, we started to see so much division in the city, like the racist people came at us, death threats all types of stuff and this isn't just a racial problem, this is a people problem. This is a problem we have imbedded in the south.”

Co-organizer Stacy Serrano said some residents are now fearful of contacting police. “There's a lot of community who is scared to even call the police department because they're scared, they're like they're working with ICE. If I call because somebody is breaking into my house what if they come and get me?” she said.

The mayor called the online threat “appalling” and said there is “zero tolerance for such threats and intimidation tactics.” An investigation is underway, and the city plans to release a full statement once the case concludes.

Despite the tension, organizers say the protest is intended to promote unity. Hernandez said, “We just want to create peace and unity in the town and the state and every city and hopefully everybody hears us.”",https://abc3340.com/resources/media/88820eb4-45e3-4667-b4df-5f803f85d37a-jemison_municipal_complex.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 11:00:17.873517

The federal law doesn’t create a mandate for information sharing or honoring civil detainer requests, according to the motion.","A Trump administration attempt to strike down Boston’s sanctuary city law can’t overcome constitutional hurdles protecting localities from federal incursions, the city said in filings asking a judge to toss the government’s lawsuit.

“Here, Boston has declined” the invitation to assist the federal government’s immigration crackdown, “and the Tenth Amendment protects the City’s authority to do so,” Boston said in its Monday filing.

The Justice Department had said Boston’s Trust Act raised its own constitutional issues, arguing in the complaint that the non-cooperation amounted to illegal obstruction of immigration efforts by strictly limiting the city’s cooperation with federal authorities. The lawsuit is part of the administration’s broad immigration enforcement efforts and push to accelerate the rate of deportations from the US.

The bid to spike the Department of Justice’s sanctuary city lawsuit urged the court to find the local ordinance is protected by the Tenth Amendment, which says all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are reserved to the states. A federal judge invoked that protection in July when dismissing a similar action filed against Illinois, the city of Chicago and Cook County.

The DOJ has also targeted New York City, Los Angeles, and Rochester, NY with sanctuary city lawsuits.

Boston said the Trump administration is wrong in arguing that the federal Immigration and Nationality Act mandates local participation in enforcement efforts. The city’s ordinance, known as the Boston Trust Act, also doesn’t stand as an obstacle to federal authorities conducting enforcement actions.

Trust Act

Boston enacted the Trust Act in 2014, limiting what information city police will share and denying federal officers access to suspects in city custody who are thought to be in the country illegally. The measure was designed to promote trust between local police and immigrant communities.

The ordinance preceded the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s 2017 Lunn v. Commonwealth ruling that found municipalities have no authority to honor civil detainer requests that immigration officials issue asking localities to detain people until they can be taken into custody by federal authorities.

The Trust Act says local police also can’t ask people their immigration status, give detainees’ release dates to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, make arrests based on ICE administrative warrants or perform functions of an immigration officer.

The law does allow police to provide criminal history information to the Department of Homeland Security Investigations division of ICE and collaborate on investigations related to human trafficking, child exploitation, drug and weapons trafficking, and cybercrimes.

In 2024, Boston police denied 15 civil immigration detainer requests and neither detained nor transferred any individuals to ICE custody, according to city records.

No Obligation

Boston told the court that the Immigration and Nationality Act doesn’t oblige states or localities to help the government in its immigration duties, and courts have ruled that invitations to assist in those federal duties can be declined without amounting to obstruction.

The federal law doesn’t create a mandate for information sharing or honoring civil detainer requests, according to the motion. The city’s decision to not engage in either “reflects its choice of how to deploy limited resources and is not an obstacle to the enforcement of federal law.”

The city also rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the ordinance amounts to illegal regulation of the federal government.

In an emailed statement, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said the city will not “participate in mass deportation.”

“Boston will continue to work with state and federal law enforcement to protect our residents,” Wu added, “but we are challenging this meritless and unconstitutional attack on our local authority.”

Representatives for the DOJ weren’t immediately available for comment.

The city is represented by in-house attorneys and the Public Rights Project.

I do so as this government publishes the most significant reform to our migration system in modern times.

This country will always offer sanctuary to those fleeing danger, but we must also acknowledge that the world has changed and our asylum system has not changed with it.

Our world is a more volatile, and more mobile, place. Huge numbers are on the move. While some are refugees, others are economic migrants seeking to use, and abuse, our asylum system. Even genuine refugees are passing through other safe countries searching for the most attractive place to seek refuge.

The burden that has fallen on this country has been heavy. 400,000 have sought asylum here in the last 4 years. Over 100,000 people now live in asylum accommodation, and over half of refugees remain on benefits 8 years after they have arrived.

To the British public, who foot the bill, the system feels out of control and unfair. It feels that way, because it is. The pace and scale of change has destabilised communities. It is making our country a more divided place.

There will never be a justification for the violence and racism of a minority, but if we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger, and ends in hatred.

I have no doubt about who we really are in this country. We are open, tolerant and generous. But the public rightly expect that we can determine who enters this country, and who must leave.

To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.

[Political content redacted]

My predecessor as Home Secretary picked up this [political content redacted] inheritance, and rebuilt the foundations of a collapsed asylum system.

Decision making has been restored, with a backlog now 18% lower than when we entered office. Removals have increased – reaching nearly 50,000 under this government.

Immigration enforcement has hit record levels, with over 8,000 arrests in the last year.

The Border Security Bill is progressing through Parliament, and my predecessor struck a historic agreement with the French, which means small boat arrivals can now be sent back to France.

These are vital steps, but we must go further. Today, we have published ‘Restoring Order and Control’, a new statement on our asylum policy.

Its goals are two-fold: firstly, to reduce illegal arrivals into this country, and secondly, to increase removals of those with no right to be here.

It starts by accepting an uncomfortable truth: while asylum claims fall across Europe, they are rising here, and that is because of the comparative generosity of our asylum offer when compared to so many of our European neighbours.

This generosity is a factor that draws people to these shores, on a path that runs through other safe countries. Nearly 40 percent come on small boats and over perilous channel crossings, but a roughly equal number come here legally, via a visitor, work or study visa, and then go on to claim asylum.

They do so because refugee status is the most generous route into this country. An initial grant lasts 5 years, which is then converted, almost automatically, into permanent settled status. In other European countries, things are done differently.

In Denmark, refugee status is temporary, and they provide safety and sanctuary until it is possible for a refugee to return home. In recent years, asylum claims have hit a 40-year low, and now, across Europe, countries are tightening their systems in similar ways.

We must act too. We will do so by making refugee status temporary, not permanent. A grant of refugee status will last 2 and a half years, not 5. It will be renewed only if it is impossible for a refugee to return home. Permanent settlement will now come at 20 years, not 5.

I know this country welcomes people who contribute. For those who want to stay, and are willing and able to, we will create a new ‘work and study’ visa route, solely for refugees, with a quicker path to permanent settlement.

To encourage refugees into work, we will also consult on removing benefits for those who are able to work but choose not to.

Outside of the most exceptional circumstances, family reunion will not be possible, with a refugee only able to bring family over if they have joined a work and study route, and if qualifying tests are met.

While over 50,000 were granted refugee status in the last year, more than 100,000 claimants and failed asylum seekers remain in taxpayer-funded accommodation, and we know that criminal gangs use the prospect of free bed and board to promote their small boat crossings.

We have already announced that we will empty asylum hotels by the end of the Parliament, and we are exploring a number of large military sites as an alternative.

We will now also remove the 2005 legislation that created a ‘duty’ to support asylum seekers, reverting to a legal ‘power’ to do so instead. While we will continue to support those who play by the rules, those who do not – be that through criminality or antisocial behaviour – can have their support removed. We will also remove our duty to support those who have a right to work.

It is right that those who do receive support, pay for it if they can, so those with income or assets will have to contribute to the cost of their stay. This will end the absurdity that we currently experience. Where an asylum seeker receiving £800 each month from his family, and who had recently acquired an Audi, was receiving free housing at the taxpayers’ expense, and the courts judged we could do nothing about it.

These measures are designed to tackle the pull factors that draw people to this country, but reducing the number of arrivals is just half of the story. We must also enforce our rules and remove those who have no right to be here. This will mean restarting removals to countries where they have been paused.

In recent months, we have begun voluntary removal of failed asylum seekers to Syria once again; however, there are still many failed asylum seekers here from Syria, most of whom fled a regime that has since been toppled. Other countries are planning to enforce removals, and we will follow suit. Where a failed asylum seeker cannot be returned home, we will also continue to explore the possibility of return hubs, with negotiations ongoing.

We must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are. Today, we are not removing family groups – even when we know that their home country is perfectly safe. There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims.

This is true despite an existing returns agreement, and that Albania is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. So, we will now begin the removal of families. Where possible, we will encourage a voluntary return, but where an enforced return is necessary, that is what we will do.

Where the barrier to a return is not the individual, nor the UK Government, but the receiving country, we will take action.

I can announce today that we have told Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Namibia that if they do not comply with international rules and norms we will impose visa penalties on them. And I am sending a wider message here: unless other countries heed this lesson, further sanctions will follow.

Much of the delay in our removals, however, comes from the sclerotic nature of our own system. In March of this year, the appeals backlog stood at 51,000 cases. This government has already increased judicial sitting days, but reform is required, so we will create a new appeals body, staffed by professional independent adjudicators, and we will ensure there is early legal representation available to advise claimants and ensure their issues are properly considered.

Cases with a low chance of success will be fast-tracked, and claimants will have just one opportunity to claim and one to appeal, ending the merry-go-round of claims and appeals that frustrate so many removals.

While some barriers to removal are the result of process, others are substantive issues related to the law itself. There is no doubt that the expanded interpretation of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights has contributed.

This is particularly true of Article 8: the right to a family life. The courts have adopted an ever-expanding interpretation of this right.

As a result, many people have been allowed to come to this country, when they would otherwise have had no right to, and we have been unable to remove others when the case for doing so seems overwhelming.

This includes cases like an arsonist, sentenced to 5 years in prison, whose deportation was blocked on the grounds that his relationship with his sibling may suffer.

More than half of those detained are now delaying or blocking their removal by raising a last-minute rights claim.

Article 8 is a qualified right: that means we are not prevented from removing individuals or refusing an application to move to the UK if it is ‘in the public interest’. To narrow Article 8 rights, we will therefore make 3 important changes, in both domestic law and our immigration rules.

Firstly, we will define what, exactly, a family is – narrowing this down to parents and their children.

Secondly, we will define ’the public interest’ test so the default becomes a removal or refusal, with Article 8 rights only permissible in the most exceptional circumstances.

Thirdly, we will tighten where Article 8 claims can be heard, ensuring only those who are living in the UK can lodge a claim, rather than their family members overseas, and that all claims are heard first by the Home Office and not in a courtroom.

We will also pursue international reform of a second element of the European Convention: the application of Article 3 – the prohibition on torture and inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment.

We will never return anyone to be tortured in their home country, but the definition of ‘degrading treatment’ has expanded into the realm of the ridiculous.

Today, we have criminals we seek to deport, but discover we cannot because the prisons in their home country have cells that are deemed too small, or even mental health provision that is not as good as our own.

As Article 3 is an absolute right, a public interest test cannot be applied. For that reason, we are seeking reform at the Council of Europe, and we do so alongside international partners who have raised similar concerns. But it is not just international law that binds us.

According to data from 2022, over 40% of those detained for removal claimed they were modern-day slaves. This well-intentioned law is being abused by those who seek to frustrate a legitimate removal.

So, I will bring forward legislation that tightens the modern slavery system to ensure that it protects those it was designed for, and not those who seek to abuse it.

Taken together Madam Deputy Speaker, these are significant reforms. They are designed to ensure our asylum system is fit for the modern world, and that we retain public consent for the very idea of providing refuge.

We will always be a country that offers protection to those fleeing peril, just as we did, in recent years, when Ukraine was invaded, when Afghanistan was evacuated, and when we repatriated Hong Kongers.

For that reason, as order and control is restored, we will open new, capped, safe and legal routes into this country. These will make sponsorship the primary means by which we resettle refugees, with voluntary and community organisations given greater involvement, to both receive refugees and support them, working within caps set by government.

We will also create a new route for displaced students to study in the UK, and another for skilled refugees to work here. Of course, we will always remain flexible to new crises, across the world, as they happen.

I know the British people do not want to close the doors. But until we restore order and control, those who seek to divide us will grow stronger.

It is our job – [political content redacted] – to unite where there is division, so we must now build an asylum system for the world as it is. One that restores order and control. One that opens safe and legal routes to those fleeing danger across the world, and one that sustains our commitment to providing refuge for this generation, and those to come.

I know the country we are. We are open, tolerant and generous. We are the greater Britain that those on this side of the House believe in. Not the littler England that some would wish we would become. These reforms are designed to bring unity, where others seek to divide.

Madam Deputy Speaker, I commend this statement to the House.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-18 11:00:02.114655

The lawsuit against California argues the state is discriminating against federal agents as it exempts some state officials from the mask ban.
California Democratic state senators pushed for the passage of these bills in June, in response to federal agents wearing face coverings while conducting immigration enforcement operations across California.","The Department of Justice is suing California over two recently enacted laws that would prohibit federal agents from wearing facial coverings and require them to identify themselves while conducting their duties.

The lawsuit filed Monday argues California's laws violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, under which federal laws take precedence over state laws. The Trump administration also claims the laws threaten the safety of federal officers.

The federal government said in court documents that it ""does not intend to comply.""

""Today we filed a lawsuit to strike down California's unconstitutional law aimed at unmasking the faces of our federal agents, which will allow criminals to dox them,"" Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, wrote on X. ""Unconstitutional laws such as this one further endanger our brave men and women protecting our community.""

A spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the lawsuit in a statement to CBS News.

""If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people's rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,"" spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo wrote. ""We'll see the U.S. Department of Justice in court.""

In September, Newsom signed the No Secret Police Act into law. The measure bans federal, state and local officials from concealing their identity with face coverings while conducting operations.

The California Highway Patrol is exempt, as well as undercover operatives, members of SWAT teams, and people who have health issues or who need masks for medical reasons such as preventing smoke inhalation.

The lawsuit against California argues the state is discriminating against federal agents as it exempts some state officials from the mask ban.

Newsom also signed the No Vigilantes Act in September, which will require non-uniformed federal agents operating in California to visibly display identification that includes their agency and either a name or badge number starting in January.

California Democratic state senators pushed for the passage of these bills in June, in response to federal agents wearing face coverings while conducting immigration enforcement operations across California.

Both laws will impose criminal penalties on federal law enforcement officers for noncompliance in some cases.

Critics of the facial covering ban, including the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, argue it puts officers and their families' lives and well-being at risk by prohibiting them from protecting their identity when needed. State-level critics also say it only serves to punish local law enforcement for the actions of federal agents.

The Department of Homeland Security called on Newsom to veto the bills in September and, upon passage, stated it would not comply.

""To be clear: We will NOT comply with Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional mask ban,"" DHS posted on X in September, calling the law a ""PR stunt.""

In June, a federal version of the No Secret Police Act was introduced by New York Democratic Reps. Dan Goldman and Adriano Espaillat. This act would also ban facial coverings and require law enforcement officers and DHS agents to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining individuals.

Nothing led her to believe that, just a few hours later, she would be walking out the door with all her belongings and an order never to return. At 3:30 p.m., as she headed to her office during a break in the asylum case she was judging, a terse, three-sentence email from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) brought her career to an end.

“I didn’t expect not to be able to finish the hearing that day. I felt sad to be leaving a job I had dedicated so much effort and care to. And, of course, I felt uncertain about what would happen next in my life,” she recalls in a telephone interview with EL PAÍS. She had an hour and a half to gather her belongings and leave the courthouse. Dillon was her family’s main source of income, and they had health insurance thanks to her job. She still doesn’t understand why she was fired, as the email offered no explanation.

Hers is not an isolated case. In San Francisco alone, the Justice Department has fired seven judges since April, 25% of the total, and in the Sacramento court, only around half of the 11 judges remain. This area of California has been hit hard by the unexplained dismissals ordered by the Trump administration, which have occurred throughout the country. Of the nearly 800 immigration judges, 139 have been fired, taken an early-out offer, or been involuntarily transferred, according to recent estimates from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI).

The pattern has been similar in many cases. In early September, the day before her two-year term at the Annandale immigration court in Virginia was set to expire, Judge Anam Petit received the notification on her computer. After seeing the message, she briefly left the courtroom where she was presiding over a hearing, then returned to the bench and, with a trembling voice and shaking hands, delivered a complex ruling without revealing what had happened, she told this newspaper via email. She cannot say for sure what the reason for her dismissal was, because she was never told, but she emphasizes that many of the judges who were terminated had experience defending immigrants.

In addition to firing officials responsible for immigration cases, in its first months the Trump administration also eliminated protections against deportation, canceled grants that provided legal representation to minors, and transferred detainees to remote locations, including prisons outside U.S. jurisdiction, thus transforming the immigration justice system to suit its purposes. All of this was done in the name of achieving the largest deportation in history.

“The Trump administration’s policies, including expedited removal procedures and politicized interpretations of asylum laws, have resulted in a lack of due process,” says Dana Leigh Marks, who was an immigration judge in San Francisco for 35 years and is now retired.

Marks has been advocating for years for the independence of immigration judges who, contrary to popular belief and unlike the rest of the country’s judiciary, fall under the power of the executive branch. Although judges have always demanded independence from the government, they had never before denounced the politicization of their work. But since Trump took office the administration has sent them directives forcing them to expedite proceedings and dismiss asylum cases.

“Judges are supposed to act independently and not receive instructions or orders on how to rule in cases. That was the policy during the previous administration: to rigorously exercise judicial independence and rule in each case according to the facts and the law. That’s why it’s confusing to receive so many memos and directives that give clear instructions on how judges should rule in particular cases,” Dillon explains.

The mass firings of judges, amid a backlog of 3.4 million cases in immigration courts, defy practical explanation. From within the judiciary, however, it is understood as a way to remove judges who disagree with the anti-immigration policies imposed by the Trump administration. “It appears that the vast majority of the judges who have been fired were hired during the Biden administration or had experience in private law practice or with non-governmental organizations that assisted immigrants, rather than coming from a Department of Homeland Security prosecutorial background,” Marks posits.

The work of immigration judges is very complex, and in the past, to practice it, one had to have at least 10 years of experience in the field of immigration. The dismissed judges are being replaced by others without experience and even by U.S. army lawyers.

On October 24, the Department of Justice announced the hiring of 11 permanent and 25 temporary immigration judges. Most of those with immigration experience gained it as prosecutors or worked for the Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agencies responsible for arrests and deportations.

Among the temporary staff there are military lawyers from the Marine Corps, Navy, Army and Air Force. Earlier this summer, the Pentagon authorized about 600 military lawyers to work for the Justice Department, which changed the requirements for temporary immigration judges, eliminating the need for prior experience in immigration law.

Express deportations

One of the most radical changes to the immigration justice system concerns expedited deportations. Before Trump, these were reserved for migrants who entered the country illegally and were apprehended at the border. Their deportation can now be ordered by an immigration officer; that is, they are not required to go through a full legal process with a lawyer before a judge.

Additionally, these deportations have extended to people who have been living in the country for years and — contrary to the government’s claims that they are expelling criminals — the majority of those deported have no criminal record. Many of them lack legal status, but they could be eligible for immigration benefits if they were allowed to stay while their cases are resolved, which was the practice followed by immigration judges before Trump. Now, for example, if someone entered on a student visa and overstayed, they can be deported even if they have married a U.S. citizen and are eligible for residency.

“The Trump administration is changing the interpretation of certain legal terms that have been well established in the past, and by doing so, it is preventing people from having full removal proceedings. Instead, it is subjecting them to expedited removal proceedings,” Marks explains.

Previously, individuals who were undocumented or even had deportation orders were not a government priority for deportation. They regularly attended their immigration court appointments for routine check-ins. Now, court visits to comply with immigration requirements have become ambushes. ICE agents wait outside and detain people who arrive for their appointments. Scenes of masked officials forcibly taking people away and separating parents from their desperately crying children have become commonplace.

Detentions in immigration courts have also changed the way lawyers work. “This is something new we’re seeing across the country: immigration lawyers who need to prepare habeas corpus petitions for their clients who attend their regular reviews with ICE are concerned that those interviews could end in detention,” explains Cristina Vélez, director of law and policy at Asista, an organization that advises and trains professionals, including lawyers who defend migrants who have been victims of abuse and domestic violence.

“Because the scope of detention law enforcement has expanded enormously and reached people who previously would not have been detained, our members and professionals, who previously did not specialize in federal court litigation, now have to train, expand their skills, and find funding to do that work,” she adds.

Another radical change in immigration justice is the elimination of the possibility for ICE detainees to be released on bond. Instead, they are sent to detention centers in often remote locations, where access to family and lawyers is nearly impossible.

Adding to all this is the lack of funding for the immigration court system, something highlighted in an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute published this week. While immigration enforcement agencies have received massive budget increases in recent decades — most recently, $170 billion over four years through Trump’s tax reform — immigration courts have received a tiny fraction of that total: $844 million this year, just 2.5% of what ICE and the Border Patrol receive.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/ICZLFO5HI5AFRNHKS6VSXUBFIY.jpg?auth=061e858765a3549b3ae2fb93d4177dbff77ef8af253a34e2684652427f9fe1f7&width=1200,N,,2025-11-18 08:56:20.723846

As 16-year-old Lily Martinez was heading home from her job at the local hospital this summer, her mother called urgently and told her not to come home, instructing her to go to a friend’s house instead.

“She told me that ICE was outside, and it was just her and my brother at home. She didn’t want to open the door for anyone,” Martinez said. “I didn’t know what to do, and I was really scared at that moment.”

Martinez and her brother were born and raised in Queens, New York. Her parents are undocumented immigrants from Mexico who have lived in the U.S. for two decades. Earlier this year, her uncle in Texas was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while driving and deported to Mexico. She’s afraid this could happen to her parents too.

“Sometimes I get so anxious that I’m distracted even when I’m with my friends,” she said.

Millions of U.S.-born children live in “mixed-status” households, families in which at least one member is undocumented or under threat of deportation. Though these children are citizens, the fear that they will lose their parents and caregivers defines their daily lives and has profound consequences for mental health.

“You can’t not consider the issue of immigration as a child well-being issue,” said Mayra E. Alvarez, the president of The Children’s Partnership, a California-based advocacy organization.

In California, nearly half of all children have at least one immigrant parent. Nationwide, it’s 1 in 4. Yet children’s mental health often remains invisible in policy debates framing immigration as a security issue rather than one of public health.

In February, 11-year-old Jocelynn Rojo Carranza, a U.S. citizen from Gainesville, Texas, died by suicide after enduring persistent bullying that included threats of immigration enforcement against her family. In interviews, her mother said classmates told her that the family would be reported to ICE, leaving her “all alone.” The case became a flashpoint for how aggressive enforcement rhetoric and peer hostility around immigration can dramatically elevate risk for children living in mixed-status families.

Researchers studying 547 U.S.-born adolescents found that having a detained or deported family member was associated with higher risks of suicidal ideation, externalizing behaviors, and alcohol use. The report, published in July in Psychiatric News, found that even the persistent threat of family separation generates toxic stress, affecting memory, emotion regulation, and impulse control into adulthood.

Claudia Santos, 17, from Santa Maria, California, has experienced similar fears. Her parents are undocumented strawberry farmworkers, and she worries they could be picked up and deported like so many in her community.

“In middle school, I had suicidal thoughts. But I always thought about what that would do to my parents and my little sisters,” Santos said.

The landscape has grown more perilous under the second Trump administration. Earlier this year, the president signed a budget reconciliation bill that allocated $145 billion toward immigration enforcement and border security. According to recent data released by ICE, over half a million people have been deported. Children are witnessing their parents and caregivers being arrested from places considered safe, such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship.

Experts and advocates say that children are showing visible signs of stress.

“I have parents asking for support from their little ones,” said Dr. Sandra Espinoza, an associate professor at Alliant International University in Los Angeles and a psychiatrist working with Latinx immigrant communities. “Children bite their nails, they are scared at night.”

That fear ripples across entire communities, affecting everyday activities, including even leaving the homes. Leisy Abrego, a sociologist and professor of Chicana/o and Central American Studies at UCLA, recalled that graduation last academic year was missing the usual scores of immigrant families.

“It’s always standing-room only. This time, there were empty rows,” Abrego said. “Imagine what is happening as children are observing this.”

Children of undocumented Latinx parents in the U.S. are at greater risk for long-term mental health struggles, especially when a parent is suddenly taken away, according to Espinoza’s co-authored 2024 study in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy. Researchers found that many of these children grow up carrying invisible scars—feelings of loss, mistrust, fear of separation, and shame—that often resurface later in life, especially in their closest relationships.

Although the research is still sparse, it’s beginning to show that the fear children carry growing up with an undocumented parent doesn’t simply fade away once they become adults. One 2021 national study of nearly 1,800 U.S.-born Latinx adults found that those who had a parent deported during childhood had more than twice the odds of exhibiting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms years later. Experiences such as a loved one being deported, living with the constant fear that a parent could be taken, or witnessing an immigration raid were all linked to adult PTSD.

“A child can learn to think, ‘My caregiver, who was the most safe person in my world, was taken from me. And so I’m going to adapt by not trusting people anymore or by not getting close to people anymore,’” Espinoza said.

Pregnant people under constant fear of deportation also show higher levels of cortisol, stress hormones that can affect fetal development. “These are babies pulling their hair out, babies with stomach aches,” Alvarez said, referring to research conducted by The Children’s Partnership. “It starts that early.”

Chronic stress impairs the immune system, delays cognitive development, and increases vulnerability to mental illness. For children of immigrants, stress may also begin with the trauma carried over from their home countries and can involve poverty, war, or political persecution. It then continues through the instability of U.S. immigration enforcement. This intergenerational trauma echoes through families, as parents struggling with depression or post-traumatic stress may become emotionally unavailable.

“Even when parents are present,” Espinoza said, “if they’re living in a constant state of hypervigilance caused by a broken legal and political system, it’s going to be difficult to be fully present with your child. That’s not the parent’s fault. It’s the environment’s fault.”

For Woojung Park, a 26-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient from South Korea, that environment has felt like a lifelong sentence.

As the only member of her family without permanent legal status—her parents now have green cards and her younger sister is a citizen—Park has lived with a constant sense of isolation.

“It’s like carrying a dirty secret,” Park said. “When I found out we’d overstayed our visa, my mom told me not to tell anyone. … I felt deceived by her. It took years to rebuild that trust.”

Park was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD as a teenager. “I don’t know if being undocumented correlates to it, but it probably was a factor because there’s so much anxiety that comes with it.”

Herlin Soto Matute, 28, a Nicaraguan-born immigrant, grew up in northern California in a mixed-status family. While her two younger sisters are U.S. citizens, Matute and her parents received Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which offers temporary legal protection to immigrants from countries facing war, natural disasters, or political instability.

TPS allowed Matute and her parents to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation—but only for as long as the program is renewed. Under Donald Trump’s first term, the administration tried to end TPS protections for thousands of recipients, but federal courts ultimately delayed those terminations. When Trump returned to office this year, his administration again began rolling back protections. For families like Matute’s, it felt like a cycle of dread repeating itself, keeping her up at night.

“It has been not only about mental and emotional state, but how do these systems have everything to do with how you view yourself, how you behave, how you respond, your psychological state, your physical symptoms?” she said. “Everything is intertwined with every person in power, all of those systems together make our identity.”

Motivated by those experiences, Matute pursued a doctorate in psychology and now works to support Latinx and immigrant communities through her private practice. Still, the precarity of TPS continues to shape her life. Her parents have grown tired and are accepting of the idea of being deported.

For Martinez, who is a high school senior, the future looks different from what she once imagined. She always wanted to leave New York for college and live on her own in a dorm.

“But now I don’t really want to do that anymore,” she said. “With everything that’s been going on, I feel like I can be of some use here at home.”

The fear of losing loved ones also extends far beyond undocumented communities. Across the country, refugee families are feeling the same collective anxiety that undocumented families have long endured. More than 90,000 Bhutanese people in the U.S.—most of them from a Nepali-speaking minority who were resettled after fleeing ethnic cleansing and surviving years in refugee camps since 2008—now find themselves facing a new wave of fear. Since March, ICE has arrested at least 60 Bhutanese in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, and other states, deporting 27 of them. Most are still missing, unreachable to their families.

“We were very much caught off guard,” said Angel Bista, a 26-year-old Nepali-speaking interpreter and community advocate in Michigan.

Advocates say children raised in such environments don’t easily outgrow that fear.

“No matter how good a therapist I am, no intervention in the world is going to make these real problems disappear,” Espinoza said. “Until we have true immigration reform, are my clients ever really going to be able to rest?”

On 15 October 2025, more than 40 legal and migration professionals, including judges, prosecutors, lawyers and employees of the General Inspectorate for Migration attended the Launch event of the Council of Europe HELP course on “Refugee and Migrant Children”. The course provides an overview of the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and aims to strengthen the knowledge, practical skills, and decision-making capacity of participants to apply child-rights standards in migration and asylum cases.

On 21–22 October 2025, 15 representatives from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, including the General Inspectorate for Migration and the General Inspectorate of Border Police, as well as the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Republic of Moldova participated in a two-day Study Visit to Bucharest and Galati, Romania. The visit aimed to provide an in-depth understanding of Romania’s legal and regulatory framework for migrant and refugee integration, to facilitate the exchange of good practices, including on gender-responsive policies and approaches, and to strengthen cooperation between Moldovan and Romanian practitioners working in the field of migration and integration.

From March to September 2025, the Council of Europe supported three grassroot projects in Armenia to promote social and economic inclusion of refugee women and girls. Implemented by For Equality Human Rights, Hub Artsakh, and Armenian Progressive Youth NGOs, the initiatives combined entrepreneurship training, skill-building workshops, mentoring, and awareness-raising on labour rights and gender-based violence. In total, 158 women and girls in vulnerable situation, including 66 refugee women and girls, enhanced their professional skills, confidence, and resilience. As a result, one in four secured employment, while half engaged in self-employment or home-based work. The projects also created safe spaces for psychological and social support and strengthened cooperation among local authorities, civil society, and professionals.

These initiatives contribute to the Council of Europe’s ongoing efforts to advance gender equality, prevent violence against women, and empower women across Armenia.

They didn’t leave.

For two weeks, Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors sat guard in the hospital lobby 24 hours a day, working in shifts to monitor her movements, her attorney Ming Tanigawa-Lau said.

ICE later transferred the Salvadoran woman to Anaheim Global Medical Center, against her doctor’s orders and without explanation, her attorney said. There, Tanigawa-Lau said, ICE agents were allowed to stay in Solis-Portillo’s hospital room round-the-clock, listening to what should have been private conversations with providers. Solis-Portillo told her attorney that agents pressured her to say she was well enough to leave the hospital, telling her she wouldn’t be able to speak to her family or her attorney until she complied.

“She described it to me as feeling like she was being tortured,” Tanigawa-Lau said.

Legal experts say ICE agents can be in public areas of a hospital, such as a lobby, and can accompany already-detained patients as they receive care, illustrating the scope of federal authority. Detained patients, however, have rights and can try to advocate for themselves or seek legal recourse.

Earlier this year, California set aside $25 million to fund legal services for immigrants, and some local jurisdictions — including Orange County, Long Beach, and San Francisco — have put money toward legal aid efforts. The California Department of Social Services lists some legal defense nonprofits that have received funds.

Sophia Genovese, a supervising attorney and clinical teaching fellow at Georgetown Law, said law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, can guard and even restrain a person in their custody who is receiving health care, but they must follow constitutional and health privacy laws regardless of the person’s immigration status. Under those laws, patients can ask to speak with medical providers in private and to seek and speak confidentially with legal counsel, she said.

“ICE should be stationed outside of the room or outside of earshot during any communication between the patient and their doctor or medical provider,” Genovese said, adding that the same applies to a patient’s communication with lawyers. “That’s what they’re supposed to do.”

ICE Guidelines

When it comes to communication and visits, ICE’s standards state that detainees should have access to a phone and be able to receive visits from family and friends, “within security and operational constraints.” However, these guidelines are not enforceable, Genovese said.

If immigration agents arrest someone without a warrant, they must tell them why they’ve been detained and generally can’t hold them for more than 48 hours without making a custody determination. A federal judge recently granted a temporary restraining order in a case in which a man named Bayron Rovidio Marin was monitored by immigration agents in a Los Angeles hospital for 37 days without being charged and was registered under a pseudonym.

In the past, perceived violations by agents could be reported to ICE leadership at local field offices, to the agency’s headquarters, or to an oversight body, Genovese said. But earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security cut staffing at ombudsman offices that investigate civil rights complaints, saying they “obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles.”

The assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, Tricia McLaughlin, said that agents arrested Marin for being in the country illegally and that he admitted his lack of legal status to ICE agents. She said agents took him to the hospital after he injured his leg while trying to evade federal officers during a raid. She said officers did not prevent him from seeing his family or from using the phone.

“All detainees have access to phones they can use to contact their families and lawyers,” she said.

McLaughlin said the temporary restraining order was issued by an “activist” judge. She did not address questions about staffing cuts at the ombudsman offices.

DHS also said Solis-Portillo was in the country illegally. The department said she had been removed from the United States twice and arrested for the crimes of false identification, theft, and burglary.

“ICE takes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in our custody very seriously,” McLaughlin said. “It is a long-standing practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This includes access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.”

Protections in California

Anaheim Global Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Dignity Health, which operates Glendale Memorial Hospital, said it “cannot legally restrict law enforcement or security personnel from being present in public areas which include the hospital lobby/waiting area.”

California enacted a law in September that prohibits medical establishments from allowing federal agents without a valid search warrant or court order into private areas, including places where patients receive treatment or discuss health matters. But many of the most high-profile news reports of immigration agents at health care facilities have involved detained patients brought in for care.

Erika Frank, vice president of legal counsel for the California Hospital Association, said hospitals have always had law enforcement, including federal agents, bring in people they’ve detained who need medical attention.

Hospitals will defer to law enforcement on whether a patient needs to be monitored at all times, according to association spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea. If law enforcement officers overhear medical information about a patient while they’re in the hospital, it doesn’t constitute a patient-privacy violation, she added.

“This is no different, legally, from a patient or visitor overhearing information about another patient in a nearby bed or emergency department bay,” Emerson-Shea said in a statement.

She didn’t address whether patients can demand privacy with providers and attorneys, and she said hospitals don’t tell family and friends about the detained patient’s location, for safety reasons.

Sandy Reding, who is president of the California Nurses Association and visited the Glendale facility when Solis-Portillo was there, said nurses and patients were frightened to see masked immigration agents in the hospital’s lobby. She said she saw them sitting behind a registration desk where they could hear people discuss private health information.

“Hospitals used to be a sanctuary place, and now they’re not,” she said. “And it seems like ICE has just been running rampant.”

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Nov. 18 on a proposal to provide more protections for detainees at county-operated health facilities. These include limiting the ability of immigration officials to hide patients’ identities, allowing patients to consent to the release of information to family members and legal counsel, and directing staff to insist immigration agents leave the room at times to protect patient privacy. The county would also defend employees who try to uphold its policies.

Solis-Portillo’s lawyer, Tanigawa-Lau, said her client ultimately decided to self-deport to El Salvador rather than fight her case, because she felt she couldn’t get the medical care she needed in ICE custody.

“Even though Milagro’s case is really terrible, I’m glad that there’s more awareness now about this issue,” Tanigawa-Lau said.

Republicans in the House could be on track today to approve the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, a vote that follows President Donald Trump's unexpected blessing for a measure that has driven rancor through the party and its base.

The bipartisan effort, which has been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., was long fought by Trump and Republican leadership from reaching the House floor. As recently as last week, White House officials met with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., about her support for releasing the files, but her position was unchanged after the meeting.

Trump has also attacked Republicans for pushing the measure, including Massie and most recently Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

However, Trump did an about face over the weekend as it became clear a vote in the House was likely to succeed, and said Republicans should approve the bill.

On Monday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Senate can take up the bill as well, and that he would sign it if it passes. The measure, if passed, would compel the Justice Department to release all of its files on the convicted sex offender within 30 days.

""I'm all for it,"" Trump said from the Oval Office, but maintained it was a ""hoax"" that he didn't want to ""detract"" from his party's success.

Trump does not need legislation in order to approve the files for release, but he told reporters that Congress ""can do whatever they want"" on the vote.

His remarks came after a simple majority of House members signed onto what is known as a discharge petition – a workaround that forces votes without leadership or committee approval. Last week, the chamber's newest member, Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., became the decisive 218th signature on the petition.

Grijalva's swearing in was delayed for seven weeks after her election, galvanizing Democrats who accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of stalling in order to put off the vote. Johnson rejected that claim, saying her oath of office would not be taken until the government shutdown fight was resolved. He also committed to not block the vote on the House floor.

Tuesday's expected vote also comes after a wave of Epstein files were released last week by members on the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. Democrats first released a set of three emails, followed by thousands of pages of new files released by the panel's chairman, James Comer, R-Ky. The documents triggered new questions about the extent of Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender before his death in 2019.

Ahead of the vote, Massie and Khanna plan to gather with survivors and their families and friends. They last appeared together in September on Capitol Hill to lobby for the release of the Epstein files, saying transparency was the path to holding those involved fully accountable.

Survivors reiterated that position in a Friday letter to Congress in which they urged the release of files relating to Epstein and his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving time at a Texas facility after her conviction on trafficking charges.

""Epstein and Maxwell's crimes exposed a double standard of justice, where rich and powerful men and women evade repercussions,"" they wrote.

Americans will likely face higher prices on items for their Thanksgiving dinners this year.

Turkey, typically the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal, will be one of the biggest sticker shocks for consumers. Wholesale prices for a turkey have jumped 40% from a year ago, according to the Department of Agriculture. Outbreaks of avian influenza, or bird flu, and increased demand have contributed to these higher prices.

Those opting for beef instead of turkey should also prepare to pay more. Beef prices are nearly 15% higher than they were last year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Canned vegetables are 5% more expensive compared to last year, due to higher packaging costs from the steel and aluminum tariffs the Trump administration put in place earlier this year.

President Trump announced Friday that he would be rolling back tariffs he imposed on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other commodities, in an effort to combat high prices at grocery stores.

David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, said those rollbacks won't lower prices completely, as tariffs aren't the only cause of increasing prices.

""By removing the tariffs, what we're doing is we're slowing down the increase in the price of many of these goods,"" Ortega said. ""So while we may not see prices go down for the holidays, it helps in terms of moderating the price increases that we've been accustomed to at the grocery store.""

Some grocery items have seen some price decreases in time for the holiday season. Egg prices have seen a decline from earlier this year, and domestic wine prices are down about 1.2% from last year due to a steady supply and softening demand.

Ortega says buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits or vegetables is one way consumers can avoid higher prices from aluminum packaging. He also recommends shoppers plan their meals out in advance, look for private label or store brands over name brands, and shop early for certain items to take advantage of sales or promotions grocery stores might have.

""It really pays off to plan ahead and create a shopping list, making sure you're sticking to it and avoiding impulse purchases,"" Ortega said.

This story was originally published by Boyle Heights Beat on Nov. 17, 2025.

After a report revealed federal immigration agents are allowed to interfere in medical decisions at Adventist Health White Memorial, the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network is calling for hospital administrators to uphold patient privacy and ensure that staff can advocate for patients without retaliation.

The article, published by LAist on Oct. 9, reported that hospital administrators are blocking doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care. Administrators at White Memorial have told doctors not to call a detained patient’s family members, even to find out what type of medication they’re on or what conditions they have, doctors told LAist.

Community demands stronger protections

Since then, community stakeholders who are part of the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network presented demands at a Nov. 5 meeting with hospital leaders, including Kerry Heinrich, the president and chief executive officer of Adventist Health System, and John Raffoul, president of Adventist Health White Memorial.

As part of those demands, the network — which is made up of residents and community leaders from organizations like Legacy LA, InnerCity Struggle and Centro CSO — wants immigration agents out of patient rooms during medical consultations and procedures. Many in the network have deep ties to White Memorial, including having friends who were born there or taking their children for care at the hospital.

Hospital issues memo in response to community concerns

In response, White Memorial, in a Nov. 12 memo, thanked community leaders for sharing their concerns and outlined the following five points:

“Every patient’s privacy is protected and respected. We follow the laws that keep people’s medical information private, and we take that responsibility very seriously.

Doctors and nurses make care decisions together with their patients. No outside groups tell them how to treat a patient.

When there is a medical reason to contact a family, our team can do that through the right process. There are rules we must follow, but our goal is always to support care and connection whenever possible.

Law enforcement officers cannot interfere with medical care or put anyone’s safety at risk. Our hospital protects the privacy and safety of everyone here — patients, families, and staff.

We stand by our care teams. They are supported and protected as they care for every person with kindness and respect.”

“We know trust takes time to build and can be lost quickly. Many of you told us that trust has been broken, and we understand that. We want to keep earning your trust through open communication, transparency, and action, not just words,” the memo reads.

The memo — signed by Juan De La Cruz, president of the Adventist Health White Memorial Charitable Foundation — does not specifically address the network’s demand that agents be kept out of patient rooms during medical consultations and procedures.

Leaders say the memo falls short of key demands

Raquel Roman, executive director of Proyecto Pastoral, which operates the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network, said White Memorial’s memo is a “good first attempt.” But, she added, “it doesn’t meet the demands we presented.”

“There is still opportunity to continue dialogue,” Roman said.

“Ultimately, we want to make sure our community and the doctors treating our community feel safe being at White Memorial, whether they go in there on their own or if somebody gets detained by ICE,” she said.

Lucy Herrera, executive director of Legacy LA, said the memo contained “a lot of gray area.”

“The way they [White Memorial] responded in the memo makes it seem like they’ve already been doing all of these things, when we’ve been hearing the opposite,” said Herrera.

Herrera said an open dialogue with White Memorial can be beneficial. “As a coalition, I want to stay vigilant to ensure that they comply with our demands,” she said.

For Henry Perez, executive director of InnerCity Struggle, the memo “signals that they have heard the community’s concerns.” However, he said, the hospital’s response is doing the “bare minimum.” As a hospital, “they already should be protecting patients’ privacy,” he said.

“White Memorial has the opportunity to fully stand with our immigrant communities … and it falls short of really communicating and conveying that they understand the horrors that our community is going through at the hands of ICE agents,” Perez said.

Sol Márquez, with the social justice group Centro CSO, wants White Memorial to make specific assurances that hospital staff won’t be punished when advocating for patients. In the memo, Marquez said, “I don’t think that they’re actually saying anything concrete.”

“We just really don’t want any of the staff to be reprimanded for asking ICE to leave the room, and for trying to make a rightful connection with the detainees and their families,” Márquez said.

Network presses for concrete changes in ongoing talks

As part of efforts to call attention to the issue, Centro CSO launched a petition soon after the LAist article was published, calling for White Memorial to uphold HIPAA, the federal law that safeguards patient privacy, and to bar U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from making medical decisions for patients.

It urges White Memorial not to retaliate against or reprimand doctors and nurses “for asking ICE to leave examination rooms.”

Sammy Carrera with Centro CSO said the petition has garnered more than 300 signatures so far.

The petition highlights the role of White Memorial in Boyle Heights.

“White Memorial is situated in a working-class neighborhood made up of predominantly Chicano, Latino, and undocumented people. ICE is bringing detainees to this hospital knowing their presence threatens the very community they are attacking and deporting,” the petition reads.

The Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network is meeting to discuss next steps. De La Cruz notes in the memo that the hospital is “committed to keeping the conversation going.”

“We are opening our doors for guided visits to help you see how care works inside the hospital. We are also creating new ways for you to be part of hospital discussions and advisory groups,” the memo reads.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting agreed Monday to fulfill a $36 million, multi-year contract with NPR that it had yanked after pressure from the Trump White House.

The arrangement resolves litigation filed by NPR accusing the corporation of illegally yielding to President Donald Trump's demands that the network be financially punished for its news coverage. The argument, part of a broader lawsuit by NPR and several stations against the Trump administration, focused on CPB funding for NPR's operation of a satellite distribution system for local public radio stations. NPR announced Monday it would waive all fees for the stations associated with the satellite service.

The judge in the case had explicitly told CPB's legal team he did not find its defense credible. CPB lawyers had argued that the decision to award the contract to a new consortium of public media institutions was driven by a desire to foster digital innovations more swiftly.

""The settlement is a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system in our legal challenge to [Trump's] Executive Order,"" Katherine Maher, President and CEO of NPR, said in a statement. ""While we entered into this dispute with CPB reluctantly, we're glad to resolve it in a way that enables us to continue to provide for the stability of the Public Radio Satellite System, offer immediate and direct support to public radio stations across the country, and proceed with our strong and substantive claims against this illegal and unconstitutional Executive Order. We look forward to our day in court in December.""

In its submission Monday evening to the court, CPB did not concede that it had acted wrongfully — nor that it had yielded to political pressure from the administration.

Instead, in a statement posted on its website, CPB asserted its side ""prevails"" as a result of the settlement.

""This is an important moment for public media,"" said Patricia Harrison, President and CEO of CPB. ""We are very pleased that this costly and unnecessary litigation is over, and that our investment in the future through [Public Media Infrastructure] marks an exciting new era for public media."" CPB had awarded a rival contract to PMI, a newly created consortium of public radio organizations including several major stations, to ensure the digital distribution system functions properly. That contract will continue, CPB said.

Federal subsidies for public broadcasting stopped on Oct. 1 as a result of a party-line vote over the summer by Congress, called a rescission. Only a skeleton crew remains at CPB, which was created as a nonprofit corporation more than a half-century ago to funnel federal subsidies to public media. While PBS has had layoffs and NPR is monitoring its own finances, many local stations across the country have been hit hard.

Over the course of the litigation this fall, mounting evidence appeared to demonstrate that CPB's board chair and executives had acted against NPR in what turned out to be a futile attempt to salvage the corporation's own future.

In hearings last month in Washington, D.C., U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss told CPB's legal team they had not made a credible case for why the corporation reneged on the contract just a day after a top White House official warned senior CPB leaders against doing business with NPR. A trial had been set to start on Dec. 1.

CPB's change of mind — and NPR's ensuing lawsuit — sparked consternation and unease within the larger public media ecosystem. The two organizations had served as partners for decades. But that relationship frayed earlier this year, as the system came under attack from the Trump administration.

Trump's public campaign against NPR and PBS started in earnest soon after he returned to the White House. Trump kicked it into high gear in late March with a series of social media posts.

In early April, CPB leaders sought to get money out the door before Trump took action against public media. On April 2, CPB's board approved the extension of a contract with NPR to distribute public radio programs, including those not produced by NPR. The arrangement stretched back four decades. The amount included millions still due on the then-current contract.

The next day, CPB's board chair and two senior executives met with a top White House budget official who attested to her ""intense dislike for NPR."" The budget official told them CPB didn't have to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" according to a deposition from CPB executive Clayton Barsoum submitted as part of NPR's legal filings.

And the day after that — just 48 hours after that board vote — CPB reversed itself. CPB executive Kathy Merritt informed NPR's top official over the satellite and distribution service that it had to be spun off: it could not be part of NPR. NPR refused to do so. CPB revised the scope of the contract and solicited new bids. NPR's submission proved unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, the White House was ramping up the pressure. It accused NPR and PBS of bias. On April 14, for example, it issued a formal statement that called their offerings ""radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news'."" NPR and PBS's chief executives have rejected the accusations of bias.

On May 1, Trump issued an executive order that no federal money should go to the two public broadcasting networks. NPR and three Colorado public radio stations then filed suit against the White House, saying they were being unlawfully punished because the president did not like their news coverage. They contended the executive order represented a violation of First Amendment protections. Their suit names CPB as a defendant as well for, in their characterization, bending to the president's will. In Monday's legal filing, CPB agreed that the executive order was precisely the sort of government interference that Congress sought to prevent in establishing CPB as it did.

In the summer, Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress, urged on by Trump, pulled back all $1.1 billion for future public broadcasting that had already been approved and signed into law by the president.

Throughout the legal battle, NPR has said, regardless of the outcome of the case, it would work with Public Media Infrastructure.

NPR's broader constitutional case against Trump's executive order purporting to ban federal funding of public media continues. A hearing on its merits is scheduled for December.

I don’t care.
I don’t care.” Super cold.
And they’re like: “We’re being transferred.” She said: “We’re going to transfer you to Maine.” I was like: Maine?
I don’t feel like this was a mistake.","I was reapplying for my work visa in the immigration office. I was doing everything completely legally. I came to the U.S. legally 11 and a half years ago. I was granted asylum. Then I got a notice to appear in one of ICE’s offices in June for what they called a routine check-in. We went to Cancún for vacation with my family. When we came back, got out of the plane, they pulled me aside and I didn’t understand why. They said: “You need to reapply through the consulate and we need to send you back to Canada.” And in my head, I thought that meant: OK, I’m just getting on a plane and going home. I was never concerned. I had a green card. I traveled multiple times before out of the country. I was sitting there, looking for flights to go home, and I was taken. They were like: “We have to detain you.” I was under arrest. With no explanation. It felt like I had been kidnapped. You’re kidnapping me. They said they are detaining and deporting people who are here illegally and criminals. I was never in the country illegally. I did not come here illegally. I was legal from day one. Having a mother taken away from her kids, I felt like a knife was just like — it’s like stabbing my heart. I never expect this in America. I was taken to the first detention center in chains. When I got there, I was like: Where am I? It looks like a prison. They took us to the booking. We’re asked to strip naked in front of each other. There were 30 of us in one cell, just like a line of bunks and then open showers and toilets. And you are supposed to use this toilet in front of 12, 14 other people. If I wanted to use the bathroom, I feel violated. What did we do to be treated this way? That is inhumane. I was treated like a criminal, like I killed somebody. And every single time I asked a question, it was: “I’m not your case officer. I don’t know. I’m just doing my job.” They said, “Listen, I know every one of you will say, ‘I left my kids at home with no one to take care of them.’ I don’t care. You will say that you haven’t eaten anything all day long. I don’t care. You will say that you’re terrified, you are here unjustly. I don’t care.” Super cold. Freezing, freezing. They nicknamed them the ICE boxes. I don’t think it’s more than 30 degrees. We’re huddled, trying to stay warm, wrapped in these aluminum foils, looking like dead bodies. There’s no window that you can look outside. I never was able to breathe fresh air. Fluorescent lights are shining 24/7. I couldn’t sleep. We kept hearing rats squeal, like, scream. One of the girls had her period, and there was blood everywhere. They knew I was on my menstrual cycle, but I was not offered to shower for five days. This nurse comes in, and she’s like: “Pregnancy test.” She made us pee in front of each other into these Dixie cups. We’re all just standing there in a circle, holding our open urine, and she’s plopping these pregnancy tests in and then being like: “OK, you guys are good. Chuck it back in the toilet.” The food was horrible. It was disgusting. I ended up getting very sick. I lost a lot of my weight. Twenty pounds. My body was really starting to shut down. I felt like, oh, my goodness, am I going to die here? I worked as a journalist in Egypt and I was persecuted and detained and tortured. My experience at the Butler County Jail was more traumatizing than my detention in Egypt. I got woken up in the middle of the night, and they’re like: “Jasmine, you’re leaving.” I jumped up. I’m like: I’m going home? And they’re like: “We’re being transferred.” She said: “We’re going to transfer you to Maine.” I was like: Maine? “You’re going to Arizona.” I’m like: Why am I going to Arizona? I begged every single guard for help. Can you please tell anyone, your supervisor, that I would love to pay for my flight home? Just get me out of here. ICE issued a statement saying I was was “detained for not having legal documentation to be in the U.S.” I do not support anyone being in a country illegally. I had all my paperwork. I was in the immigration office. I was never in the country illegally. It says “a green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation’s laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if a law is broken and abused.” In my early 20s, I was young. I was in college. I got in trouble for possession of marijuana. I was pardoned. It was dismissed. It’s been years. And I have renewed my green card twice. Never had an issue with immigration. “U.S.C.I.S. obtained evidence that indicated you provided material support to a Tier 3 terrorist organization.” I volunteered with a nonprofit that took care of orphans and poor and sick people in Egypt. So basically, they tried to link this nonprofit which is a most reputable, respected nonprofit to a Tier 3 undesignated terrorist organization. This is how they framed it. I don’t feel like this was a mistake. I feel like this was on purpose. That is not a rare case. This is systematic. They are just grabbing anyone that they can. They’re trying to find ways to deport as many people, even if these people were here legally. Not knowing what’s going to happen to me, it felt like that was the worst because I wanted just to call my husband. I wanted to hear my kids, that my kids are OK. During the time that I was there, it was also my daughter’s birthday. I feel like they took that away from me. I was scared they were going to forget me. I was put on solitary confinement for six days for advocating for myself and the other Muslim inmates to have a quiet space to pray. That’s when my mental health started to deteriorate too fast. “It’s just a matter of time. You will get deported and get killed in Egypt.” That was the thing that I couldn’t get out of my mind. I’ll just get deported and get killed. I had a medical check, and I had to go visit this nurse. She could tell that I was distraught and confused, and she looked at me. And she goes: “Can I pray for you?” And she said this beautiful prayer in Spanish that I have no idea what she was saying. I just cried, and I cried. And I cried. And she just held my hands, and I was like: OK, I’m going to get through this. An officer called and said, “Pack your stuff.” Where am I going? “Just pack your stuff.” I was transferred back to the San Diego prison. It was a two-hour drive. Someone just grabbed me and said: “You’re coming with me this way.” She’s like: “Yeah, Uncuff her. She’s being released today.” My eyes just like: What? He said, “You are released.” I actually forget what the word ‘released’ mean in English, to be honest. It just, I didn’t — “What do you mean by released?” I was in shock. They stripped the chains off of me quickly, snuck me into the airport, escort me onto the plane, sit me down, and they’re like: “OK, you’re free. You can use your cellphone now. Take care.” And they’re kind of like, “Outside.” And I did not know where to go. I didn’t have a phone. An officer said, “We just got this letter today. The Department of Homeland Security reinstated your asylum status. It was the happiest moment of my entire life. [ARABIC SPEAKING] “Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah.” So the first thing we did was to drive to the mosque. Then we went out to eat in a Palestinian restaurant. I ate a lot. I was happy to see my husband. I was more happy to see my girls, no offense. The youngest one was having nightmares and kept waking up. So I knew they needed me and just reassure them I’m OK, even though it’s still hard for me. It’s still fragile. I am a different person than the person that got detained. I lost my job that I love. I lost my health insurance. I was not able to finish my degree all because I got detained for 73 days. I was so lucky to have only been in there for two weeks. Can you imagine someone in the system that doesn’t have my privilege, all the lawyers, all the money, all my connections? The majority of the women that I met have been in there for months. I received a five-year ban from America. Everyone asked me, they’re like: “Well, you’re never going to go back, are you?” I’m appealing. I want to go back. I love America. I am in the process now of getting my citizenship. I still love the American people. But I’m doubting if I’ll ever feel safe and call the United States my home. I don’t think this government will stop. Your government is funding a system that doesn’t follow any rules. Immigrants will be the first target. After that, they will target any opposition. Violating due process this time means they will violate it again and again and again.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/13/arts/17op-ice-detention-clean-thumb/17op-ice-detention-clean-thumb-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay,N,,2025-11-18 03:56:38.090865

(AP) — Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh as soon as Tuesday, the mayor of the state’s capital city said, while Customs and Border Protection agents continue operating in Charlotte following a weekend that saw arrests of more than 130 people in that city.

Mayor Janet Cowell said Monday that she didn’t know how large the operation would be or how long agents would be present. Immigration authorities haven’t spoken about it. The Democrat said in a statement that crime was lower in Raleigh this year compared to last and that public safety was a priority for her and the city council.

“I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges,” Cowell said in a statement.

U.S. immigration agents arrested more than 130 people over the weekend in a sweep through Charlotte, North Carolina’s largest city, a federal official said Monday.

The movements in North Carolina come after the Trump administration launched immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago. Both of those are deep blue cities in deep blue states run by nationally prominent officials who make no secret of their anger at the White House. The political reasoning there seemed obvious.

But why North Carolina and why was Charlotte the first target there?

Sure the mayor is a Democrat, as is the governor, but neither is known for wading into national political battles. In a state where divided government has become the norm, Gov. Josh Stein in particular has tried hard to get along with the GOP-controlled state legislature. The state's two U.S. senators are both Republican and President Donald Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.

The Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents.

But maybe focusing on a place where politics is less outwardly bloody was part of the equation.

The White House “can have enough opposition (to its crackdown), but it's a weaker version"" than what it faced in places like Chicago, said Rick Su, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who studies local government, immigration and federalism.

“They’re not interested in just deporting people. They’re interested in the show,” he said.

The crackdown

The Trump administration has made Charlotte, a Democratic city of about 950,000 people, its latest focus for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime — despite local opposition and declining crime rates. Residents reported encounters with immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Border Patrol officers had arrested “over 130 illegal aliens who have all broken” immigration laws. The agency said the records of those arrested included gang membership, aggravated assault, shoplifting and other crimes, but it did not say how many cases had resulted in convictions, how many people had been facing charges or any other details.

The crackdown set off fierce objections from area leaders.

“We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color,” Stein said in a video statement late Sunday. “This is not making us safer. It’s stoking fear and dividing our community.”

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Monday she was “deeply concerned” about videos she’s seen of the crackdown but also said she appreciates protesters’ peacefulness.

“To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: You are not alone. Your city stands with you,” she said in a statement.

The debate over crime and immigration

Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County have both found themselves part of America’s debates over crime and immigration, two of the most important issues to the White House.

The most prominent was the fatal stabbing this summer of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train, an attack captured on video. While the suspect was from the U.S., the Trump administration repeatedly highlighted that he had been arrested previously more than a dozen times.

Charlotte, which had a Republican mayor as recently as 2009, is now a city dominated by Democrats, with a growing population brought by a booming economy. The racially diverse city includes more than 150,000 foreign-born residents, officials say.

Lyles easily won a fifth term as mayor earlier this month, defeating her Republican rival by 45 percentage points even as GOP critics blasted city and state leaders for what they call rising incidents of crime. Following the Nov. 4 election, Democrats are poised to hold 10 of the other 11 seats on the city council.

While the Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on the state because of sanctuary policies, North Carolina county jails have long honored “detainers,” or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them. Nevertheless, some common, noncooperation policies have existed in a handful of places, including Charlotte, where the police do not help with immigration enforcement.

In Mecklenburg County, the jail did not honor detainer requests for several years, until after state law effectively made it mandatory starting last year.

DHS said about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored since October 2020, putting the public at risk.

For years, Mecklenburg Sheriff Garry McFadden pushed back against efforts by the Republican-controlled state legislature to force him and a handful of sheriffs from other urban counties to accept ICE detainers.

Republicans ultimately overrode a veto by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper late last year to enact the bill into law.

While McFadden has said his office is complying with the law’s requirement, he continued a public feud with ICE leaders in early 2025 that led to a new state law toughening those rules. Stein vetoed that measure, but the veto was overridden.

Republican House Speaker Destin Hall said in a Monday post on X that immigration agents are in Charlotte because of McFadden’s past inaction: “They’re stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city.”

Last month, McFadden said he'd had a productive meeting with an ICE representative.

“I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.

But such talk doesn't calm the political waters.

“Democrats at all levels are choosing to protect criminal illegals over North Carolina citizens,” state GOP Chairman Jason Simmons said Monday.

Rutilio Vázquez, who lives in the East Valley Farms neighborhood, says federal agents arrived at 5:30 a.m. Thursday, with bright lights, drones, and loud commands as they ordered people to exit one of the properties.

“When they talk, they say that we are federal police or something like that. ‘We want you to come out with hands on your head,’” he told KSBY News in Spanish.

ICE reports that three undocumented people from Mexico and one U.S. citizen were arrested. Investigators allege a labor recruiter named Jorge Vasquez collected illegal fees – in one case up to $8,000, including a $1,000 upfront deposit – in exchange for the opportunity to work in the U.S. under H-2A visas.

According to ICE, the money was deducted from the farm workers’ wages and the workers were threatened with violence or deportation if they failed to comply or complained to government inspectors.

During the raid, multiple community members arrived, attempting to confront law enforcement. Federal agents deployed flash-bangs in an attempt to disperse the crowd.

""As the capital city, it is important to us that everyone who lives, works, plays, and learns in Raleigh feels safe,"" Cowell said in a statement. ""We have been made aware that Customs and Border Protection are coming to Raleigh. While the Raleigh Police Department is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law. I can confirm that RPD has not participated in any immigration planning activities.

""Above all, Raleigh is a safe city, with crime down year-over-year. Public safety is a priority for me and this City Council,"" the mayor continued. ""This is a key moment to reaffirm our commitment to serving all members of our community. If you need help from the police, you call 911, and help will come. I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges. Together we are Raleigh Strong.""

Other Democrats, including Durham Mayor Leo Williams and Gov. Josh Stein also reacted to the news of federal action.

""We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights and compromises safety,"" Williams said. ""Durham does not operate from fear. We lead with compassion, justice and determination. Our schools, neighborhoods and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages and experiences that define Durham.""

Stein said, ""Our office is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh. Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations. Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte. To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement. Let's keep each other safe.""

In Morrisville, Councilmember Steve Rao said he was already getting messages from people wondering what documentation they should carry with them.

""Uncertainty about paper work, what kind of paperwork should I have in my car if I'm driving, do I need to have my immigration status, my visa, am I waiting for a green card?"" said Rao.

Agents spent the weekend in Charlotte. Protests were held across Charlotte before and during the agents' presence.

While many of the raids in Charlotte targeted Hispanic-owned businesses, Rao also worried about the possible effects on Morrisville's large South Asian population.

""So there is this fear and uncertainty about how you're treated, how you're handled,"" Rao said. ""I think many Indian-Americans are here legally on skilled immigration visas. There's been concerns about fees being increased to $100,000 from $5,000 for applying for those. And if there are people here illegally, whether their paperwork has transpired or whatever, these people need to know their rights.""

On Sunday in Raleigh, hundreds of people marched from Moore Square to the State Capitol in downtown Raleigh to protest what they saw happening in Charlotte.

A top Border Patrol commander touted dozens of arrests in North Carolina's largest city on Sunday as Charlotte residents reported encounters with federal immigration agents near churches and apartment complexes. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched Operation Charlotte's Web, which they say resulted in more than 80 arrests.

The Trump administration has made the Democrat-run city of about 950,000 people its latest target for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime, despite fierce objections from local leaders and declining crime rates.

Morrisville issues safety guidance

Meanwhile, Morrisville's mayor Pro-Tem Satish Garimella posted this guidance and warning on Facebook for people who live in Morrisville and Wake County.

""We've received information that there may be ICE activity in the Raleigh area tomorrow might be a day or more. Out of an abundance of caution, please make sure you have your ID, a copy of your passport, and any important immigration documents with you if you need to go out. It's also a good idea to keep your original documents in a safe place where someone you trust can access them if needed. If you prefer and are able to stay home, that is also an option. Sharing this only to ensure everyone stays informed and prepared. Please pass this message along to anyone who might need it. Thank you and stay safe.""

Green Party MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns said she was ""really worried"" about Monday's announcement.
Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.
There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.
Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".","The government's plans to fast-track the deportation of illegal migrants and a major overhaul of human rights law have been described as ""inhumane"".

Green Party MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns said she was ""really worried"" about Monday's announcement.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood detailed sweeping reforms of the UK's immigration policy, meaning anyone granted asylum will be returned home if their country is deemed safe in the future.

Addressing the House of Commons, the minister said she had a ""moral duty"" to fix the ""broken asylum system"" and ""unite what is today a divided country"".

Chowns responded: ""The right to seek asylum for someone fleeing violence in their home country... is a basic principle of international law and it's also a basic principle of our shared humanity.

""And it appears what the government is trying to do is really lean into this whole narrative that all of the problems in the country are to do with people coming over in small boats.

""It's completely false and it's deeply, deeply concerning.""

Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.

It would mean only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, would be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

And the UK will also join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9b0f/live/617f15c0-c3de-11f0-bbb8-f506e20a7d44.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 02:56:36.734055

The expected action comes after U.S. Border Patrol agents reportedly arrested over 130 people in Charlotte this weekend in places like restaurants, grocery stores, Home Depot parking lots and an east Charlotte church, The Charlotte Observer reported.

“As the capital city, it is important to us that everyone who lives, works, plays and learns in Raleigh feels safe,” Cowell said in a statement Monday night.

“We have been made aware that Customs and Border Protection are coming to Raleigh,” she continued. “While the Raleigh Police Department is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law. I can confirm that RPD has not participated in any immigration planning activities.”

The Wake County Sheriff’s Office has not received official notification about U.S. Customs and Border Protection being in the area, according to an email from the Sheriff’s Office.

“However, if any operation or activity should occur, I kindly ask all residents to refrain from engaging or confronting Border Control personnel and allow them to carry out their official duties,” according to a statement on behalf of Sheriff Willie Rowe. “The safety and well-being of our community remains the primary concern of the Wake County Sheriff’s Office, and we strive to avoid circumstances that may lead to injuries or unnecessary arrests.”

Gov. Josh Stein’s office has not received any outreach from the White House, Stein’s spokesperson said. The Democratic governor said in a statement that his office “is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh.”

“Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,” Stein said in the statement. “Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.

“To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement. Let’s keep each other safe.”

U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are different agencies. The Border Patrol is the law enforcement arm of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It has been sent to cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and, most recently, Charlotte.

The news of a possible Border Patrol action in Raleigh on Tuesday was first reported by INDY and The Assembly Monday night.

Crime is down year-over-year in Raleigh, and public safety is a priority for the City Council, Cowell said in her statement.

“This is a key moment to reaffirm our commitment to serving all members of our community,” she said. “If you need help from the police, you call 911, and help will come. I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges.”

Durham leaders denounce Border Patrol actions

In Durham, Mayor Leo Williams opened Monday night’s City Council meeting with a joint statement from him; Nida Allam, chair of the Durham County Board of Commissioners; and Bettina Umstead, chair of the Durham school board.

“We’re deeply troubled by recent news accounts of increased presence of immigration officers in and around North Carolina,” Williams read. “We want to assert a courageous stance on behalf of our immigrant communities that are essential to the fabric of our state and city. We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights and compromises safety.

“Durham does not operate from fear,” he added. “We lead with compassion, justice, determination. Our schools, neighborhoods and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages and experiences that define Durham.”

Concerns about who will be targeted

State Democratic leaders representing Charlotte said earlier Monday that the arrests amounted to racial profiling, The N&O reported. Mecklenburg County Democratic Rep. Carolyn Logan denounced the tactics of “reaching and grabbing ... for whoever they can see and grabbing them off the street. They don’t know if they’re criminals, they’re just looking to skin color.”

Later Monday, after news about Raleigh broke, State Sen. Lisa Grafstein, a Wake County Democrat, said in a text to The N&O that she shares concerns raised by Stein after the Border Patrol deployment in Charlotte “about the methods being used and the violent targeting of people who are simply living their lives peacefully.”

“We saw in Chicago that the vast majority of people being targeted have no criminal history,” Grafstein said. “Many of the actions we are seeing are unconstitutional and are bringing violence and chaos. I hope and believe that the people of Wake County — a welcoming and diverse community — will look out for each other.”

Rep. Phil Rubin, a former federal prosecutor and a Wake County Democrat, said the conduct in Charlotte was “unacceptable, un-American, and dangerous.” In a news release, he urged residents — including immigrants, who have rights — to know their rights ahead of federal agents’ expected presence in Raleigh.

“During my service as a federal prosecutor right here in Raleigh, I worked with federal agents — people who used their immense power carefully, targeted dangerous offenders to keep our communities safe and lived their oath to uphold the Constitution,” Rubin said. “What we’ve seen from federal agents in Charlotte is not the work of the federal law enforcement I knew. It would not have been tolerated then, and we should not tolerate it now.”

Asked about the Triangle deployment, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson shared a statement about the people arrested in Charlotte over the weekend, “who have all broken the immigration laws of our country.”

“Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony,” the Homeland Security statement says.

The Observer reported that federal immigration agencies have not released names or paperwork, or said where those arrested are being detained, so the claim about records could not be verified.

“We will not stop enforcing the laws of our nation until every criminal illegal alien is arrested and removed from our country,” the Homeland Security statement says.

The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department was dispatched at around 10:40 p.m., according to a news release.
The teenager and his family, who are all U.S. citizens, “were already scared to begin with” before the incident, Kirakosian said.
Rodriguez interrogated him, asking where he and his family were from and demanded identification, Kirakosian said, for nearly 20 minutes.
Kirakosian said this incident likely resulted in an arrest because the agent was off duty.","An off-duty law enforcement officer was arrested in Riverside County last week after pulling a firearm on a 17-year-old and detaining him on the side of the road.

Gerardo Rodriguez, 46, was known by neighbors to be an agent employed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Patrol, said Greg Kirakosian, a lawyer representing the teenager.

An ICE spokesperson wrote that Rodriguez is not employed by the agency. A CBP spokesperson said in a statement: “This matter is under investigation.”

The teenager had driven by Rodriguez’s home in Temecula to drop friends off at a nearby house at around 10 p.m. on Nov. 10, Kirakosian said. When he drove back he was stopped by Rodriguez, who pulled a gun. The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department was dispatched at around 10:40 p.m., according to a news release.

Rodriguez was taken into custody without incident the next day and charged with assault by a public officer, child endangerment and assault with a deadly weapon, the Sheriff’s Department said. He posted bail the same day and his next court date is scheduled for Dec. 26.

The teenager and his family, who are all U.S. citizens, “were already scared to begin with” before the incident, Kirakosian said.

“They’re Mexican Americans, you know, in Southern California right now, and there’s ICE raids happening left and right,” he said.

Security camera footage from a neighbor shows Rodriguez “in the middle of the street, kind of marching down with a gun in his hand,” Kirakosian said.

“It’s not like he pulled it out in an emergency. He had it out. He was walking down the street with a gun in his hand,” he said.

As he sees the truck approach, Rodriguez walks toward the middle of the street, pulls out a gun and points it at the vehicle.

“Stop, stop. Slow down. Freeze. Police,” Rodriguez yells.

The teenager feared he would be shot, Kirakosian said, so he stopped. Rodriguez ordered him to park, again identifying himself as police, then approached the driver’s side and pointed his gun at the teenager. Rodriguez interrogated him, asking where he and his family were from and demanded identification, Kirakosian said, for nearly 20 minutes.

In the video, Rodriguez argues with the teenager, claiming he was speeding down the street. He repeatedly claims the teenager almost ran him over.

The teenager’s friends, who were still at a house nearby, saw the incident and notified parents who were also at the home and approached Rodriguez, eventually persuading him to let the teenager go, according to Kirakosian. They called the teenager’s mother, who immediately grabbed her son’s passport to prove his citizenship, he said. By the time the mother had arrived, Rodriguez had left, and they then called the police.

Police obtained a search warrant and confiscated Rodriguez’s security camera footage and the gun when they arrested him, Kirakosian said.

The incident is the latest in a growing number of armed confrontations involving ICE agents or people posing as them confronting people and demanding identification. An ICE agent was confronted by local police when he pulled a gun on a woman in Fullerton this month, and multiple ICE and Border Patrol shootings have taken place in and outside Southern California in recent months.

Kirakosian said this incident likely resulted in an arrest because the agent was off duty.

“You got ICE agents who apparently feel so emboldened by what they do on a day-to-day basis, they’re essentially treating their own neighborhoods as an area they need to start investigating,” Kirakosian said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/937907a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Fef%2Fee6ba1ba44218b788e7ac2e7984a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2195569366,N,,2025-11-18 02:56:48.688886

""We have elderly folks who are not getting medical help they need because they are afraid,""

On Monday evening, Sen. Graig Meyer, a Democrat who represents Caswell, Person, and Orange counties, told ABC11 that federal agents will be in Raleigh as early as Tuesday this week.

Grassroots advocacy organizations such as Brava NC are partnering up, as they believe the effects of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Charlotte are already being felt across the state.

Santillan recommended that people who are concerned seek legal advice.

""I'm a naturalized citizen myself, and I have considered carrying my passport with me as a precautionary measure because right now we know they have questioned and harassed American citizens. So, nobody is really safe,"" she said.

This comes as the DHS launched Operation Charlotte's Web, an effort aimed at targeting people with criminal records who are in the country illegally. DHS said it is surging law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.

""We're seeing an increase in street stops and workplace stops,"" said Eisha Jain, the Henry P. Brandis Distinguished Professor of Law at UNC-Chapel Hill.

Jain said these efforts are similar to those in Chicago and Los Angeles. Though immigration enforcement efforts are in Charlotte now, she wouldn't rule out ICE's presence in other parts of the state, such as the Triangle, later.

Jaine told ABC11 that there's a lot of uncertainty as to why people are stopped and what happens during that interaction.

“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said.

(KTLA) – A 45-year-old California man who reportedly works as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent is accused of illegally detaining a minor at gunpoint while off duty last week.

The Nov. 10 incident, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, played out at around 10:30 pm outside a home in Temecula, California.

Lawyer Greg Kirakosian, who represents the boy and his family, told Nexstar’s KTLA that the 17-year-old was driving home after dropping a friend off down the street when he saw the suspect, identified by investigators as Gerardo Rodriguez, pointing a gun at his vehicle and demanding he pull over.

“In the moment, I think he was just scared for his life. He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” Kirakosian explained, referring to the teen. “Then that same person came up to his driver’s side door and pulled him out at gunpoint.”

In footage of the incident obtained by KTLA, the 45-year-old is seen pulling a gun from his waistband as he walks up the street, pointing it at the teen’s truck and demanding he stop the vehicle while reportedly brandishing his badge.

“Freeze, police,” Rodriguez shouts. “Put the car in f****** park. Get out of the car. Turn it off, get out. You’re speeding in the f****** neighborhood. Come over here, sit down, get your a** down. You have a driver’s license?”

The 45-year-old, who is known to residents on the street as an ICE agent and also reportedly told the boy he worked for ICE, then began interrogating the Mexican American teen, asking him who he was, where he is from and demanding documentation, eventually drawing the attention of others who live on the street.

“By the time our client’s parents showed up, the neighbors had essentially come to the rescue and stopped him from doing what he was doing, calming him down and forcing him to go back inside his house and leaving the boy alone,” Kirakosian said.

The teenager’s parents had been alerted by a friend to what was happening, prompting them to rush over from their home with their son’s passport, fearing the incident could be some type of immigrant enforcement operation. They called 911 after they arrived.

Responding deputies turned the investigation over to RCSD’s Investigation Bureau, who contacted Rodriguez later the same night, arrested him and conducted a search of his house “where evidence related to the investigation was collected,” the department said in a news release.

“I think right now, a lot of Mexican Americans, whether they are in a situation like this or not, who are angry upset and scared, and this just really came close to home for them,” Kirakosian said when asked how the family was doing after the harrowing ordeal.

The L.A.-based civil rights attorney added that he believes the 45-year-old has become emboldened by what he does and sees other ICE agents doing on a day-to-day basis.

“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said. “I don’t know how much worse the situation is going to get, honestly. This kid could’ve been shot.”

This incident comes after several others in which federal law enforcement agents have pulled their firearms on citizens.

On Nov. 9, video captured an ICE officer pointing his gun at a woman behind him in an intersection in Santa Ana, California, witnessed by a Fullerton police officer returning from the Santa Ana Jail facility, who refused to get involved if no crime had been committed.

Federal officials later claimed the woman was following the agent.

On Oct. 30, a 24-year-old Ontario man was shot by a federal agent who was reportedly trying to notify officers involved in an enforcement operation that there were children across the street.

In that instance, federal officials claimed the agent fired “defensive shots” while fearing the 24-year-old was attempting to run over officers.

As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center on allegations of assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer. Jail records show he posted bond and was released the same night.

KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.

The proposals have been brought forward by Minister for Justice Jim O'Callaghan and Minister of State Colm Brophy.
Mr O'Callaghan said ""every country has a right to introduce its own migration policy"".
The minister stressed that changes to the UK asylum laws ""can have an impact in Ireland"" and ""have had an impact in the past"".
""But that's not to say that the UK can't change their asylum laws.","The Coalition leaders are meeting in Dublin and are expected to sign off on a further tightening of migration rules, relating to the criteria for family reunifications.

The proposals have been brought forward by Minister for Justice Jim O'Callaghan and Minister of State Colm Brophy.

If passed by Cabinet next week, it will likely result in a reduction in the total number arriving under the family reunification policy which stood at 22,000 last year.

Applicants seeking family reunification will also have to be self sufficient and not owe accommodation costs.

Separately, the Coalition leaders are also discussing plans to change the current requirement that people who are granted refugee status may apply for naturalisation after three years' resident.

The new proposal would increase that to five years.

It comes as Minister O'Callaghan said earlier that Ireland will need to be ""nimble"" and may need to change its own laws and provisions in order to respond to a proposed overhaul in UK asylum laws.

Britain is set to overhaul its approach to human rights' laws to make it easier to deport migrants who arrive illegally, in a major shake-up of asylum policy.

Mr O'Callaghan said he expects the proposed changes to UK asylum laws will have an impact on Ireland and that the Government may have to change the law here in response.

In a statement this evening, the minister said he and the Government are aware that changes to the UK's asylum practices or laws can result in changes to the flow of asylum seekers between the UK and Ireland.

""I am committed to ensuring that Ireland is not viewed more favourably than the UK by those seeking to claim asylum,"" he said.

Mr O'Callaghan said he will closely monitor the changes proposed by the UK government and will ""respond to those proposals having considered them fully and discussed them with Government colleagues"".

""I will be publishing a new International Protection Bill to reform Ireland's asylum system later this year and any necessary changes arising from the UK’s change of policy can be included in that Bill,"" he said.

""Prior to the changes proposed by Home Secretary Mahmood, I had already directed a separate review of Ireland's rules on family reunification and will shortly bring proposals to Government in respect of this issue.""

The minister also spoke earlier at Farmleigh House following the British Irish-Intergovernmental Conference where he and Tánaiste Simon Harris met British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Hilary Benn and Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Matthew Patrick.

Mr O'Callaghan said ""every country has a right to introduce its own migration policy"".

""The British government has every right to bring forward its own proposals, but we would ask and are grateful for close engagement, because we clearly have interdependencies here because of the contract here,"" he said.

The minister stressed that changes to the UK asylum laws ""can have an impact in Ireland"" and ""have had an impact in the past"".

""But that's not to say that the UK can't change their asylum laws. They're perfectly entitled to change their asylum laws, and I thank them again for giving us a heads up in respect of it, however, what it does indicate is that I suppose we need to be nimble in Ireland as we may need to change our laws and our provisions as well to respond to any changes that have taken place in the UK,"" he said.

Mr Benn said he did not believe any of the new proposals would put the UK at odds with its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.

""The British government is absolutely committed to the European Convention of Human Rights, unlike other parties in Britain who want to take us out of it, and that really would undermine the Good Friday Agreement, which has seen so much progress take place in Northern Ireland,"" he said.

Mr Benn said there is a debate going on in the Council of Europe about the interpretation and application of various aspects of the ECHR, adding that ""there is a great deal of public concern about illegal migration to the United Kingdom"".

""This is undoubtedly the case, and that's why it's vital we have a system that everyone can have confidence in, that can distinguish between those who are trying to move for other reasons by claiming asylum, when, in fact, the sovereign system is there for people who are fleeing persecution,"" Mr Benn said.",https://www.rte.ie/images/00237e88-1600.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 22:56:15.963627

This move is designed to create confusion and uncertainty

“This move is designed to create confusion and uncertainty. The courts have determined that public charge has a very narrow meaning and that it does not apply to benefits like health care that everyone inevitably needs at some point in their life. But now, immigration officials are sure to make inconsistent and arbitrary decisions, forcing families to guess at what programs may or may not count,” said Sarah Grusin, Senior Attorney at the National Health Law Program. “This is yet another breach of trust that will push families back into the shadows and deter them from seeking health care. NHeLP and our partners will fight to stop these harmful changes to public charge, just as we did during Trump’s first term.”

The current Biden-era rule’s definition of “public charge” assures families that immigration officials will not count most public benefits. Under the current rule, only cash assistance for income maintenance and government-funded long-term institutional care are considered in public charge determinations, meaning use of programs like most Medicaid, nutrition assistance, and housing support do not threaten an individual’s immigration status.

During the previous Trump administration, changes to the definition of public charge went well beyond the settled, historic understanding of public charge, causing widespread fear in immigrant communities and leading many to withdraw from or avoid enrolling in public programs, even when they or their children were fully eligible.

Refugee status

In a document outlining the changes, the government warns being granted refugee status ""is to essentially receive the ability to live in this country, forever"" - and must change to ""reflect our changing times"".

Refugee status will become temporary and subject to review every two and a half years under a ""core protection"" offer, way down from five years of initial right to remain currently offered.

Anyone granted refugee status will be removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe, while the wait for permanent status will be quadrupled to 20 years.

How UK and Denmark's immigration policies compare

Safe and legal routes

Refugee charities often claim the reason so many people cross the Channel in small boats is because there are not enough safe and legal routes asylum seekers can take to the UK.

The government has said it will introduce new routes. For those arriving on these for work and study, they could be offered long-term status in 10 years, subject to consultation.

Local communities will be able to sponsor individual refugees granted asylum, like the Homes for Ukraine scheme.

More families to be deported

The government says a ""hesitancy"" to deport families can lead to ""particularly perverse incentives"", such as people risking bringing their child to the UK illegally on the assumption that this will make them less likely to be removed.

To change this, there will be no automatic right to family reunion for refugees unless they successfully enter the ""protection work and study"" route and become eligible to sponsor family members.

Children won't be separated from the parents during deportations, though, it is understood.

Financial support not guaranteed

Currently, the government has a legal obligation to provide support to asylum seekers who would otherwise be ""destitute"", but the document says the government will remove this.

Housing and weekly allowances will be discretionary and no longer be guaranteed.

Those with a right to work in the UK who can support themselves but don't may be denied housing and benefits, while those with income and assets such as cars will have to contribute to their costs.

A new body to speed up appeals

A new appeals body will be created to speed up the time it takes to decide whether to refuse an asylum application, allowing those who fail to be deported sooner.

It will be staffed by ""professionally trained adjudicators"", the document states.

Those whose claims are denied will be limited to one appeal. They can currently make several on different grounds.

Human rights law changes

The Tories and Reform have advocated leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), something the prime minister - who was a human rights lawyer - is reluctant to do.

But new legislation will be brought forward to ensure the ECHR's ""right to family life"" clause is balanced against the public interest, as it has been used to prevent deportations.

Ministers will also work with international partners to reform part of the treaty designed to prohibit torture and inhuman treatment, which they say has allowed foreign criminals to stay in the UK because of how it is interpreted.",https://e3.365dm.com/25/11/1600x900/skynews-shabana-mahmood-small-boats_7084629.jpg?20251118000216,N,,2025-11-17 20:57:01.907920

Burns has been using artificial intelligence to generate audio recordings of his courtroom decisions at the New York Broadway Immigration Court, according to internal Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) records obtained by Migrant Insider.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by:

“That seems highly unusual,” said a senior Justice Department official familiar with EOIR operations, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. The official could not confirm whether Burns employs the AI to draft full written decisions or only to read his written rulings aloud using text‑to‑speech software, according to audio files reviewed by Migrant Insider.

A Test Case for AI in the Immigration Courts

The concern comes months after Acting EOIR Director Sirce E. Owen circulated Policy Memorandum 25‑40, which acknowledged that the immigration courts have “neither a blanket prohibition on the use of generative AI in its proceedings nor a mandatory disclosure requirement regarding its use.”

The August memo—distributed internally to all immigration judges and court administrators—permitted individual courts to adopt local standing orders on AI use but did not require them to disclose when such technologies are applied in adjudications.

The memo’s omission of any restriction on text‑to‑voice or AI‑generated decision delivery appears to leave it to individual judges’ discretion. Burns appears to be among the first to take advantage of that gap. His courtroom assistants said the use of “voice rendering” software began earlier this year and is now a regular feature of his decisions.

One of the Nation’s Most Restrictive Judges

Burns’ use of AI tools comes amid controversy over his record as one of the most restrictive immigration judges in the country. According to data compiled by

, Burns approved just 2 percent of asylum claims between fiscal 2019 and 2025—compared with a national average of 57.7 percent. Pathfinder data show the same 2 percent benchmark, placing him among the lowest nationwide.

The numbers have fueled criticism from immigration advocates, who say the fusion of extreme denial rates with opaque AI‑assisted adjudication threatens defendants’ faith in the system. “When a person’s freedom depends on a judge’s voice, there needs to be certainty that it’s the judge’s own reasoning being rendered—not a synthesized layer of technology,” said one immigration lawyer who practices before the Broadway court.

A Highly Controversial Appointment

Internal EOIR emails released through the memos show that Burns’ path to the bench was unusually political. Initially interviewed in May 2020, he was rated “highly qualified” by two Assistant Chief Immigration Judges for his litigation experience but ranked overall as “Not Recommend.” Senior EOIR leadership later overrode that ranking—reclassifying him as “Highly Recommended” in September 2020, just as Trump‑era DOJ officials accelerated appointments of judges with prosecutorial backgrounds.

At the time of his selection, Burns served as an Assistant Chief Counsel for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in New York, where he represented the government in removal proceedings and appeals. His résumé and military record were cited in his eventual appointment announcement that December, one of 14 judges named by the outgoing administration. Nearly all came from government enforcement roles, according to EOIR data logs.

Pattern of Political Replacement

The Burns memos form part of a broader DOJ paper trail indicating a systematic reshaping of the immigration judiciary. Recent EOIR correspondence references the removal—through firings and resignations—of more than 125 judges since January, replaced with politically aligned appointees.

An August rule further loosened hiring standards, allowing the Attorney General to appoint “any licensed attorney” as a temporary immigration judge.

Broader Due Process Implications

EOIR declined to comment on Burns’ use of text‑to‑voice technology or his designation history. A Justice Department spokesperson responded only that “immigration judges apply the law to the facts of each case.”

But as AI applications quietly enter immigration courtrooms without disclosure requirements or oversight, experts warn of an accelerating shift. “We’re witnessing the automation of adjudication in a system that already struggles with fairness,” said one former EOIR official. “When the human element fades, so does accountability.”

The Trump White House “inherited this terrible inflation crisis from the Biden administration,” Vance said.
The vice president then blamed immigrants for the administration’s lack of action to make housing more affordable.
Christopher J. Calton, a research fellow at a nonpartisan think tank called The Independent, condemned the administration in May for blaming immigrants for rising prices.
Trump also disregarded rising prices in a lengthy Truth Social post over the weekend, writing that he and Republicans “are winning BIG” on “the Economy” and “Affordability.”","In an interview with Fox News last week, Vice President JD Vance downplayed the significance of rising inflation and costs for consumer goods in the U.S., claiming that any price increases are not the result of Trump administration policies.

Unlike President Donald Trump, Vance recognized that costs are up compared to last year. But he blamed former President Joe Biden for the increases.

The Trump White House “inherited this terrible inflation crisis from the Biden administration,” Vance said.

The vice president then blamed immigrants for the administration’s lack of action to make housing more affordable. (A new report from the National Association of Realtors, published earlier this month, notes that the median age of homebuyers in the U.S. is now 40 years old — the highest age ever recorded by the organization.)

“A lot of young people are saying, ‘Housing is way too expensive.’ Why is that? Because we flooded the country with 30 million illegal immigrants who are taking houses that ought, by right, go to American citizens,” Vance said.

This claim — frequently peddled by Vance and Trump to deflect blame for the state of the economy — is blatantly false, housing and immigration experts say.

There is “no significant relationship between unauthorized immigrants and general house price growth for each state in the U.S.,” said a joint study from researchers at Texas A&M and the University of Maine published earlier this year.

The National Immigration Forum similarly blasted such reasoning in an explainer on the subject last month, stating:

While immigrants do contribute to rising housing demand, they are not the primary drivers of increasing housing costs. Instead, factors such as housing shortages, restrictive zoning laws, and shifts in housing preferences in the wake of the pandemic are the more dominant forces behind rising prices. Furthermore, immigrant workers are essential to the housing supply, making up a crucial segment of the construction workforce that can address shortages and improving housing stock.

Christopher J. Calton, a research fellow at a nonpartisan think tank called The Independent, condemned the administration in May for blaming immigrants for rising prices.

“The simple truth is that we would have a severe housing shortage even if President Trump were to deport every undocumented immigrant tomorrow,” Calton said, adding that, “the longer we scapegoat immigrants for America’s self-imposed housing shortage, the longer it will take us to solve it.”

Beyond his bigoted remarks about immigrants, Vance’s other claim in the interview — that inflation is the fault of the previous administration — is also flawed.

While inflation was high under the Biden administration, most economists attributed it at the time to the reopening of the economy following the COVID pandemic, as demand for products went up and disruption in supply chains affected prices. “Greedflation” — when corporations use the effects of inflation to justify raising prices higher than is necessary in order to make more profits — also played a role in costs going up.

Even so, year-over-year inflation shrank slightly from 3.0 percent in 2023 to 2.9 percent in 2024. So far in 2025, it appears that inflation is on track to rise by 3.0 percent again.

While not a significantly huge increase, the rate change suggests that Vance’s arguments about an “inherited” inflation problem are false — if prices were getting better under Trump’s watch, that number would be lessening, not growing.

What’s more, studies demonstrate that Trump’s various tariffs have indeed contributed to a rise in retail prices for consumers, amounting to an effective tax rate of about 18 percent on American shoppers, the highest level since 1934.

Trump repeatedly promised to lower prices on the campaign trail last year, vowing to do so “on day one” of taking office. However, just weeks after he won his second term, Trump admitted that he might not be able to keep his pledge.

“I’d like to bring them down. It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard,” Trump said.

Presently, Trump is deflecting from concerns about affordability. In response to off-year elections earlier this month that saw huge wins for Democrats across the country, Trump insisted that voters were not casting their ballots based on concerns about affordability, describing the concept as a “con job” by Democrats. Instead, Trump said he and Republicans “are the ones that have done great on affordability.”

“Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down, and the press doesn’t report it,” Trump said during a White House event nearly two weeks ago.

But that claim is false: Grocery store prices, similar to inflation overall, have increased by 2.7 percent since Trump won the 2024 presidential election.

Trump also disregarded rising prices in a lengthy Truth Social post over the weekend, writing that he and Republicans “are winning BIG” on “the Economy” and “Affordability.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/2025_1117-vance.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:56:45.859852

Rumors of additional federal assistance with immigration enforcement in Louisiana have been swirling in recent days and weeks.

The New York Times last week Tuesday reported that the Trump administration planned to send the Border Patrol to New Orleans and Charlotte, North Carolina, following an enforcement effort that has ignited tensions in Chicago.

On Sunday, Gregory Bovino, a top Border Patrol commander, on social media touted dozens of arrests in Charlotte as part of an effort dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Just a day earlier on Saturday, federal officials confirmed a surge of immigration enforcement there as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

“UTEP’s embrace of right-wing politics in the last few years has been alarming and is unreflective of El Paso. As a loving, welcoming community, the invitation of Tom Homan is contrary to the values most El Pasoans hold dear.

“Homan has been one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s cruel, hardline mass deportation tactics. Despite promises to go after the ‘worst of the worst,’ their efforts have done little but terrorize families, including mixed-status families, households with immigrants who have been in the country for decades, parents of U.S. citizens, and U.S. citizens themselves. And all of it has come with a significant emotional and financial cost to Americans.

“While I believe in productive debate and genuine conversation, I’m disappointed and ashamed that the leadership at UTEP is amplifying someone who is actively engaged in demonizing many of those who attend UTEP like DREAMERs, individuals in mixed-status families and first generation Americans, all of whom have long considered UTEP to be a safe place. Attendees should expect a white-washed, ugly rewriting of recent history.”

The university’s invitations of figures like former Vice President Mike Pence and Tom Homan have conspicuously occurred after senior leadership at UTEP intensely pushed back on hosting an event with Congresswoman Escobar and the Biden administration to celebrate the institution’s National Science Foundation grant award in 2024, claiming it would be a ‘political' event.

About Tom Homan

Tom Homan has a dishonorable history. Recent reporting details a lack of ethical judgement, corrupt behavior, and an eager willingness to execute the Trump administration’s cruel, un-American agenda. He played a central role in lobbying Republicans in Congress to syphon billions in taxpayer dollars to fund astronomically high levels for ICE, including the $1.24 billion detention camp in El Paso, which houses immigrants in inhumane conditions.

In February 2025, it was reported that Homan met several times with a right-wing activist with ties to the Proud Boys about the Trump administration’s deportation plans in Chicago. He was also a consultant for GEO Group, one of the private prison companies that has received millions in federal contracts from the Trump administration for the immigration enforcement. Most recently, Tom Homan was recorded by the FBI as part of an undercover operation accepting $50,000 in cash after indicating he could help the undercover agents — who were posing as business executives — win government contracts in a second Trump administration. The investigation was shut down by the FBI and Justice Department after a Trump Justice Department appointee called the case a “deep state” probe in early 2025. He also attacked the Catholic church – including El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz – for the criticism of his inhumane deportation tactics.

“If enforced against the Federal Government, the laws would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities,” the lawsuit says.

California has also joined an Oregon lawsuit against Trump’s attempt to use National Guard soldiers to control anti-ICE protests in Portland.","Supporters of the laws say they are needed to provide accountability for immigration agents who have used excessive force, made unlawful arrests and threatened citizens exercising their First Amendment rights to protest Trump’s mass deportation campaign. Opponents, including top Trump administration officials, say the laws are aimed at making it easier for activists to intimidate federal law enforcement personnel.

“Law enforcement officers risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe, and they do not deserve to be doxed or harassed simply for carrying out their duties,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand.”

In its 16-page complaint, the Trump administration says that it “will not comply” with the state statutes. However, Justice Department lawyers say the measures — which take effect Jan. 1 — “have the purpose and likely effect of impeding federal law enforcement in the State of California” by causing federal officers to fear they could face prosecution in state courts.

“If enforced against the Federal Government, the laws would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities,” the lawsuit says.

“If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people’s rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,” a spokesperson for Newsom said. “We’ll see the U.S. Department of Justice in court.”

“It’s problematic when Californians can’t tell the difference between a law enforcement officer who is charged with protecting them and a criminal who is attempting to cause them harm,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. “The FBI itself has warned that the practice of ICE agents wearing masks to obscure their identity has led to a rise in copycats committing crimes, threatening public safety and eroding trust in law enforcement. My office is responsible for defending the laws of California, and we will do so here.”

The Trump administration’s complaint notes that in June Newsom cast doubt on the legal validity of the legislation under discussion at that time. “We’re looking at the constitutionality of it. And it appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents,” Newsom said during an interview with podcaster Justin Kanew.

California and federal officials have been at loggerheads in court over immigration-related policies for years. Earlier this year, Newsom sued unsuccessfully to block Trump from deploying National Guard troops to protect immigration enforcement operations and federal buildings in Los Angeles.

California has also joined an Oregon lawsuit against Trump’s attempt to use National Guard soldiers to control anti-ICE protests in Portland.

Several church members tending to the front garden of a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting the church's pastor.

""We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,"" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.

Officials said there were ""a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters"".

The DHS said it was carrying out the operation because North Carolina had failed to adhere to requests to keep nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees in custody, who had been released due to ""sanctuary policies"".

Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - which have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a ""certified welcoming city"". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.

""President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,"" the DHS said.

Charlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to Data US.

DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing.

Earlier in the week, US representative and Democrat Alma Adams said she was informed of the operation and was ""extremely concerned"" about Border Patrol and ICE agents arriving in North Carolina.

The complaint, filed in October, accused Department of Homeland Security officials of cramming people into dirty holding cells and not providing enough food and water, among other problems, as they sought to boost immigration arrests during the Operation Midway Blitz enforcement operation. It also claims that officials blocked attorney access at the site and coerced people into signing voluntary deportation forms.

The Tribune got a rare look inside Broadview’s ICE processing center in 2009. Here’s what we saw.

It was filed on behalf of Pablo Moreno Gonzalez and Felipe Agustin Zamacona, who were detained there for several days in October. The two men sought to represent a class of detainees, but the class-action status needed approval from a judge.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman on Monday handed the win to the plaintiffs, even though the government argued that detainees had differing experiences there, given that some were only held for a few hours.

But Gettleman found that the plaintiffs overcame that hurdle, while also meeting requirements around numbers of potential class members.

“Plaintiffs state that, according to ICE data, ICE detained 5,202 individuals at Broadview between January 1, 2025, and July 28, 2025,” Gettleman’s order said. “These figures are from the period prior to the announcement of ‘Operation Midway Blitz,’ which caused a dramatic increase in immigration enforcement in the Chicago area.”

The class is likely more than 1,000 people, the judge found.

The class certification came days after a federal magistrate judge and a cadre of attorneys became some of the only outsiders in recent months to tour the facility, which is now under a temporary restraining order that requires the government to improve conditions there.

After a full-day hearing earlier this month during which detainees described overcrowded cells and scant food, Gettleman found that conditions at the facility — which was not built to house people overnight — did not “pass constitutional muster.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CTC-L-broadview-black-caucus118_243497542_92295b.jpg?w=1024&h=735,N,,2025-11-17 20:57:05.500194

""We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants. We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care.""

Falk was the UN special rapporteur for Palestinian human rights between 2008 and 2014 and Elver was the UN special rapporteur on the right to food from 2014 to 2020.
“A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,’” Falk told Al Jazeera on Sunday, from Ottawa.
He expressed alarm that Canadian officials may have detained them over their participation in the tribunal.
We know they have been outspoken in documenting and publicising the horrors inflicted on Gaza by Israel, and advocating for justice,” Woo told Al Jazeera.","Former UN special rapporteurs Richard Falk and Hilal Elver were detained and interrogated by Canadian authorities on Thursday while on their way to an event examining Canada’s role in the genocide in Gaza and continued abuses against Palestinians.

Falk, who turned 95 on the day he was detained, said that officials deemed he and his wife posed a “national security threat” to the country upon their arrival at an airport in Toronto. Falk was the UN special rapporteur for Palestinian human rights between 2008 and 2014 and Elver was the UN special rapporteur on the right to food from 2014 to 2020.

“A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,’” Falk told Al Jazeera on Sunday, from Ottawa. “It was my first experience of this sort — ever — in my life.”

Border agents took Falk and Elver’s passports, he told CBC, and brought them to an interview room. Falk said that authorities held him and Elver for over four hours, grilling them on their work on Israel and Gaza, and interrogating them about the genocide more generally. Eventually, they were released.

The questioning was “random and disorganized,” Falk said, but still an element of a global campaign to “punish those who endeavour to tell the truth about what is happening” in Gaza.

“It’s disappointing that Canada — after having acknowledged Palestinian statehood — would take such a hostile attitude toward a very forthright conference that really explained to a public, that hasn’t been so well-informed, the nature of the objections to what Israel has been doing,” he said. “It suggests a climate of governmental insecurity, I think, to try to clamp down on dissident voices.”

Advocates for Palestinian rights have sharply criticized Canada’s government for sending Israel military support, even though officials pledged to stop sending weapons that could end up in use in Gaza last year.

Canada’s Border Services Agency told CBC that the detention was “normal” and “should not be viewed as any indication of wrongdoing.”

Both Falk and Elver were slated to participate in the Palestine Tribunal on Canadian Responsibility, described by organizers as a “people’s tribunal on Canada’s complicity in the genocide and dispossession of Palestinians, including over the last two years in Gaza.”

Falk said he suspects they were stopped due to their planned participation in the event. He and his wife are both U.S. citizens, and have taught at prominent American universities.

The chair of the tribunal, Azeezah Kanji, told CBC that Falk’s detention was “outrageous.” Canadian Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, who supports the tribunal, said he was contacted by the conference’s organizers about Falk’s detention. He expressed alarm that Canadian officials may have detained them over their participation in the tribunal.

“We know they were here to attend the Palestine Tribunal. We know they have been outspoken in documenting and publicising the horrors inflicted on Gaza by Israel, and advocating for justice,” Woo told Al Jazeera. “If those are the factums for their detention, then it suggests that the Canadian government considers these acts of seeking justice for Palestine to be national security threats — and I’d like to know why.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/2025_11-17-richard-falk.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 17:56:55.975187

The justices will hear the Trump administration's appeal of lower court rulings that struck down the practice known as metering, in which U.S. border agents capped the number of people seeking asylum at border crossings by prohibiting migrants from setting foot in the U.S.

The administration pressed for the high court's intervention even after President Donald Trump suspended the asylum system on the first day of his second term and advocates for migrants said the lower-court rulings have no ongoing practical effect.

The case will be argued in the late winter or early spring.

Metering was first used during President Barack Obama's administration when large numbers of Haitians appeared at the main crossing to San Diego from Tijuana, Mexico. It was expanded to all border crossings from Mexico during Trump's first term in the White House.

The practice ended in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic led the government to restrict asylum-seekers even more severely. President Joe Biden formally rescinded the use of metering in 2021.

Still, the Justice Department said it wanted the justices to hear the case because the court rulings took away “a tool that administrations of both parties have deemed critical for controlling the processing of inadmissible aliens during border surges.”

U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant ruled in 2021 that metering violated the migrants' constitutional rights and a federal law requiring officials to screen anyone who shows up seeking asylum.

A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Bashant's ruling in a 2-1 decision. Twelve of the 29 judges on the San Francisco-based appeals court voted to rehear the case, a strong signal that may have caught the justices' attention.

People seeking refuge in the U.S. are able to apply for asylum once they are on American soil, regardless of whether they came legally. To qualify, they have to show a fear of persecution in their own country because of specific reasons, such as their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.

“We inherited a broken asylum system just as we inherited a broken economy, broken public services, a broken NHS.
“I didn’t fight an election as a Labour MP to bundle distressed children on to deportation flights,” one MP said.
“These reforms sound tough, but they won’t fix the real problems in the asylum system.","Keir Starmer is facing another major challenge to his authority as angry Labour MPs vowed to force changes to new hardline migration measures that would bring an escalation in the deportations of children and families.

The policies – which include the possibility of confiscating assets from asylum seekers to contribute to costs – have caused significant divisions inside the party, with some MPs accusing their colleagues of not taking seriously public anger about illegal migration and asylum.

The Conservatives have said they could support the government to pass the tough new laws in the event of a major Labour rebellion.

The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has outlined a number of radical measures, including how the government will attempt to change the way the European convention on human rights (ECHR) is interpreted by UK judges in an attempt to stop asylum seekers using their rights to a family life to avoid deportation.

Policies include consulting on enforcing the removal of families, including children, who have been refused the right to settle in the UK and have refused payments encouraging them to leave.

“We will launch a consultation on the process for enforcing the removal of families, including children,” a policy document released on Monday said.

Starmer defended the government’s asylum plans, which have been met with alarm by many Labour MPs.

“We inherited a broken asylum system just as we inherited a broken economy, broken public services, a broken NHS. So we have got to pick it up and fix it,” he told the Daily Mirror.

“We need to make sure there’s a consensus on this, that people have confidence in our asylum system, and the truth is that we need to stop people arriving who shouldn’t be here, and we need to return those who are found not to be genuine refugees.”

At least 20 MPs have publicly expressed concern about the policies including the Folkestone MP and former human rights barrister, Tony Vaughan, the select committee chair Sarah Owen and 2024 intake MPs including Simon Opher, Abitsam Mohamed and Neil Duncan-Jordan.

The chair of the housing and communities select committee, Florence Eshalomi, asked Mahmood in the Commons if she was certain there would not be “unintended consequences” from the policies.

Speaking in the Commons, Mahmood rebuked MPs for suggesting she was using divisive language. She mentioned the crude racial slur she said was “regularly” used against her by people telling her to “go back home”.

“I know through my own experience and the experience of my constituents just how divisive asylum has become in our country,” she said.

A government source said there would be a “huge amount of engagement” with worried Labour MPs and stressed there would be no deportations of unaccompanied children.

“The crisis at our borders is an existential issue for mainstream parties. If we don’t solve the crisis at our border, dark forces will follow,” they said. “Politics is about making arguments for things you think are right. That is what the home secretary is doing today.”

But MPs said there were in particular widespread concerns about “morally bankrupt” moves to ramp up the deportation of families – which in practice would mean increased detention of children before removal.

“I didn’t fight an election as a Labour MP to bundle distressed children on to deportation flights,” one MP said. Another MP in a Green-facing seat said they were facing an enormous backlash on social media. “It’s all terrible. Straight out of the far-right playbook. Lots of colleagues feel the same,” said a third.

Opher said the government “should stop the boats because it’s dangerous, and we should stop the scapegoating of immigrants because it’s wrong and cruel … Measures that create bureaucracy and insecurity do not offer clarity or strengthen control – they cost money, waste time and weaken the system.”

Owen, one of the key organisers against the government’s welfare cuts, said: “A strong immigration system doesn’t need to be a cruel one. It shouldn’t need saying – but refugees and asylum seekers are real people, fleeing war and persecution.”

Duncan-Jordan said: “My taxi driver this morning told me that after 20 years living in this country he no longer felt welcome, despite paying his taxes and making a contribution to the local community.

“British values extend beyond running a raffle or cutting the half-time orange. We are compassionate, tolerant and generous. Kicking out recognised asylum seekers doesn’t speak to any of our values. It hardens us as a nation and portrays Britain as a country like its weather – cold and uninviting.”

Several Labour aides also expressed their own discomfort and expressed scepticism that the government would be able to pass the proposals without a climbdown on some measures, including the seizures of assets and the rights of refugee families to reach permanent settlement sooner than the proposed 20 years.

The government has already been forced to clarify that it did not intend to proactively seize jewellery from refugees.

“I think what the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] will try and do first is seek to dilute these proposals,” one said. Another MP said they saw it as an “opening offer … I’m sure that they will want to try and hear concerns because we know what happens when they don’t.”

One MP in a marginal seat said they were particularly disturbed by the rhetoric that Britain is the “destination of choice” for refugees, which they said was straightforwardly untrue given the UK was the 14th most popular in the recent data.

But another MP said they did not think it would mean immediate rebellions or resignations: “We want to read the proposals and then hear from other interested parties and get expert advice.

“That is what happened with welfare and then the picture became clearer. No one doubts that there is a necessity to tackle illegal immigration but there are parts of this that do not strike me as an obvious deterrent and which will extend people’s suffering.”

However, a significant number of MPs said they were convinced of the need to undertake “the unthinkable” when it came to the asylum system, given the threat of Reform and the even more draconian measures that could come under a Nigel Farage government.

“People need to get real,” one minister said. “The public are moving a lot faster than colleagues on this because they recognise the stereotype of the deserving refugee has changed dramatically over the last decade because of the scale of people on the move.”

Refugee status will be made temporary and reviewed every 30 months, the Home Office’s asylum policy document reads.

The government also plans to weaken asylum seekers’ rights under article 8 of the ECHR, which provides for the “right to respect for family and private life”.

The policy document said this was being used by illegal migrants to “stop” their removal. It proposes “strengthening” the public interest in interfering with article 8 and limiting it to “immediate family”.

The UK will also lobby to “evolve” article 3 of the ECHR, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to counteract how it has “been expanded over time”, with it now being used to allow criminals to stay.

A new appeals body would be formed in an attempt to accelerate removals, the Home Office’s blueprint states. This would be staffed by “professionally trained adjudicators” and its aim would be to “expand the capacity of the appeals system”.

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of Refugee Council, said: “What’s being forgotten here is that behind these proposals are men, women and children who have survived war, persecution and unimaginable loss, and who arrive in the UK with almost nothing.

“These reforms sound tough, but they won’t fix the real problems in the asylum system. Instead, they risk creating more delays, more stress and more inhumane treatment for the very people the system is meant to protect.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e2851968b094865d1a962db537f9efce9b76d8c/581_0_4861_3889/master/4861.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1ed725afe622d79fc010f03afc677178",N,,2025-11-17 19:56:49.343520

Similarly, West Virginia’s HB 3293 bars all transgender girls and women from playing on athletic teams for women or girls.
The Idaho and West Virginia laws cannot survive heightened judicial review as applied here and thus violate the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.","Idaho’s HB 500 and West Virginia’s HB 3293 expressly classify students based on their sex assigned at birth and prohibit all transgender women and girls from joining women’s and girls’ sports teams across all levels of competition at any public educational institution. These statutes also subject cisgender and transgender women and girls—but not any men or boys—to invasive sex-verification procedures to determine their eligibility to join public-school sports teams. Transgender students seeking to join women’s and girls’ sports teams, Lindsay Hecox and B.P.J, a minor using her initials, challenged the laws in separate lawsuits.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit considered whether these laws’ sex-based exclusions of Hecox and B.P.J. satisfied intermediate scrutiny, the doctrinal test required for sex-based classifications to pass constitutional muster. Longstanding Supreme Court precedent underscores that classifications that treat individuals differently based on their sex must “serve important governmental objectives” and “the discriminatory means employed [must be] substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” In concluding that the challenged statutes fall short of this demanding standard, the Ninth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit both acknowledged a government interest in promoting competitive fairness in athletics but rejected the notion that, as applied to Hecox and B.P.J., categorical bans on the participation of all transgender women and girls on women’s and girls’ sports teams substantially furthered that interest. Instead, such sweeping prohibitions reduce these students to the mere fact of their sex—and deny them the equal opportunity to participate in public-school athletics and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities.

In November 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in support of the student athletes. Our brief makes three principal points.

First, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equality under the law, prohibiting states from denying to “any person” the “equal protection of the laws.” As the Amendment’s text and history make clear, the Equal Protection Clause establishes a broad guarantee of equality for all persons, securing the same rights and protection under the law regardless of race, sex, or class. Its framers consciously chose universal language intended to secure equal rights for all people. Under the Amendment’s plain text and original meaning, this sweeping guarantee of equality applies to everyone, and states may not impose invidious class-based discrimination that bans students from public-school activities, including sports, based on their sex.

Second, the Nineteenth Amendment buttressed the Fourteenth Amendment’s promise of equality. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment imposed a penalty of reduced congressional representation on states that denied or abridged the right to vote to any of the state’s “male inhabitants,” implicitly sanctioning the disenfranchisement of women. Women’s-rights activists celebrated the Fourteenth Amendment’s universal embrace of equality, but rejected the notion that our foundational promises of democracy, freedom, and equality were real when half the population was excluded from voting based on sex. Demanding fundamental constitutional change, women’s-rights activists finally succeeded with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. The Nineteenth Amendment deepened the Fourteenth Amendment’s core promise of equality, guaranteeing equal citizenship to all regardless of sex and rejecting state-sponsored discrimination rooted in sex-based stereotypes about physical bodies and social roles.

Third, consistent with the text and history of the Fourteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, the Supreme Court has long held that “gender-based classifications . . . require ‘an exceedingly persuasive justification’ in order to survive constitutional scrutiny.” Idaho’s and West Virginia’s laws cannot satisfy this standard. To begin, Idaho’s HB 500 and West Virginia’s HB 3293 classify students based on sex. Idaho’s HB 500 bars Lindsay Hecox from competing on the women’s sports teams she attempted to join because the law identifies her as a “student[] of the male sex” based on her sex assigned at birth. And West Virginia’s HB 3293 uses B.P.J.’s sex—“based solely” on her “reproductive biology and genetics at birth”—to determine that she cannot join girls’ athletics teams and sports. Next, these sex-based classifications do not further the state governments’ stated goals of maintaining competitive fairness in women’s sports. Idaho’s law is remarkably overbroad and covers students who have no relevant advantage over cisgender woman athletes, including Hecox, who is barred from women’s sports teams even though she is prescribed hormone therapy that, as the Ninth Circuit noted, has dramatically altered her body and removed physiological traits that would differentiate her from cisgender peers. Similarly, West Virginia’s HB 3293 bars all transgender girls and women from playing on athletic teams for women or girls. But banning B.P.J.—a transgender girl who received puberty blockers and is undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy that “cause[s] her to experience [the same] physical changes . . . typically experienced by cisgender girls”—does not advance competitive fairness. Overall, the challenged classifications deny Hecox and B.P.J. consideration as individuals, subjecting them to overbroad and inaccurate stereotypes about their physiology and abilities based simply on the fact of their sex. The Idaho and West Virginia laws cannot survive heightened judicial review as applied here and thus violate the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-11-17 15:56:36.656462

(Shabana Mahmood)

With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will make a statement about how we restore order and control to our borders. I do so as this Government publish the most significant reform to our migration system in modern times.

This country will always offer sanctuary to those fleeing danger, but we must also acknowledge that the world has changed and our asylum system has not changed with it. Our world is a more volatile and more mobile place. Huge numbers are on the move. While some are refugees, others are economic migrants seeking to use and abuse our asylum system. Even genuine refugees are passing through other safe countries, searching for the most attractive place to seek refuge.

The burden that has fallen on this country has been heavy: 400,000 have sought asylum here in the past four years. Over 100,000 people now live in asylum accommodation, and over half of refugees remain on benefits eight years after they have arrived. To the British public, who foot the bill, the system feels out of control and unfair. It feels that way because it is. The pace and scale of change have destabilised communities. It is making our country a more divided place. There will never be a justification for the violence and racism of a minority, but if we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.

I have no doubt about who we really are in this country: we are open, tolerant and generous. But the public rightly expect that we can determine who enters this country and who must leave. To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.

Rather than deal substantively with this problem, the last Conservative Government wasted precious years and £700 million on their failed Rwanda plan, with the lamentable result of just four volunteers removed from the country. As a result, they left us with the grotesque chaos of asylum seekers housed in hotels and shuttled around in taxis, with the taxpayer footing the bill.

My predecessor as Home Secretary picked up this dreadful inheritance and rebuilt the foundations of a collapsed asylum system. Decision making has been restored, with a backlog now 18% lower than when we entered office. Removals have increased, reaching nearly 50,000 under this Government. Immigration enforcement has hit record levels, with over 8,000 arrests in the last year. The Border Security Bill is progressing through Parliament, and my predecessor struck an historic agreement with the French so that small boat arrivals can now be sent back to France.

Those are vital steps, but we must go further. Today, we have published ""Restoring Order and Control"", a new statement on our asylum policy. Its goals are twofold: first, to reduce illegal arrivals into this country, and secondly, to increase removals of those with no right to be here. It starts by accepting an uncomfortable truth: while asylum claims fall across Europe, they are rising here, and that is because of the comparative generosity of our asylum offer compared with many of our European neighbours. That generosity is a factor that draws people to these shores, on a path that runs through other safe countries. Nearly 40% come on small boats and over perilous channel crossings, but a roughly equal proportion come legally, via visitor, work or study visas, and then go on to claim asylum. They do so because refugee status is the most generous route into this country. An initial grant lasts five years and is then converted, almost automatically, into permanent settled status.

In other European countries, things are done differently. In Denmark, refugee status is temporary, and they provide safety and sanctuary until it is possible for a refugee to return home. In recent years, asylum claims in Denmark have hit a 40-year low, and now countries across Europe are tightening their systems in similar ways. We must act too. We will do so by making refugee status temporary, not permanent. A grant of refugee status will last for two and a half years, not five years. It will be renewed only if it is impossible for a refugee to return home. Permanent settlement will now come at 20 years, not five years.

I know that this country welcomes people who contribute. For those who want to stay, and who are willing and able to, we will create a new work and study visa route solely for refugees, with a quicker path to permanent settlement. To encourage refugees into work, we will also consult on removing benefits for those who are able to work but choose not to. Outside the most exceptional circumstances, family reunion will not be possible, with a refugee able to bring family over only if they have joined a work and study route, and if qualifying tests are met.

Although over 50,000 claimants have been granted refugee status in the past year, more than 100,000 claimants and failed asylum seekers remain in taxpayer-funded accommodation. We know that criminal gangs use the prospect of free bed and board to promote their small boat crossings. We have already announced that we will empty asylum hotels by the end of this Parliament, and we are exploring a number of large military sites as an alternative. We will now also remove the 2005 legislation that created a duty to support asylum seekers, reverting to a legal power to do so instead. We will continue to support those who play by the rules, but those who do not—be that through criminality or antisocial behaviour—can have their support removed.

We will also remove our duty to support those who have a right to work. It is right that those who receive support pay for it if they can, so those with income or assets will have to contribute to the cost of their stay. That will end the absurdity that we currently experience, in which an asylum seeker receiving £800 each month from his family, and who had recently acquired an Audi, was receiving free housing at the taxpayer's expense, and the courts judged that we could do nothing about it.

The measures are designed to tackle the pull factors that draw people to this country, but reducing the number of arrivals is just half of the story. We must also enforce our rules and remove those who have no right to be here. That will mean restarting removals to countries where they have been paused. In recent months, we have begun the voluntary removal of failed asylum seekers to Syria once again. However, many failed asylum seekers from Syria are still here, most of whom fled a regime that has since been toppled. Other countries are planning to enforce removals, and we will follow suit. Where a failed asylum seeker cannot be returned home, we will also continue to explore the possibility of return hubs, with negotiations ongoing.

We must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are. Today, we are not removing family groups, even when we know that their home country is perfectly safe. There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims—despite an existing returns agreement, and Albania being a signatory to the European convention on human rights. So we will now begin the removal of families. Where possible, we will encourage a voluntary return, but where an enforced return is necessary, that is what we will do.

Where the barrier to a return is not the individual, nor the UK Government, but the receiving country, we will take action. I can announce that we have told Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Namibia that if they do not comply with international rules and norms, we will impose visa penalties on them. I am sending a wider message here: unless other countries heed this lesson, further sanctions will follow.

Much of the delay in our removals, however, comes from the sclerotic nature of our own system. In March of this year, the appeals backlog stood at 51,000 cases. This Government have already increased judicial sitting days, but reform is required, so we will create a new appeals body, staffed by professional independent adjudicators, and we will ensure that early legal representation is available to advise claimants and ensure their issues are properly considered. Cases with a low chance of success will be fast-tracked, and claimants will have just one opportunity to claim and one to appeal, ending the merry-go-round of claims and appeals that frustrate so many removals.

While some barriers to removal are the result of process, others are substantive issues related to the law itself. There is no doubt that the expanded interpretation of parts of the European convention on human rights has contributed. This is particularly true of article 8: the right to a family life. The courts have adopted an ever-expanding interpretation of that right. As a result, many people have been allowed to come to this country when they would otherwise have had no right to, and we have been unable to remove others when the case for doing so seems overwhelming. That includes cases like an arsonist, sentenced to five years in prison, whose deportation was blocked on the grounds that his relationship with his sibling may suffer. More than half of those detained are now delaying or blocking their removal by raising a last-minute rights claim.

Article 8 is a qualified right, which means we are not prevented from removing individuals or refusing an application to move to the UK if it is in the public interest. To narrow article 8 rights, we will therefore make three important changes, in both domestic law and to our immigration rules. First, we will define what, exactly, a family is—narrowing it down to parents and their children. Secondly, we will define the public interest test so that the default becomes a removal or refusal, with article 8 rights only permissible in the most exceptional circumstances. Thirdly, we will tighten where article 8 claims can be heard, ensuring only those who are living in the UK can lodge a claim, rather than their family members overseas, and that all claims are heard first by the Home Office and not in a courtroom.

We will also pursue international reform of a second element of the convention: the application of article 3, and the prohibition on torture and inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment. We will never return anyone to be tortured in their home country, but the definition of ""degrading treatment"" has expanded into the realm of the ridiculous. Today we have criminals who we seek to deport, but we discover we cannot because the prisons in their home country have cells that are deemed too small, or even mental health provision that is not as good as our own. As article 3 is an absolute right, a public interest test cannot be applied. For that reason, we are seeking reform at the Council of Europe, and we do so alongside international partners who have raised similar concerns.

It is not just international law that binds us. According to data from 2022, over 40% of those detained for removal claimed that they were modern-day slaves. That well-intentioned law is being abused by those who seek to frustrate a legitimate removal, so I will bring forward legislation that tightens the modern slavery system, to ensure that it protects those it was designed for, and not those who seek to abuse it. Taken together, these are significant reforms. They are designed to ensure that our asylum system is fit for the modern world, and that we retain public consent for the very idea of providing refuge.

We will always be a country that offers protection to those fleeing peril, just as we did in recent years when Ukraine was invaded, when Afghanistan was evacuated, and when we repatriated Hongkongers. For that reason, as order and control are restored, we will open new, capped, safe and legal routes into this country. These will make sponsorship the primary means by which we resettle refugees, with voluntary and community organisations given greater involvement to both receive refugees and support them, working within caps set by Government. We will also create a new route for displaced students to study in the UK, and another for skilled refugees to work here. Of course, we will always remain flexible to new crises across the world, as they happen.

I know that the British people do not want to close the doors, but until we restore order and control, those who seek to divide us will grow stronger. It is our job as a Labour Government to unite where there is division, so we must now build an asylum system for the world as it is—one that restores order and control, that opens safe and legal routes to those fleeing danger across the world, and that sustains our commitment to providing refuge for this generation, and those to come.

Fair, efficient asylum systems are essential to swiftly identify refugees and provide the protection they need.

UNHCR notes the 17 November announcement by the Home Secretary outlining proposed changes to the UK asylum system.

We share the Government’s concern regarding the dangerous journeys undertaken by refugees and migrants, the abuses perpetrated by smugglers and gangs, and the challenges that these movements present to governments. We also welcome the Government’s commitment to maintaining the UK’s strong tradition of providing sanctuary and safety to people fleeing conflict and persecution, while ensuring well-managed borders – both are compatible goals.

Refugees are not migrants. They are people fleeing conflict, instability and human rights abuses - circumstances no one would willingly choose. Fair, efficient asylum systems are essential to swiftly identify refugees and provide the protection they need. These should be coupled with well-managed migration pathways that alleviate pressure on asylum systems - often used by those seeking to move for economic reasons - with mechanisms that ensure the swift return of individuals who are found not to have valid claims. This dual approach is central to maintaining well-managed borders. We note the progress made in this regard and will continue to support these efforts.

We also encourage the UK to continue to work with European and other partners on cooperative arrangements to effectively manage irregular arrivals while sharing responsibility for refugees and upholding international protection. With the right safeguards in place, this may include lawful transfers of some asylum-seekers to other countries, including through mechanisms like the UK-France ‘one-in, one-out’ arrangement.

For those whose claims are assessed in the UK, and who are found to be refugees, safety means more than just a grant of asylum. UNHCR urges that they be given a stable status that allows them to rebuild their lives and reunite with their families, while a long-term, durable solution is sought. For some, this will be a return home when circumstances allow. But in view of the protracted nature of many of today’s conflicts, and the persistence of repressive regimes, for many, it entails the heart-breaking reality of building a future elsewhere.

Early investment in refugee integration is in everyone’s interest. UNHCR supports approaches that help refugees rebuild their lives in safety and contribute to their new communities, as so many are doing here in the UK. In contrast, short-term stay arrangements and stringent limitations on refugee family reunion often create prolonged uncertainty and despair, undermining integration and social cohesion. Such arrangements can be complex and costly to administer, and may ultimately not deter arrivals. Building understanding of why refugees flee and ensuring accurate, balanced narratives are equally vital for social cohesion.

UNHCR welcomes the Government’s commitment to safe, regular routes for refugees to be welcomed to the UK, drawing on the experience of the UK Resettlement Scheme and initiatives for Syrians, Ukrainians and Afghans. Such pathways provide a lifeline for refugees unable to live safely or realize their potential where they are, and are a means of sharing responsibility with countries hosting most of the world’s refugees. If accessible and realized at scale, they can provide managed alternatives to dangerous, irregular journeys. This work should be rooted in wider cooperation with European and other governments ‘upstream’ in large refugee-hosting and transit countries to help provide real alternatives to dangerous onward journeys and stabilize movements by strengthening rights, lawful stay and work opportunities.

In a time of unprecedented global displacement, empathy, efficiency, responsibility-sharing and international cooperation are essential to protect displaced people, with measures that work for both states and refugees. UNHCR stands ready to continue working closely with the UK Government, and all governments, to ensure a managed, shared approach to forced displacement that maintains access to asylum, upholds rights and promotes social cohesion.

He also told deputies that the man displayed a badge before ordering the teenager out of the car at gunpoint.
Greg Kirakosian, the attorney representing the family, says that Rodriguez is an agent with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The teenager and his parents are Mexican-American U.S. citizens, Kirakosian told CBS Los Angeles.
They have not yet confirmed the family attorney's statement that Rodriguez is a federal agent.","An off-duty public officer has been arrested after he allegedly pointed a gun at a teenager in Temecula before detaining him last week.

It happened on Nov. 10 at around 10:40 p.m., when Riverside County Sheriff's Department deputies were dispatched to the Sommers Bend community after learning of someone who was ""brandishing a firearm"" in the area, according to a news release from RSO.

Upon arrival, deputies spoke with the reporting party, who told them that his 17-year-old son was ""stopped by a subject in the roadway while driving in a residential neighborhood."" He also told deputies that the man displayed a badge before ordering the teenager out of the car at gunpoint.

The teen was eventually released to his parents after complying, deputies said. Family members say that he was on his way home from a party when the incident happened.

Investigators with the Southwest Sheriff's Station's Investigation Bureau assumed the case and identified the suspect as 45-year-old Gerardo Rodriguez.

Greg Kirakosian, the attorney representing the family, says that Rodriguez is an agent with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The teenager and his parents are Mexican-American U.S. citizens, Kirakosian told CBS Los Angeles.

""My client thought, and his family thought, he was either gonna be shot dead, or he was gonna be taken by ICE that night,"" Kirakosian said.

Rodriguez was arrested at his home without incident by RSO investigators, at which point a search warrant was authored and served. Deputies discovered and collected evidence related to the investigation.

Home surveillance video of the incident was shared by Kirakosian, which shows a man they say is Rodriguez pacing along the street while holding what looks to be a gun. As a pickup truck approaches, Rodriguez can be heard shouting, ""Freeze, police! Put the car in park right now!"" while pointing the alleged gun at the vehicle. He can then be seen opening the front door and telling the teenager to sit down.

Kirakosian claims that Rodriguez demanded the teenager's ID, told him he knew where he lived and threatened to investigate his family for more than 10 minutes before he finally let him go when neighbors intervened.

""I think he and his family are scared, just like everybody else in Southern California, all the way to Chicago, are scared, and this is getting so out of hand,"" Kirakosian said. ""ICE agents are doing this when they're off the clock, at home, in their pajamas, they're using their badge and their gun, and investigating people in the neighborhood.""

Rodriguez was booked for assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer, according to the Sheriff's Department news release.

CBS Los Angeles has reached out to DHS, ICE and Customs and Border Protection for comment on the incident. They have not yet confirmed the family attorney's statement that Rodriguez is a federal agent.

As their investigation continues, RSO investigators ask anyone with further details to contact them at (951) 696-3000.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/17/0b4fabc3-e067-4279-bbdd-4c032d15ad98/thumbnail/1200x630/fb77ba82c76bf9db5fc56e6a3a201aa8/temecula-federal-agent.png,N,,2025-11-17 16:57:38.437864

The figures, reported by CBS News, come as a federal judge considers ordering the release of hundreds of detainees after finding that many arrests may have violated an existing court order that restricts warrantless detentions.
Just 2.6% of those detained were found to have prior offenses that the government deemed significant enough to fall under the ""high public safety risk"" classification.
Judge Cummings emphasized that the court's role is not to shape immigration policy but to ensure compliance with existing orders.
""There will be nothing for me to do if arrests made during this Operation Midway Blitz are within the decree,"" he said.","Federal court documents show that, out of 607 people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Chicago, only 16 were classified by the government as a ""high public safety risk,"" despite weeks of intensified enforcement under Operation Midway Blitz.

The list, released as part of ongoing litigation over potentially unlawful arrests, also identified one person as a national security risk and another as a ""foreign criminal,"" but provided no additional details.

The figures, reported by CBS News, come as a federal judge considers ordering the release of hundreds of detainees after finding that many arrests may have violated an existing court order that restricts warrantless detentions. The court-required list includes each person's name, country of citizenship, and whether they remain in custody, were deported, or left the country voluntarily.

According to the government's own assessments, 78% of the 607 detainees were categorized as posing a low public safety risk, while only 7% were considered high risk — and not all in that category had criminal histories. Just 2.6% of those detained were found to have prior offenses that the government deemed significant enough to fall under the ""high public safety risk"" classification.

Eric Balliet, a retired Homeland Security Investigations special agent with 25 years of experience, told CBS News that the numbers contradict repeated statements by the Trump administration that operations in Chicago were targeting ""the worst of the worst:""

""It confuses the public. It certainly instills a sense of fear,"" he said. ""To go after violent criminals, that's a lot of work. That's a lot of effort. That's a lot of time, and candidly, from the people I've talked to, the department and the agency doesn't want to expense that time, that strategic and operational planning to actually get the worst of the worst""

The arrests are now at the center of a broader legal challenge. On November 12, U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings ruled that hundreds of ICE arrests carried out in Chicago and across Illinois may have violated the Castañon Nava Consent Decree, a 2022 order that bars federal agents from detaining individuals without warrants or probable cause. The judge found that DHS and ICE had repeatedly violated the decree, and that field offices were incorrectly told it had been canceled.

Cummings ordered that 615 people detained between June 2 and October 7 be released into Alternatives to Detention programs on bond by November 21. The court also mandated that the government produce a full list of all people detained by ICE and Border Patrol during Operation Midway Blitz — believed to exceed 3,000 arrests — including risk assessments and country-of-origin information.

In a FOX News interview, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said more redeployments were imminent and suggested Chicago could again become a target. He also signaled plans for more arrests, saying, ""If he releases those 650, we're going to apprehend 1,650 on the streets of Chicago.""

Judge Cummings emphasized that the court's role is not to shape immigration policy but to ensure compliance with existing orders.

,Litigation,2025-11-17 19:26:08+00:00,Progressive.org,Using Race As Reasonable Suspicion - Progressive.org,"Mira Nalbandian, progressive.org",,,,,https://progressive.org/latest/using-race-as-reasonable-suspicion-nalbandian-20251117/,"Using race to determine reasonable suspicion is an issue that has been argued in front of the Supreme Court for decades.
For years, advocates have criticized ICE for using it in immigration enforcement and surveillance operations.
But per the ruling, ICE agents in Los Angeles can legally constitute reasonable suspicion on the basis of assumed race or ethnicity until the merits of the case are decided.
And in Los Angeles earlier this month, ICE agents took a toddler during another immigration raid at a Home Depot in Cypress Park.
He also justifies the Trump Administration’s argument that such metrics fall under the definition of reasonable suspicion, writing, “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion .","Outside a Home Depot in Westlake, Los Angeles, it was typical for day workers to gather in the parking lot to find work with contractors and homeowners visiting the store. But on June 6, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted violent immigration raids across the city, white vans rushed into the parking lot and unloaded masked officers who, after asking around in Spanish for day workers, handcuffed and arrested people.

The raid, along with a similar one that occurred at an apparel warehouse in another part of the city on the same day, prompted Los Angeles court district judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) a little over a month later covering several Southern California counties. Frimpong wrote that her decision was based on “ample evidence that seizures occurred based solely upon” one of four factors—an individual’s apparent race or ethnicity, their accent or use of Spanish, their presence at a farm or known work pickup site, or the type of work they do.

Using race to determine reasonable suspicion is an issue that has been argued in front of the Supreme Court for decades. In the long history of government surveillance, detention, and deportation, the use of race by multiple federal government agencies in a variety of contexts is nothing new. For years, advocates have criticized ICE for using it in immigration enforcement and surveillance operations.

The Los Angeles case was soon brought to the Supreme Court, which, on September 8, voted 6 to 3 on ideological lines, issuing an opinion in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo overturning the TRO. The decision was unsigned, which in Court precedent typically indicates that the case matter is non-controversial. It also only applies to the restraining order—not the merits of the case as a whole—which will be debated in future litigation surrounding the raids. But per the ruling, ICE agents in Los Angeles can legally constitute reasonable suspicion on the basis of assumed race or ethnicity until the merits of the case are decided. To immigration experts, the decision has “effectively legalized racial profiling.”

Now, the city of Los Angeles and its communities are grappling with the practical implications of the Court’s decision. Street vendors with legal residencies in the Boyle Heights neighborhood have begun carrying their passports, Real ID cards, and green cards with them at all times, making the difficult choice between asserting their right to exist without proof of residency and avoiding the risk of being targeted by an ICE agent and not having their documentation. In an attempt to prevent further fallout, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency in mid-October which lays the groundwork to provide eviction moratoriums for tenants too afraid to leave their homes for fear of arrest.

The lower courts and legal advocates, including Immigration Defenders Law Center managing attorney Brynna Bolt, have argued that the use of the four factors by ICE agents during patrols in Los Angeles—and around the country—is purely racial profiling. “The individuals that we’ve seen swept up, they are primarily Latino, primarily Spanish speaking, primarily working or arrested in proximity to places where people work low-wage jobs,” Bolt tells The Progressive. “We have clients who have lawful immigration status who have been swept up in the raids.”

Though the Supreme Court decision only pertains to Los Angeles and the surrounding areas, it signals the permissibility of racial profiling in the eyes of the Court. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh claims that immigration stops would be a small inconvenience to citizens or legal residents. But in Ventura County, one of seven in California where racial profiling is now temporarily sanctioned, a U.S. citizen was arrested and detained by masked agents who subsequently refused to allow him to produce identification verifying his legal status.

The man, George Retes, is an Army veteran who was held in an immigration detention center for three days and denied access to a lawyer and a phone call. Retes missed his daughter’s third birthday while in detention. “It would have taken them two minutes to check my papers and confirm that I was a citizen,” Retes wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle. “Instead, they arrested me because I was there.” According to the Federal Tort Claims Act, Retes must wait six months after filing an administrative claim with ICE before he can file a lawsuit against the U.S government for being unconstitutionally detained, which he plans to do.

Meanwhile, ICE stops have become increasingly chaotic and violent. In September, an ICE agent fatally shot a man in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, claiming the man had dragged one of the officers with his car; body camera footage released later recorded the officer describing his injuries as “nothing major.” In Boston, Massachusetts, a family has accused ICE of using their five-year-old daughter to lure her father out to agents for arrest. And in Los Angeles earlier this month, ICE agents took a toddler during another immigration raid at a Home Depot in Cypress Park.

The opinion has had a chilling effect on citizens of color throughout the country, some of whom have begun carrying their passports, deleting social media apps from their phone before trips, and canceling trips altogether, as residents of all documentation statuses fear being swept up in ICE raids.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has denied that any use of racial profiling, writing on X that “allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE” and calling the criticisms “anti-ICE LIES.”

Even though immigration policies and programs have been technically considered colorblind, or race-neutral, due to a Civil Rights Era overhaul, immigration enforcement has in practice long employed racial profiling. “That’s always been an issue with immigration,” Bolt says. As a result, immigrant communities of color often fear going out due to pervasive stories of deportation and potential raids that manifest into emotional trauma.

As government surveillance ramped up in the decades after the 9/11 attacks, DHS has employed social media surveillance that specifically targets Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Muslim individuals. Both the DHS and the FBI use Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—which was just expanded by Congress in 2024—to disproportionately surveil Middle Eastern and South Asian Americans, coordinating with corporations like Meta, Google, Microsoft, Verizon and AT&T.

In 2017, the FBI similarly surveilled Black people in an intelligence assessment entitled “Black Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers.” The agency’s actions echoed its historical surveillance of civil rights and Black Panther Party leaders, which was used as a part of a campaign to “discredit, or otherwise neutralize” Black power movements and which resulted in the deaths of Panther leaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.

Now, ICE is following suit by bolstering its surveillance capabilities. The agency is planning to set up intelligence-gathering centers in Vermont and California where contracted senior analysts and researchers can use a combination of social media and law enforcement and federal government database searches to target individuals for deportation.

As Wired reported last month, previous ICE surveillance tools have been the subject of lawsuits over their use in targeting civilians, threatening privacy rights, and sidestepping warrant requirements by collecting “vast amounts of data with no clear link to its enforcement mandate.”

In California, Bolt says that the use of race by immigration agents was already evident: “The federal government has made clear in this case and in the public square and by its own actions that they’re going to continue doing what they’re doing, and that the enforcement operation in Southern California is being driven by race.”

While there was no official written opinion in Noem, Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion downplays the detrimental effects of immigration stops. He also justifies the Trump Administration’s argument that such metrics fall under the definition of reasonable suspicion, writing, “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion . . . . However, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

Kavanaugh’s claim cites the Supreme Court precedent set in 1975’s United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, which found that the Fourth Amendment did not justify Border Patrol agents stopping individuals solely based on the assumption of “Mexican ancestry,” but that race could be used in conjunction with other factors. In Noem, he states that, “Whether an officer has reasonable suspicion depends on the totality of the circumstances.” The current case, he argues, includes the known presence of “an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area” and that they “tend” to work certain jobs and “do not speak much English.”

Legal experts, including Rory Little writing for SCOTUSblog, warn that if Kavanaugh’s concurrent opinion in the temporary decision holds weight further down the road, “his view would constitute a significant doctrinal shift in ‘reasonable suspicion’ Fourth Amendment doctrine.”

The original case, which will determine the merit of using racial characteristics in constituting reasonable suspicion, is currently pending in district court. How the Supreme Court will rule on it is unclear, but their decisions in Noem have given some indication of where the Justices stand. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor spears Kavanaugh’s concurrence, claiming that it “relegates the interests of U.S. citizens and individuals with legal status to a single sentence.”

Sotomayor also reiterates an interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that requires federal agents to rely on “specific articulable facts” to form a “particularized and objective basis” when determining reasonable suspicion, as was decided in 1981 in United States v. Cortez. Traits such as apparent race or language spoken, Sotomayor writes, are facts that “apply to a large category of presumably innocent people,” and therefore cannot indicate illegal presence any more than they could indicate legal presence.

The Supreme Court’s willingness to permit the use of race in Noem remains a stark example of the double standards that it has used when deciding racial cases in the past. As Stanford Law School professor Jennifer Chacón writes in Border Criminologies, “only in immigration policing cases does the Court explicitly reason that someone’s (racialized) appearance alone gets a law enforcement officer almost 100 percent of the way toward ‘reasonable suspicion.’ ”

Still, while Noem has legalized its use in immigration enforcement, the federal government has long been used in the United States to target certain individuals, citizens or not, and it likely won’t stop anytime soon.",https://progressive.org/downloads/22313/download/ICERacialProfiling.jpg?cb=9019bf0529238482c98d86dc90a4ab11&w=1200,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:37.994366

April 7

A senior lawyer in the Office of Immigration Litigation, Erez Reuveni, acknowledged in court that the Trump administration wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran construction worker who lived in Maryland for a dozen years, to El Salvador, where he was being held in a notorious maximum-security prison. In previous administrations, including Trump’s first term, the government routinely worked to get people back when they were deported without legal authority. In this case, however, Bondi put Reuveni on leave and then fired him.

David McConnell, director of the Office of Immigration Litigation: Erez was one of the more aggressive litigators over the years. He vigorously defended Trump 1 policies.

Traditionally, we didn’t have a lot of turnover in the office. But now I’ve heard that around 60 out of 320 attorneys have left since February.

The document dump fueled the drama over Mr. Epstein that has engulfed Mr. Trump, Mr. Johnson and his Republican majority.
Mr. Trump dismissed the emails as a “hoax” to drive attention away from the government shutdown, which he blamed on Democrats.","But with beef prices approaching $10 per pound, the Trump administration is scrambling to bring them down, including by lowering tariffs on beef imports and trying to address a shortage of cows. With many Americans frustrated by Mr. Trump’s tariffs, his advisers have been straining to blame the high cost of hamburgers — and anything else — on anyone other than the president.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to explain high beef prices over the weekend by blaming undocumented immigrants, saying they were bringing sick cows into the United States. Mr. Bessent said that forced the Trump administration to halt imports of beef from Mexico, which is the second-largest supplier of beef to the United States.

“Because of the mass immigration, a disease that we’d been rid of in North America made its way up from South America, as these migrants brought some of their cattle with them,” Mr. Bessent said on Fox News on Sunday.

The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for an explanation about Mr. Bessent’s suggestion that sick cows were being brought from Mexico across the border. Mr. Bessent was referring to the spread of New World screwworm, a parasite that the United States has been working with Mexico to eradicate.

Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration is “laser focused” on fixing the problem and added: “This is the perfect storm, again something we inherited.”

The Trump administration has been taking other measures to contend with rising beef costs. Mr. Trump announced this month that he asked the Department of Justice to investigate meat companies that he said were driving up prices through “illicit collusion.”

Last month, Mr. Trump said that he would ease import restrictions on beef from Argentina in an effort to lower prices in the United States. The plan angered American cattle ranchers, who argue that meat prices are reasonable and that more competition will harm their businesses.

Mr. Trump’s economic advisers have acknowledged that it will not be easy to get grocery prices to fall meaningfully in the near term and have instead focused on wage increases to make the case that “affordability” is improving. That is a shift from Mr. Trump’s promise as a presidential candidate last year to lower the price of groceries.

Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said on CNBC on Monday that “purchasing power” has improved under the Trump administration and lamented that the president is being blamed for failing to reduce food costs faster.

“There’s a million things that we’re doing to fix this problem,” Mr. Hassett said. “It’s just kind of astonishing to me that the cost problem is somehow being blamed on us.”

Ms. Evans, like Mr. Richardson, lacks experience in emergency management, which is a legal requirement to lead FEMA.

Ms. Evans has played a central role in the Trump administration’s efforts to cut costs at FEMA, according to three people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Earlier this year, Ms. Evans rejected many FEMA spending requests before they could reach the desk of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has imposed a requirement that she personally approve any expense over $100,000, the three people said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said Mr. Richardson was returning to the private sector and thanked him for his work “refocusing the agency to deliver swift resources to Americans in crisis.”

President Trump has suggested eliminating or overhauling FEMA, with an eye toward shifting more responsibility for disaster response to the states. The administration is expected to release a report in the coming weeks detailing its plans to reshape FEMA’s role in disasters across the country.

That report “will inform this Administration’s ongoing efforts to fundamentally restructure FEMA, transforming it from its current form into a streamlined, mission-focused disaster-response force,” Ms. McLaughlin said in a statement.

Ms. Evans, who had worked in the first Trump administration, was previously national director of the U.S. Cyber Challenge, a private initiative focused on building the country’s cybersecurity work force, and worked in information technology for her own company, according to her LinkedIn profile. She served as the chief information officer at the Office of Management and Budget during the George W. Bush administration.

Mr. Richardson, who served in the Marines, was named to the role of acting FEMA administrator in May, replacing Cameron Hamilton, who was pushed out a day after telling members of Congress that FEMA was vital to communities “in their greatest times of need” and should not be eliminated. His resignation was first reported by The Washington Post.

When he was tapped for FEMA, Mr. Richardson was the assistant secretary at the Homeland Security Department’s office for countering weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Richardson maintained both jobs.

After Mr. Richardson joined FEMA, some of his employees expressed concern about his lack of experience. He told employees in June that he did not know the United States had a hurricane season — a comment that unnerved FEMA employees who heard it. The agency later said Mr. Richardson was joking.

On his first full day as acting administrator, Mr. Richardson told the agency’s employees that if any of them tried to obstruct his agenda, “I will run right over you.”

In a statement responding to Mr. Richardson’s resignation, Representative Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, said, “good riddance.”

“Americans deserve a FEMA leader with at least the most basic core competencies in emergency management, something David Richardson never demonstrated,” Mr. Pallone said.

The future of FEMA is unclear. In June, President Trump said he wanted to eliminate FEMA in November after the hurricane season ended and move emergency management efforts “back to the state level.”

After deadly Texas floods in July, when many Americans were focused on the rescue efforts, the administration’s rhetoric softened and officials spoke instead of reforming the agency.

Still, more than 2,000 employees have left FEMA since Mr. Trump took office, accounting for about one-third of the agency’s permanent work force. Those who resigned included some of the agency’s most accomplished leaders. A task force of local, state and federal emergency managers has been studying reforms to the agency that could raise the threshold for a disaster that warrants federal intervention, change how disaster aid is paid to states, and end FEMA’s role in the long term recovery of disaster-struck communities.

The panel, known as the FEMA Review Council, was required to release its recommendations by Sunday under an executive order Mr. Trump issued in May. An administration officials said the report is expected by the end of this year.

Emergency management officials around the country are eager for its release to understand what they can expect from FEMA in the future.

“We’re all anxiously waiting to see what it says,” Bryan Fisher, director of the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said Saturday at a resource fair for victims of Typhoon Halong, which hit Southwestern Alaska last month.

Since the Texas floods, there has not been a major test of the agency’s evolving disaster response strategy, under which FEMA has added new hurdles to some grant programs and stretched the limits of a dwindling pot of money used to pay for disaster aid. In recent months, Mr. Trump has declared federal disasters in Alaska, where remnants of a typhoon devastated coastal villages, and across the Plains, where severe storms and tornadoes damaged communities.

But the wildfire season has been calmer than expected in the West. And it has been a relatively mild Atlantic hurricane season in the East, with the most destructive storms avoiding landfall in the United States.

In his ruling, Judge Fitzpatrick said that when Ms. Halligan appeared — by herself — in front of the grand jury in September to seek an indictment accusing Mr. Comey of lying to and obstructing Congress in 2020 testimony, she made at least two “fundamental and highly prejudicial” misstatements of the law. He also pointed out that the grand jury materials he ordered her to turn over to him for his review this month appeared to be incomplete and “likely do not reflect the full proceedings.”

“The court is finding that the government’s actions in this case — whether purposeful, reckless or negligent — raise genuine issues of misconduct, are inextricably linked to the government’s grand jury presentation and deserve to be fully explored by the defense,” Judge Fitzpatrick wrote.

As part of his ruling, the judge ordered prosecutors to provide Mr. Comey’s lawyers by Monday evening with the same grand jury materials that he himself has already looked at — a measure he described as “an extraordinary remedy.” Typically, grand jury notes are kept secret before trial, even from defendants and their lawyers.

But the disclosure was needed, Judge Fitzpatrick said, to permit Mr. Comey’s legal team to delve into the question of whether Ms. Halligan and an F.B.I. agent who testified in front of the grand jury had conducted themselves properly when they secured the indictment.

The ruling by Judge Fitzpatrick was only the most recent setback in the Justice Department’s efforts to bring charges against Mr. Comey — a decision that was initially rejected by Ms. Halligan’s predecessor as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik S. Siebert. In an extraordinary move, Mr. Trump ousted Mr. Siebert in September to make way for Ms. Halligan after he suggested there was insufficient evidence to file an indictment against Mr. Comey.

Judge Fitzpatrick’s harsh words came just days after a different judge involved in the Comey case raised doubts about a separate question pertaining to Ms. Halligan: namely, whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had lawfully appointed her to her post as U.S. attorney in the first place. The judge overseeing that issue said she would make a decision on the matter by Thanksgiving.

The indictment against Mr. Comey charges him with lying to and obstructing Congress during an appearance he made in September 2020 in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the hearing, he was asked questions about whether he had authorized anyone at the F.B.I. to serve as an anonymous source in newspaper articles about sensitive investigations.

Ms. Halligan, who had never worked on a criminal case until she was thrust into the Comey prosecution, has faced extensive scrutiny from the moment Mr. Trump installed her atop the U.S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia against the wishes of many career prosecutors there. Her critics have pointed out that her previous experience in the law was limited to working as an insurance lawyer and serving as a personal lawyer to Mr. Trump.

It is extremely unusual for judges to examine how prosecutors act in front of grand juries, let alone to openly criticize their conduct. But that is exactly what Judge Fitzpatrick did to Ms. Halligan.

He noted that during her grand jury presentation she appears to have misrepresented a basic tenet of the law by suggesting that Mr. Comey did not have the right, under the Fifth Amendment, to avoid testifying at his own trial.

She also appears to have made another astonishing error, Judge Fitzpatrick said. In his ruling, he pointed out that she told grand jurors that they did not have to rely solely “on the record before them” to return an indictment against Mr. Comey, but instead “could be assured the government had more evidence — perhaps better evidence — that would be presented at trial.”

The judge also said that Ms. Halligan appears to have botched her efforts to pare down the three-count indictment she had initially sought against Mr. Comey after grand jurors rejected one of the charges. Moreover, he noted that the grand jury transcripts he later received from her did not appear to contain her presentation of the second, two-charge indictment to the grand jury, leaving the record incomplete.

If, however, a second presentation was never made, then the court “is in uncharted legal territory,” he went on.

That would suggest, he wrote, “that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.”

“Either way,” the judge concluded, “this unusual series of events, still not fully explained by the prosecutor’s declaration, calls into question the presumption of regularity generally associated with grand jury proceedings, and provides another genuine issue the defense may raise to challenge the manner in which the government obtained the indictment.”

Judge Fitzpatrick mentioned one more potential problem with the government’s grand jury presentation. He questioned whether the F.B.I. agent who was the sole witness to have testified may have inadvertently disclosed information that should not have been revealed because of the attorney-client privilege.

Ultimately, the decision about whether to dismiss the case based on these purported grand jury errors will lie with Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff, the district court judge who is handling the case. Judge Nachmanoff has already scheduled a hearing for early December to consider separate but related claims by Mr. Comey’s lawyers that Ms. Halligan had abused the grand jury process.

Now, as he prepares to return to the White House on Tuesday after a long absence, the prince may feel he has little to prove, despite all those years when he was effectively unwelcome in Washington. At 40 years old, he has cemented his power not only as the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia but as a global political heavyweight — a diplomatic deal-maker who oversees one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds.

Over the past few years, he has become too powerful for American politicians and chief executives to ignore.

On Tuesday, the face that will greet him could hardly be more welcoming. President Trump has repeatedly proven himself a warm friend of Saudi Arabia, a country where Mr. Trump’s family has cultivated significant business interests.

“This is a personal triumph for the crown prince,” said Gregory Gause, a scholar of Saudi Arabia and professor emeritus of international affairs at Texas A&M University. “Five years ago, if he had showed up in Washington, nobody would have talked to him. He’s coming back with a huge delegation as a regional leader, a world figure.”

The opprobrium that erupted after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing dogged Prince Mohammed for years until he put it behind him. The prince denied prior knowledge of the killing, but a U.S. intelligence assessment determined he had probably ordered it.

A lawsuit against him over the killing was dismissed by a U.S. federal court in 2022, after the State Department determined that the prince had immunity as a head of state. Even President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — who had pledged on the campaign trail in 2019 to turn Saudi Arabia into a pariah state — flew to the kingdom to meet the prince in 2022, when he needed his help to lower global oil prices.

In May, Mr. Trump chose Saudi Arabia as the destination for his first major trip abroad of his second term as president.

“Over the past eight years, Saudi Arabia has proved the critics totally wrong,” Mr. Trump declared during the visit.

During the same visit, Mr. Trump toured a Saudi government-owned real estate project called Diriyah. The Trump Organization is in talks that could bring a Trump-branded property to Diriyah, the project’s chief executive told The Times — the latest example of the Trump family’s fluid mingling of politics with profit.

The crown prince has overseen a significant loosening of religious restrictions in the kingdom over the past decade, allowing greater social freedoms, while increasing political repression at the same time.

Today, the prince’s main focus is no longer on consolidating power, but rather on overhauling the kingdom’s economy. The deadline for his “Vision 2030” program to reduce dependence on oil is looming, even while financial constraints are mounting.

“Since the last visit, Saudi policy has become laser-focused on domestic economic priorities,” said Yasmine Farouk, Arabian Peninsula project director at the International Crisis Group.

He is expected to stick to business on this trip, including bilateral diplomatic and corporate deals. His priorities include signing a mutual defense agreement with the United States, advancing a potential deal to transfer American nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and sealing agreements for the two countries to collaborate in the field of artificial intelligence, according to analysts.

Mr. Trump, in turn, is eager to persuade the prince to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. But that is “pretty much off the table,” said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.

“Saudi Arabia can’t go forward with normalization without Israel in effect recognizing the Palestinians have the right to a state,” he said.

The Trump administration and Saudi Arabia have also been trying to work out an agreement in which U.S. weapons manufacturers would sell F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia, although an intelligence report raised concerns that China could acquire the technology if the sale went through.

Prince Mohammed has sought to build deeper ties with China and other world powers, too.

“We are always keen to strengthen our bilateral relationship with the United States, even though we have a lot of other options,” said Salman al-Ansari, a Saudi political analyst.

The visit comes as Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the Middle East express increasing uncertainty over the strength of American security guarantees. In September, Israel tried to assassinate senior Hamas officials in Qatar, rattling neighboring Persian Gulf countries.

“The Saudis worry about U.S. reliability,” Mr. Gause said. “Part of the way to keep us from leaving is to have all these great deals that we’re going to see signed in Washington in the next few days.”

“We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we’ll see how that turns out,” Mr. Trump said, speaking at an airport in West Palm Beach, Fla. He added that Venezuela “would like to talk” but would not elaborate on what he meant.

“What does it mean? You tell me, I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said. When a reporter asked if he was interested in negotiations, he shrugged. “I talk to anybody,” he said. “I talk to you.”

The Trump administration has been building up its military presence in the Caribbean and reviewing options for potential strikes inside Venezuela, even as Mr. Trump’s aides provide conflicting accounts of what they are seeking to achieve.

It has also launched 21 known strikes on boats it claimed were trafficking narcotics in the waters off Central and South America, killing at least 83 people since September in a campaign that many legal experts say violates international law.

The Trump administration has said the campaign is about stopping the flow of drugs in the region, but has yet to provide evidence that any of these boats were moving drugs. And the discussion by Mr. Trump and his top aides has focused on removing Mr. Maduro from office. The United States and its allies do not recognize Mr. Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela after last year’s election.

On Sunday, the U.S. Navy announced that the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, the country’s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier, had arrived in the Caribbean with its accompanying warships and attack planes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had ordered its deployment to the region last month. Mr. Maduro has placed Venezuela’s military on high alert.

The carrier’s arrival adds to the U.S. military’s ability to conduct boat strikes or potential attacks on Venezuelan soil. The American force in the region has now reached 15,000 soldiers and sailors, the largest in decades.

Later on Sunday, the U.S. military announced the details of its latest strike in the eastern Pacific of a boat the Trump administration said was smuggling drugs by sea. The strike on Saturday killed three people.

In a social media post on Sunday, the U.S. Southern Command said that the boat was being operated by a “designated terrorist organization” and was trafficking narcotics in the eastern Pacific. It did not provide evidence for those claims. The post included a video that showed a boat being struck.

In another move to escalate the pressure campaign against Mr. Maduro, Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday announced that the State Department would designate a Venezuelan group, Cartel de Los Soles, as a foreign terrorist organization. The designation restricts financial transactions of the group or anyone associated with it.

Mr. Rubio said the group is “headed” by Mr. Maduro and high-ranking individuals in his government. A federal indictment from 2020 accuses Maduro of drug trafficking charges related to the group. He has denied the charges.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump, speaking of Mr. Carlson as he traveled back to the White House after spending the weekend golfing at Mar-a-Lago, said, “You can’t tell him who to interview.” The president then insisted that he “didn’t know much about” Mr. Fuentes, whom he previously dined with at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, an episode that also caused a furor.

If Mr. Carlson wanted to interview Mr. Fuentes, then “get the word out,” Mr. Trump said. “People have to decide. Ultimately people have to decide.”

Mr. Fuentes, who had previously bragged that the silence from the White House over the episode was a sign of his growing influence on the right, shared Mr. Trump’s defense of Mr. Carlson on social media, writing “Thank you Mr. President!”

Mr. Trump’s defense of Mr. Carlson did not address Mr. Fuentes’s racist views, or Mr. Carlson’s expressions of sympathy for some of his positions. But the president’s remarks threw the right-wing influencer a lifeline weeks after prominent Republican lawmakers, Jewish organizations and conservative influencers denounced him for the podcast.

Even as many figures on the right disavowed or distanced themselves from Mr. Carlson, others defended him. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, a powerful think tank at the center of conservative politics, said that Mr. Carlson’s critics were “sowing division” and that he would “always be a close friend” to the institution. (Days later, in response to significant criticism over those remarks, Mr. Roberts pleaded ignorance, saying that he “didn’t know much about this Fuentes guy.” His video defending Mr. Carlson has not been retracted.)

The White House stayed out of the uproar for weeks. Mr. Fuentes, appearing on his own podcast soon after speaking to Mr. Carlson, interpreted that silence as a victory for his movement of so-called groypers, who oppose diversity and immigration and believe the United States was better off when Christian white men were in charge.

Mr. Fuentes gleefully singled out Vice President JD Vance for not condemning him. Mr. Fuentes has long been a mocking critic of Mr. Vance and has made racist remarks about his wife, Usha.

Hours before Mr. Trump’s comments on Sunday, Mr. Vance waded into the infighting among conservatives to defend Mr. Carlson’s son Buckley, who works as an aide in the vice president’s office. After a conservative political operative had attacked the younger Carlson on social media, accusing him of bigotry because of his connection to his father, Mr. Vance lashed back.

“I have an extraordinary tolerance for disagreements and criticisms from the various people in our coalition,” Mr. Vance said in a social media post. “But I am a very loyal person, and I have zero tolerance for scumbags attacking my staff.”

“It’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown,’” he wrote.

The president’s turnabout followed his intensive pressure campaign over the Epstein files that often appeared to overshadow efforts on other matters, including the recent government shutdown. In a last-ditch effort in recent days, Mr. Trump reached out personally to try to sway Republican lawmakers backing the measure, summoning one to a meeting in the White House Situation Room with his attorney general and F.B.I. director to discuss the demand to release the files.

It was unclear how quickly Mr. Trump’s tightly controlled Justice Department might release files on Mr. Epstein, or whether the president’s seeming backing of the idea might speed such a release, regardless of the vote. When he ordered the department to look into Democrats associated with Mr. Epstein last week, his own ties to the disgraced financier were receiving renewed scrutiny because of the release of a trove of emails in which Mr. Epstein claimed Mr. Trump knew of his activities.

Even if the bill were to pass the House, it would face longer odds in the Senate, where 60 votes would be needed to bring up the bill. Democrats hold 47 seats, so even if all of them back the measure, they would still need 13 Republicans to join them.

The Republican base remains split over the files, and the tension has led to a falling-out between Mr. Trump and one of his closest political allies, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.

On Sunday, minutes after Mr. Trump publicly reversed course on the Epstein files, he said on social media that Ms. Greene “is working overtime to try and portray herself as a victim when, in actuality, she is the cause of all of her own problems.” Mr. Trump has escalated his attacks on Ms. Greene in the past week, calling her a “traitor,” something that she says has led to death threats.

Ms. Greene is far from the only Republican lawmaker pushing to release the files.

Hours before Mr. Trump’s announcement on Sunday evening, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has helped lead efforts in Congress to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files, suggested on ABC’s “This Week” that “100 or more” House Republicans could support such a measure this week despite opposition from the president. “The record of this vote will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency,” he said.

Speaker Mike Johnson also predicted significant G.O.P. support, acknowledging before Mr. Trump’s reversal on Sunday that there would be “lots of votes” for the bill. Mr. Johnson, who said last week that he would move up the timeline for a vote on the bill to this week, told “Fox News Sunday” that the House just needed to “get this done and move it on.”

“There’s nothing to hide,” he added.

On Wednesday, lawmakers released more than 20,000 emails belonging to Mr. Epstein in which the convicted sex offender claimed that the president once “spent hours at my house” with a young woman who later accused Mr. Epstein of sexually abusing and trafficking her when she was a teenager.

The document dump fueled the drama over Mr. Epstein that has engulfed Mr. Trump, Mr. Johnson and his Republican majority. Mr. Trump dismissed the emails as a “hoax” to drive attention away from the government shutdown, which he blamed on Democrats. But pressure instead built on Mr. Johnson, who relented in moving up the vote.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/17/multimedia/17trump-news-promo3p-fltz/17trump-news-promo3p-fltz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:04.188257

In response, attorneys for the asylum seekers and Al Otro Lado, the organization serving them, shared the following comment:

“The issue before the Court is whether noncitizens seeking safety at ports of entry along the U.S. southern border have a legal right to apply for asylum in the United States. As the Ninth Circuit correctly concluded, our immigration laws require the government to inspect and process people seeking asylum at ports of entry and allow them to pursue their legal claims in the United States. The government’s turnback policy was an illegal scheme to circumvent these requirements by physically blocking asylum seekers arriving at ports of entry and preventing them from crossing the border to seek protection. Vulnerable families, children, and adults fleeing persecution were stranded in perilous conditions where they faced violent assault, kidnapping, and death. We look forward to presenting our case to the Court.”

The American Immigration Council, the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies (CGRS), the Center for Constitutional Rights, Democracy Forward, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection serve as co-counsel.

She will give an oral statement in the House of Commons this evening and answer questions from MPs.

Let me say from the outset to those who are worried that we do not have any timescales for implementation or details of who will be affected (e.g. people who are currently waiting for a decision). Where it is indicated that changes will be consulted on or legislation will be brought forward, that obviously means that we will have a bit more notice before anything is implemented.

There are two forewords to the paper, from the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary. With no indication that she feels any sense of ownership for the situation, the Home Secretary states that “Over 100,000 people now live in asylum accommodation, funded by the taxpayer. Many refugees remain unemployed several years after being granted protection, depending on taxpayer funded benefits to live in the UK.” This is of course a result of slow and inaccurate processing of claims as well as a ban on work for those waiting in the asylum system for so long, which makes it more difficult for them to get their lives up and running again following a grant of status.

She states “In 2024, asylum claims in the UK rose by 18 percent, to a record high. Across Europe, meanwhile, claims fell by 13 percent.” Yet fails to mention that Germany (218,550) receives twice as many applications as the UK (109,343) which is in fifth place in Europe, also behind Spain (164,830), France (159,260) and Italy (151,525).

The paper is in three sections. Part I: Reducing arrivals, Part II: Increasing removals, and Part III: Safe and legal routes. I have looked at the details below.

Part I: Reducing arrivals

This section begins with an assertion that various factors are acting as “pull factors” for people to come to the UK. These include “the generosity of refugee protection in the UK”, “the extent of support provided” to those waiting for a decision and the ability to work without permission to do so.

Notably and predictably, there is no reference to the Home Office’s own research showing that “welfare policies and labour market access have little impact on migrant decision making”, or indeed, to any evidence at all. There are several proposals to address this.

Extension of period needed to reach settlement from five to twenty years and “safe return” reviews every two and a half years

By way of quick background, before 30 August 2005, settlement was granted to people when their asylum claim succeeded. On 30 August 2005 this was changed to an initial grant of five years, after which the person could apply for settlement. A “safe return review” whereby the Home Office would consider whether a person could return to their country of origin at the end of the five years instead of being granted settlement was announced in 2017 but not much seems to have come of this.

Then there was the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 which introduced the “two tier” system of refugee status whereby certain refugees (those deemed to have entered “illegally”) were granted two and a half years’ leave to remain. They would be eligible for settlement only under the normal long residence rules and after holding leave for ten years. Robert Jenrick MP closed this process in June 2023.

In the new policy paper, reference is made to the asylum system in Denmark throughout. It mentions that settlement can be obtained there after eight years of residence, subject to various requirements being met. The Home Office’s proposal is for there to be no path to settlement in a protection route until a person has spent twenty years in the UK. No explanation is provided as to why even Denmark’s eight year waiting period has been deemed too generous. This twenty year route is referred to as the “core protection” route.

Instead of five years, refugees will be granted leave for two and a half years and will have to keep renewing this. Each time the Home Office will only grant the extension if they accept that there is still a need for protection. If it is decided that there is no longer such a need, the intention will be to remove that person. So the plan is that people will spend twenty years of their lives here living in terror of being sent back to a country where the UK has accepted that they have previously been at risk of persecution in.

These short periods of leave and inevitably lengthy periods spent with section 3C leave will make it difficult for people to work and find homes, as we have already seen happening with Ukrainians. It will also be enormously damaging to people’s mental health. Inevitably, more people will need support from the state.

If eligible, people will be able to switch into a new “protection work and study route”. This will be available to people who “obtain employment or commence study at an appropriate level and pay a fee. Once on this route, they will become eligible to ‘earn’ settlement sooner than they would under core protection alone”.

Family reunion

It seems that the intention is that family reunion will only be available to those who have moved into the work and study route. Under core protection we are told that there will be “no automatic right to family reunion”. It will still exist, but “stricter requirements will apply”. Those in the work and study routes may be subject to the same requirements to bring dependants as in other routes, presumably such as Appendix FM.

Public funds

They have also trailed changes to benefits for refugees, stating that:

we are now exploring a change to taxpayer-funded benefits to prioritise access for those who are making an economic contribution to the UK. This could see additional criteria that migrants have to meet to receive benefits and actions they need to take in order not to lose them. A consultation on this question will take place in 2026.

Asylum support

The government will be revoking The Asylum Seekers (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2005 and the paper states that they “will restore a discretionary power to offer support”. It is unclear to me how much will actually change here. Section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1995 already says that the Home Secretary may provide support to people who appear “to be destitute or to be likely to become destitute”.

Even without these laws in place, people cannot simply be left without support where that would make them destitute. The “law of humanity” will still apply under the common law.

The paper goes on to say:

In doing so, we will deny support to those who have the right to work and could therefore support themselves. This would include those who enter the country on a work or student visa with permission to work before claiming asylum, or those granted permission to work where their claim has been outstanding for more than 12 months.

It is obviously much more difficult for people in that first group (with section 3C leave) to find work because employers do not know how long they will have that leave for, as it will only last until either their asylum claim is granted or once they are appeals rights exhausted.

People without leave who have claimed asylum are able to work only after they have been waiting for a decision on their claim for over 12 months and they have applied to the Home Office for permission to work and that request has been granted. Even then, they are only allowed to work in an extremely limited number of roles.

The Home Office cannot have it both ways and make it incredibly difficult for people to work and then withhold support from them if they are unable to do so.

The paper also says that support will be removed from those who “fail to abide by a removal direction”, work illegally, refuse to relocate to a different accommodation site or are disruptive in accommodation.

Removal of assets (aka “contributions mechanism”)

This proposal states that:

we will require individuals to contribute towards the cost of their asylum support where they have some assets or income, but not enough to support themselves independently. We will also take action to recover support costs in scenarios where any assets are not convertible into cash or declared at the point that asylum support is initially provided but become convertible or are discovered at a later date.

This wording looks fairly identical to section 31 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which provides for a “financial contribution by resident” of an accommodation centre. This section has not been brought into force but includes provision for the Home Secretary to make regulations to recover costs relating to accommodation and other facilities where the person has assets that can be converted into cash.

The Lords debate on removing that clause when it was still a bill is worth revisiting. Section 31 only covers accommodation centres, so the government’s proposal would presumably be to extend this to all types of support.

Large scale accommodation sites

This has already been announced and there are no new details here.

Illegal working

Again, nothing new here. Just mention of previously announced changes on expansion of right to work checks and the digital hostile environment.

Part II: Increasing removals

The paper says that the UK/France pilot will be continued, but with a “higher appetite” for removing people, apparently. It also says that removals to certain countries will be resumed and say that they have already started returning a small number of Syrians.

It refers to several European countries beginning “voluntary removals”, so presumably at this stage the UK has also just been helping those who wish to return. The paper goes on to say that they are “exploring resuming enforced returns” to certain countries, including to Syria.

Removing failed asylum seekers

The paper says that the UK/France pilot will be continued, but with a “higher appetite” for removing people, apparently. It also says that removals to certain countries will be resumed and say that they have already started returning a small number of Syrians.

It refers to several European countries beginning “voluntary removals”, so presumably at this stage the UK has also just been helping those who wish to return. The paper goes on to say that they are “exploring resuming enforced returns” to certain countries, including to Syria.

A consultation is to be launched on the enforced removal of families with children. This consultation will also include “commencing measures in the 2016 Immigration Act which will allow us to remove support from families who do not have a genuine obstacle to leaving the country”. Taking a quick look, this seems to mean sections 66 and 68 and schedules 11 and 12 of the Immigration Act 2016.

Visa penalties

This proposal formed part of the Conservative government’s New Plan for Immigration, eventually making its way into section 72 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 which provides for “visa penalties for uncooperative countries”. I don’t think it has ever actually been used, presumably because there are non-Home Office related reasons which make it sensible to maintain good relations with other countries.

Appeals reform

Yet again there are some fairly glaring omissions in the Home Office’s assessment of the situation regarding the appeals backlog. For a proper picture of what is going on, see my explanation.

The paper mentions increased judicial sitting days and statutory timelines, neither of which are new announcements. A new appeals body has also already been announced, although one welcome point to note here is the mention that “Early legal advice will be a core part of system reforms, avoiding delays and late claims, leading to better decisions”. Again, this needs to be present at application stage as well, so that many cases can avoid being wrongly refused in the first place, but any mention of the importance of legal advice is a positive.

There is also mention of accelerating certain cases, again this is a process that already exists in detained cases. They also mention “strengthening” the approach to certifying cases to remove the right of appeal. It is unclear whether anything new is being proposed here beyond further use of existing processes.

What is new is proposed legislation for accelerated appeals in “removable high-harm cases, foreign national offenders, and others who are detained and readily removable”, but no more detail than this is provided.

Legislation is also proposed “to enable an expedited appeal for first time late claims where someone is being removed but has not previously made a claim. This will ensure these claims do not suspend removal, as is all too often the case today”. I have addressed this situation previously, the system often operates to prevent people from being able to make these claims earlier.

Legislation is also to be made to ensure that a person does not accrue any private or family life rights if they do not leave the UK after an unsuccessful claim. This will presumably involve an amendment to section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as trailed in the immigration white paper in May).

Fresh claims will seemingly require a paid application, this is a bit unclear but seems to be saying where the fresh claim is based on article 8. It is unclear what the process would be if e.g. it was a sur place claim (where the need for asylum only arose later on because of a change of circumstances in the country of origin). This change will be made via the immigration rules.

Legal reform

As set out in the immigration white paper earlier this year, the government is unhappy with the number of families of British citizens and those who are settled here who are unable to meet the minimum income requirement, yet have the audacity to still want to live together.

The paper also mentions that 86% of people who raised rights based applications in detention awaiting removal were released. A significant factor in this which goes unmentioned will of course be the decimation of legal aid advice generally, but particularly the removal of article 8 cases from the scope of legal aid, meaning that people are unable to access their rights at an earlier stage.

In response to the above two “problems”. Again, several changes are proposed.

The first is to:

legislate to set out to Home Office decision makers, and the courts, how to properly balance the public interest against individual rights. This intends to narrow the circumstances in which an individual’s Article 8 rights would outweigh the public interest in removing them.

The second is to set out in primary legislation a more narrow definition of family, largely restricted to immediate family members, with limited exceptions. The second is to change the application process for leave outside the rules applications based on article 8. Applications to bring people from outside the UK will need to be submitted by the UK based family member.

For in-country applications:

we will prescribe how and when Article 8 claims can be made. This will prevent migrants from frustrating removal by making late human rights claims, avoiding fees and relying on the courts to remake Home Office decisions, or in some cases having the courts consider Article 8 claims that have not even been considered by the Home Office.

This doesn’t make much sense to me and I can’t really see a change in here.

The third proposed change is to work with other countries to limit the definition of “inhuman or degrading treatment” in article 3 claims.

Next, reform to the modern slavery system (which is very much not being abused). Here the paper mentions the guidance change on reconsiderations made in September. It also talks about improved screening processes, with no acknowledgement of the well known fact (contained in the Home Office’s own guidance) that survivors of modern slavery often have difficulty in disclosing their experiences. New legislation is mentioned, without any further detail.

Other barriers to removal

Here, we are told that the immigration rules will be changed to allow consideration and refusal of protection claims after the screening interview. It is unclear whether any form of longer screening interview will take place in these circumstances.

The paper states that this process will be used to “target citizens of manifestly safe countries”. I will raise my usual concerns here that generally when countries are deemed “safe”, the safety of LGBTQI+ people is not considered. This will be one to keep an eye on.

Apparently processes and systems will be improved to ensure that they do not miss opportunities to deport foreign national offenders waiting for trial on other more minor offences.

The use of AI in age assessments was announced back in July 2025 but is repeated here. Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit published a good response at the time.

There is already evidence of racial bias in AI. In Australia, there is evidence of this specifically in using AI to carry out age assessments (in the context of their social media ban for children, rather than for asylum). The trial was carried out by a UK based company and found that racial bias in the system meant that the tests were less accurate for certain groups.

Part III: Safe and legal routes

Unsurprisingly, this is the smallest section of the paper. Let me be clear from the outset, because I have already seen this argument being made a couple of times. There is no trade off which would make the above proposals for refugees in any way more acceptable. There are no circumstances in which it is okay to treat people like that, to forcibly separate families and to keep people living in limbo for decades. And what is on offer here is thin gruel indeed.

Let’s also remember that the context for this is that the past couple of years has seen the closure of “safe and legal routes”, namely the Ukraine, Afghan and family reunion schemes with little if any advance notice. The latter two closures have taken place under this government. Other routes still exist but seem to have stalled through government inaction on quotas.

All that the paper says is that:

To achieve this, we will:

reform refugee sponsorship to give voluntary and community sector organisations a greater role in resettlement through named sponsorship, within caps set by government

introduce a capped route for refugee and displaced students to study in the UK, helping talented refugees to continue their studies, realise their potential and be able to return to their country and help rebuild it as soon as circumstances allow

establish a capped route for skilled refugees and displaced people to come to the UK for work, building on the experience of the Displaced Talent Mobility Pilot

It is proposed that those arriving through these routes will have to wait ten years before they can settle, this will be subject to consultation. It is unclear whether they will also have to renew their leave every two and a half years and live under the threat of removal during that decade.

Conclusion

A bullet point summary of the proposals is available as an appendix to the paper. As I said at the outset, it is unclear what will happen when. Where it has been indicated that changes will be made to the immigration rules, this can potentially happen sooner that those subject to consultation and changes to primary legislation.

This is a shameful day for Labour. These proposals are cruel, unnecessary and perhaps most importantly for the two authors of the foreword, will have no impact on the desperate people who continue to make that dangerous journey across the Channel.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-Linked_Image___1948421727_11c577fdef_3k-min-edited-600x337.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:14.390765

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda.
It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens).
There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said.
Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration.","Many members of Colorado’s Latino community fear they could be arrested by federal immigration authorities and have changed their daily lives to avoid it, a recent poll found — even as Latinos remain predominantly focused on economic concerns ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

“In every aspect of life, Latinos have attenuated their normal behavior and avoided critical locations, like work and school, in order to stay clear of the immigration (enforcement) surge,” pollster Gary Segura told reporters upon releasing the results.

The issues identified more broadly in the Colorado Latino Agenda poll, which was released earlier this month, reflect a growing national consensus among all voters, not just Latinos. The overwhelming concern with affordability — respondents’ top four issues all related to the cost of living and the economy — shows that economic fears have endured through President Donald Trump’s first nine months in office, with recent elections across the country notching wins for Democrats who focused on the issue.

But the results also revealed mounting fear about an erosion of civil rights and discontent with the Republican president’s efforts to rapidly arrest and deport millions of immigrants without proper legal status.

Forty percent of the registered voters who participated in the survey said they or their communities feared that immigration authorities would arrest them, even if they’re U.S. citizens or have some kind of legal status. And 30% said they or their communities feared interacting with or calling the police, while 28% said they or their communities feared attending regular immigration proceedings because they could be arrested.

Asked whether civil rights had improved under Trump, 62% said they hadn’t, compared to 20% who said they had.

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda. Immigrants have repeatedly been arrested while attending regular immigration hearings, as advocates have said and court filings reviewed by The Denver Post have indicated.

ProPublica, a nonprofit news outlet, reported last month that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration authorities nationwide this year. Immigrants with legal status and work permits, like a Douglas County teacher arrested last month, have also been caught up in raids and arrests.

“The actions of the Trump administration are fundamentally changing the way that Latino citizens are interacting with their government,” said Phil Chen, a political science professor at the University of Denver who reviewed the poll. “A quarter of them say that they or their community are missing classes because parents are worried about being arrested driving to school. I read (those results) as deeply, deeply troubling.”

About 23% of Colorado residents are of Hispanic or Latino origin, according to the State Demography Office.

The poll was conducted by a bipartisan polling team last month. It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens). Its margin of error was plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

Concerns with Trump, Republicans

Latino Coloradans, who have tended to vote Democratic but not monolithically, also expressed mounting concerns with the Trump administration and Republicans who control Congress. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they were concerned that Congress wasn’t acting as a check on Trump. Asked who was to blame for the recent government shutdown, 61% said the president and his party, compared to 23% who blamed Democrats. Two-thirds disapproved of Trump’s performance in office.

There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said. More than a third of respondents said they’d voted for Trump in 2024.

The vast majority of that group — 80% — said they would vote for him again. But 13% said they wouldn’t, and the remaining 7% said they were unsure. Of those who supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, 91% said they would vote for her again, and the remaining share said they weren’t sure.

“When there’s a party that holds all of the levers of power in the federal government, (voters) are going to blame that party for things they think are not going well and probably give them credit for things that are going well,” Chen said. “This is the pattern we expect to find in every off-year and midterm election.

“So if you were (U.S. Rep.) Gabe Evans or the state Republican Party, I think it’s really important to start thinking about how you talk about issues around affordability — around housing costs, food costs, inflation, job opportunities, things like that.”

Evans, a Republican, represents the 8th Congressional District stretching from the northern Denver suburbs to Greeley, and it’s one of the most contested congressional seats in the country. Much of his successful 2024 campaign focused on immigration and public safety.

‘Latinos are looking for leadership’

Still, criticism of Trump doesn’t necessarily mean Latino voters are running straight into the arms of the Democratic Party, said Alex Sánchez, the president and CEO of Voces Unidas, which is part of the coalition that released the poll.

Fifty-two percent of self-identified independents surveyed in the poll said they either didn’t know which party they’d support next year or that they wanted to support someone else. (A plurality of independents, 35%, said they would support Democrats, compared to 12% for Republicans.)

“There are warning signs to both parties in the data,” Sánchez said in an interview. “While, yes, Colorado Democrats fare better … they’re not too far from the danger zone. That’s what we see in the data: a clear sign that Latinos are looking for leadership, are looking for results.”

He added about Latinos: “We are not brand loyal. We don’t carry the party loyalty the same way that other voters do. Latinas and Latinos historically vote based on value and vote based on results, instead of party sticker and party label.”

Despite the unpopularity of the Trump administration’s mass-deportation efforts, affordability concerns were still far and away the top concerns for voters. Forty-eight percent of respondents said the cost of living and inflation were their top priority.

Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration. More than half of respondents said it was most important for election officials to tackle either prices and affordability, or wages and good jobs.

That’s unsurprising, Chen said. Affordability was a dominant issue in elections elsewhere in the U.S. earlier this month, he said, and has remained a top issue for all Colorado voters for years.

With next year’s midterms approaching, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had begun floating new affordability ideas in recent weeks as it faces the reality that Americans are still pessimistic about the economy as they struggle with higher prices.

“You can think of (the immigration crackdown) as a problem. It can affect your impressions of President Trump,” Chen said. “But when it comes to how (Latinos) are going to vote, (they’re) going to vote on the thing that’s really affected me, which is the economy.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-L-immigrant-rights-RJS-13431.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:08.249902

Refugee and migrant rights are women’s rights.","Today (17th November 2025), the government has announced plans to rollback rights and protections for refugees and people seeking safety in the UK.

In a joint statement, Southall Black Sisters Hibiscus, End Violence Against Women Coalition and Latin American Women’s Rights Service responded to these plans.

We are outraged by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood’s announcement today introducing a sweeping roll-back of the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees seeking safety in the UK. These measures, described by the Home Secretary as ‘the most significant changes to our asylum system in modern times’, will have devastating and life-threatening consequences for women and children, particularly those trapped in cycles of abuse. They will further restrict women’s already limited ability to escape violence and exploitation.

These policies disregard the daily realities we as specialist ending violence against women and girls organisations witness firsthand on the frontline. We see, with painful clarity, that insecure immigration status is one of the strongest predictors of continued abuse, exploitation, and homelessness. When the state strips away human-rights protections, restricts family-life claims, renders refugees’ settlement temporary, and closes off safe routes to safety, the consequences fall most brutally on women and children who are already marginalised and least able to defend themselves.

The hostile environment, now intensified by these regressive reforms, is fuelling an already-burning fire. Women who have fled violence must now navigate not only abuse and precarity but also an increasingly punitive and unsafe public climate. Against this backdrop, the government’s reshaping of the immigration framework, including the erosion of Article 8 protections enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights, the removal of the statutory duty to support people seeking asylum, and the creation of ‘talent-based’ routes to safety, rings alarm bells for migrant victim-survivors and their children. These proposals should alarm anyone with any stake in women’s rights and human rights.

Refugee and migrant rights are women’s rights. We stand united in condemning these reforms and call on the government to immediately reverse course and adopt a genuine human-rights based approach to overhauling the UK’s immigration and asylum systems.",https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Refugee-and-migrant-rights-are-womens-rights.-1400-x-1434-px.png,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:22.296762

Many Republicans are expected to support a vote in the US House this week to force the justice department to release the files.
“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” he posted on his Truth Social network on Sunday evening.
For years, Trump’s Maga base, including people who now have prominent positions in his administration, have called for the release of the Epstein files, suggesting there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful.
“Releasing the Epstein files is the easiest thing in the world,” she told Politico on Friday.","Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to back the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, an abrupt reversal, is a rare instance of the president being unable to tame his Maga base and being instead forced to accede to it.

Many Republicans are expected to support a vote in the US House this week to force the justice department to release the files. Once the measure passes, it would still need approval in the US Senate, where 13 Republican senators would need to join with all 47 Democrats to approve it.

Trump spent last week aggressively squeezing allies in the US House, including Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, to back off in their support of releasing the files. Those efforts were unsuccessful, and when it became apparent the measure was going to pass, Trump backed it in an effort to salvage an embarrassing political loss. “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” he posted on his Truth Social network on Sunday evening.

For years, Trump’s Maga base, including people who now have prominent positions in his administration, have called for the release of the Epstein files, suggesting there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful. Trump supported the release as a candidate. But earlier this year, the justice department said it had reviewed the files and would not be releasing more documents. That set off more furor and pressure on Trump to release them.

The House oversight committee last week released a tranche of documents they obtained from Epstein’s estate, including messages in which Epstein wrote that Trump knew of Epstein’s conduct. The messages also show Trump ally Steve Bannon advising Epstein on how to rehabilitate his image. Epstein further corresponded with other prominent people, including the former treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers; the journalist Michael Wolff; and Kathryn Ruemmler, Barack Obama’s former White House counsel.

The release of those messages has only further increased scrutiny on Trump, and built the pressure to release everything the government still has on Epstein – which could be quite a lot, given the number of federal investigations conducted into him.

Some Maga influencers have sought to pivot the story away from Trump. Megyn Kelly, the conservative radio host, appeared to question whether Epstein really was a pedophile. “There’s a difference between a 15-year-old and a five-year-old,” she said on her podcast. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to one count of soliciting an underage prostitute and in 2019 faced federal sex trafficking charges for girls as young as 14. Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.

The issue has ignited a bitter split with Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House representative of Georgia, who has increasingly styled herself as someone in touch with the real Maga base and has refused to blindly back Trump through the Epstein saga. “Releasing the Epstein files is the easiest thing in the world,” she told Politico on Friday. “Just release it all, let the American people sort through every bit of it, and, you know, support the victims. That’s just like the most common sense, easiest thing in the world. But to spend any effort trying to stop it makes – it just doesn’t make sense to me.”

Trump repeatedly attacked Greene over the weekend, calling her a “traitor”, amid other insults. Greene decried the president’s rhetoric during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. “Those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” she said.

Later that evening she posted on social media that she and her family had started receiving hoax pizza deliveries, and that there had been a pipe bomb threat directed at her construction company. Pressed on CNN about why she was speaking out against the president’s rhetoric now, as she had not condemned his similarly viscous rhetoric in the past, she was evasive.

“I’m only responsible for myself and my own words and actions … and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” she said. “I really want to just see people be kind to one another.” She also stressed during the interview that she continued to support the president and his administration.

But whether Trump’s reversal will effectively quell the pressure from his base, or if he will continue to feel the heat – including from some of his otherwise staunchest allies – will be closely watched.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8667e758ebab167407a2be7c707c2d7a8eea33d8/1517_310_4872_3897/master/4872.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d07b473e69c0f29e23ea85b18507709e",N,,2025-11-17 13:57:23.160976

The lawsuit alleges detainees with mobility issues don’t have access to wheelchairs, and in some cases are unable to bathe or dress themselves.

The plaintiffs are seeking to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all detainees housed at the California City Immigration Processing Center, which is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield and run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

“In their haste to warehouse hundreds of men and women in this isolated facility, defendants have failed to provide for the basic human needs of the people for whose lives and wellbeing they are legally responsible,” the lawsuit alleges.

ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August. On average, there were about 480 people held in the detention center each day in September, and the facility has the capability to house up to 2,560 people. The lawsuit asserts 800 people are now housed there.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on the lawsuit for this story.

In September, a state disability rights group conducted a two-day inspection of the facility and found that its operators failed to distribute medication for life-threatening conditions and did not schedule timely surgeries for people that needed them.

CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month. Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, in a written statement at the time said the site provides robust medical care. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

The detention center’s accelerated opening was part of the Trump administration’s plan to execute the largest deportation program in U.S. history. California City’s mayor previously told CalMatters the federal government opened the facility without proper permits or a business license as required by state law.

“In the rush to expand capacity, ICE has cobbled together a patchwork system of county jails, private prisons, and newly converted facilities across the country. The rapid and haphazard growth of the detention system has outstripped any meaningful system of accountability or oversight,” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit was filed by Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP.

Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits. Counties in California have the option to inspect immigration detention facilities, although few do. Three of the four counties in California that host the facilities have not held inspections.

Seventeen people have died in ICE facilities this year, two in California. The agency’s official list of deaths in custody documents 15. Two subsequent deaths — one each in California and New York have not yet been added to the ICE list.

One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, alleged that he has been denied medication for a heart condition for days at a time. The lawsuit alleges the lack of medication led to him being hospitalized twice.

“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges. “Mr. Roque Campos has yet to see a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication.”",https://kcet.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bae653f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkcet-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F00%2F4f%2F36efe1f64c54a9b9873f68e7e1b4%2Fcalcity-detention-mv-cm-12.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:58:18.171450

Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Mahmood said undocumented migration is “tearing the country apart”.

end of list

The government’s proposals, to be unveiled on Monday, will have two main prongs. First, they would end the automatic path to settled status for refugees after five years. And second, they would remove state benefits from those who have the right to work and can support themselves.

After a summer of fierce protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers and an anti-immigration march in London, Mahmood also announced new plans to curb small-boat crossings from France as well as to return refugees to their home countries once it is safe to do so.

What are the current immigration numbers?

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that net migration – the number of people entering a country minus the number leaving – had hovered around 200,000 to 300,000 people per year since 2011.

However, after Brexit was enacted in 2020, there was a large increase in the number of undocumented immigrants entering the UK. Data from the ONS showed net migration climbed to 906,000 for the 12 months to June 2023.

But more recent figures showed those numbers have fallen dramatically since then. Net migration figures dropped by more than half in 2024 – to 431,000. This was largely owing to a decrease in the number of healthcare and student visas made available last year.

Meanwhile, despite a UK media focus on people arriving in small boats from France, this group makes up a small share of the overall number of people entering the country. In 2024, for instance, the Home Office found that 36,816 people who arrived in the UK came via small boats.

In total, 108,138 people claimed asylum last year. Of those, only one-third came via small boats. As such, most claims for asylum went through formal channels (and included some dependants of those people).

Despite the falling numbers, disquiet with the ruling Labour Party remains rife. In an August YouGov poll, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Reform UK, an anti-immigration party, would be more effective at handling asylum cases than Labour, who secured just 9 percent of the tally.

What changes is the government announcing?

Access to citizenship

On Monday, the government is expected to announce a shift from permanent settlement for refugees to a temporary-protection model.

Current rules stipulate that refugees granted asylum may remain in the UK for five years before being able to apply for an “indefinite leave to remain”, opening the door to citizenship.

But under the new plans, those who enter the UK through the asylum process could face up to 20 years before seeking permanent residency.

In addition, people granted asylum would have to renew their status every 30 months to see if the situation in their home country has changed such that UK residence is still required.

Access to social benefits

Mahmood said she intends to repeal the legal duty of the government to provide accommodation and basic financial support to all asylum seekers.

The government is expected to withdraw support from asylum seekers deemed able to work as well as from those people who commit offences, ignore removal orders or work illegally.

Asylum seekers may currently apply for permission to work if their asylum claim has been outstanding for 12 months or more and if the delay is not considered their fault.

What do refugee rights groups say?

Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council charity, said that instead of deterring migrants, the 20-year path to citizenship would “leave people in limbo and experiencing intense anxiety for many, many years”.

“We need a system that is controlled and is fair, and the way you do that is you make decisions fairly, in a timely fashion, and if someone is found to be a refugee, they go on and they contribute to our communities and they pay back,” he told the programme BBC Breakfast on Sunday.

Mahmood’s proposal for 30-month checks implies that refugees could be sent back to their home countries once the government believes conditions on the ground have improved – an approach inspired by Denmark’s much-debated policy.

Although research by the Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook has found that deterrence has limited influence on where asylum seekers travel to, a 2017 study did suggest that Denmark’s “negative branding” had led to fewer asylum applications.

How have others reacted to the proposals?

While Oxford University’s Migration Observatory said Mahmood’s overhaul would make the UK’s immigration system among the strictest countries in Europe, Matt Vickers, the opposition home office minister, said the government’s new plans to reform the asylum system contain “lots of gimmicks”.

He told the BBC that a “deterrent” is what is needed: “If people arrive in this country and know they’re going to get sent back, they won’t get in those boats in the first place.”

What other proposals is the UK government making?

Using artificial intelligence tools to assess age

The government wants to introduce artificial intelligence-based assessments to determine the age of people who arrive without documentation. Ministers said errors in the current system risk placing adults in children’s services or wrongly treating minors as adults.

Rights groups, however, warned that automated systems could entrench bias, wrongly classify children as adults and expose them to harm.

Earlier this year, Solomon told the BBC that he was “not convinced” that using AI tools was the government’s correct approach on age identification because he has concerns about children being put in unsafe situations. He added that “these [AI] technologies continue to raise serious questions about accuracy, ethics and fairness.”

Visa ban threat for three African countries

The Home Office has said visa applications from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be refused unless their governments improve collaboration with the UK regarding the deportation of their nationals.

In a statement, the department cited “unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive return procedures” as the reason for the potential penalty.

It said restrictions would apply “unless they agree to accept the return of their criminals and irregular migrants”.

Right to ‘family life’ claims to be checked

UK media are also reporting the government is set to limit how UK courts interpret the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in matters related to family life.

Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to a family and private life, will be reinterpreted “to better reflect the expectations of the British public”, the government is expected to say.

The new law would likely clarify that a “family connection” refers to immediate relatives only, such as a parent or child, and not to extended family members.

How will Ukrainian refugees be affected?

Asked about Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion, Mahmood said they would continue to be admitted on a “bespoke scheme” but would also be expected to return once the war ends. She stressed that many arrivals from Ukraine have expressed a desire to return home.

Under the current scheme, Ukrainian refugees have the right to live in the UK for up to three years with access to healthcare, education and benefits. As these visas are temporary, Ukrainian nationals are largely exempt from the new 20‑year settlement rules for asylum seekers.

Will there be new authorised pathways for asylum seekers to come to the UK?

Apart from Ukrainians, vulnerable people from Afghanistan are provided with legal residence, access to work, education and healthcare through the UK’s Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme.

In addition, the British national overseas (BNO) visa allows Hong Kong BNO status holders and their dependents the right to live, work and study in the UK, providing a pathway to settlement and eventual citizenship.

Mahmood also told the BBC that new “safe and legal” avenues will be introduced to try to reduce the number of people attempting perilous crossings of the English Channel.

Organisations such as Amnesty International have repeatedly highlighted that restrictive policies and limited visa schemes leave many people with no option but to attempt illegal entry.

Amnesty has called on Westminster to expand legal avenues – such as resettlement schemes, family reunification and community sponsorship – to reduce people smuggling and fatalities.

One option would be to allow individuals and charities in the UK to sponsor refugees, echoing the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which endows local communities with housing responsibilities.

The aim of these schemes, which would be for a limited number of people, is to give local areas more control to improve support.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-15T224658Z_1844714237_RC2Q1HA5XEDE_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-POLITICS-MIGRATION-1763379409.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-17 13:57:39.157285

The Trump administration has deployed a sweeping crackdown on immigration, launching ICE raids across the country and removing legal barriers in order to make deportations faster. The study found that while Democrats were largely consistent in their opposition to these immigration policies, Republican sentiment varied more, especially by age, gender and ethnicity.

“At least some subset of Republicans are seeing that these immigration strategies are a step too far,” said G. Cristina Mora, a sociology professor and co-director of the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, which administered the poll. The polling data were collected from nearly 5,000 registered voters in mid-August. Just over 1,000 of those surveyed were registered Republicans.

Latino Republicans, with whom Trump made historic gains during the 2024 elections, showed the highest levels of disagreement with the party’s aggressive stance on immigration. Young people from 18 to 29 and moderate women in the Republican Party also more significantly diverged from Trump’s policies.

The majority of Republican respondents expressed approval of Trump’s immigration strategy overall. However, the study found respondents diverged more from Trump’s policies that ignore established legal processes, including due process, birthright citizenship and identification of federal agents.

“On these legalistic issues, this is where you see some of the bigger breaks,” Mora said.

Of those surveyed, 28% disapproved of the end of birthright citizenship, which Trump is pushing for, and 45% agreed that ICE agents should show clear identification. Four in 10 Republican respondents also support due process for detained immigrants.

Young people, who make up about 15% of the party in California, were on average also more likely to break from Trump’s policies than older Republicans.

The analysis also found that education level and region had almost no impact on respondents' beliefs on immigration.

Latinos and women were more likely to disagree with Trump on humanitarian issues than their demographic counterparts.

Nearly 60% of moderate Republican women disagree with deporting longtime undocumented immigrants, compared with 47% of moderate men. 45% of women believe ICE raids unfairly target Latino communities.

The political party was most split across racial lines when it came to immigration enforcement being expanded into hospitals and schools. Forty-four percent of Latinos disagreed with the practice, compared with 26% of white respondents, while 46% of Latino respondents disagreed with deporting immigrants who have resided in the country for a long time, compared with just 30% of their white counterparts.

Trump had gained a significant Latino vote that helped him win reelection last year. Democratic candidates, however, made gains with Latino voters in elections earlier this month, indicating a possible shift away from the GOP.

The data could indicate Latino Republicans “are somewhat disillusioned” by the Trump administration's handling of immigration, Mora said. “Latinos aren't just disagreeing on the issues that we think are about process and American legal fairness. They’re also disagreeing on just the idea that this is cruel.”

Mora said the deluge of tense and sometimes violent encounters posted online could have an impact on Republican opinion surrounding immigration. A plainclothes agent pointed his gun at a female driver in Santa Ana last week, and two shootings involving ICE agents took place in Southern California late last month.

“You now have several months of Latinos being able to log on to their social media and see every kind of video of Latinos being targeted with or without papers,” Mora said. “I have to believe that that is doing something to everybody, not just Latino Republicans or Latino Democrats.”

More from James Baratta

AT&T has raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from its contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) since the early 2000s. Last year, the company inked a ten-year contract worth $146 million to “provide mission-critical communications services that support the agency’s national security and emergency preparedness mission,” a press release explains. (Verizon did the same, though its contract with DHS was valued at $176 million.)

But DHS is a very different animal during Donald Trump’s second term, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) conducting an unprecedented campaign of mass detention and deportation. In August, ICE sole-sourced an $11 million contract to AT&T for data analytics and support services. The company also received a $14 million payout from CBP in April for network-related services. Critics say AT&T does not need these rather modest contracts to remain profitable. For the past several quarters, the company’s revenues have consistently hovered around $30 billion, and its annual revenues have yet to fall shy of $120 billion.

“AT&T is enabling and profiting off of the invasion and defunding of our city and state,” said Will Tanzman, executive director of the People’s Lobby, a Chicago-based community advocacy group. “I think a lot of Chicagoans wouldn’t want to be supporting that.”

The Trump administration has sustained its assault on Chicago over the city’s sanctuary policies, threatening to withhold federal funding and deploying 200 ICE officers as part of Operation Midway Blitz in September. As my colleague Emma Janssen reported, federal immigration authorities have terrorized residents of the Windy City, killing a man in a suburb and firing pepper balls at peaceful protesters; immigration attorneys have struggled to track down their clients; and now, Chicagoans have set their sights on AT&T for “enabling and supporting the level of civil liberties violations and human rights violations that ICE is engaging in,” Tanzman told the Prospect.

The People’s Lobby and ONE People’s Campaign—member organizations of People’s Action, a national network of community activists—recently introduced a petition demanding that AT&T drop its contracts with DHS. In a joint statement, organizers criticized the telecom giant for “choosing to both collect money from customers who are in the crosshairs, and line its pockets with public dollars from DHS and ICE, whose agents are masked, unidentifiable, and operating without warrants as they terrorize members of the public in communities like Chicago.” The petition, which is addressed to AT&T CEO John Stankey, includes a pledge to “not buy or upgrade” the company’s products until it cuts ties with federal law enforcement agencies.

“We also see this as part of a larger strategy,” said Tanzman, an AT&T customer and proud Chicagoan. He expects the grassroots campaigns behind that strategy, which seeks to hold consumer-facing corporations accountable for “enabling and supporting” the Trump administration’s sweeping domestic agenda, to step up their organizing efforts in the near term. On Sunday afternoon, People’s Action organized protests at several AT&T stores throughout Chicago.

“This definitely is the season when a lot of people go out and spend money at retail establishments,” Tanzman told the Prospect. “I think this is a real opportunity for consumers to make some different decisions.”

The groundswell of grassroots organizing against consumer brands that have either supported federal immigration authorities as they ambush and kidnap immigrants at work and school, or done nothing to stop it, seems to be gaining traction. On August 12, organizers in Los Angeles coordinated a nationwide boycott of household names like The Home Depot that they say have been complicit in the federal immigration crackdown, and mobilized to support migrant workers and businesses. For their part, No Tech for ICE and adjacent campaigns have taken direct action to urge cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services to stop fueling Trump’s well-oiled deportation machine.

There is proof of concept here, as well. A similar mass subscription cancellation campaign prompted Disney to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show after he was suspended in an effort to appease the MAGA mob.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act unlocked unprecedented levels of funding for federal law enforcement agencies, with much of that funding going toward immigration enforcement, and set the table for the largest transfer of wealth to the rich in history. The People’s Lobby has been channeling the unpopularity of looming cuts to health care and food assistance programs into direct action, spending “a lot of this year pushing for the state of Illinois to tax some of the corporations that are benefiting from the big, ugly bill, so that our state can recoup some of that money in order to mitigate the negative impact,” Tanzman said. The economic fallout of that impact seems to be compelling more Americans to take a stand against consumer brands with ties to federal law enforcement agencies, which “are engaging in really reprehensible behavior that is becoming increasingly unpopular,” he told the Prospect.

“As we approach Black Friday, I think any company that has anything to do with ICE or the Trump regime is likely to see some significant backlash from consumers,” Tanzman continued. “People are likely to continue to organize more peaceful protests of those companies.”",https://i0.wp.com/prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25318635173472.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-17 13:57:52.007006

Many EOs followed regarding DOGE and its role in the government, but two in particular have been challenged heavily in the courts: EO 14219 and EO 14222.

Lawful Governance

EO 14219, signed on February 19, 2025, established the way DOGE would operate and the purpose behind the department’s responsibilities. According to the EO, one of the purposes of DOGE is to find and rescind unlawful regulations and regulations that undermine the national interest. Through this EO, President Trump allowed DOGE to begin the process of reviewing all regulations in consultation with the Attorney General’s office. Exempt from the EO are actions relating to the military, national security, foreign affairs, immigration, and homeland security, as well as the executive branch’s management of its employees and anything else exempted by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

This EO was meant to “commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome administrative state” and to focus the executive branch on ensuring regulations are fully constitutional and follow federal statutes. It requires DOGE to work with department heads in the process of reviewing, auditing, and deregulating areas that are not in line with the Trump administration’s agenda, the Constitution, and/or the national interest.

Cost Efficiency

EO 14222, signed on February 26, 2025, focused on transparency in the spending of the federal government relating to contracts, grants, and loans, with the goal of providing accountability to the American people. This EO orders that all agency heads should build systems, with the help of DOGE, to “seamlessly record every payment issued by the agency pursuant to each of the agency’s covered contracts and grants, along with a brief, written justification for each payment.” Once this is completed, there will be ongoing requirements for agencies and their employees to follow regarding spending by the agency and in the employees’ official capacities within the department.

The administration also ordered continued review of grants and contracts that require approval, justification of non-essential travel, and scrutiny of the government’s real property holdings. This EO also has broad exemptions, including law enforcement, homeland security, and classified information.

Attempts at Efficiency Lead to Extensive Litigation

Presently there are 11 court cases pending regarding EO 14222. Of those 11, four are still awaiting a court ruling, courts have issued temporary injunctions against the EO in six of the suits, and one has a pending appeal.

EO 14219 is the focus of eight lawsuits, and all eight of those court cases also list EO 14158 in their challenge. Two suits were consolidated in New Mexico et al. v. Musk, and in both cases, the plaintiffs’ motions for temporary restraining orders were denied. Four other cases are awaiting a court ruling, and two are pending appeal.

Some of the challenges raised surround the creation of DOGE and the appointment of Elon Musk in his role as the head of DOGE. Although Mr. Musk has since stepped away from the role, at the time, those challenging the EOs argued that since Mr. Musk was exercising significant government authority, he should have been approved through U.S. Senate confirmation. Since that did not happen, the cases raise the question as to whether he has the authority to be in that position and to exercise the control that President Trump has given him. In New Mexico et al. v. Musk, Joshua Fisher, the Director of the Office of Administration, submitted a declaration that explained that Mr. Musk is only an employee of the White House Office, with “no greater authority than other senior White House advisors,” and denying that Mr. Musk has any formal role with DOGE. Both complaints made in the originally separated cases ask that all action taken to date by Mr. Musk, as well as any future action he may take, be deemed to have no legal effect. The consolidated defendants’ motion to dismiss was denied in a May 27, 2025, memorandum opinion, with the exception of allowing President Trump to be removed as a defendant.

The lawsuits challenging these EOs focus heavily on blocking mass firings and limiting executive overreach, arguing that the separation of powers and checks and balances are sufficient. In the still-pending case State of Maryland v. Corporation for National and Community Service, filed on April 29, 2025, Maryland joined 23 other states and the District of Columbia to challenge AmeriCorps placing over 85 percent of its staff on administrative leave at the direction of President Trump’s administration. The plaintiffs argue that this bypasses Congress’ authority and “violates the Constitution’s separation of powers.” Similar layoffs, as well as budget cuts and other mandates, have occurred throughout other government agencies as DOGE continues to audit and monitor agency actions, as documented on its website and X account. DOGE is expected to continue its work until July 4, 2026.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-white-house-2186187195.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:58:24.332322

We affirmed the judgments of conviction for both Defendant and his company.

Defendant was the founder and CEO of a technology company. Defendant pleaded guilty, on behalf of himself and on behalf of his company, to 20 counts of wire fraud for fraudulently obtaining and reselling Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. After the guilty pleas had been entered, Defendant moved to withdraw them, arguing that intervening Supreme Court precedent invalidated the theory of prosecution for the wire fraud convictions. The district court denied Defendant’s motion. Defendant also maintained that the district court erred in failing to advise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea and that his counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of those consequences. Separately, Defendant’s company asserted that Defendant lacked the requisite authority to enter guilty pleas on its behalf.

Specifically, among other things, Defendant maintained that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the district court had failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(O). Although we agreed that the district court erred in failing to provide this warning, we found its failure to do so harmless. Defendant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Iran. Although Defendant was charged with criminal conduct that began prior to his naturalization, Defendant’s pre-naturalization conduct for which he was indicted, arrested, and convicted of after being naturalized could subject him to denaturalization.

The district court erred by failing to inform Defendant of immigration consequences if he entered a guilty plea as mandated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(O). Indeed, at oral argument, the Government agreed that the district court’s failure to read the warning was error. That did not end our analysis, however. If a criminal defendant demonstrates that the district court abused its discretion by failing to give a Rule 11(b)(1)(O) warning, the burden shifts to the prosecution to prove that the error was harmless. Here, the Government met this burden. The district court’s failure to provide the Rule 11(b)(1)(O) advice did not affect Defendant’s substantial rights. The text of the Rule references only immigration consequences for those individuals who are not United States citizens. At the time Defendant pleaded guilty, he was a citizen of the U.S., and he remains a citizen today. Thus, a warning meant for those who are not U.S. citizens would not have put Defendant on notice of the potential immigration consequences.

The Supreme Court agreed to review an effort by the Trump administration to limit asylum processing claims from immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in an order issued Thursday.

The key issue in the case, Noem v. Al Otro Lado, is over what constitutes ""arrival in the United States"" within the meaning of federal immigration law. The law provides that an alien who ""arrives"" may apply for asylum and must be inspected by an immigration officer.

The legal question, however, is over whether an immigrant ""arrives"" to begin the process for the asylum claim when meeting immigration officers on the U.S. side of the border or while still on the Mexican side.

The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court said someone ""arrives"" when they present themselves to an immigration official ""at the border,"" even if that meeting occurs on Mexican soil.

SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY

The lower court had ruled that ""metering,"" or turning away or delaying asylum-seekers because the port was deemed full, was unlawful.

The U.S. provided protection to 54,350 asylum seekers during 2023, according to data compiled by the Office of Homeland Security Statistics, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

BORDER CROSSINGS PLUMMET TO HISTORIC LOWS; TRUMP'S ENFORCEMENT POLICIES YIELD BIG RESULTS

That figure included 22,300 individuals who were granted asylum by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services within DHS and 32,050 individuals who were granted asylum defensively by the U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments next year with a ruling expected by early summer.

Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives will offer supportive opposition to the government's asylum reforms - but has said they're ""nowhere near enough"".","The government has just released a 32-page dossier outlining its reforms of the asylum system in full.

The lengthy document is topped by a foreword from the prime minister, who begins his contribution by stating that the ""world has changed"" and it is ""our responsibility to renew the application of those values as new challenges arise"".

Sir Keir Starmer added: ""It is more volatile and insecure, with increased conflict leading to a significant increase in the movement of people across the globe.

""Our asylum system was not designed to cope with this. Nor were our rules designed for the situation that sees asylum seekers travelling through multiple safe countries before seeking to cross the English Channel by boat.""

He says this has resulted in ""severe strain"" not only on the asylum system, but also on the ""wider social contract"".

The PM adds that the UK is a ""decent, compassionate, tolerant country"", but that the government must control the borders to maintain ""confidence in those values"".

He says the UK's current asylum regime ""is a significant pull factor"" and is ""more permissive than the European mainstream"".

This means, he explains, that the UK needs an ""approach with a stronger deterrent effect and rules that are robustly enforced"".

He concludes: ""The principle that people genuinely fleeing danger and persecution should be welcomed is one this government will always defend – an expression of the UK's values in action.

""But that principle depends upon social confidence that our asylum system is fair, effective and humane.""

You can read the document in full (if you really wish) here.

We'll bring you more of what we've learnt from it shortly.

A Labour MP has launched an attack on her government's asylum reforms, calling them ""dystopian"" and ""shameful"".

Nadia Whittome told the Commons: ""The Denmark-style policies briefed in the last couple of days are dystopian.

""It's shameful that a Labour government is ripping up the rights and protections of people who have endured unimaginable trauma.

""How can we be adopting such obviously cruel policies? Is the home secretary proud that the government has sunk to such depths that it's now being praised by [far-right activist] Tommy Robinson?""

Responding to her question, Shabana Mahmood said that she was ""disappointed at the nature of the question"".

She urged Whittome to look at ""the detail"" of the reforms and insisted she as home secretary has a ""moral duty"" to ""fix"".

""Our asylum system is broken. The breaking of that asylum system is causing huge division across the whole country.""

She insisted the changes she will set out later will fix the problem and ""unite what is today a divided country"".

Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives will offer supportive opposition to the government's asylum reforms - but has said they're ""nowhere near enough"".

The Tory leader told journalists that she does welcome the reforms and called them a ""small step in the right direction"".

But she insisted that her party wants ""to ban all asylum claims completely"" and leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

She said: ""We're going to work with them to try and get this through, because what I know is that a lot of Labour backbenchers hate this stuff.

""We are going to do everything we can to support her.

""Unless we leave the ECHR, I suspect Shabana Mahmood is going to run into the same legal problems that the Conservative government ran into.""

Badenoch criticised the decision to still offer asylum seekers a path to permanent citizenship (after 20 years), saying she would like to see everybody who arrives in the UK illegally ""gone within a week"".

""If you arrive in our country illegally, you need to be sent home,"" she added.

""If people know that they can get citizenship after arriving here illegally, they're going to encourage more and more people to come here.""

She also admitted that leaving the ECHR is ""not a silver bullet"" but is a ""measure necessary in order to do lots of other things"".

Badenoch also called for the creation of a removals force, the end of immigration tribunals, and the end of judicial reviews ""that mean that court cases go on and on"".

Labour MP Richard Burgon is the latest to speak out against the government's major reforms to the asylum system to make the UK much less attractive to illegal migrants, and speed up deportations.

The MP, who is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, labelled the announcement ""a further desperate attempt to outdo Reform and chase its voters"", and noted that Labour has ""moved a long way from the days when the prime minister promised 'an immigration system based on compassion and dignity'"".

Writing on X, Burgon said: ""We now have policies and briefings that seem to have been dragged from the moral sewer - and that are even being celebrated by far-right figures like 'Tommy Robinson'.""

He continued: ""This approach isn’t just morally wrong; it’s politically disastrous.""

He argued that the voters who have left Labour since the general election will not come back as a result of these policies, and most fled to progressive parties anyway.

Watch: Can the asylum plan unite Labour?

Burgon called on the government to focus on cost of living to ""win back voters"", and added: ""This failing Labour leadership is choosing to fight on terrain set by Farage. In doing so, it is paving the way for the first far-right government in our history.""

Ian Byrne, a fellow Labour MP who is also a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, has issued a similar statement.

The Liverpool West Derby MP wrote on X: ""The polls are clear, the cost of living crisis is what matters.

""That's where we should focus, and that's why I'm launching the Right to Food Commission today, while the leadership is fighting on ground chosen by Farage, paving the way for a dangerous far-right future.""

He also labelled the government's plans ""morally bankrupt and politically disastrous"".

Many Labour MPs have been left shellshocked after the chaotic political self-sabotage of the past week.

Bafflement, anger, disappointment, and sheer frustration are all on relatively open display at the circular firing squad which seems to have surrounded the prime minister.

The botched effort to flush out backroom plotters and force Wes Streeting to declare his loyalty ahead of the budget has, instead, led even previously-loyal Starmerites to predict the PM could be forced out of office before the local elections in May.

""We have so many councillors coming up for election across the country,"" one says. ""And at the moment it looks like they're going to be wiped out.

""That's our base - we just can't afford to lose them. I like Keir [Starmer] but there's only a limited window left to turn things around. There's a real question of urgency.""

Another criticised a ""boys club"" at Number 10 who they claimed have ""undermined"" the prime minister and ""forgotten they're meant to be serving the British people"".

We've heard a lot this morning about the government's plan to reform - toughen up - the rules around claiming asylum in the UK.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has called it a ""moral mission"", claiming how the UK is divided by the issue and how she wants to resolve this.

Central to the government's plans has been a look at the Danish model.

So, what is Denmark's record on immigration, and how does it all work?

Denmark has adopted increasingly restrictive rules in order to deal with migration over the last few years.

In Denmark, most asylum or refugee statuses are temporary. Residency can be revoked once a country is deemed safe.

In order to achieve settlement, asylum seekers are required to be in full-time employment, and the length of time it takes to acquire those rights has been extended.

Denmark also has tougher rules on family reunification - both the sponsor and their partner are required to be at least 24 years old, which the Danish government says is designed to prevent forced marriages.

The sponsor must also not have claimed welfare for three years and must provide a financial guarantee for their partner. Both must also pass a Danish language test.

In 2018, Denmark introduced what it called a ghetto package, a controversial plan to radically alter some residential areas, including by demolishing social housing. Areas with over 1,000 residents were defined as ghettos if more than 50% were ""immigrants and their descendants from non-Western countries"".

In 2021, the left of centre government passed a law that allowed refugees arriving on Danish soil to be moved to asylum centres in a partner country - and subsequently agreed with Rwanda to explore setting up a program, although that has been put on hold.

The government has come in for major criticism from some of its own backbenchers for the major reforms it is about to announce to make the UK much less attractive to illegal migrants, and speed up deportations.

Downing Street has defended its position, telling journalists that their policy ""reflects the mandate we have been given to secure our borders and deal with the asylum system that we've inherited"".

Asked whether it was chasing the hard-right, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are responding to the mandate we have been given, and the public can tell that the pace and scale of illegal migration is out of control, unfair and placing huge pressure on communities.

""And the prime minister wants to fix the chaos in the asylum system so we can move away from division and decline and build a Britain for all.""

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he said: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""

Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice held a news conference this morning to tout his party's work on reducing spending in local councils.

Our political correspondent Rob Powell asked why he thinks so many councillors have left their party.

Tice replied: ""Councillors come and go. We've welcomed lots of defections to Reform from all over the place.

""But ultimately, people have to abide by our principles and values. We are a team. We're a large family, and like all families, we have our debates, our discussions, our excitements.

""But those are always best played out behind closed doors. And when you've got 1,000 councillors give or take, just under - stuff will happen.""

Tice added that voters ""want more Reform, not less Reform"".",https://e3.365dm.com/25/09/1600x900/skynews-shabana-mahmood-hub_7014255.jpg?20250908115205,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:24.470936

Federal law requires the government to process asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry. But in 2018, President Donald Trump’s first administration began a policy known as “metering,” in which border agents simply turned back potential asylum seekers to Mexico before they entered the US.

An immigrant rights group, Al Otro Lado, and several asylum seekers filed a lawsuit in California challenging the policy. An appeals court based in San Francisco sided with the migrants, and the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in July.

The practical impact of the litigation, at least for now, is limited at best. The Biden administration rescinded “metering” and instead began requiring most people seeking asylum to make an appointment before arriving at a port of entry. Because of that, Al Otro Lado argued that the case “has almost no present implications, and likely no future implications either.”

But the Trump administration balked at that reasoning, telling the Supreme Court that “this administration and future administrations should retain the option of reviving that practice when border conditions justify doing so.”

In that sense, the fact that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case was already a win for Trump.

A divided 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal law requires border agencies to inspect asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry, even if they did not enter the country. In its appeal to the high court, the Trump administration argued that cannot be right.

“In ordinary English, a person ‘arrives in’ a country only when he comes within its borders,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court. “An alien thus does not ‘arrive in’ the United States while he is still in Mexico.”

But the groups supporting Al Otro Lado said that reading would make a mockery of the asylum process, empowering officials to render “inspection and asylum processing requirements wholly inoperable at ports of entry – the designated places where noncitizens may lawfully come into the United States – by simply blocking asylum seekers from stepping on U.S. soil.”

The court will hear arguments in the case next year and hand down a decision by the end of June.

A Councilwoman Intervened During an ICE Arrest. Then She Faced the Voters.

Months before the election, Etel Haxhiaj, a councilwoman in Worcester, Mass., was charged with assaulting an officer when she stood between the police and an immigrant family.

Nov. 17, 2025, 5:00 a.m. ET

Early on Election Day, Etel Haxhiaj pulled a campaign sign from the back seat of her car and found a spot on the sidewalk outside Blessed Sacrament Church, a polling place in Worcester, Mass. A cold wind tugged at the sign in her hands, threatening to blow it away.

Ms. Haxhiaj, 45, was a two-term city councilwoman in the city. By that night, she would know the fate of her campaign for re-election. Voters would judge her handling of everyday municipal business, but many would also consider a thornier question: Should Ms. Haxhiaj have intervened in an immigration enforcement action on a street in her district?

The encounter in May — a chaotic confrontation among residents, city police officers and federal immigration agents — had grabbed national attention after videos of it went viral. Ms. Haxhiaj had placed herself in the middle of it, standing between the police and an immigrant family. Six months later, she was fighting charges of assaulting an officer and interfering with the police. And she was facing a worrisome reality: Her actions in May could cost her the election, even in this diverse, immigrant-friendly, majority-Democratic city.

The controversy had brought new campaign donations and support. But it had also set off a fierce backlash. An angry man had accosted Ms. Haxhiaj outside a supermarket as she walked with her children. A bomb threat had been sent to her city email: “This is what you lunatic progressive get,” it said in capital letters. Days before the election, a local firefighters union had rescinded its endorsement of her after receiving complaints from its members.

Worcester is the second-largest city in Massachusetts, a liberal state where 61 percent of voters had supported Kamala Harris for president. But its politics are complicated.

Moderate Democrats have long held power, but since 2020, more socially progressive Democrats have run for office, Ms. Haxhiaj among them. An immigrant from Albania, she became the first Muslim on the council in 2022. Another progressive, an immigrant from Vietnam, became the first openly nonbinary member the same year.

As the newcomers pushed for racial justice, L.G.B.T.Q. protections and changes in policing, tensions ticked up. So did a perception among some voters that basic city business, like road repairs and snow removal, had taken a back seat.

In that unsettled atmosphere, Ms. Haxhiaj’s clash with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the police had the effect of a match on dry kindling.

Elsewhere in the lead-up to Election Day, progressive Democrats had big momentum. In New York, Zohran Mamdani led the race for mayor by a sweeping margin. In Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu would coast to victory unopposed. In Worcester, about 50 miles to the west, the picture was less clear. Would voters tolerate a council with diverse views and backgrounds, looser ties to business interests and vocal disagreements between members?

Outside the towering stone church where Ms. Haxhiaj stood waving at traffic on Election Day, a man in a passing truck appeared to glare at her. Seconds later, a car honked in support.

She had written two speeches: one for victory, another for defeat. There was little left to do but grip her sign and wait.

An Arrest on Eureka Street

Six days before the election, in a packed union hall, it was hard to tell which candidate was winning louder applause — Ms. Haxhiaj (pronounced HA-jee-eye) or her only opponent, José Rivera.

Moderators of the debate had waited only minutes before asking about the encounter with ICE in May on Eureka Street, in a residential neighborhood within the district. Ms. Haxhiaj remained unrepentant.

“We have all seen secret police snatching people off our streets,” she said. “My job as councilor is to protect my constituents, especially women and children.”

At least half the crowd roared in approval. But the cheering sounded just as loud when Mr. Rivera took the microphone and disagreed: A city councilor’s role, he said, was to defuse tensions, not elevate them.

“We are a country of law and order, and I think it’s important to show that we respect law enforcement,” said Mr. Rivera, 52, a court officer, former professional boxer and former Democrat who is no longer affiliated with a party.

It had never been in question that ICE would come to Worcester. President Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, had not attacked the working-class city of 200,000 like he had Boston. But Worcester had long been a destination for refugees and asylum seekers, with lower rents and a constellation of organizations to help them.

Liberal-leaning residents of Worcester had begun preparing for aggressive immigration enforcement even before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Some attended training on how to serve as so-called informed observers, documenting the actions of federal agents. They set up messaging groups to share updates on ICE’s movements in the city.

Ms. Haxhiaj, who works as a housing advocate, had not taken the training. But when friends texted her about a conflict that was unfolding after an ICE arrest on Eureka Street on the morning of May 8, she rushed to join them. Driving there, she felt nervous but determined.

“I kept thinking, something bad is happening to my constituents, and I need to be there to protect them,” she said.

Federal agents had detained a Brazilian woman who they said was in the country illegally. After Ms. Haxhiaj arrived, she stood by the woman and her daughters, one a teenager and the other holding a baby. Ms. Haxhiaj shielded them with her arms and demanded that the agents show a warrant. After the woman was placed in an ICE vehicle, her daughters clung to the car, trying to prevent it from leaving.

Ms. Haxhiaj declined to describe what happened on the street, citing her ongoing court case. But body camera footage from the incident shows pushing, pulling and moments of contact between civilians, ICE agents and police officers who had been summoned by ICE to clear the crowd. At one point, officers tried to lay hands on Ms. Haxhiaj’s arms, and she shook them off. At another, her hands flew out and appeared to make contact with an officer’s chest.

When federal agents finally drove away with the woman, her younger daughter ran after the car, crying and screaming. Police officers raced to stop her, and the teenager ended up on the ground. “She was just howling, ‘No, no, no,’” said Maydee Morales, a community activist who was there. “It’s a sound I will never forget.”

The ICE action did not result in a deportation. After four months in detention, the Brazilian woman was released and granted asylum. The police charges against her teenage daughter, for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, were dropped.

But soon after the incident, the local police union called for an investigation into Ms. Haxhiaj’s actions, citing her “reckless interference and agitation of that crowd.” In early June, the Worcester police announced they were charging her with assaulting an officer and interfering with the police, both misdemeanors. (The department did not respond to interview requests.)

“I did the humane thing,” Ms. Haxhiaj said when the charges were announced. “Nothing more, nothing less.”

She pleaded not guilty and asked a judge to dismiss the charges. The next hearing in her case is scheduled for Wednesday.

‘I Saw a Family in Distress’

On a bright Saturday morning in September, Ms. Haxhiaj parked on Eureka Street and studied a list of likely voters. She had been back there only once or twice since May. Several yards had signs for her opponent.

She had always considered neighborhood canvassing the most important kind of campaign work. “If you love this job, you love door knocking,” she said.

But now, approaching strangers’ doors felt dangerous. It was hard to forget the man who had called her ugly names outside a supermarket, or the man who had verbally assaulted her and another councilor as he followed them through a cemetery on Memorial Day, angry at her defense of what he called “illegals.”

Still, a sense of urgency drove her back to the streets of her district this fall. Two years ago, she had beaten Mr. Rivera by just 174 votes. This race could be even closer.

In some ways, the confrontation in May had brought her full circle. As a teenager, she had watched her home country, Albania, descend into violence. Her family fled to Greece as undocumented immigrants, hiding their nationality.

Her father had been arrested on a bus on his way to work one day and jailed for his immigration status. He was released just in time for the family’s green card interviews, after which they were granted the chance to start new lives in the United States.

Years later on Eureka Street, “I saw a family in distress,” Ms. Haxhiaj said. “My instinct was to use the power I’d been given to defend them from the things my family had experienced.”

She would do the same again, she said. But she had not realized how much it could cost her.

As she stood on Eureka Street again to knock on doors, a van rounded the corner. “Have fun in prison!” a man inside shouted at her through an open window.

A Hero to Some, Not All

Even before the events of May 8, Ms. Haxhiaj had been something of a lightning rod, beloved by some residents for her progressive approach to issues like housing, homelessness and zoning, but accused by others of using inflammatory rhetoric and spending too much time on polarizing national concerns.

She had alienated some Jewish voters in 2023 by opposing a council resolution that condemned Hamas, because it did not acknowledge Palestinian suffering. And she had angered the Worcester police force by pushing for reform after a damning Justice Department report last year on police misconduct.

After May 8, many liberal city residents criticized the police, infuriated by what they saw as collaboration with ICE on Eureka Street. Days after Ms. Haxhiaj was charged, a City Council meeting had to be adjourned when protesters packed the chamber, chanting “ICE out of Worcester now.”

Around the city, strangers thanked her. After she and her sons had finished lunch at a TGI Friday’s restaurant in July, the bill came with a handwritten note from their server. “We need more people like you,” it said. “Keep up the good fight.”

Criticism of Ms. Haxhiaj was quieter, but widespread. Steve Quist, who runs a Facebook page about city politics and lost to Ms. Haxhiaj in a past council race, said that her actions were “a step too far.” Even if she did not “slug” officers on Eureka Street, he said, “she kept pushing them away, and that’s assault.”

Mr. Quist predicted that Mr. Rivera would win the election, boosted by Ms. Haxhiaj’s “attack on public safety” and by voters seeking a return to “common sense” from “chaos.”

“We want leaders who talk about sidewalks, not national issues,” he said.

A Close Finish

At the polls on Election Day, a few voters shared their views: A pastor who said he voted against Ms. Haxhiaj because he opposes illegal immigration. Another man who said he did the same because he wanted councilors to prioritize problems they can fix.

There were also voters like Rob Tisdell, 37, who grew up on Eureka Street and cast his ballot for Ms. Haxhiaj because of what she did there.

“I was thrilled to see someone from government taking a stand,” he said.

After the polls closed, volunteers from Ms. Haxhiaj’s campaign headed to an African restaurant where a buffet of chicken, rice and plantains waited. Early vote tallies showed her barely leading. Then the count refreshed, and the crowd grew quiet: Mr. Rivera had surged ahead.

Huddled with family at her home nearby, Ms. Haxhiaj felt her heart sink as the gap widened. In the end, she would lose by 375 votes, 3,956 to 3,581.

“I let so many people down,” she thought on the short drive to the restaurant.

Speaking to her supporters just inside the door, her voice wobbled at times. She pledged to continue to “protect our neighbors” and “push for a better city.”

Through her tears, she had already begun to imagine how her loss would free her: to be better rested, more focused and fiercer, outside the confines of elected office. “An unleashed Etel is more powerful,” she said days later on a local podcast.

Reflecting on the outcome a week later, she saw low voter turnout as a factor, as well as a powerful police union that had mobilized against her and business interests that had backed her opponent. She also saw misogyny. But the shadow of Eureka Street, and the charges against her, had been critical obstacles, she thought.

Still, she could not accept the view that the ICE crackdown, and other federal actions in her district, were none of her concern, or the City Council’s.

“These are real people,” she said. “People who don’t want us to talk about it are either refusing to believe their neighbors are affected, or they are choosing to ignore them.”

Mr. Rivera, for his part, said he had already received a slew of emails from constituents seeking his help to get streets and sidewalks repaired.

“Independents, Democrats, Republicans all want the same things,” he said. “We all want a good city, so let’s unite and not be part of that divisiveness.”

Strategic Integrity — The Future of Immigration Compliance Immigration enforcement now evaluates behavior through the lens of governance.
Yet in many organizations, immigration compliance still sits apart from broader corporate governance and strategic planning.
In reality, immigration compliance belongs at the same table as financial controls, data security and ethics — a strategic discipline that protects the organization’s license to operate globally.","The modern employer faces a paradox that defines the future of immigration compliance. Laws written for a twentieth-century industrial economy now regulate twenty-first-century enterprises, while enforcement has evolved into a data-driven, intelligence-based system. This mismatch — outdated law enforced through modern analytics and investigative capability — defines what has become the compliance paradox.

Traditional compliance models, which emphasize documentation and formality, were designed for a different era. For example, an employer might once have assumed that maintaining a complete set of forms and records — I-9s, petitions and audit files — satisfied its compliance burden. Today’s enforcement agencies can cross-reference data across systems, comparing visa filings to tax records or travel history. A process that appears perfect on paper can collapse under scrutiny if those systems do not align — proof that perfect files no longer protect an organization whose operations diverge from its legal representations.

Enforcement itself has evolved from a reactive audit model to a proactive intelligence function — one that measures not paperwork, but control. True compliance is a function of governance: the behaviors, systems and culture that ensure a company acts lawfully even when the rules no longer align neatly with modern business models.

These developments have accelerated in 2025 under the Department of Justice’s recalibrated enforcement priorities. Recent DOJ memoranda have expanded the use of criminal charging, whistleblower incentives and civil fraud mechanisms to reach corporate immigration practices that once would have been handled administratively. The policies now mandate centralized reporting from U.S. Attorneys’ offices and emphasize corporate accountability — including through voluntary self-disclosure regimes and the False Claims Act — effectively merging immigration enforcement with the tools traditionally reserved for white-collar crime.

The central argument of this blog is that immigration compliance must evolve into a strategic governance discipline. Employers who integrate legal, operational and reputational awareness into their compliance architecture will not only withstand modern enforcement but also demonstrate integrity in how they operate globally.

The compliance paradox has multiple dimensions. Programs that once sufficed no longer do — not simply because enforcement agencies now possess the analytic tools to see beyond paperwork, but because they can verify whether the evidence of compliance actually reflects what happens in practice. At the same time, business models have evolved far beyond the regulatory frameworks built to govern them, creating gaps between operational reality and legal form. Many employers still rely on compliance structures that were performative from the start — systems designed to document, not to control — or treat immigration compliance as a peripheral HR function rather than a strategic enterprise risk. The modern challenge is to reconcile these forces: to align outdated rules with modern operations, to ensure that documented compliance reflects real conduct and to build governance systems capable of monitoring, auditing and managing the gaps in between.

The Illusion of Compliance — Why Perfect Paperwork Still Fails

The first step toward reforming compliance thinking is recognizing how easily organizations confuse documentation with adherence. For decades, immigration compliance was built on the belief that tidy records equaled legal security. Employers assembled I-9s, maintained public access files and archived petitions, confident that a well-organized paper trail could withstand any inspection.

That assumption no longer holds. Regulators now look past documentation to the underlying conduct: whether employees perform the duties described in filings, whether wages and locations align with certifications and whether internal systems detect discrepancies. Enforcement has become a test of operational truth, not administrative neatness.

One common example of this misplaced confidence is E-Verify. Many employers assume that enrolling in the system, or using it to confirm new-hire eligibility, insulates them from risk. In practice, E-Verify is a useful verification tool but not a legal defense. Participation does not cure underlying errors in the Form I-9 process, prevent findings of document abuse, or preclude liability for discrimination under 8 U.S.C. § 1324b. E-Verify also does not guard against identify fraud because it only verifies that an identity exists. It does not guarantee that the individual presenting the identity is that identity’s true owner. Overreliance on E-Verify as a safeguard demonstrates diligence in form, but not necessarily conformity in substance.

This shift exposes the illusion of compliance. Paperwork demonstrates awareness, not conformity. The presence of a file does not mean the organization is acting within the law; it only means someone once intended to. Substantive compliance today requires governance — coordinated processes, technology, and accountability that ensure the company’s real-world practices match its representations to the government.

Substantive Risk and Operational Governance — Where Compliance Really Lives

This shift exposes a larger truth: paperwork demonstrates awareness, not adherence. The presence of a file — or an electronic confirmation — does not mean the organization is acting within the law; it only means someone once intended to comply. Even as the economy transforms, six enduring legal principles remain constant.

In the modern enterprise, however, these legal constants have become operational stress points — the junctions where governance either functions or fails.

Notice to U.S. Workers: Posting and transparency requirements under H-1B and PERM remain a key measure of labor-market fairness. In a hybrid world, ensuring postings are accurate and accessible requires coordination across HR, Legal, and business teams — not just checking a box.

Wages: Variable pay, equity compensation, and agile job structures make wage compliance an exercise in real-time financial control. Governance systems must link payroll, HR and immigration data to ensure prevailing wage obligations remain intact.

Location: As remote work blurs traditional “place of employment,” monitoring where services are performed becomes a data-governance issue. Employers must maintain systems that detect location changes that could invalidate labor condition applications.

Duration: Visa validity and work authorization often sit across disconnected systems. Without integrated monitoring, extension and amendment obligations can be missed, transforming a clerical lapse into a substantive violation.

Work Performed: As job roles evolve, duties can drift beyond those certified in filings. Embedding immigration awareness into workforce planning prevents that drift from becoming noncompliance.

Anti-Discrimination: Employers must ensure that hiring, promotion, and employment-eligibility verification practices do not disadvantage protected individuals based on citizenship or immigration status. The same statutes that govern verification also prohibit discriminatory treatment under 8 U.S.C. § 1324b, making training and consistent procedures critical to managing this risk.

Together, these constants represent the operational edge of governance — the points where outdated law meets modern work. Managing them effectively requires cross-functional collaboration and disciplined oversight. Failures here rarely stem from ignorance; they reflect breakdowns in systems or culture.

These six areas are the practical test of an organization’s compliance maturity. They reveal whether the enterprise can govern itself coherently when business innovation moves faster than the law.

Intersecting Domains and Enforcement Evolution — When Compliance Becomes Systemic

Immigration compliance does not exist in isolation. It intersects with employment verification, export controls, tax, and equal employment law — each with distinct enforcement priorities. The result is regulatory asymmetry: an action that satisfies one agency’s expectations can simultaneously expose an employer to another’s jurisdiction.

This asymmetry is especially evident in the labor certification process. Employers pursuing permanent residence sponsorship for foreign nationals through the Department of Labor’s PERM program must comply with detailed recruitment and posting regulations designed to protect U.S. workers. Yet an administrative court at the Department of Justice (DOJ) has held that those same recruitment activities fall under the antidiscrimination provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, at 8 U.S.C. §1324b, enforced by DOJ’s Immigrant and Employee Rights (IER) Section.

Here the compliance paradox takes on a tangible form: behavior that satisfies one regulator’s technical requirements can simultaneously violate another’s substantive mandate. The Department of Labor (DOL) rules compel employers to advertise roles in prescribed ways that demonstrate intent to hire through the PERM process. The IER’s position, however, is that how an employer chooses among its DOL-permitted recruitment options can be recruitment that restricts or discourages U.S. applicants and thus potential citizenship-status discrimination.

The consequences have been substantial. In recent years, high-profile settlements—exceeding tens of millions of dollars—have shown that procedural compliance with DOL regulations does not insulate an employer from liability under DOJ enforcement. PERM recruitment practices consistent with labor regulations were found by the IER to disadvantage U.S. workers.

Since immigration programs intersect with civil rights, labor and national security frameworks, actions taken to satisfy one obligation may trigger exposure under another. This same dynamic extends across the broader compliance landscape. The I-9 process implicates both the Department of Homeland Security and DOJ oversight. Export-control regulations enforced by the Commerce and State Departments can overlap with visa compliance for foreign engineers. Even routine business travel can create exposure across immigration, tax and employment law.

Since agencies now coordinate and share data, compliance failures in one domain rarely remain contained there. The DOJ’s new enforcement framework magnifies this risk. Under its 2025 “Corporate Enforcement and Voluntary Self-Disclosure Policy,” immigration-related violations can now trigger the same prosecutorial responses as anti-corruption or sanctions cases — including corporate monitorships and public declinations. The expanded whistleblower award program also creates new exposure: line supervisors, recruiters, or vendors who detect I-9 or visa irregularities can now earn financial rewards for reporting them. Combined with Attorney General Bondi’s charging directive to pursue “the most serious, readily provable offense,” these changes signal that immigration compliance is being treated as a matter of corporate integrity, not administrative housekeeping.

Initiatives such as DOL’s Project Firewall and the hiring of USCIS 1811-series investigators have enabled cross-agency, analytics-driven enforcement. Agencies now detect anomalies before a notice or subpoena is ever issued — a shift toward enforcement by inference.

To meet this new reality, employers must mirror that integration internally. Legal, HR, Mobility, Export Control, Finance, and Internal Audit must operate within a shared governance framework, supported by Government Affairs and Corporate Communications, which provide context and manage reputational risk.

Strategic Risk Management — Navigating Regulatory Lag

Even with strong systems, compliance is complicated by a structural reality: the immigration framework was built for another era. It assumes static job descriptions, fixed worksites and linear employment models. The technology and service sectors that dominate today’s economy operate through distributed teams, agile projects and constant change— realities the law scarcely contemplates. A software engineer may contribute to a single project from three countries and two U.S. jurisdictions in the same year, while legacy visa frameworks still presume one worksite and one job description. That mismatch creates compliance gaps that no checklist can close.

This regulatory lag has real consequences. When rules do not align with business models, some organizations treat compliance as a secondary concern, rationalizing deviations as necessary for competitiveness. But the rules remain enforceable even when they no longer make sense. Enforcement agencies have shown little tolerance for businessmodel justifications. That imbalance is real. Employers operate within a patchwork of outdated statutes and agency interpretations that change faster than formal rulemaking. But while the law’s inconsistencies are beyond their control, how organizations manage within that uncertainty is not.

Navigating this gap requires disciplined adaptability. Employers must identify where business imperatives collide with legal requirements, quantify the associated risks, and make deliberate, documented choices about how to proceed. This process must include Legal, HR, Government Affairs, and Corporate Communications to balance operational, legal, and reputational concerns.

Governance maturity lies in transparency and intent—in acknowledging when compliance requirements are misaligned with reality and managing that misalignment deliberately. Following the law blindly when it no longer fits the business model is not realistic; ignoring it outright is rash. The responsible path is structured decision-making — informed, documented and defensible.

The measure of compliance leadership, then, is not avoiding every gray area, but managing it with integrity.

Strategic Integrity — The Future of Immigration Compliance

Immigration enforcement now evaluates behavior through the lens of governance. The distinction between technical error and willful violation often depends on whether a company can demonstrate that its systems are designed to prevent and correct mistakes. Agencies routinely mitigate penalties where employers can show credible controls, self-auditing and remediation. Without such infrastructure, even minor discrepancies appear negligent.

Compliance has therefore become evidentiary. Employers must be able to prove the existence of a functioning compliance architecture — not just produce forms. But compliance governance does not require building new bureaucracies; it means designing proportional systems of accountability that fit the organization’s size and complexity. Even small employers can strengthen compliance simply by connecting immigration oversight to their existing governance or audit frameworks. For senior leadership, that means immigration compliance must be integrated into enterprise risk discussions, like cybersecurity, ESG or data privacy.

The compliance paradox will persist until the law itself evolves, but employers cannot wait for legislative reform. The task today is to modernize compliance to match enforcement — to govern strategically, make transparent decisions, and maintain documentation that demonstrates judgment as well as procedure.

Yet in many organizations, immigration compliance still sits apart from broader corporate governance and strategic planning. Senior leaders often view it as an operational or HR concern rather than a core enterprise risk. When executives overlook immigration risk in strategic planning, they not only expose the organization to enforcement, but also undermine its credibility with regulators, investors and employees who increasingly equate compliance discipline with corporate integrity. In reality, immigration compliance belongs at the same table as financial controls, data security and ethics — a strategic discipline that protects the organization’s license to operate globally.

That need has only intensified under DOJ’s current enforcement agenda. The integration of immigration violations into corporate fraud and civil rights frameworks means the government now assesses companies not just on whether they follow immigration rules, but on whether they govern those obligations with the same rigor applied to financial reporting or cybersecurity. For boards and executives, immigration compliance has effectively become a governance referendum.

Ultimately, immigration compliance is no longer about paperwork; it is about proof of governance. The companies that thrive are those that understand this reality and treat compliance not as an obligation, but as evidence of how responsibly they choose to operate.

If the United States kills someone, and if the intelligence provided facilitates that killing, the State sharing the intelligence is itself violating international law.","Several States have curtailed intelligence-sharing with the United States due to the continuing drug boat strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific that have killed 83 people to date. Notably, the United Kingdom, which maintains a significant presence in the Caribbean, has for years provided intelligence to support U.S. Coast Guard drug interdiction, in addition to conducting its own counter-narcotics operations. Concerned that the United States might use that support to unlawfully target drug boats, over a month ago, the UK suspended sharing intelligence. Asked about the CNN report that broke the story, Secretary of State Rubio labeled it “false,” without stating why.

Reports have also emerged that the Netherlands has curtailed intelligence cooperation due to fear that the United States might use it to support human rights violations or, a rather shocking concern, assist Russia.

Canada, which is conducting Operation Caribbe in coordination with the Coast Guard and 13 other nations, has likewise informed the United States that the information it provides is not to be used to facilitate the boat strikes. As a spokesperson for the Department of National Defence emphasized, “Canadian Armed Forces activities under Operation Caribbe, conducted in coordination with the United States Coast Guard, are separate and distinct from the activities you describe involving other branches of the United States military.”

And Colombia, which has long collaborated hand-in-glove with the United States on counter-drug operations, has similarly suspended intelligence sharing with U.S. intelligence agencies until the strikes end. Colombian President Gustavo Petro justified the decision by noting, “The fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people.” Mexico has also opposed the boat strikes, called on the United States to respect international treaties, and most recently announced an arrangement with the United States whereby the Mexican Navy will intercept boats near the countries’ coasts in order to prevent further lethal attacks in that area.

In recent days, E.U. leaders and member States, such as France, have told journalists that they consider the boat strikes flatly illegal. (France too has a significant presence in the region, including past work with U.S. counter-narcotics operations.) In response to such European legal concerns, Rubio quipped, because many of the shipments are bound for Europe, “Maybe they should be thanking us.”

Suspension of intelligence sharing is not new. For example, Germany and other European States froze intelligence following revelations of torture and rendition in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. And the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces motivated France to curtail intelligence cooperation on the basis that the invasion was unlawful.

The U.S. attacks on suspected drug traffickers are both short-sighted from a strategic policy perspective and morally questionable. Such concerns may have motivated the intelligence sharing restrictions that U.S. allies and partners have imposed. However, as we will explain in this essay, even setting aside those concerns, the decision to withhold intelligence and other cooperation that might contribute to the U.S. operations was a sensible decision from the perspective of international legal risk.

To understand why, it is necessary to assess both the legality of the strikes under international law and the relationship between them and the cooperation being withheld. If the operations are lawful (they are not), other States may lawfully contribute to them, barring any other applicable rule specifically prohibiting such contributions. However, if the U.S. operations are unlawful, this raises the urgent question whether support for them would itself violate international law. In other words, would a State sharing intelligence with the United States be complicit in the “internationally wrongful acts” of the United States? Accordingly, we first conduct a brief survey of the legality of U.S. strikes and then proceed to examine the possible complicity of third States.

The Legality of the Operations

Despite protestations from the Trump administration, and the very suspect claims by a Pentagon spokesperson that “lawyers up and down the chain of command have been thoroughly involved in reviewing these operations prior to execution” and “no lawyer involved has questioned the legality” of them, international law experts who have opined on the matter are nearly unanimous in their conclusions that the strikes clearly violate international law (see, inter alia, Just Security’s collection of commentary and this episode of EJIL: The Podcast!). However, there is some confusion among the broader public regarding why this is the case.

Inapplicable Law: UN Charter, Non-Intervention, and Laws of War

The U.S. operations do not violate the prohibition on the use of force found in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, for that rule only bars the use of force directed at other States. Thus, attacking a flagless (Stateless) ship on the high seas does not amount to a wrongful use of force under international law’s jus ad bellum. For the same reason, the strikes do not constitute unlawful intervention into the internal affairs of other States.

Nor do the operations violate the law of armed conflict (LOAC), as that law is inapplicable in this situation for reasons explained below. Nevertheless, the administration, in a notification to Congress and a statement to the United Nations Security Council, contends that the attacks are lawful on the basis that the United States is involved in a non-international armed conflict (NIAC) with drug cartels and that those killed were “unlawful combatants.” It is correct that civilians who directly participate in hostilities (so-called unlawful combatants) may be attacked for such time as they so participate. Moreover, in our view, members of the armed wing of an “organized armed group” (OAG) may be attacked at any time during a NIAC, so long as other targeting rules, such as the rule of proportionality and the requirement to take precautions to protect civilians in attack, are satisfied.

However, whether those aboard the boats fall into either of the targetable categories need not detain us here; LOAC rules are simply not relevant in this situation, since it does not qualify as a NIAC. A NIAC, as distinct from an armed conflict between States, requires protracted and intense armed violence between a State and non-State organized armed group, an explanation derived from the judgements of international tribunals and long-accepted by the United States (Tadić, para. 70; ICTR, Akayesu, para. 619; ICC, Bemba, para. 229; DoD Law of War Manual, § 17.1.1).

To begin with, drug trafficking as such has never been treated as “armed violence,” nor could it. Drug cartels sometimes use violence against a government, but it is that violence that can qualify the situation as a NIAC, not their drug activities. Moreover, the violence must be at a high level to distinguish a NIAC from “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence, and other acts of a similar nature” (DoD Law of War Manual, § 17.1.1). Examples include various situations in Mexico and Colombia, where cartels or armed groups such as Sinaloa and the FARC directed intense violence against the government in addition to producing and trafficking drugs.

Although there was no qualifying violence until the first strike, the more attacks the United States conducts, the more likely it is that this threshold will arguably be reached – despite the fact that the violence is one-sided (although some scholars believe there needs to be exchanges of fire from both sides). But even if the threshold is reached, the violence must be directed at an organized armed group. This requirement is not met simply because a group possesses weapons or sometimes uses violence to further its criminal ends, as many cartels do. To qualify, the group “must possess organized armed forces” (2016 Commentary to GC I, art. 3), which the targeted groups such as Tren de Aragua do not appear to field.

In short, neither the intensity nor the organization requirement for a NIAC has been satisfied in this situation. Thus, there is no armed conflict and, derivatively, no applicable LOAC rule to violate. It is essential to note that this is an objective assessment of the facts. These facts cannot be ignored simply because the U.S. President proclaims otherwise – which, from the recent reporting on Department of Justice memoranda justifying these operations, appears to be the sole basis on which the otherwise inexplicable U.S. legal claims are based.

Applicable Law: International human rights law (extrajudicial killings)

This being the case, the applicable body of law directly governing these uses of lethal force is international human rights law (IHRL). It is here that the international law violation is found. Importantly, even if, contrary to our view, the jus ad bellum prohibition on the use of force in Article 2(4) of the Charter did apply, but the United States was exercising the right to self-defense, U.S. defensive actions would still need to comply with IHRL since, as explained, the situation does not amount to an armed conflict triggering LOAC.

It has long been recognized that the arbitrary deprivation of life violates a State’s international human rights obligations (see, e.g., UDHR, art. 3). The right is found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 6(1), an instrument to which the United States is a party. There has long been a debate over whether the ICCPR generally, or Article 6(1) specifically, applies extraterritorially, an issue present in the boat strikes. The United States claims that it does not, although the prevailing view, illustrated by the UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comment 36, is that it does (¶ 63). As noted in that Comment, the right extends to persons “located outside any territory effectively controlled by the State whose right to life is nonetheless affected by its military or other activities in a direct and reasonably foreseeable manner.”

But in any event, the right to life is a customary right that applies extraterritorially, regardless of the U.S. interpretation of the ICCPR – a point that the United States has previously accepted, as explained by Ryan. This is also acknowledged in the 2024 U.S. Army’s Operational Law Handbook, which characterizes the prohibition of murder as a fundamental right, and explains that “[i]n contrast to fundamental human rights, […] non-fundamental human rights do not necessarily bind States during all operations inside and outside a State’s territory.” The implication is that a fundamental right, such as the prohibition on the arbitrary deprivation of life, does apply during all operations and extraterritorially (pages 98-99).

Moreover, there is extensive State verbal practice and opinio juris characterizing extrajudicial killings, including those committed abroad, as violations of the right. And in its recent UNRWA advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that State obligations under IHRL (including customary IHRL, which the Court discusses twice in the opinion) apply when a State exercises jurisdiction extraterritorially, particularly in, but not limited to, situations of occupation (¶ 151; see more here). To put this simply, there is no doubt in our mind that, were the ICJ to be confronted with a situation similar to the U.S. strikes against suspected drug boats, the Court would rule that the right to life, i.e., the prohibition on the arbitrary taking of life, applies even if the State concerned kills people outside its own territory.

Therefore, the question is whether these killings were “arbitrary.” The widely-accepted standard for arbitrariness prohibits the use of force likely to cause death or grievous bodily injury “except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives” (Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; see also U.N. Human Rights Committee, General Comment 36, para 12).

As reflected in the standard, a deprivation of life must be strictly necessary to be justified, as a measure of last resort – if a State can mitigate the imminent threat that an individual poses to others by non-lethal means, then those means must be exhausted first. It is manifest that the U.S. strikes do not satisfy this requirement. While countering drugs is a legitimate aim for State action, the fact that there are numerous operational means that the United States regularly uses to stop maritime drug-trafficking renders simply blowing the boats up unnecessary as a matter of law.

In short, there is absolutely no question that the U.S. lethal strikes on the boats are a violation of international human rights law. The violation of the right to life is as equally manifest as it would be if the United States started using drone strikes against suspected drug traffickers on its own territory. Such individuals, serious criminals though they may be, need to be arrested and put on trial, not summarily killed. We thus agree with the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, who labelled the strikes as “extrajudicial killings” – this is precisely what they are.

This legal point is very straightforward. Indeed, as a Senator, Marco Rubio sponsored legislation calling out the Philippines’ then-President, Rodrigo Duterte, for summarily killing people involved in the drug trade. The legislation stated: “Extrajudicial killings perpetrated by the Government of the Philippines as part of a government-directed antidrug campaign present the foremost human rights challenge.” Notably, the International Criminal Court approved an arrest warrant for Duterte for the crime against humanity, because a policy of such killings can eventually amount to a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population.

Support to the Unlawful Strikes by Other Countries

This then brings us to the question of the possible complicity of third States in facilitating the U.S. strikes in the Caribbean. As with complicity doctrines in domestic law, there are various ways in which States accrue legal responsibility by contributing to the “internationally wrongful acts” of other States (for a primer, see this Chatham House paper by Harriet Moynihan). Two are relevant here.

First, a State may be complicit on the basis of the general rule set out by the International Law Commission in Article 16 of its Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that a State that assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful act will be responsible for its contribution if it is bound by the same legal obligation as the assisted State, and if it provides the assistance knowing of the attendant circumstances. The ICJ has held that this rule reflects customary international law. Second, a State may be complicit based on rules that are specific to the various sub-branches of international law, like IHRL, which may set somewhat different standards than the general secondary rule.

There is no doubt that intelligence sharing can constitute such a form of wrongful facilitation, for it can causally contribute to a sufficient degree to the commission of the wrongful act (for an extended discussion, see this paper and this blog post series by Marko). Consider, for instance, the sharing of geolocational data about a boat in the Caribbean with the United States, or other information about the people on board and their activities. It is self-evident that the United States could use this information to conduct a lethal strike against the boat in question. Accordingly, the criterion of a causal contribution, which is essential to all complicity rules, could be met in such a scenario, depending on the nature and content of the intelligence shared.

The requirement that the same legal obligation bind the assisting State as the assisted State is likewise satisfied. All States partnering with the United States in intelligence sharing are bound by customary IHRL prohibiting arbitrary deprivations of life. Most are also parties to treaties that prohibit arbitrary deprivation of life. For instance, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are party to the European Convention on Human Rights, and Colombia and Mexico are bound by the American Convention on Human Rights (arts. 2 and 4, respectively). The five, as well as Canada, are parties to the ICCPR. They are all bound by the customary international law prohibition on arbitrary deprivation of life.

But whether States sharing intelligence would be complicit in the unlawful U.S. attacks depends primarily on the fault (subjective, mental, culpability) element of the given complicity rule. There has been much discussion of this issue in the literature, which we will not examine here (see Marko’s article). We would only make two points.

To begin with, under Article 16, the fault element would be met if the assisting State shared intelligence with the United States, knowing that the latter intended to conduct unlawful strikes and that the intelligence would facilitate them, and nonetheless decided to proceed (a form of oblique or indirect intent). After the United States has conducted 20 such strikes and has openly announced it would conduct more, no State sharing intelligence with the United States could plausibly argue that it lacked the requisite degree of knowledge. This is especially the case for intelligence that directly relates to the activities of boats or drug cartels in the Caribbean.

Under complicity rules specific to IHRL, the requisite fault standard might be lower still – mere appreciations of a level of risk (rather than certainty) that the United States would engage in arbitrary killings using the intelligence provided. This would be a fault standard akin to recklessness, that is, one of conscious risk-taking. As explained in Marko’s piece, and although this possibility is unsettled in IHRL, a lower standard would arguably be justified by the importance of the interest being protected – the right to life.

In short, in our view, any State sharing intelligence with the United States about boats or drug trafficking in the Caribbean exposes itself to a high degree of legal risk. If the United States kills someone, and if the intelligence provided facilitates that killing, the State sharing the intelligence is itself violating international law. This is true even if the relatively high fault standard in Article 16 ASR is applied, let alone under IHRL. After 20 such strikes, no State could plead ignorance here.

As an aside, for present purposes, we do not assess whether the U.S. boat strikes could constitute international crimes, nor do we examine the potential liability of other State officials under a theory of aiding and abetting.

Conclusion

Obviously, we have no way of knowing whether the decisions to suspend intelligence sharing were made after government ministers sought and obtained formal legal advice to that effect. The step could also have been taken prudentially, as a matter of policy. And, of course, it is politically problematic for partners and allies to publicly castigate the United States for engaging in unlawful attacks.

However, whatever the motivation for maintaining or suspending intelligence sharing, the law is clear. The only way in which States can avoid their own responsibility for facilitating attacks that qualify as “arbitrary killings” under international human rights law is to refrain from sharing intelligence that, in part, enables them. Even mitigation measures, such as diplomatic assurances, are unlikely to adequately lower the legal risk, for the nature of the information shared is such that States sharing it cannot plausibly claim ignorance or clean hands. Simply put, any provision of intelligence known to support such attacks is unlawful. Needless to say, this is a point that States should also bear in mind with respect to any prospective U.S .operations directly against Venezuela or other States in the region.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2245807371-e1763386771786.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:57:20.057213

Border Patrol official behind Chicago immigration crackdown defends tactics as President Trump cheers

SOPHIA TAREEN

Associated Press

Published: November 17, 2025

ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) — The Border Patrol commander leading an immigration crackdown in Chicago applauded his agents' aggressive tactics that have prompted resident backlash and lawsuits.

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation's third-largest city.

""I didn't have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it's far worse than I ever thought,"" Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since "" Operation Midway Blitz "" began in September as part of the Trump administration's push to target cities with "" sanctuary"" immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who've spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an ""invasion"" of ""criminal illegal aliens,"" how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

""We're what I call now sanctuary busters,"" he said. ""There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.""

Doubling down on chemical agents

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He's regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is ""far less lethal"" than what agents face.

""We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,"" he said. ""If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.""

Immigration agents' tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Praising a raid that amplified tensions

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. Recently a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration's use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because ""you have to get the people out.""

""I think (the raids) haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,"" Trump said in a recent CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that's had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

""A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?"" he said. ""I'm proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.""

Bovino said he hasn't seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents' accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Blaming elected leaders and activists

Bovino's presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker ""wildly misinformed"" while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor's appearance.

In response, Pritzker's office said that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino's ""publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.""

Bovino wouldn't say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

""We're going to be in Chicago a good while,"" he said. ""But you just never know.""

What will Shabana Mahmood announce for the asylum system?
In her speech in the Commons at around 3.30pm, Ms Mahmood is to unveil radical measures modelled on Denmark’s system that will tackle illegal migration.
Ms Mahmood will say, under her reforms, that refugees will be removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe.
Following days of media reports, there is wide-spread consternation among charities that support asylum seekers coming to the UK.","It’s a tough message Shabana Mahmood will hope will reach the disgruntled voter, the criminal gangs smuggling people on small boats, and even the would-be migrants on the northern shoreline of Pas-de-Calais 100 miles from Westminster.

On Monday afternoon, the home secretary will reveal sweeping reforms to the asylum system in an unprecedented bid to make it easier to remove migrants fleeing conflict and hardship and make the UK a less attractive destination.

Over a troubled first 16 months in power for Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour government, illegal immigration has been a hot button topic, with claims ministers have failed to control the country’s borders.

In the year to June, the UK received the highest number of asylum applications since 2011, while the number of people arriving via small boat crossings hit almost 20,000 in the same period.

Now, after attempts by Sir Keir to stem the flow - the targeting of people-smuggling gangs and then the “one in, one out” deal with France - Ms Mahmood, appointed home secretary in September, will introduce her own sweeping reforms.

The plans are said to be inspired by Denmark’s approach to asylum seekers, where the government transformed its own approach following an influx of people throughout the 2010s. Now, the Scandinavian country has one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.

But Labour’s policy changes come amid an outcry from some backbenchers, and human rights groups, who fear they will be a catalyst to further division in UK communities, while bringing disruption and harm to those seeking sanctuary.

What will Shabana Mahmood announce for the asylum system?

In her speech in the Commons at around 3.30pm, Ms Mahmood is to unveil radical measures modelled on Denmark’s system that will tackle illegal migration.

Arguably, the biggest change will be making the refugee status temporary, and subject to regular review.

Under current UK law, people granted status have the status for five years and can then apply for indefinite leave to remain and get on a route to citizenship.

Ms Mahmood will say, under her reforms, that refugees will be removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe. Meanwhile, the wait for permanent settlement will be quadrupled to 20 years.

This is similar to Denmark, where asylum seekers get a temporary residency permit for one or two years, which is subject to regular review, and can be revoked once their home country is deemed safe.

The home secretary will also say ministers will want to bring forward a Bill to change how Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) – the right to a family life – is interpreted by judges in migrant court cases.

She is expected to say that this could stop migrants “gaming the system”.

Also, the government’s legal duty to provide asylum-seeker support will be revoked, meaning housing and weekly allowances will no longer be guaranteed. And those who have the right to work and can support themselves, could also be denied benefits.

Failed asylum seekers will be limited to make one appeal against their removal, instead of having the ability to make multiple challenges on different grounds.

It also looks like Ms Mahmood will introduce a “jewellery law” that will allow officials to confiscate refugees’ valuables, to help pay for cost of their accommodation and living.

Meanwhile, new and legal routes to the UK will be introduced as a way to cut dangerous journeys in small boats across the English Channel.

Summed up by borders minister Alex Norris on Monday morning’s Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “If your intention is to come to the country illegally to have a claim assessed, and if you are successful then sit at home, not contribute, not learn English, integrate into the community, not to build a life away from the dreadful circumstances that you may have come from, then that is going to come with much greater checks.”

Which three countries face the threat of UK visa restrictions?

In a show of determination to make her plan work, Ms Mahmood will also ban three African countries from accessing UK visas if they fail to take back illegal migrants.

Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, will face visa sanctions, blocking their tourists, VIPs and business people from travelling to Britain if they do not co-operate more on the removal of illegal migrants.

The move was reportedly inspired by Trump administration homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, according to the Times.

Ms Mahmood said: “My message to foreign governments today is clear: accept the return of your citizens or lose the privilege of entering our country.”

The Independent has contacted the London-based embassies for each of the three countries.

Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics shows that the nationalities do not appear in the top 20 for small boat arrivals in the year up to June this year.

What have Labour MPs said about the proposals?

While many backbench MPs have so far remained silent, perhaps understandably, ahead of Ms Mahmood’s announcement, a couple have voiced their concerns this morning, among them Kent MP and former immigration lawyer Tony Vaughan.

Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Vaughan said that he accepted public trust in the asylum system was ebbing away, but said the measures were “taking the wrong turn”, with a particular concern being the idea to “kick refugees out despite having granting them protection”.

He said: “If the system has decided that someone should be granted asylum we should be welcoming, integrating and not creating this situation of perpetual limbo and alienation which doesn’t help the refugees, it doesn’t help society.”

Labour MP John McDonnell wrote on X: “Tony Vaughan is one of the new MPs elected for Labour last year & in his contributions to Commons debates has displayed a considered approach to issues.

“He’s certainly not what the media would call a usual suspect. I suspect he is reflecting here what many in the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] feel.

Mr Norris has urged his colleagues to wait before passing judgment, saying he disagreed with Mr Vaughan’s “characterisation” of the policy.

What have migrant charities said about the proposals?

Following days of media reports, there is wide-spread consternation among charities that support asylum seekers coming to the UK.

Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights director, said: ""Constantly demonising and scapegoating refugees in a hopeless and cruel attempt to deter people seeking asylum in the UK is causing social division while wrecking the asylum system – all to no good whatsoever.

“Sadly, this home secretary seems as determined to continue in precisely the same vein as the previous government – possibly now subjecting people granted asylum to decades of insecurity that will undermine their prospects of recovery and integration.”

Fizza Qureshi, chief executive of Migrants' Rights Network, said: “The Home Secretary is taking unprecedented and appalling steps to blame people for daring to come to the UK to seek sanctuary. Instead of upholding their rights to claim refugee protection she is making them out to be a ‘problem’ that needs to be solved through harsher anti-refugee measures.”

Lara Parizotto, chief executive of Migrant Democracy Project, said: “Ms Mahmood's is cementing a dangerous narrative of ""good"" vs ""bad"" refugees, is bending over backwards to change immigration rules to actually make claiming asylum illegal, which is not at the moment, and is washing her hands of responsibility by stating that it's local residents' responsibility to host refugees.”","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/17/11/58/SEI273322345.jpeg?trim=0,25,0,25&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-17 09:57:03.393244

“These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said in a statement.

In what the government says is the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

The government also threatened visa bans on Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo unless those countries accepted the return of illegal migrants and criminals.

TOUGHER STANCE ON ASYLUM

Immigration has become the most important issue for voters in recent months, with those arriving in small boats from France the most visible sign of illegal arrivals. The issue has helped propel Reform UK, led by veteran anti-EU campaigner Nigel Farage, into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Zia Yusuf, a senior member of Reform, said the public were sick of being told there was no way to prevent people from arriving illegally on beaches, but said existing laws and likely opposition from Starmer’s lawmakers meant Mahmood’s proposed changes were unlikely to ever happen.

Tony Vaughan, a Labour lawmaker and senior lawyer, was one of the first to publicly criticize the proposals, adding the rhetoric would encourage “the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

In the year to the end of March, 109,343 people claimed asylum in Britain, up 17 percent on the previous 12 months. Still, fewer people claim asylum in Britain than in its EU peers France, Germany, Italy or Spain.

Most migrants arrive legally. Net migration reached a record high of 906,000 in the year to June 2023, before it fell to 431,000 in 2024, reflecting tighter rules.

’DARK FORCES’ AT PLAY

Mahmood said Britain had always been a tolerant and welcoming country to refugees but she warned that “dark forces” were stirring up anger, after protests took place this summer outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.

The interior minister said that risked threatening social cohesion and turning anger against those whose families had lived in Britain for decades, saying “a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me.”

Mahmood’s parents moved to Britain from Pakistan in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Under her proposals, the government wants to change the interpretation of Article 8 of the ECHR, governing the right to a family life. It would make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from “using dubious connections to stay in the UK.”

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the “definition of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ has expanded beyond what is reasonable,” making it too easy to challenge deportations.

It did not go as far as to say it wanted to leave the ECHR, as Reform and some in the Conservative Party have advocated.

However, the government’s harder stance on immigration has been criticized by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the rules would “punish people who’ve already lost everything,” adding this is “not who we are as a country.”",,N,,2025-11-17 13:58:03.312639

The New Orleans mayor’s office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.","With dozens of people arrested in North Carolina’s largest city during the Department of Homeland Security’s latest targeted immigration blitz, one question has emerged for many of its residents and leaders: Why Charlotte?

The city hadn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago and Los Angeles. It’s a Democrat-led city, but it’s hundreds of miles away from either the northern or southern border. And crime has dropped 8% from last year, with violent crimes down 20%, according to data released by the city in October.

Before it even started, the announcement that an immigration enforcement operation would arrive in Charlotte – right off the heels of a weekslong operation that led to hundreds of arrests and fierce protests in Chicago – provoked fear and anxiety in the city.

Democratic leaders in Charlotte have largely framed the operation – which came as a surprise to local officials – as a political distraction ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

“This administration ran on rhetoric that is anti-immigrant to score political points,” said City Council member Dimple Ajmera, a Democrat. “We have a very important US Senate race in 2026 coming up. And they want to score political points and use fear to divide our community.”

Democrats are hoping to flip one of North Carolina’s Senate seats after Republican incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis pulled out of the race following criticism from the president who threatened to back a primary challenger to Tillis’ seat. Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is widely popular across the state, launched his campaign in July.

Similarly, state Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat, characterized the operation as a Republican political stunt. “The truth is, this move from the federal government, and the silence from GOP state leaders enabling it, are part of the same political distraction,” he said in a statement to CNN. “They’re trying to shift attention away from their own failures, because they have no plan to lower costs, make housing affordable, or expand real opportunity for working people.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement the surge would “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

The agency claimed “nearly 1,400 detainers across North Carolina have not been honored – releasing criminal illegal aliens into North Carolina’s neighborhoods.” Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” but it is a “Certified Welcoming City,” a designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.

Immigration into the city has increased in recent years. Around 18.2% of the city’s population was foreign-born in 2023, according to US Census data, around double that of North Carolina at large. And there have been disagreements in the city in the past about immigration enforcement. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden ended the county’s decadelong 287(g) partnership with ICE in 2018, to the chagrin of Republican officials.

The city became a lightning rod for debates about policing and public safety in Democrat-led cities in September, after a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee was stabbed to death on Charlotte public transit by a man with a lengthy history of arrests and mental health problems.

Though the suspect arrested in that case is a US citizen, President Donald Trump seized on the killing as an example of what he framed as out-of-control crime, and he pledged to send the National Guard to blue cities across the country. Three Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation, who represent districts around Charlotte, asked the governor earlier this month to deploy the Guard to fight crime.

Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who is from North Carolina, has his own answer. In an Instagram post with a photo of a man he claimed was an “illegal alien with a violent criminal history,” he wrote, “This is why border security matters. This is why we’re in Charlotte.”

Weekend of turmoil

Border Patrol agents arrested 81 people in Charlotte on Saturday, Bovino said Sunday, in an operation DHS dubbed “Charlotte’s Web.” He didn’t specify the reasons for the arrests or the names of those arrested but said many had “significant criminal and immigration history.”

Bovino – who was criticized by a federal judge over his and his agents’ use of force in Chicago – was spotted on video during the detainment of a person outside a grocery store in Pineville, around 10 miles south of Charlotte.

A man with a REAL ID who says he became a US citizen in 2019 was caught in the fray. Federal agents smashed the car window of Willy Wender Aceituno Medina, a Honduran immigrant who lives in Charlotte, and then detained him before letting him go a little while later. Medina said he pleaded with federal agents to look at his ID after the arrest.

In a statement to CNN, a Customs and Border Patrol agent said that officers had “approached an individual who acted increasingly erratic. The individual escalated the situation and refused to comply to lawful commands by officers.”

Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson, in a Saturday interview with CNN, said there’s “fear and anxiety rampant” across the city.

The Carolina Migrant Network, a legal advocacy nonprofit, said it had seen federal agents in “camouflage and tactical gear operating out of unmarked vehicles” – a sight that has become characteristic of DHS’ operations across the country.

“We have also witnessed an escalation in hostile actions, including the arrest of U.S. citizens, physical assaults on community members, and the disruption of places of worship, businesses, and restaurants where people have been questioned about their immigration status,” said the group in a statement.

DHS did not respond to questions about the nonprofit’s claims but sent CNN a statement including the photos and names of people it said were immigrants with criminal histories released in North Carolina.

Protesters decrying the operation filled a Charlotte park Saturday, then marched through the streets of uptown.

Businesses close as Border Patrol agents arrive

Several businesses closed temporarily in the wake of the announced operation, among them a popular Colombian bakery that had closed its doors only once in the past 28 years.

Manuel “Manolo” Betancur closed his family bakery Saturday after men in green uniforms chased and tackled people outside the shop, he told CNN. He said he isn’t sure when he will reopen.

The officers emerged from unmarked SUVs Saturday morning, “jumping and taking people down in the street, just people that look like me,” Betancur said. He is a naturalized US citizen and said he’s started carrying his passport with him everywhere he goes, “because I don’t want to go through the trouble. I promised my wife and my kids I’m going to be back home tonight.”

Betancur said he doesn’t want his customers to risk a similar encounter with federal agents – not when they’re just trying to buy cakes or pastries.

A company that manages several bars and restaurants in Charlotte said it closed its properties Saturday night after DHS’s announcement. Dubai Nightlife Charlotte cited the “safety, peace of mind and protection of those who visit us” in making the “preventative” decision, according to a Facebook post in Spanish.

The Colombian American Chamber of Commerce of the Carolinas also announced it was postponing an event scheduled for Saturday “due to recent action to bolster immigration operations in several cities across the country.”

Deployment surprised local officials

The announcement that Charlotte would be the next city targeted by federal immigration officials was unexpected – including for local government.

None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of the plan.

City Council member Malcolm Graham, who said he was unaware of the planned operation before CNN called him, said, “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”

It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans. McFadden said Thursday afternoon two federal officials contacted him about the arrival of Border Patrol agents but said details on the federal operation had not been shared with the sheriff’s office and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.

Even the operation’s name has attracted controversy: Martha White, the granddaughter of “Charlotte’s Web” author E.B. White and his literary executor, decried it as an attempt to ride the beloved children book’s “coattails without permission” in a statement to CNN. Her grandfather, she said, “certainly didn’t believe in masked men, in unmarked cars, raiding people’s homes and workplaces without IDs or summons.”

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein noted in a statement on social media that Border Patrol has detained many people without criminal histories in Chicago. He urged residents to use their phones to record “if you see something bad happening.”

“Local law enforcement will be here protecting the people of this state long after these federal agents go on to the next place,” he said.

Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, suggested Charlotte’s growing immigrant population as a possible reason the city is being targeted. The city is home to Charlotte Immigration Court and a large ICE field office, she said. The move could also be seen as “retaliation” for the sheriff’s decision to end collaboration with ICE, she said.

“I think there’s a level of, ‘let’s add another city to a roster, create some havoc, and move on’ as well,” she said.

Republicans welcome surge

Some of the state and city’s Republicans, meanwhile, have welcomed the surge.

“We’re grateful to see these brave men and women in federal law enforcement following through on President Trump’s promise to remove violent criminal illegals from our country and those stoking fear about these targeted operations must stop at once,” NCGOP Communications Director Matt Mercer said in a statement.

Kyle Kirby, the chair of Mecklenburg County’s GOP, told CNN he believed Charlotte was targeted because of its large immigration court and the sheriff’s refusal to work with ICE. “When local leaders release individuals flagged for federal pickup back into the community, it simply forces federal agencies to step in,” he said.

At least one Republican had more mixed feelings. Ed Driggs, who, after Democrats flipped a seat in this month’s election, will be the lone Republican on Charlotte’s City Council next year, said early in the week he was surprised to learn it was Border Patrol being sent to Charlotte.

“I’m conflicted. I have a hard line on identifying and deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes, but I’m not sure this is the way to do it,” said Driggs. “That’s the right thing to do, deport violent criminals. But they are running over local government and it’s causing concern from legal people, legal Americans and legal immigrants.”

Driggs said if there were more local coordination ahead of time – instead of finding out through “anonymous media sources” – the Border Patrol operation may not have been met with such initial fear and confusion from the city’s residents.

“The involvement of people who are elected locally gives residents, legal residents, comfort. Otherwise this could feel like an invasion.”

New Orleans is next, sources say

Bovino’s crackdown on immigration is expected to continue apace in other Democrat-led cities after Charlotte.

The next stop: New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.

The president has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans, a Democrat-led city in a Republican-led state, as far back as September. He said the city has a “crime problem.” But the National Guard plan hasn’t materialized, as efforts to deploy the National Guard in Chicago and Portland have largely been stymied by the courts.

Neither have the president’s ideas to send troops to Baltimore and New York.

The New Orleans mayor’s office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.

Speaking to Fox News on Thursday from West Virginia – before the Charlotte operation was officially announced – Bovino floated a few cities that Border Patrol could head to next.

During the campaign, Sherrill declined to say if she would retain the policy, called the Immigrant Trust Directive, if elected governor, while her Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli vowed to scrap it.

In the days since the election, Sherrill has deflected when asked about the future of the policy under her administration.

“I am focused on keeping people safe here,” Sherrill told reporters Nov. 5, the day after her election victory, when asked about the policy. “I’m committed to making sure people feel safe,” she said. “That is what I’m going to do as governor.”

Separately, Sherrill did not commit in an interview last week with NJ Spotlight News in Washington to sign the policy into state law if legislation to do so cleared the Assembly and Senate.

“I’d have to look at what comes across my desk but I am supportive of most of it,” she said Wednesday night off the House floor. “The directive itself I like, but there’s some clarification on the whole I’d like to see.”

Enshrining the policy into New Jersey state law is a priority of immigration advocacy groups, who are pushing state lawmakers to pass legislation to do so during the remaining days of the administration of Phil Murphy, the outgoing governor.

In particular, groups including the ACLU-NJ and the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, are pressing state lawmakers to pass the Immigrant Trust Act, which would expand protections for immigrants to prevent data sharing that could alert authorities to someone’s immigration status.

That legislation (S3672/A4987) has not advanced since it was introduced in 2024.

“I’m thinking a lot about immigrants’ rights right now,” Amol Sinha, executive director of ACLU-NJ, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News, adding that about 25% of residents in New Jersey were born outside of the U.S., the second-highest percentage of all states.

“It’s crucial that we select an attorney general who will preserve the Immigrant Trust Directive,” Sinha said, alluding to the governor’s authority to appoint a state attorney general.

While campaigning, Sherrill said she would not retain New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin.

The Trump administration has made anti-immigration policy a centerpiece of its first year in office, directing the arrest and deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many of whom have minor or no criminal records.

In New Jersey, the administration has arrested more than 3,000 people, placing it among the top 10 states with the most arrests.

Immigration policy has not been a significant point of focus for Sherrill, a former prosecutor and four-term House member, during her time in Congress.

She first won in a congressional race in 2018. In the years since, Sherrill, a military veteran, has served on the House Armed Services Committee.

In what was likely her final House speech, Sherrill said she would resign from Congress this week.

The House is scheduled to vote this week on legislation to discharge records related to the federal investigation of deceased sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein.

Sherrill said she would vote for that legislation “if I’m here for that.”

The Oct. 17 bulletin, first reported by WIRED and obtained by the transparency group Property of the People via a public-records request, describes multiple cases of criminals posing as ICE agents.

According to the FBI, victims have reported being threatened, robbed, kidnapped and even sexually assaulted by individuals posing as federal officers. Some of the incidents occurred in New York, Florida and North Carolina, the bulletin said.

""Due to the recent increase in ICE enforcement actions across the country, criminal actors are using ICE’s enhanced public profile and media coverage to their advantage to target vulnerable communities,"" the FBI said.

Officials say these impersonation scams are making it harder for communities to distinguish legitimate law enforcement operations from criminal activity — endangering both civilians and real officers. The FBI is urging local police departments to review identification protocols and reminding the public that impersonating a federal officer is a serious crime with significant penalties.

Retired FBI Special Agent Jason Pack, who spent more than two decades with the bureau, told Fox News Digital that the criminals behind these schemes are deliberately exploiting fear and confusion.

DHS WARNS OF ‘UNPRECEDENTED VIOLENCE’ AS DEATH THREATS AGAINST ICE OFFICERS SOAR 8,000%

""Let’s be honest about these crooks,"" Pack said. ""They are slicker than a boiled onion and about as trustworthy as a snake oil salesman. They hide behind fake badges and phony authority, hoping folks will be too scared to ask questions.""

""That kind of behavior tears down public trust and puts real law enforcement officers in harm’s way,"" he continued. ""Anyone caught pretending to be an officer should be prosecuted and put so far under the jail they’ll need sunlight mailed in, and I mean that in the most lawful sense.""

Pack explained that real federal officers carry both a badge and photo credentials — and will always show them, especially in non-arrest situations.

""During my 21 years as an FBI agent, I always identified myself before any conversation began,"" he said. ""In tactical situations where an agent’s face may be covered for safety, that agent still carries identification and will present it once the scene is secure. Real officers will never ask for money, gift cards or favors. They will not get upset if you ask to verify who they are. They want you to feel safe and know you’re dealing with the real thing.""

Pack encouraged the public to stay calm and confirm an officer’s identity before cooperating.

""If you’re ever unsure, take a breath and double-check,"" he said. ""Ask to see both a badge and a photo credential. Read the name and agency on the card. In most cases, there will also be a marked patrol car and a uniformed officer with the agents.""

Pack said those concerned can also look up the local field office number for that agency and call to confirm.

""There are a lot of federal agents deployed throughout the country, so checking which field office they’re assigned to helps verify who they are,"" Pack said.

He added that citizens should never go anywhere alone with someone whose identity they haven’t verified — and should never hand over money or personal information.

""Trust your instincts and call 911 or your local police if something feels off,"" Pack said. ""Real agents and officers will not be upset that you asked, they want everyone to be safe.""

Pack said impersonation crimes don’t just endanger victims — they undermine confidence in legitimate law enforcement.

""Public trust is what keeps the bond strong between citizens and the people sworn to protect them,"" he said. ""Every real officer I’ve ever known takes that responsibility to heart.""

The FBI urges anyone approached by a supposed federal officer to check both a badge and credentials, look for marked vehicles, and contact the nearest field office or local police if anything seems suspicious.

The FBI acknowledged sharing information with law enforcement agencies but declined to discuss specific details from the bulletin.

""Our standard practice is to not comment on information we may share with our law enforcement partners,"" the FBI said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""However, we regularly share information to assist in protecting the communities we all serve. The FBI always encourages members of the public to be vigilant and report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement.""

“These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said in a statement.

In what the government says is the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

The government also threatened visa bans on Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo unless those countries accepted the return of illegal migrants and criminals.

TOUGHER STANCE ON ASYLUM

Immigration has become the most important issue for voters in recent months, with those arriving in small boats from France the most visible sign of illegal arrivals. The issue has helped propel Reform UK, led by veteran anti-EU campaigner Nigel Farage, into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Zia Yusuf, a senior member of Reform, said the public were sick of being told there was no way to prevent people from arriving illegally on beaches, but said existing laws and likely opposition from Starmer’s lawmakers meant Mahmood’s proposed changes were unlikely to ever happen.

Tony Vaughan, a Labour lawmaker and senior lawyer, was one of the first to publicly criticize the proposals, adding the rhetoric would encourage “the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

In the year to the end of March, 109,343 people claimed asylum in Britain, up 17 percent on the previous 12 months. Still, fewer people claim asylum in Britain than in its EU peers France, Germany, Italy or Spain.

Most migrants arrive legally. Net migration reached a record high of 906,000 in the year to June 2023, before it fell to 431,000 in 2024, reflecting tighter rules.

’DARK FORCES’ AT PLAY

Mahmood said Britain had always been a tolerant and welcoming country to refugees but she warned that “dark forces” were stirring up anger, after protests took place this summer outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.

The interior minister said that risked threatening social cohesion and turning anger against those whose families had lived in Britain for decades, saying “a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me.”

Mahmood’s parents moved to Britain from Pakistan in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Under her proposals, the government wants to change the interpretation of Article 8 of the ECHR, governing the right to a family life. It would make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from “using dubious connections to stay in the UK.”

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the “definition of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ has expanded beyond what is reasonable,” making it too easy to challenge deportations.

It did not go as far as to say it wanted to leave the ECHR, as Reform and some in the Conservative Party have advocated.

However, the government’s harder stance on immigration has been criticized by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the rules would “punish people who’ve already lost everything,” adding this is “not who we are as a country.”",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/11/17/4659034-1855157338.jpg?itok=sg4wo2KV,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:29.750535

I’m grateful to all of you, especially our thousands of new subscribers, for your continued support—and I hope that you’ll consider sharing some of what we’re doing with your networks:

Share

The Supreme Court made a fair amount of news last week, but I wanted to use today’s post to reflect upon a story that got swallowed up in the SNAP-related developments—comments made by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche at the Federalist Society’s National Lawyers Convention on Friday, November 7. Specifically, Blanche attributed the Trump administration’s myriad losses in the lower federal courts to “rogue activist judges,” claiming that these “liberals” are “more political or certainly as political as the most liberal governor or D.A.” As Blanche continued (with my emphasis), “There’s a group of judges that are repeat players, and that’s obviously not by happenstance, that’s intentional, and it’s a war, man.” (There’s video here.) Exhorting young lawyers and law students in the audience to come work for the Department of Justice, Blanche continued, “We need you, because it is a war, and it’s something we will not win unless we keep on fighting. It’s hard to get the media, it’s hard to get the American people to focus on what a travesty it is when you have an individual judge be able to stop an entire operation or an entire administrative policy that’s constitutional and allowed just because he or she chooses to do so. So, it’s a war.”

These remarks, of course, did not come entirely off the cuff (you don’t refer to something as a “war” three times by accident), nor did they take place in isolation. The Attorney General herself has filed a (frivolous) misconduct complaint against Chief Judge Boasberg on the D.C. district court; Stephen Miller keeps decrying each adverse ruling against the Trump administration as just part of a broader “judicial insurrection”; and, although the hearing has been postponed for now, the Senate Judiciary Committee had been set to convene tomorrow to hold a hearing on incredibly dubious claims of misconduct by two district judges (never mind that the impeachment power belongs to the House of Representatives).

It’s certainly not a coincidence that we’re seeing all of these spurious attacks on lower courts at the exact same time as they have continued to be the single most effective—and important—check on the lawless behavior of the current administration. But that’s exactly why these attacks are so worrisome. It’s not just that they are remarkably light on substance (and indifferent to the data of where these adverse rulings are coming from, about which more below); it’s not just that they are shamelessly hypocritical given both the behavior of right-wing lawyers during the Biden administration and the attacks directed against those who were themselves critical of that behavior; it’s that, unlike anything that happened between 2021 and 2025, here it’s the number-one and number-two officials in the Department of Justice publicly leading the charge.

Not only is this rhetoric and conduct unbecoming of anyone in the employ of the Department of Justice, let alone its top two officials, but it will surely lead to an increase in both (1) the very real threats that these lower-court judges are already facing; and (2) eroding public faith, at least among those who take Bondi and Blanche seriously, in the lower federal courts. It would be one thing if there were any substance to their charges, but there isn’t. And yet, you’d be hard-pressed to find any conservative groups, right-of-center law professors, or other right-wing commentators publicly criticizing these remarks or the broader attacks on lower federal courts emanating from this administration. I don’t say this lightly, but that is to their profound (and growing) discredit.

More on all of that below. But first, the news.

On the Docket

The Merits Docket

In addition to sitting for the second week of the November oral argument calendar, the Court in last Monday’s regular Order List added one more case to the docket for the upcoming term—agreeing to review a puzzling and controversial Fifth Circuit ruling that had held that federal law, by fixing Election Day as the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, bars states from accepting mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day even if they are postmarked on or before it. My own view is that this is—and should be—a “grant to reverse the Fifth Circuit” case, but either way, one can imagine justices from across the ideological spectrum wanting to at least settle that question well in advance of next year’s midterms.

The Emergency Docket

As has become the norm since this summer, most of the news the Court made last week came with respect to emergency applications.

First, with regard to SNAP, we had Tuesday’s extension (over Justice Jackson’s dissent) of Justice Jackson’s administrative stay—which I wrote about in some detail in Thursday’s bonus issue. As I predicted then, the Solicitor General withdrew the government’s application for emergency relief later on Thursday—after President Trump signed into law the bill reopening the government, which includes full funding for the Department of Agriculture for the rest of the fiscal year. Thus ends, at least for now, the SNAP-related litigation.

Second, the full Court also denied stays of execution to two death-row prisoners. The first came Wednesday when the justices, over no public dissents, cleared the way for Florida to kill Bryan Jennings. The second came Thursday in the case of Oklahoma death-row inmate Tremane Wood, this time over a public dissent from Justice Jackson (and with Justice Gorsuch not participating—presumably because he was involved in one of Wood’s appeals while serving on the Tenth Circuit).

Third, the Court on Thursday also denied emergency relief in the long-pending international child custody dispute, Castro v. Brito Guevara, over public dissents from Justices Sotomayor and Jackson. Given that Justice Alito had entered an administrative stay, and given how long the application was pending (it was filed on October 1; Alito entered his stay on October 2), I’m a bit surprised that no one wrote anything to explain their views. But … there’s a lot going on.

Finally, on Friday, Justice Sotomayor, acting by herself, vacated an administrative stay she had entered in a long-running suit by more than 9,000 Filipino victims of human rights abuses by former President Ferdinand Marcos. The applicants had obtained a $2 billion judgment against Marcos’s estate, which they are currently seeking to execute at least in part against $40 million of funds held in a New York bank account. Sotomayor’s order stressed that no stay pending appeal was needed because of the U.S. government’s “representation that it will not transfer the funds outside of the United States before the disposition of any petition for a writ of certiorari.” Sometimes, a party may seek emergency relief simply to extract such a concession from the government.

Ten years ago, this amount of emergency docket behavior would’ve been a story unto itself. In 2025, it’s just another week at the Court.

The Week Ahead

Turning to this week, we expect a regular Order List out of last Friday’s Conference at 9:30 ET. The Court is also scheduled to take the bench this Friday at 10:00 ET for a “non-argument session.” This has been on the calendar for some time, and is in no way a prediction that any decisions in argued cases are expected. Indeed, especially given all of the emergency docket activity, this strikes me as too early for any merits rulings. But a short, unanimous ruling from an October argument wouldn’t be beyond the realm of possibility; either way, we should get some indication of whether anything other than bar admissions is expected later in the week.

As for the emergency docket, we could see quite a lot of action this week—or not. The reply briefs in response to the Court’s supplemental briefing order in the Illinois National Guard case are due today, so we could see a ruling there later this week. Likewise, another pending emergency application from the Trump administration (the “is the Library of Congress an executive branch agency” case) has been ripe for a ruling since last Wednesday.

There’s also a new application from the Chamber of Commerce, represented by former Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia, asking the Court to issue its own injunction pending appeal of new California state-law requirements that, as of January 1, 2026, most companies doing business in the state make a series of public disclosures relating to climate change. Although the Chamber challenged those laws on First Amendment grounds, the district court denied preliminary injunctive relief, and the Ninth Circuit, although it has expedited the Chamber’s appeal, has yet to act on its request for an injunction pending appeal. I assume Justice Kagan (as Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit) will, as soon as today, order California to respond—although I suspect we won’t hear from the full Court until after Thanksgiving.

Miscellaneous

Finally, the Court last week issued the oral argument calendar for the January 2026 argument session—which includes the two cases about discrimination against transgender athletes (on January 13); and the emergency application in the Lisa Cook case on January 21. The session includes only seven arguments across 10 slots—which means, among other things, that the later-in-term argument sessions are likely to be … crowded.

The One First “Long Read”: “It’s a War, Man”

Even before Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s comments at the Federalist Society Convention on November 7, I had already been planning to devote an issue to the growing assault on lower-court judges from both the Trump administration and congressional Republicans. But Blanche’s incendiary remarks added both a sense of urgency and a specific claim against which it seemed worth pushing back—for at least three independent reasons:

First, it is just not true, by any remotely objective measure, that the rulings adverse to the Trump administration are coming from a small subset of “liberal” district court judges in a handful of district courts. Second, data aside, neither Blanche nor any of the other critics have offered any substantiation of their charge—e.g., by identifying some recurring error that district courts are generally making in these cases even after the Supreme Court has specifically held otherwise. And third, to whatever extent these charges might be legitimate if they had any quantitative or qualitative support (and they don’t), they are especially dangerous to both the safety of these judges and public faith in the judiciary at a time in which the lower federal courts have been the institution that has arguably done the most to serve its intended constitutional function. Of course, that may be the point of these attacks—but that’s all the more reason for folks from across the political spectrum who claim to take our legal institutions seriously to denounce them.

I. The Data

Let’s start with the easy part. Although you might see slightly different numbers elsewhere (there are some small variances in methodology), my own regularly updated data, compiled by two of my research assistants—Alyssa Negvesky and Grace Kiple—and me, identifies 204 distinct cases as of last Friday in which federal district courts have ruled one way or the other on requests for preliminary coercive relief against the Trump administration. In 154 of them, district judges granted either a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, or both. And those 154 rulings came from 121 different district judges appointed by seven different presidents (including President Trump) in 29 different district courts across 10 circuits. Indeed, 41 of those 154 cases with rulings adverse to the Trump administration were presided over by (30) Republican-appointed judges, fully half of whom (15) were appointed by President Trump. (This all assumes, of course, that the party of the President who appointed the judge is an accurate proxy for the judge’s ideological leanings. There are lots of reasons to dispute that framing, especially with respect to district court judges given the persistence of blue slips. But at least as generalizations, the data still has value, IMHO.)

Not surprisingly, the grant/deny rate varies a bit between Democratic appointees and Republican appointees; it’s 82% for the former (113/138) and 62% for the latter (41/66). But it’s still the case that more than a quarter of the cases in which there have been rulings adverse to the Trump administration have been presided over by 30 different Republican-appointed district judges; and that those judges are ruling against the Trump administration at a meaningfully higher clip than they are ruling for it.

Let me just say this one more time: It’s not just that rulings adverse to the Trump administration have come from 121 different district judges spread across the country in 29 district courts and 10 circuits; it’s that 41 of those cases have been presided over by 30 judges appointed by Presidents Reagan, George W. Bush, and Trump. All by itself, that total (41) would be an unprecedented number of rulings adverse to the federal government during the first ten months of any other presidency. If we just looked at those rulings, and no others, it would still be a remarkable story.

And although a visible subset of the total body of lower-court rulings have been “stayed” by appeals courts (including the Supreme Court), there are three points to make about the appeals: First, they’re still a significant minority of the total dataset. Counting the 22 distinct cases with stays from the Supreme Court and another ~20-25 from the courts of appeals, that’s still well more than 100 district court rulings that, at least as of today, remain in effect. Second, and speaking of the courts of appeals, it sure seems like any claims about “rogue activist judges” needs to account for the cases in which those courts are denying emergency relief—in which it’s not just district courts ruling against the Trump administration. One might also flag the handful of cases in which district courts had denied temporary relief but courts of appeals granted it (one especially visible example is the “is the Library of Congress an executive branch agency” case noted above). And third, although I’ve made this point before, it still seems kind of important to this narrative that, in the majority of these cases, the Trump administration either (1) has not appealed the adverse district court ruling at all; or (2) is appealing it without seeking emergency relief. In other words, it’s not just the data that overwhelmingly belies Blanche’s claims; it’s the Justice Department’s own behavior.

II. The Substance

Presumably, if one actually believed that these “rogue activist judges” were abusing their authority, one would have specific examples of analytical moves the judges keep making in these cases that are not just “wrong,” but that are indefensible. After all, in any large dataset of federal litigation, one can always find at least some rulings by district courts that are stayed pending (and reversed on) appeal. The question is not whether it’s possible to point to one or a handful of these 154 cases and find error; it’s whether there’s some broader pattern of behavior that is both (1) not surviving appeal; and (2) being followed by district courts even after the appeals courts or the Supreme Court have explained why that analysis is wrong.

Here, the biggest problem for those criticizing the lower courts is … the Supreme Court. Whatever else may be said about the Court’s refusal to provide full-throated explanations in most of its orders granting emergency relief to the Trump administration, one can hardly find in those cryptic missives any attempt to rein in particular analytical moves being made by lower courts. Indeed, the closest example—Justice Gorsuch’s separate opinion in the NIH case about which challenges to grant cancellations had to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims instead of ordinary district courts—is striking only in how unpersuasive it is; five justices disagreed with where Gorsuch thought the line was in NIH itself. Ditto district courts that at least initially enforced statutes protecting agency heads from being removed without cause; despite the tea leaves from the Supreme Court about overruling Humphrey’s Executor, Justice Kavanaugh himself has emphasized that district courts lack the power to overrule it first. It’s hardly “rogue activism” on the part of federal district judges to … enforce a squarely-on-point precedent from the Supreme Court when one of the key justices reiterates that they have no discretion to not do so.

Again, the story might be different if district courts in these cases were regularly finding, e.g., that plaintiffs have standing to challenge federal policies only to repeatedly be reversed by the Supreme Court (looking at you, district courts in the Fifth Circuit), or if they were regularly exercising jurisdiction in cases in which it is clearly foreclosed. But there is no evidence of any patterns along those lines—and, if there were, it would be easy enough for the Supreme Court to identify them.

The issue isn’t just that these patterns don’t actually exist; it’s that those criticizing the lower courts aren’t even bothering to identify what they think the patterns of allegedly bad behavior are. That’s critical because, as I’ve suggested in the past, I think there is a big difference between a specific, substantive criticism of either individual lower courts or patterns in lower-court decisionmaking and these kinds of handwaving complaints about “rogue activist judges” in contexts in which the only relevant criterion appears to be handing down rulings with which you disagree. The former is an essential part of a healthy discourse about the role of the judiciary in our constitutional system; the latter is not just lazy—it is affirmatively dangerous.

III. The Effects

In response to Blanche, the “Article III Coalition”—a group of 50 retired federal judges appointed by presidents of both parties—put out a remarkable statement, emphasizing that:

In the past year, federal judges have been the target of an unprecedented number of threats based on rulings that have been the subject of harsh criticism by senior public officials. The United States Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies have determined that many of these threats have posed a credible danger to the judges, their loved ones, and their court staff.

It shouldn’t be controversial to suggest that these kinds of attacks from Blanche and other senior Republicans will only increase the incidence of those kinds of threats—especially as they are, and continue to be, amplified on social media. That is, and ought to be, reason enough to repudiate them.

Nor should it be controversial to explain why these attacks fundamentally misapprehend both the role of the lower federal courts and the proper means for objecting to their rulings. As former Fourth Circuit Judge Allyson Duncan (a George W. Bush appointee) put it in a press release accompanying the Article III Coalition’s statement, “Our founders did not design a system of government built on warfare between branches. They built a system of deliberate tension—where courts, Congress, and the executive branch check each other. Calling judges ‘rogue’ because they apply the law in a politically unfavorable way is a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the judiciary in our constitutional structure.”

One might also point out the latent hypocrisy in these attacks. After all, it was at the exact same conference one year ago that Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones launched into an extended (and very personal) attack against me in response to my public criticisms of “judge shopping” in Texas district courts—in which plaintiffs, especially the State of Texas, kept steering nationwide lawsuits to single-judge divisions where they were guaranteed to be assigned to a specific federal judge. Among other things, Jones accused me of directly provoking death threats against Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk (based upon public comments criticizing litigants for repeatedly filing nationwide lawsuits in Amarillo). Even if one thinks the two types of criticisms are remotely identical (and there are a number of reasons why I think they very much aren’t), it’s striking that a single law professor’s comments warranted such a public response then, but these concerted attacks on a much larger number of district judges by senior executive branch officials have been met with … crickets … from the same cohort.

As I wrote then, the point is not that criticism of federal judges (or their critics) is illegitimate or per se harmful; it’s that there’s a critical distinction between criticisms that are founded in evidence and substantive arguments, on the one hand (which, in my view, are not only appropriate but vitally important), and those that are based upon handwaving and innuendo. If anyone would like to go through the rulings adverse to the Trump administration and explain how their analyses (as opposed to their results) reflect judges behaving badly, let’s have it. For now, it suffices to note that any such claim will depend upon much more than pointing to how many of these cases have been filed in Boston or San Francisco; or how often specific courts or judges have ruled one way versus the other. It depends upon identifying the legal points that these judges keep getting wrong—and explaining why no reasonable judge could make the same error.

I’m still not convinced that it would be appropriate for senior Justice Department officials to suggest that they are at “war” with the courts even in those circumstances—especially at the same time as the executive branch is engaged in what appears to be patently unlawful real warlike activity elsewhere. But until and unless the case is made that the courts are doing anything to warrant such a bellicose response, such overheated and incendiary rhetoric reflects little more than an effort to undermine the one institution that the current administration has not been able to steamroll, and for no other reason than because federal judges of every stripe keep enforcing statutory or constitutional constraints against the Trump administration.

In that regard, my exasperation stems not only from these attacks themselves, but from the continuing silence of so many groups, organizations, commentators, and academics to my right—who have, at plenty of other times, claimed to be invested in defending and/or protecting “judicial independence.” If you speak out in defense of judicial independence only to protect judges (or justices) who rule the way you want them to, then I respectfully submit that your definition of judicial independence is bollocks.

SCOTUS Trivia:

Congress Nudges Justice Moody to Retire

115 years ago this Thursday, Justice William Henry Moody retired from the Court—less than four years after his appointment by President Theodore Roosevelt. Shortly after his appointment, Moody had been stricken by severe rheumatism, and sat on the bench for the last time on May 7, 1909. But because of Moody’s age and brief service, he was not yet eligible for the judicial pensions for which Congress had first provided in 1869 (which required the recipient to have reached both 70 years of age and 10 years of federal judicial service).

Borrowing from an 1882 precedent (when Congress had passed a similar statute to nudge Justice Ward Hunt to retire), President Taft lobbied Congress to enact a similar measure for Justice Moody’s benefit. That statute was adopted in May 1910—and offered to extend the 1869 benefits to Moody if, but only if, he retired within five months. Three days before that period expired, on November 20, 1910, Moody stepped down.

For more on the Hunt/Moody statutes, the broader historical politics of the justices’ pensions, and how Congress in 1937, for better or worse, mooted the need for comparable one-off statutes, see this older post.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The U.S. Navy announced yesterday that the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean with its accompanying warships and attack planes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday that he would designate a Venezuelan group, Cartel de Los Soles, as a foreign terrorist organization, adding that the group is “headed” by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Also on Sunday, Trump told reporters, “We may be having some discussions with Maduro, we’ll see.” When Trump was asked if he would be interested in negotiations, Trump said “I’ll talk to anybody. I’ll talk to you.” He did not provide further details on potential talks. Yan Zhuang reports for the New York Times.

The U.S. military on Saturday killed another three people accused by the Trump administration of smuggling drugs by sea, the U.S. Southern Command said yesterday on social media. The post said that the strike had been carried out by a joint task force called Southern Spear at the direction of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Anushka Patil reports for the New York Times.

Trump’s aides are considering giving Maduro safe passage to another country if they succeed in ousting him, according to a U.S. official and two other sources. Others are suggesting placing Maduro under arrest and putting him on trial in the United States, a third source told POLITICO. Officials are also debating which sanctions to lift on Venezuela and when to do so once Maduro has left power, considering the role of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in rebuilding Venezuela’s economy. When asked about the extent of preparation, a U.S. official said, “We have the concepts of a plan.” Nahal Toosi reports.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

The U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday mandated a U.N. fact-finding mission working in Sudan to identify those responsible for the atrocities that occurred when the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary took over El Fasher. The decision was part of a resolution that condemned the widespread, ethnically motivated killings, rape, and torture during the conflict. “Much of El Fasher is now a crime scene,” Mona Rishmaw, a member of the U.N. mission in Sudan, told the council, adding that the mission is also investigating similar tactics in Kordofan, “where civilians are encircled, aid is blocked, and starvation is beginning to emerge.” Nick Cummings-Bruce reports for the New York Times.

UNHCR said on Friday that tens of thousands of people who fled El Fasher are unaccounted for. The U.N. has recorded that nearly 100,000 people fled the city since the RSF took over at the end of October, but only around 10,000 have been counted at arrival hubs such as Tawilia, UNHCR’s Head of Sub Office from Port Sudan said. “A significant number of people on the move [are] stranded somewhere, not able to move further.” Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The U.N. Security Council is set to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution on Gaza today, which now states that after reforms in Gaza the conditions “may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday pledged to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state. Hamas said yesterday that the U.S. proposal is biased towards Israel and deprives Palestinians of the right to manage their own affairs by imposing an international mandate on Gaza. Netanyahu said the proposal calls for Gaza to be demilitarised and noted that “either this will happen the easy way, or it will happen the hard way.” Melanie Lidman reports for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

China yesterday sent coast guard ships to patrol near islands claimed by both Beijing and Tokyo, escalating the current diplomatic feud with Japan. On Friday, the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo warned its citizens against travelling to Japan because of serious safety risks. China did not provide any evidence of such risks. Yan Zhuang reports for the New York Times.

“There is no undeclared nuclear enrichment in Iran. All of our facilities are under the safeguards and monitoring” of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told AP News yesterday, adding “there is no enrichment… because our facilities… have been attacked.” Araghchi said that Iran’s message on its nuclear program remains clear: “Iran’s right for enrichment, for peaceful use of nuclear technology, is undeniable.” Jon Gambrell reports.

A wall built by the Israeli military crosses the Blue Line, the de facto border separating Lebanon from Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, according to a survey conducted by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon last month. A spokesperson for the U.N. Secretary General said that the wall erected by the IDF has made more than 4,000 square metres of Lebanese territory inaccessible to the local population. UNIFIL informed the Israeli military of its findings and requested that the wall be removed. The Israeli military denied that the wall crossed the Blue Line. Lebanon will file a complaint to the U.N. Security Council against Israel for constructing the wall, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said on Saturday. Jasper Ward reports for Reuters; Laila Bassam reports for Reuters.

The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal today sentenced ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on charges of crimes against humanity for her crackdown on a student uprising last year that killed hundreds of people. The Tribunal also sentenced her former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan to death for his involvement. Hasina said today, “We lost control of the situation, but to characterize what happened as a premeditated assault on citizens is simply to misread the facts.” Julhas Alam reports for AP News.

South Africa is investigating a charter flight that unexpectedly landed in Johannesburg last Thursday with more than 150 Palestinians from Gaza. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said, “These are people from Gaza who somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi and came here.” After NGO intervention, most passengers were allowed entry, amid concerns that the secret operation was part of a broader Israeli effort to push Palestinians out of Gaza. Gerald Imray, Alfonso Nqunjana, and Julia Frankel report for AP News.

Colombian human rights ombudswoman Iris Marin said on Saturday that seven children were killed in an airstrike by the Colombian military against the FARC-EMC rebel group last week. Marin said the minors had been forcibly recruited by FARC-EMC and were being used as “human shields,” adding that “the armed forces must adopt precautions to protect children who have been forced to take part in hostilities.” Manuel Rueda reports for AP News.

The Islamic State-backed Allied Democratic Forces on Friday killed at least 17 people in an attack on a hospital in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, authorities said on Saturday. Justin Kabumba reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Alibaba provides tech support for Chinese military operations against targets in the United States, according to a White House national security memo seen by the Financial Times. The memo says that Alibaba shared customer data with the Chinese government and PLA, which includes IP addresses, WIFI information and payment records. The memo did not specify what the PLA is alleged to be targeting in the United States. Alibaba rejected the claims, adding that the intelligence being relied upon is “complete nonsense” and “this is plainly an attempt to manipulate public opinion and malign Alibaba.” Demetri Sevastopulo reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

“We told the Trump administration that the supply of F-35s to Saudi Arabia needs to be subject to Saudi normalization with Israel,” an Israeli official said. Trump told reporters on Friday that he plans to discuss the possibility of normalization with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, adding “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly.” Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

A panel of Brazil’s Supreme Court judges voted on Friday to accept charges of coercion against Eduardo Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro moved to the United States earlier this year and claimed credit for pushing the White House to raise tariffs on Brazilian goods to 50% in retaliation for the criminal case against his father. Reuters reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Homeland Security Department has diverted thousands of federal agents from their core missions like child exploitation investigations, counterterrorism, and human trafficking to focus on immigration enforcement, a New York Times investigation found. The investigation shows, for example, that Homeland Security investigators worked approximately 33% fewer hours on child exploitation cases from February to April compared to prior years, despite claims from officials that overall law enforcement and national security remain effective. The investigation is based on previously undisclosed DHS documents – including statistical reports about workloads, search warrants and arrests – and interviews with more than 65 officials. Nicholas Nehamas, Michael H. Keller, Alexandra Berzon, Hamed Aleaziz, and Zolan Kanno-Youngs report.

Border Patrol agents deployed across Charlotte, N.C., arrested 81 people on Saturday, Senior Border Patrol official Grego Bovino said on social media, adding that the mission was a “success.” An immigrant rights group said it was the largest number of immigrant arrests in the state’s recent history. Eduardo Medina and Sonia A. Rao report for the New York Times.

At least four people died and four others were taken to hospital after a boat capsized off the coast of Imperial Beach near San Diego on Friday night, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard said it was unclear where the boat came from, but said some of the survivors said they were Mexican nationals. Mark Walker reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Former Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler resigned in August amid scrutiny of her financial holdings, which appeared to violate the central bank’s ethics rules, according to a document released by the Office of Government Ethics on Saturday. The document shows that either Kugler or her husband bought and sold multiple individual stocks in 2024, a category of asset that senior Fed officials are not allowed to purchase. Victoria Guida reports for POLITICO.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and acting U.S. attorney Lindsay Halligan submitted written statements on Friday pushing back against a federal judge’s suggestion that records of grand jury proceedings in former FBI Director James Comey’s case were missing. Halligan said that the gap of more than two hours in the transcript “consisted solely of the grand jury’s private deliberations,” adding “there are no missing minutes, contrary to the suggestions raised by the court.” Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

DOMESTIC DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. MILITARY

The Pentagon is withdrawing hundreds of out-of-state National Guard troops from Chicago and Portland, Ore., according to two U.S. officials. The Guard troops arrived in these cities in early October but were never deployed onto the streets as a result of ongoing legal challenges. The Pentagon has not formally announced the withdrawal but the Northern Command indicated on Friday that changes to the federalized troop mission in those cities were imminent. Eric Schmitt reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump yesterday urged House Republicans to vote in support of a measure that would compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. Trump said on social media that Republicans should back the measure “because we have nothing to hide.” Ashley Ahn reports for the New York Times.

Trump on Friday directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI to investigate links between Jeffrey Epstein and notable democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, and former Harvard President Larry Summers, as well as the bank JPMorgan. “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his ‘Island,’ Trump wrote on social media. Bondi appointed Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to run the probe. Gregory Svirnovskiy and Erica Orden report for POLITICO.

Trump also on Friday pardoned Dan Wilson, a Jan 6. 2021 defendant, for the second time. Trump already erased Wilson’s felony conviction for his role in the Capitol riot, but he has now issued a “full and unconditional” pardon for Wilson’s other federal crimes, which include Wilson’s firearms case in which he pleaded guilty to two felony gun offences. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

Trump withdrew Donald Korb’s nomination to be chief counsel for the Internal Revenue Service at the end of last week. While Trump did not provide an explanation for the withdrawal, right-wing political activist Laura Loomer reposted Trump’s announcement on social media with the hashtag “LOOMERED.” Loomer had criticised Korb on Wednesday for praising Democrats and donating to them. Danny Nguyen reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge on Friday issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from coercing the University of California by threatening to cut its research funding in violation of the First Amendment. The judge also said that the government was forbidden from seeking payments from the university system in connection with civil rights investigations. Alan Blinder reports for the New York Times.

But our priority today is to stay focused on executing our mission to defend civil rights and civil liberties in this moment, no matter what may come.","Eight years ago, early in Donald Trump’s first term as president, I worked with Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on a story about the organization’s Strategic Affiliate Initiative, the ACLU’s multiyear program to bolster a select group of its state affiliates to advance civil liberties and defend voter rights against a multitude of threats in post-9/11 America. The initiative, launched in 2002, enabled the ACLU to respond quickly to the crackdowns on immigrants Trump executed in the first 24 hours after being sworn into office.

Trump is now back in the White House for a second term, with far greater executive power than he enjoyed in his first stint. Unopposed by Congress, enabled by a loyalist Cabinet, and buoyed by a Supreme Court that declared him immune to criminal prosecution for his actions, he has deployed National Guard troops to major US cities, along with a vastly expanded Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to further his plans for mass deportation. He has unilaterally gutted federal agencies without congressional approval and threatened legal action against foundations and nonprofits whose activities, though perfectly legal, he perceives as extreme. He has attempted to exert control over universities by freezing billions of dollars in research grants appropriated by Congress and threatening other penalties. He envisions, according to a September 30, 2025, speech he gave to a mass gathering of top officers of the armed forces at Quantico, Virginia, deploying active-duty military to “Democrat-run cities” as training grounds to fight a war against “the enemy within.”

That day, I had scheduled a time to speak to Romero to get an update on the ACLU’s response to Trump’s authoritarian gambit. He was joined by two senior leaders, A.J. Hikes and Aletheia Henry. The following transcript has been edited.—David V. Johnson

* * *

Johnson: Let me start by going back to 2017, the early days of President Trump’s first term. Anthony cowrote a cover story for us, titled “A Revamped ACLU Takes on Today’s Fights,” that addressed “the unconstitutional agenda that President Trump was initiating to undo many of the civil liberties gains of the past quarter century, from immigrants’ rights to reproductive freedom to LGBT rights.”

Around that time, Trump issued an executive order that banned the immigration of citizens from seven different Muslim countries. I remember how people flocked to airports at the time to protest.

Those days now seem quaint in comparison. We have masked agents arresting people off the streets without giving them access to a lawyer or to contacts, without giving them due process, and deporting them to third-party countries.

Where are we today, and how did we get here?

Anthony Romero: This is the most challenging time for civil liberties and civil rights in my tenure as the ACLU’s national executive director. In a conversation I was having with Aryeh Neier, who was my predecessor and the head of the ACLU during Vietnam and Watergate, he said that this is the most challenging time for civil liberties and civil rights that he has ever seen for the organization since its founding. What hang in the balance are nothing less than the basic rights and liberties that define how people live in free democracy and the functioning system of checks and balances that have come to define the United States as a nation committed to fairness and justice and rule of law.

Clearly, the ability for the Trump administration to enact an agenda that is so hostile to civil liberties and civil rights entails the assistance of Congress. This is not just the agenda of a president run amok; it’s really a much broader challenge to the functioning of our system of government than just one person getting elected.

A.J. Hikes: As a 105-year-old organization, we were not created for Trump, but we are built for this moment, and we certainly know how to play the long game. When you think back to that 2017 article and that time during Trump 1.0, we filed more than 400 legal actions against the administration, including against the Muslim ban that you mentioned, family separation policies, his proposed change to the US Census. We have really hit the ground running during this time: We have over 180 legal actions that we have filed so far this term, so we are certainly on track to surpass that 400 number from the first term.

Johnson: With so many different challenges, how do you figure out what to prioritize?

Hikes: We knew that the administration’s strategy would be to flood the zone, and certainly they’ve done that. They’ve been throwing nearly everything they can at the wall in an attempt to overwhelm the public. Very early on, Anthony encouraged us to exercise extraordinary discipline in our responses. So we had to think about the idea that we are not going to swing at every pitch that’s coming at us. What is in our strike zone as the ACLU? And so we think about urgency—the urgency of this moment, the urgency of this issue. Can we act quickly? We think about impact. We think about how we engage our audiences around this. Can we drive action on a set of issues?

And we think primarily about our lane. What is in our scope of expertise? And where are our partners? Is this core to civil liberties? That’s where you see us front and center on birthright citizenship and freedom of speech—the bread and butter of the ACLU. And then we also think about where our partners are leading. So, where do we lead and drive, and where do we support?

Johnson: How did you prepare for this moment?

Aletheia Henry: During this election, we took both candidates at their word. And just before the Republican convention and just before the Democratic convention, we publicly released Trump and Harris memos. We deeply read all of Project 2025, we looked at all of the promises that Trump was making on the campaign trail, and we took him at his word. Then we analyzed those policy positions through a lens of the Constitution and civil rights and civil liberties, and talked about the way we would defend against those attacks.

Once we were clear on the election outcome, we took those public-facing memos and turned them into 100-day action plans, and it allowed us to get a temperature check from the experts across the organization about which executive actions they believed would come first, and we leaned into that. We began lining up clients and preparing briefing materials and ensuring that we were ready to go, and we certainly were. We filed our first case in 90 minutes, on the first day that Trump was signing executive orders. That was the birthright citizenship case—that’s still ongoing.

My colleagues were fairly prescient. I don’t think that anyone could have quite predicted the speed or ferocity with which this administration has moved, but we took them at their word.

We’re in the process of going back to each of those issue teams and spelling out a longer-term, two-to-three-year strategy so that we can stay one step ahead continuously. In the immigration space, the Trump administration has done a lot of the things that were on our 100-day checklist that we predicted, and we want to make sure that we’re preparing for exactly what’s next.

Johnson: What issues would you say are priorities for you, other than birthright citizenship, which you mentioned?

Henry: I would say immigration across the board. It’s not just the birthright citizenship case. It’s the raids and deportation response, the Alien Enemies Act, all the violations of due process in the Fourth Amendment that we’re seeing over and over again in those cases.

There’s a cross-section there with freedom of speech, which has obviously come to the forefront, and we’ve been in the lead on a lot of those attacks on freedom of speech for individuals who are here on visas or some other [immigration] status within the country. But we see the President branching out in his attacks on freedom of speech, so that is at the forefront. And voting rights continue to be at the forefront of our thinking, almost always.

Romero: The one I would add is that we bucket the current challenges to civil liberties into three large categories. Those are the key priorities or the challenges we’re confronting in this political moment.

In the first bucket, we identify the attacks on individuals and institutions who are ideologically opposed to the Trump agenda. These are the attacks on universities, on law firms, on activists like Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, who are our clients. It’s like a modern-day McCarthy—if you don’t agree with the government, you’re in the government’s crosshairs, and it’s playing out in real time, whether it’s in the attacks on [former FBI Director] Jim Comey or the investigations of the Open Society Foundations. And that’s a place of enormous concern and energy for us as an organization that is fundamentally dedicated to the rights of individuals to speak their minds and associate freely. When the government attacks individuals who disagree with it, that raises it to the highest level of priority for us.

The second bucket has to do with the attacks on vulnerable individuals and communities as a way to score cheap political points with the MAGA base. And here, you can look at the attacks on immigrants, the deportations, the raids. You can also look at the attacks on transgender communities. It’s another way to rile up and throw red meat to the Trump supporter base.

In the third bucket would be the attacks on the rules, the norms, and the system of checks and balances that undergird our democracy. And here again, it’s the attacks on a free and open media, the lawsuits against the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, the squeezing of ABC News because of Jimmy Kimmel through the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] licensing process, or the attacks that some members of the Trump administration will levy against judges who rule against them. It’s about the attacks on the structures that are a bulwark against government overreach and government abuse.

Those are the three big areas of work, and within it, we do work on immigrants, we work on voting—voting is one of the systems of our government that you have to defend, especially if they try to subvert the outcome of the election during the midterms.

When it’s other topics, like the firing of federal government employees, the shrinking of the federal workforce, and others that are not civil liberties issues, per se, other organizations carry the ball. Groups like Democracy Forward, Democracy Defenders Fund, Public Citizen, and others have done an amazing job leading on many of the challenges to our country that are not core civil liberties or civil rights issues. So, it’s really important that we have discipline to focus on the issues that are in our lane and allow other groups to lead on issues that are outside our remit.

Johnson: You mentioned Congress and its lack of action in defending civil liberties, but there are also the courts, and you’ve mentioned the many lawsuits that you’ve filed. And it seems the dynamic we’re seeing is that lower courts rule in your favor and maybe issue an injunction against certain conduct by the federal government. And then, in many cases, the Supreme Court has on appeal, via shadow docket, removed the injunction and overruled judges at the district level. What do you make of the role of the judiciary and the Supreme Court in this, and the dynamic you’re seeing right now in many of these cases?

Romero: I think we need to parse it more carefully than just characterize the role of the courts with broad sweeps.

Most cases never get up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decides only 60 to 80 cases in a year, so if there are hundreds of cases filed in a particular year, there’s only a small number of them that will end up before the Supreme Court and on review. And so that’s why we think it’s essential to continue to use the federal courts. There are over 1,100 judges who handle over 300,000 cases in the district courts. Over 300 judges handle 50,000 cases in the courts of appeal. And nine Supreme Court justices handle fewer than 100 cases each year. There are 400-plus cases filed against the Trump administration, so the bulk of these cases will be decided at the district court level, the courts of appeals, and that’s it.

All you have to do with the Supreme Court is count to five. And I actually think in the birthright citizenship case, you might get to seven.

I think it’s also important to parse out how the court has decided some of the matters on the shadow docket. To be clear, there have been great disappointments. The Supreme Court’s decision in our case coming from the ACLU affiliate in Los Angeles on racial profiling, where we had obtained a stay at the lower court level, was lifted by the Supreme Court, with unfortunate language from Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh. But we live to fight another day. We will be able to develop the record, look at the facts, and ultimately, when the case ends up back in front of either the court of appeals or the Supreme Court on the merits, we’re hopeful that with a more fulsome record we’ll be able to strike down the government’s targeting of individuals based on what it perceives to be the characteristics of an undocumented person.

I don’t write off the Supreme Court on most of the major issues just yet. I think with birthright citizenship, which is now pending before the Supreme Court, almost assuredly we win, even with this court. All you have to do with the Supreme Court is count to five. So we’ve got three. Can you get two more? And I actually think in the birthright citizenship case, you might get to seven.

On the Alien Enemies Act litigation, we’ve had to file multiple cases in different jurisdictions, also based on a decision from the Supreme Court requiring us to file in different jurisdictions and making sure that you couldn’t bring just one case. The fact that we won in the Fifth Circuit, a very conservative jurisdiction, makes me feel that when we ultimately get before the Supreme Court on the merits of the Alien Enemies Act case—whether this 1798 statute is properly invoked in this alleged war against the drug cartels and against gangs—ultimately we will succeed at convincing the Supreme Court on the merits.

We’ve been also tracking our own batting average on the shadow docket thus far. Aletheia, do you want to talk through how our report card stacks up?

Henry: What’s important to know is that in 80 percent of the cases where we’ve requested emergency relief, we’ve received it. And of the cases that we have directly brought to the Supreme Court in the past year, 80 percent of them have been decided either in our favor or with a mixed ruling. Rulings aren’t always a clean win-loss, but we’re doing pretty well.

We’re also adapting really quickly. When the Supreme Court issued its ruling striking down nationwide injunctions, we were ready to file a class-action lawsuit. That means that to this day, not one US-born child has been denied their citizenship under Trump’s executive order.

We walked into this understanding that litigation was going to be one tool for the ACLU in this fight. We will see you in court, for sure. But we’re also going to see you in the state house, we’re going to see you in Congress, we’re going to see you in the streets, because it’s going to take all of those mechanisms to defeat this administration and what it’s attempting.

Johnson: In terms of strategy, one thing that I’ve read is your initiative Firewall for Freedom. Can you tell me more about that and how it’s going so far?

Hikes: What’s exciting about Firewall for Freedom is that it’s proactive. Our affiliates are really on the front lines of this. Our goal with Firewall for Freedom is to let local and state government officials know that they can say no to Trump’s extremist policies.

The planning and preparation for Firewall for Freedom started well over a year ago. Over the summer, we worked with our state affiliates to develop a strategy playbook for disrupting this radical agenda that we knew was going to be coming in the second term. The playbook outlines tools across our issues, such as immigration, reproductive rights, free speech, so that these municipalities can uphold rights in their cities.

Here’s where we are now: The campaign is in 43 states. In those states, you see some legislative, some executive, and some advocacy campaigns. We have 15 state legislatures who have already passed 30 different laws protecting our rights. We have 24 pieces of guidance that have been issued by a dozen state officials that tell state agencies how they can safeguard our information, our data, our families. We have three governors who’ve already issued executive orders, and five municipalities who’ve taken action.

Just last week, Delaware Gov. [Matt] Meyer signed HS 119 and SB80 into law—two powerful laws protecting our rights to learn and to dissent. In August, we had Gov. [Maura] Healey in Massachusetts acting to protect and enshrine gender-affirming care and abortion rights into state law. And earlier this year, Washington Gov. [Bob] Ferguson signed a bill that restricted out-of-state armed forces from entering Washington. We have been seeing this escalation of federal troops on the ground in American cities, and we know that’s a cornerstone to Trump’s abuse of power agenda. This law makes it clear that almost any mobilization of the National Guard into the state requires the governor’s permission, and it also has to align with Washington’s core values to protect immigrant communities.

So, those are just a few examples of the ways that Firewall for Freedom is proactively protecting our local communities. It’s been powerful, and we’ve been very lucky to have many state and city officials be our partners in this work.

Romero: The theory of change behind Firewall for Freedom is to use our federalist system as a way to deploy both a sword and a shield against the Trump administration’s policies on civil liberties and civil rights. If you can convince governors, attorneys general, mayors, and city councils to enact policies that stand in the way of government overreach, then that provides some meaningful protection against the worst abuses.

Johnson: You mentioned Trump’s threats to crack down on foundations like the Open Society Foundations (OSF), on universities, and law firms. At SSIR, we represent the social sector and the people who work at such organizations. What do you make of how the organizations, philanthropies, nonprofits, and universities are responding?

Hikes: We should start by saying that the attack on OSF is baseless and a challenge to the values that make this country great. And Anthony mentioned this modern-day McCarthy moment that we’re in. That is exactly what this feels like, turning the whole weight of the DOJ [Department of Justice] against organizations that are speaking out against this administration’s un-American agenda.

We have to remind folks that the President can’t rewrite the Constitution via a memo. And I think we’ve seen real strength in numbers.

Just last week, we saw a presidential memorandum authorizing the government to investigate nonprofits, activists, and donors; and using this overbroad label of terrorism and conspiracy against rights; and targeting individuals, institutions, and communities to score political points, disrupting checks and balances, and consolidating power. It’s all a part of a larger strategy and agenda, and it’s shameful and dangerous.

We have to remind folks that the President can’t rewrite the Constitution via a memo. And I think we’ve seen real strength in numbers. We see coalitions in the philanthropic sector coming together. We see the same thing with our nonprofit communities. We see it as well with corporations and law firms coming together, standing up, and saying that we will not stand for this. We know that this administration is sending up test balloons to see what will actually fly. It’s really imperative in this moment that we are coming together and building those kind of coalitions to push back and draw the line.

On a personal point, when it comes to the ACLU, we are well aware that we may be targeted by this administration. We’ve been preparing for that moment. And we have plans internally and externally. But our priority today is to stay focused on executing our mission to defend civil rights and civil liberties in this moment, no matter what may come.

Romero: There is a sense of real solidarity in the nonprofit sector. Unlike what you saw with some of the nation’s largest law firms just capitulating to Trump’s extortionist policies, or the universities, some of which settled claims against them, the nonprofit sector has been much more unified in its response, and I think we’ve learned from the mistakes of the universities and the law firms that didn’t stick together. There’s been a real effort to make sure that nonprofits across areas and across the political spectrum stay together as one. [Former Associate Attorney General] Vanita Gupta has organized a NATO for nonprofits, and the sector has really come together.

We recently organized a conference call with Public Citizen and Democracy Defenders Fund for nonprofits in the wake of the executive orders that were signed by the President allowing them to investigate domestic terrorist groups. We had 7,000 nonprofits show up on that call. I am proud of the way in which the nonprofit sector has understood that we are in this together. There are lines of communication that I have not seen in 24 years as CEO of a major nonprofit. I have never seen this level of alignment of sharing of information, of referring donors, of dividing work, of providing support and assistance and advice, and that’s because the nonprofit sector realizes what we’re up against is going to require a much more coordinated response. Collective solidarity is key to our individual success.

Johnson: I am also curious about public sentiment. Back in 2017, after Trump was first elected, the ACLU netted a huge windfall of donations from a public worried about civil liberties. Do you feel like the public is again energized? What are you seeing from your supporters and from people at large?

Romero: In 2017, I think there was a response from the public that was largely driven by surprise and shock. Folks rushed to the airports on the Muslim ban weekend. We saw these large spikes of contributions to our website around the Muslim ban and family separation. With Trump’s reelection, we don’t see those crescendo points like we did the first time around. We see a more steady increase of concern, building off where we were at the end of the Biden administration.

I also think some people are turned off by politics in this moment, and tired of the acrimony and divisiveness. Some people just want to put their heads in the sand. Some folks are feeling that it’s not a surprise that Donald Trump is president. Trump represents larger portions of public sentiment. And at the same time, there are many more people who are trying to figure out how to make a difference in this time. You may not see the large women’s marches that you saw in 2017, but there’s much more activism happening at the state and local levels. There are people who are taking action, going to local rallies, signing up to be monthly contributors, because they understand that there’s not one flashpoint and there’s not one silver bullet. They realize that you have to stay on this like water on stone. There’s real, growing activism that we ought not to overlook or downplay.

Henry: What we have seen is people being willing to give more of their time to this effort. So, we’ve had tens of thousands of people attend our Know Your Rights trainings. We have hundreds of thousands of active volunteers. These aren’t people sitting on an email list; they’re the folks working beside us to pass those Firewall measures that AJ was talking about. They’re hosting education events in their communities so that folks understand the impact. They’re engaging with their members at town halls and other events locally. And I think that that’s really important.

Erica Chenoweth and the Crowd Counting Consortium at Harvard University have measured an increase in crowds showing up to demonstrate in comparison to the last Trump administration. It just doesn’t look like the Women’s March. There are more events across more places, and so it’s more of this local activism. The No Kings rallies back in June are a great example of this: Five million people rallied at over 2,000 events across the country. And so that’s 100,000 people in Philadelphia, and 200,000 in New York, and 500,000 in Boston, but it’s also 400 people in Pentwater, Michigan, where the population size is 800. So you get half the town showing up to condemn President Trump’s escalating abuses of power.

We’re taking to the streets again on October 18 with our partners across the country in a similar show of condemnation of this president’s ongoing abuses.

Romero: Sometimes people ask me, “Are we in a constitutional crisis? Is everything lost?” And my answer is, we are in a constitutional crisis if we accept it, and we’re not in a constitutional crisis if we resist it. We need to give people a sense of agency, turn them into protagonists, rather than spectators. That’s critical for groups like ours, and that’s why we work really hard to find meaningful ways for folks to make a difference. If you tell them, “Call your member of Congress” or, “Write a letter to your member of Congress,” people’s eyes immediately roll. They don’t think that Congress is terribly functional or relevant at the moment. But if you tell them, “Let’s stiffen the spine of your local attorney general or your governor, let’s make sure that we eliminate the programs that allow local officials to work with federal immigration enforcement, let’s get the city council to enact laws that protect immigrants and that make the local prisons and jails off-limits to federal immigration enforcement,” then you give them something meaningful to do that they feel is worth their time, energy, and sweat equity.

This momentum is building as people increasingly realize just how far the Trump administration is pushing its agenda. On the issue of immigration, the public opinion was much more with President Trump at the beginning of his first year than it is now. He promised to deport the criminals, the drug dealers, the cartels. Now they see that he’s deporting good folk, people who are the members of our local communities, not the criminal aliens that he promised. And I think that’s creating a backlash to some of the very policies that they are beginning to scale up. Public response and engagement will scale up in response.

Having a strong, local infrastructure among our state affiliates is critical to fighting off the worst of the abuses of the Trump administration.

Johnson: You mentioned your affiliate network—the ACLU has affiliates in all 50 states, in Puerto Rico, and in DC. The cover story you cowrote, Anthony, back in 2017, talked about the ACLU’s Strategic Affiliate Initiative (SAI), where you devoted financial support to select states in an overall strategy to protect civil liberties. Could you update us on the initiative?

Romero: Thank God we launched the Strategic Affiliate Initiative. To do organizational development, you have to do it over the long term. When we first launched our initiative, we realized—and we realize even more so now—that the locus of activity for the battle for civil liberties and civil rights plays out in local communities. The deportations happen in local communities. The abridgment of freedom of speech happens in local communities. The deployment of the National Guard or federal forces happens in cities like Portland [Ore.]; Chicago; Washington, DC; Los Angeles; Memphis [Tenn.]. And so having strong, local infrastructure among our state affiliates is critical to fighting off the worst of the abuses of the Trump administration, because that’s where the rubber’s hitting the road.

Over the past several years, we have consciously focused on growing our Southern affiliates. That is the most recent iteration of our Strategic Affiliate Initiative. Increasingly, you see these issues play out in Texas—for instance, the redistricting battle to try to redraw the maps of Texas’ congressional districts to put their thumb on the scale in the midterm elections. It’s critically important that we be strong in a place like Texas. In Florida, we’re holding off the worst of the abuses. The head of our Florida office, Bacardi Jackson, says that the nation’s going in the same direction that Florida’s been heading in for years. And so it’s really important for us to be able to fight off some of those challenges in Florida. Alligator Alcatraz, for instance: Our legal challenge to the creation of that prison camp for immigrants has met with success. If we didn’t have the boots on the ground to be able to challenge that in real time, we’d be struggling to do it from afar in New York City or Washington. The Strategic Affiliate Initiative was exactly the right investment so that we could not just enact policy reforms like Firewall for Freedom but also fend off the worst of the civil liberties violations in really difficult states, like Florida or Texas or Alabama.

What was it that you told me the other day, Aletheia, about the Census on the South?

Henry: I read reporting recently that the 2030 Census is going to demonstrate a population shift to the South. States like New York and California are losing population relative to the South, and we will be redistricting accordingly, so it’s good that we have these strong, sustainable affiliate organizations built there for the future fights.

I think it’s really interesting that the Southern Collective, the third iteration of our SAI, was born from the affiliates themselves. In 2019, these 12 affiliates came together and lifted up the challenges that they were having and asked for national investment. What started as a $15 million investment in the Southern Collective has now become a $51 million, five-year investment in the South. And because voting rights is a generational struggle in the South, a lot of our work has focused on voting rights. We were able to partner with our Alabama affiliate on our Allen v. Milligan case that made it up to the Supreme Court—a redistricting case under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

Across the South now, we have these data dashboards that have demographic voting and turnout patterns for our southern states. In Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia, we’re monitoring voter-roll purges so that we can see when they’re trying to force people off the rolls and get them back on quickly. And in Florida, we’ve built on those demographic dashboards to track inclement weather that may affect polling locations, to track social media reports of violent groups that may be attempting to target those locations, so we can do that rapid-response voter-protection work when the time comes.

Romero: In order to be ready for a moment like the one we’re in, it takes years of planning and preparation, of anticipating where you think the challenges will go. We have 2,200 staff nationwide at the ACLU, and 1,600-plus of them are in the state offices. That reflects a conscious decision that the only way you can be effective is to be proximate to the problems. And so you have local lawyers, local activists, local organizers, people who are embedded in these communities, helping solve the problems that manifest in their communities.

Johnson: One last question about the midterms next year: How worried are you about free and fair elections in our country? And what do you have planned for the midterms?

Henry: I don’t think we ever stop thinking about how to protect the people’s voice, and certainly, given Trump’s voting executive order, this midcycle redistricting, his targeting of mail-in voting, and other efforts of the Trump administration, we’re monitoring and responding to all of that. We’ve had success in blocking many of these attempts in the past. We have a playbook, and we have been involved in election protection in many states for years now, and I mentioned a lot of our work in the South. Our first call with our affiliates on having a plan to safeguard the election is tomorrow [October 1, 2025]. So we are preparing for the fights ahead. We certainly will be involved in the 2025 cycle, even though it’s a lighter election year, just to make sure that voting is as free and fair as possible, but we are ramping up all those efforts for 2026 and 2028. And it’s not just us: We have a whole network of groups that we work very closely with.

Romero: And our work to secure the right to vote and to defend the franchise is not animated by a desire to help one party or one candidate get elected. We are agnostic about the outcomes. Our sole goal is to ensure that people cast an informed vote. We will inform them about the records and the history and the backgrounds of candidates. But we never tell people who to vote for. We want voters to be informed, and if they wish to cast a vote, our job is to make sure it is meaningfully counted.

In one of the voting rights challenges we had during the first Trump administration, they were trying to shut down drive-through polling booths in Harris County, Texas. Our lead plaintiff was a Republican. Shutting down drive-through voting affects Democrats as much as Republicans, and our goal was to make sure that voters were able to cast their votes. It’s the same thing with mail-in ballots. A lot of elderly people vote by mail. And they vote Republican, and they vote Democrat, and it doesn’t matter which party they vote for—they should just be able to cast their vote. That is the animating principle for us: making sure that government officials don’t cynically try to shave off certain types of voters who they don’t believe vote for their party or their candidates. We believe that the voters should pick our elected officials, not that the elected officials should pick the voters.",https://ssir.org/images/articles/winter-2026-feature-aclu-737x737.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:57:11.111251

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda.
It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens).
There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said.
Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration.","Many members of Colorado’s Latino community fear they could be arrested by federal immigration authorities and have changed their daily lives to avoid it, a recent poll found — even as Latinos remain predominantly focused on economic concerns ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

“In every aspect of life, Latinos have attenuated their normal behavior and avoided critical locations, like work and school, in order to stay clear of the immigration (enforcement) surge,” pollster Gary Segura told reporters upon releasing the results.

The issues identified more broadly in the Colorado Latino Agenda poll, which was released earlier this month, reflect a growing national consensus among all voters, not just Latinos. The overwhelming concern with affordability — respondents’ top four issues all related to the cost of living and the economy — shows that economic fears have endured through President Donald Trump’s first nine months in office, with recent elections across the country notching wins for Democrats who focused on the issue.

But the results also revealed mounting fear about an erosion of civil rights and discontent with the Republican president’s efforts to rapidly arrest and deport millions of immigrants without proper legal status.

Forty percent of the registered voters who participated in the survey said they or their communities feared that immigration authorities would arrest them, even if they’re U.S. citizens or have some kind of legal status. And 30% said they or their communities feared interacting with or calling the police, while 28% said they or their communities feared attending regular immigration proceedings because they could be arrested.

Asked whether civil rights had improved under Trump, 62% said they hadn’t, compared to 20% who said they had.

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda. Immigrants have repeatedly been arrested while attending regular immigration hearings, as advocates have said and court filings reviewed by The Denver Post have indicated.

ProPublica, a nonprofit news outlet, reported last month that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration authorities nationwide this year. Immigrants with legal status and work permits, like a Douglas County teacher arrested last month, have also been caught up in raids and arrests.

“The actions of the Trump administration are fundamentally changing the way that Latino citizens are interacting with their government,” said Phil Chen, a political science professor at the University of Denver who reviewed the poll. “A quarter of them say that they or their community are missing classes because parents are worried about being arrested driving to school. I read (those results) as deeply, deeply troubling.”

About 23% of Colorado residents are of Hispanic or Latino origin, according to the State Demography Office.

The poll was conducted by a bipartisan polling team last month. It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens). Its margin of error was plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

Concerns with Trump, Republicans

Latino Coloradans, who have tended to vote Democratic but not monolithically, also expressed mounting concerns with the Trump administration and Republicans who control Congress. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they were concerned that Congress wasn’t acting as a check on Trump. Asked who was to blame for the recent government shutdown, 61% said the president and his party, compared to 23% who blamed Democrats. Two-thirds disapproved of Trump’s performance in office.

There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said. More than a third of respondents said they’d voted for Trump in 2024.

The vast majority of that group — 80% — said they would vote for him again. But 13% said they wouldn’t, and the remaining 7% said they were unsure. Of those who supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, 91% said they would vote for her again, and the remaining share said they weren’t sure.

“When there’s a party that holds all of the levers of power in the federal government, (voters) are going to blame that party for things they think are not going well and probably give them credit for things that are going well,” Chen said. “This is the pattern we expect to find in every off-year and midterm election.

“So if you were (U.S. Rep.) Gabe Evans or the state Republican Party, I think it’s really important to start thinking about how you talk about issues around affordability — around housing costs, food costs, inflation, job opportunities, things like that.”

Evans, a Republican, represents the 8th Congressional District stretching from the northern Denver suburbs to Greeley, and it’s one of the most contested congressional seats in the country. Much of his successful 2024 campaign focused on immigration and public safety.

‘Latinos are looking for leadership’

Still, criticism of Trump doesn’t necessarily mean Latino voters are running straight into the arms of the Democratic Party, said Alex Sánchez, the president and CEO of Voces Unidas, which is part of the coalition that released the poll.

Fifty-two percent of self-identified independents surveyed in the poll said they either didn’t know which party they’d support next year or that they wanted to support someone else. (A plurality of independents, 35%, said they would support Democrats, compared to 12% for Republicans.)

“There are warning signs to both parties in the data,” Sánchez said in an interview. “While, yes, Colorado Democrats fare better … they’re not too far from the danger zone. That’s what we see in the data: a clear sign that Latinos are looking for leadership, are looking for results.”

He added about Latinos: “We are not brand loyal. We don’t carry the party loyalty the same way that other voters do. Latinas and Latinos historically vote based on value and vote based on results, instead of party sticker and party label.”

Despite the unpopularity of the Trump administration’s mass-deportation efforts, affordability concerns were still far and away the top concerns for voters. Forty-eight percent of respondents said the cost of living and inflation were their top priority.

Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration. More than half of respondents said it was most important for election officials to tackle either prices and affordability, or wages and good jobs.

That’s unsurprising, Chen said. Affordability was a dominant issue in elections elsewhere in the U.S. earlier this month, he said, and has remained a top issue for all Colorado voters for years.

With next year’s midterms approaching, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had begun floating new affordability ideas in recent weeks as it faces the reality that Americans are still pessimistic about the economy as they struggle with higher prices.

“You can think of (the immigration crackdown) as a problem. It can affect your impressions of President Trump,” Chen said. “But when it comes to how (Latinos) are going to vote, (they’re) going to vote on the thing that’s really affected me, which is the economy.”",https://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-L-immigrant-rights-RJS-13431.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:21.016921

Dr Zazai warned that political rhetoric has become increasingly dehumanising — and that adopting the tone of the far right is both morally wrong and socially dangerous.

“People fleeing war, persecution and trauma are not a burden. They are not a threat. They are human beings. Yet too often, the way we talk about them strips away their dignity. When politicians use language that echoes the far right, they don’t defeat extremism — they legitimise it.”

“Imagine arriving here with nothing, being placed in cold, overcrowded accommodation, and surviving on just a few pounds a week. Then imagine being told your right to remain may be denied simply because your family doesn’t meet new thresholds.

“We can protect our borders without undermining our humanity. We can enforce rules without embracing rhetoric that divides. The UK must show that firmness and compassion can go hand in hand — and that the dignity of every person remains at the heart of our asylum system.”

Government plots human rights overhaul to speed up deportations

Caitlin Doherty

Monday 17 November 2025 04:34 EST

Labour plans to overhaul human rights laws to facilitate the deportation of foreign criminals and small boat migrants, aiming to strengthen border security.

The government intends to change how UK judges interpret the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 8 (right to family life) and Article 3 (prohibition of torture), to prevent asylum seekers from using these rights to avoid deportation.

Proposed measures include tightening family connection rules for Article 8, updating modern slavery laws, restricting illegal migrants to a single appeal route, and potentially making refugee status temporary.

Visa sanctions will be imposed on Angola, Namibia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo if they do not cooperate with the repatriation of illegal migrants.

Critics, including human rights charities, warn that these changes will punish vulnerable individuals, drive asylum seekers underground, and undermine fundamental human rights protections.

The organization notes that FCI Dublin was closed in 2024 after federal investigations confirmed ongoing patterns of correctional officers sexually assaulting incarcerated women.
“As a resident of the Tri-Valley for over 35 years, I am opposed to reopening FCI Dublin as an ICE detention facility in our community,” said resident Dan Morley, according to CCIJ.
Organizers warn a new ICE detention hub in Dublin would worsen these conditions and further isolate mixed-status families.
The organization warns that reopening FCI Dublin would recreate the same harmful conditions that led to the facility’s closure.","DUBLIN, CA – Dublin residents and immigrant justice advocates are urging the Dublin City Council to reject any attempt to reopen the former Federal Correctional Institution Dublin as an immigration detention center, according to the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice (CCIJ).

Community members are expected to gather for a vigil outside the Dublin Civic Center at 6:30 p.m. on Nov. 18 before giving public comment at the council meeting at 7 p.m.

CCIJ reports that early 2025 filings revealed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is considering reopening FCI Dublin to expand immigration detention, alarming survivors and advocates because of the facility’s documented history of widespread staff sexual abuse.

The organization notes that FCI Dublin was closed in 2024 after federal investigations confirmed ongoing patterns of correctional officers sexually assaulting incarcerated women. Many survivors were undocumented, which advocates argue made them more vulnerable to threats of deportation.

“These guards abused us because we were immigrants. They told us they could do whatever they wanted, because we were going to be deported,” said one anonymous survivor. According to CCIJ, she reported being regularly subjected to racist slurs and told to “go back” to her country.

CCIJ reports that survivors also described dangerous conditions inside the facility, including mold, asbestos and deteriorating infrastructure, which contributed to the prison’s closure.

Community opposition has grown across the Tri-Valley as residents continue urging officials to block ICE from reopening a site associated with severe human rights violations, according to the organization.

CCIJ warns that reopening the facility under the Trump administration could escalate mass deportation efforts, widen arrest dragnets and increase the risk of wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens. The group adds that detention and deportation have long-term effects on family stability, mental health and industries dependent on immigrant labor.

“As a resident of the Tri-Valley for over 35 years, I am opposed to reopening FCI Dublin as an ICE detention facility in our community,” said resident Dan Morley, according to CCIJ. He stated that reopening the site would “stoke fear in the daily lives of so many of our immigrant neighbors.”

CCIJ claims that the Nov. 18 actions are part of a broader movement led by the ICE Out of Dublin Coalition, the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity and other community partners working to stop the facility from reopening. The coalition includes survivors, faith leaders, residents, labor groups and civil rights organizations.

The organization argues that FCI Dublin’s legacy as a site of systemic abuse makes it especially inappropriate for detaining immigrants. CCIJ emphasizes that many survivors still live in the Bay Area and continue to experience trauma tied to the facility.

CCIJ reports that unsafe infrastructure, toxic materials and deteriorating buildings would require major investment to make the prison habitable, raising further concerns about holding vulnerable individuals there.

The coalition fears reopening the facility would heighten fear among immigrant communities already worried about workplace raids, surveillance and traffic-stop enforcement, according to CCIJ. Organizers warn a new ICE detention hub in Dublin would worsen these conditions and further isolate mixed-status families.

CCIJ reiterates that faith leaders throughout the East Bay have joined the opposition because they believe the use of a site known for abuse violates core religious values.

The organization warns that reopening FCI Dublin would recreate the same harmful conditions that led to the facility’s closure.

According to CCIJ, while the City Council cannot directly prevent federal authorities from leasing the prison, large-scale public opposition could influence political decisions and pressure federal officials to abandon the plan.

CCIJ concludes that organizing will continue until ICE publicly commits to not reopening the facility, and they encourage residents to attend the vigil, speak during public comment and urge elected leaders to oppose detention expansion at the site.

State Representative Kristi Pursell (DFL-Northfield) Yesterday’s actions by federal law enforcement were unnecessarily extreme.","By Logan Wells, News Director | Logan@kymnradio.net

In a statement on their Facebook page, Northfield Police Chief Jeff Schroepfer stated that ICE had not contacted the department before the incident. Furthermore, while Northfield Officers were called to the scene by bystanders, it is not a Northfield Police Department case or investigation. “The department was not involved in the contact or any related arrests and has not been provided details regarding the circumstances or reasons for ICE’s actions.”

The police chief noted that it is the policy of the Northfield Police Department not to participate in or assist with immigration enforcement actions and that they do not have the authority to interject themselves into a federal investigation.

Will be working in the coming days to gather and provide any additional as we have it, and will update you on-air and online.

Statements from Local Leaders:

Northfield Mayor Erica Zweifel:

I have viewed the video circulating showing federal agents detaining one of our neighbors in Northfield. These actions have traumatized the community and left a family without their father and husband. The City of Northfield values the safety and well-being of all residents. We value our local law enforcement officials. Our focus at the City level remains on fostering a safe, inclusive community for all residents, ensuring local law enforcement operates transparently and professionally, and providing support for families affected by incidents within our jurisdiction.

Because this is a Federal matter, the City has no authority to intervene in or direct ICE actions, and there are no local mechanisms to require identification or prevent the use of masks by Federal agents acting under Federal authority. Any questions regarding the procedures or accountability of ICE agents should be directed to the agency itself. To be clear, this is not a Northfield Police Department investigation, and the department had no role in the detention or any enforcement actions. Local law enforcement and city officials do not have authority over Federal investigations or the actions of Federal agents. I support the Northfield Police Department in fulfilling its duties responsibly and in accordance with the law.

That said, it would be irresponsible for us not to express some concern about the approach the current Federal administration is taking regarding the freedoms and civil rights that every resident of our community deserves. We fully acknowledge that we do not know the complete circumstances around the current issue at hand. However, we are fully committed to the U.S. Constitution and the laws of our land which include due process and protection under the Bill of Rights.

We call on our Federal leaders in Congress, in the White House and in the Supreme Court to uphold their oaths to the Constitution while ensuring that everyone on U.S. soil is afforded the human and civil rights that we would all want for ourselves.

Many residents have asked what they can do in the face of such uncertainty. I have reached out to Senator Tina Smith, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Representative Angie Craig to express my deep concern about how this incident unfolded in Northfield and the delay of information regarding this community member’s location, status, or charges. Issues of transparency, oversight, and communication fall squarely within federal authority, and I am urging our congressional delegation to seek answers on behalf of the community. I encourage residents to join me in sharing these concerns with their federal representatives.

In Northfield we will continue to support one another, stay in dialogue with our local police, and engage with our elected officials. The Community Action Center has established the Northfield Supporting Neighbors Fund, donations can be made at www.northfieldsupportingneighbors.org These funds are made available to families in need for legal assistance.

Together, we can stand with this family and uphold the values of care, dignity, and accountability that define Northfielders.

State Representative Kristi Pursell (DFL-Northfield)

Yesterday’s actions by federal law enforcement were unnecessarily extreme. The disappearing of one of our community’s valued Northfielders has left us scared and angry, but we are not deterred.

I’ve been in touch with his family, community groups, and local leaders to offer my support in any way I can as we respond to this unconstitutional act. Right now we are united as a community in grieving, but we will move forward together. We must continue to speak up and speak out against unconstitutional actions like these.",https://i0.wp.com/kymnradio.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/KYMN_square.png?fit=32%2C25&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:09.971796

“It’s 2025, and this is completely unacceptable to be running an ICE facility like this, and be deporting people illegally, without due process.","Activist groups and community members gathered Saturday morning to denounce the construction of a new federal immigration enforcement detention facility on Milwaukee’s Northwest Side. Renovations at the property, located at 11900 W Lake Park Drive, were clearly underway, with construction equipment sitting behind new fencing, piles of dirt and stacks of building materials visible through the building’s dark windows. Outside, protesters marched in the street and delivered speeches.

The 36,000-square-foot detention and processing center is planned to serve as a central hub for southeastern Wisconsin, holding people before deportation or transfer to other detention centers.

“You may be here, but you are not welcome here,” said Ald. Larresa Taylor — who represents the district where the facility will be located. Although the city cannot prevent ICE from taking over the facility, Taylor said that this “doesn’t mean that we are going to accept it laying down.”

Activists from Voces de la Frontera, Comité Sin Fronteras, the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Never Again Action–Wisconsin, the Party for Socialism & Liberation, and the Wisconsin Coalition for Justice in Palestine picketed outside the building for close to two hours. Towards the end of the event, a drone was seen flying overhead, which was not operated by any of the activist groups who held the rally. In a empty parking lot nearby, several deputies appeared to be packing away equipment in the trunk a Milwaukee County Sheriff’s vehicle. The Sheriff’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment on whether its drone team was flying over the Saturday protest.

Opponents of the facility say that its opening moved forward without community input or consent, and that it will perpetuate troubling uses of force and arrests in cities nationwide including Chicago. The facility will be used to process ICE detainees, as well as immigrants who must come in for regular check-ins.

Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, applauded Taylor, calling her “the first person to sound the alarm months ago about the expansion of this detention center, and to call attention and condemn what was happening in our city.” The building is privately owned by Milwaukee Governmental LLC, which originally requested modifications to the property (something Taylor learned about in December). The LLC is linked to the Illinois-based WD Schorsch LLC, which owns properties leased to federal government agencies.

“It’s not an accident what is happening, where this facility is being chosen to be built,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “It’s part of a long-term pattern of discrimination and marginalization, and criminalization of working class people of color.” Neumann-Oritz said that instead of spending “millions” on the facility, “that money should be used to pay for FoodShare, BadgerCare, and our public schools.”

Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC), said, “We are not free, until we are all free.” Lang added that Black communities “know what it’s like to be ripped away from our families and locked away,” and that people are concerned about federal agents’ behavior in cities like Chicago. “And we have been worried for months, if not years, ‘is this going to happen to Milwaukee?’”

Over recent months months, videos have suggested an escalating patter of force from federal agents including shooting people in the head with pepper balls, placing protesters in chokeholds, deploying tear gas in crowded neighborhoods in broad daylight, arresting and attacking journalists, arresting parents in front of their children, and having unprofessional verbal exchanges with citizens.

Although Milwaukee hasn’t seen protest-related clashes, ICE stirred anxiety and condemnation earlier this year after arresting members of families with mixed-immigration status at the Milwaukee County Courthouse as they attended court hearings. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was also arrested and criminally charged after the federal government accused her of attempting to hide a person sought by ICE who’d attended a hearing in her courtroom. Dugan is expected to go to trial in federal court in December. Other high profile arrests and deportations of community members have also occurred in Milwaukee during the first six months of the second Trump administration.

Conor Mika, a student activist at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) condemned what he said is a lack of transparency and accountability for his school’s relationship with ICE, which has been using a university building for operations in Milwaukee. “It’s time MSOE takes a stand. It’s on MSOE to slow down ICE’s operations, and protect its students by removing ICE from this building, and refusing any future collaborations with these agencies conducting mass deportations in our city.”

Leah Janke and Tanya Brown both attended the rally Saturday, and told the Wisconsin Examiner that it was important to make their voices heard. “I think it’s important that people here know that we don’t want this,” said Brown. “It’s not just a small community that doesn’t want it, it’s everybody. We don’t want it.” Janke said. “It’s 2025, and this is completely unacceptable to be running an ICE facility like this, and be deporting people illegally, without due process. This is insanity. It doesn’t feel right in any way.” Janke added, “I’ve seen a lot happening in Chicago, and that’s my fear…that’s my biggest fear.”

Besides attending rallies, Janke has been making “whistle kits” filled with whistles and information about reporting ICE, or alerting the community if an arrest is happening. “Be safe out there,” said Janke. “Because honestly, it’s scary and people are getting hurt.”

Raúl Ríos, an activist with both Comité Sin Fronteras and Party for Socialism and Liberation, said it was important to rally people on Saturday both on the North and South Sides of Milwaukee, especially since the city is one of the most segregated in America. “Most people that I’ve heard, not only today but previously, had said that they had no idea that this was even being constructed, and that it’s going to be used as the main facility for southeast Wisconsin,” Rios told the Examiner.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0106-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:34.932820

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.
The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year.
Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.
Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""","The changes aim to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals, as well as make it more difficult for successful asylum seekers to remain.

Mahmood told the BBC on Sunday: ""This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.""

She said the ""pace and scale"" had been destabilising and that to ""maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control"".

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.

The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year. The government sees overhauling the system as crucial in order to rebuild public confidence that it can stem the numbers coming to the UK.

Under the plans, which have been criticised by some Labour MPs as well as opposition parties, people will be restricted to arguing their grounds for appeal within a single appeal and if a case fails, they will be deported.

The government will argue that these restrictions would give room to create new safe and legal routes for refugees through work and study routes.

The government will follow the Danish model of creating an independent body to fast-track the deportation of foreign criminals and cases with little prospect of success through the appeals system.

Tighter restrictions would be placed on successful asylum seekers, who will have their case reviewed every two and a half years - and if their home country is considered safe they will be returned.

A refugee will have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

The home secretary is also expected to announce another Danish-inspired move, which is to take possessions and savings to pay for accommodation, including cars and e-bikes - although unlike in Denmark this will not include jewellery and sentimental items like wedding rings.

The Home Office says this is because some asylum seekers are getting gifts of money from relatives at the same time as living in free accommodation and receiving a small financial allowance from the UK government.

Mahmood also wants to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied - only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

And the UK will join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

The government believes this has been used to support unreasonable claims, including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their healthcare needs cannot be met.

As first reported in the Times, the threat of visa bans for Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo comes after thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from the three nations were said to be in the UK.

A Home Office source said the countries were being targeted ""for their unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive returns processes"".

Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the plans were ""a small step in the right direction"" and her party would work with the government to get them through Parliament.

However, she added that the proposals were ""nowhere near enough"" and called on the government to go further, including by leaving the ECHR and removing everyone who arrives in the country illegally.

The plans have prompted criticism from some Labour MPs, including the MP for Folkestone Tony Vaughn, who said he agreed action needed to be taken ""to regain public trust"" in the asylum system but opposed the idea of temporary asylum ""on principle"".

""A particular problem that I have is around the idea we should be trying to kick refugees out despite having granted them protection,"" Vaughn, who is an immigration barrister, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""I think the idea is we review their status after two-and-a-half years on a rolling basis and then hopefully at some point their country will be safe and we can deport them - I think that's completely the wrong position in principle.""

Vaughn said the proposals risked creating ""limbo and alienation"" and called on the government to instead clear the asylum appeals backlog, make decisions on claims more quickly, and ramp up the France-UK returns deal pilot.

Speaking on the same programme, Asylum and Border Security Minister Alex Norris said the 20-year rule would only apply to new arrivals, but he said he did want to tackle the 50% of refugees who ""end up on benefits"".

Norris said: ""If your intention is to come to this country illegally... sit at home, not contribute, not learn English, integrate into the community, not to build a life... then that's going to come with much greater checks.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cdcf/live/51572e20-c385-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:14.414601

Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the effort launched on Saturday is to protect the public from “dangerous criminal offenders who are in the country unlawfully,” adding that additional DHS workers were deployed to Charlotte.

Gregory Bovino, who led hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in a similar effort in Chicago, said that 81 arrests were made Sunday.

Nearly 1,400 ICE detainers across North Carolina have not been honored — releasing “criminal illegal aliens” into North Carolina’s neighborhoods, DHS said Saturday.

Some of the arrests and agent encounters were caught on video — with many shocking audiences.

On Sunday, ICE officials said the driver of a van went off-road, driving around agents in Charlotte in the University City area near UNC-Charlotte.

DHS officials said an officer was injured when the van driver — a U.S. citizen — led them on a high-speed chase and later tried to ram law enforcement vehicles.

When the driver was arrested, a firearm was found in the vehicle, according to DHS.

Also on Sunday, a video sent from a WJZY viewer showed about a dozen agents out in northeast Charlotte just before noon, with a large crowd around the agents.

Some people were recording video and others were annoyed by the agents at the Compare Foods grocery store near the intersection of Sugar Creek Road and Tryon Street in Charlotte.

An early sighting of agents Saturday was near Baleada Bar and Grill, less than a mile from where a group of agents was caught on video getting into two unmarked Ford SUVs along South Boulevard.

There were tense moments as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents smashed the window of a Honduran-born U.S. citizen in a Charlotte strip mall parking lot.

Willy Aceituno recorded video of the second stop when his red Ford pickup truck window was smashed. He says once the video cut away — the agents dragged him out and threw him to the ground.

Aceituno was released once he was able to show documentation that he was a U.S. citizen. But he was also shaken up with some cuts to his arms from the broken glass and he later filed a report with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police.

The incident with Aceituno was also caught on video from another angle, showing the agents holding him to the ground.

The agents drove off in a light-colored unmarked Ford Expedition SUV.

A video captured by a man driving in a parking lot also showed U.S. agents with two people on the ground across the street. Johny Martinez Gonzalez cursed at the agents on video as they led the pair of detainees away.

Also Saturday, a video showed federal agents putting a woman’s hands behind her back as she can be heard yelling.

Video captured by Paula Walker Coleman showed the woman screaming, “I am a US citizen!”

According to WUNC, agents were seen making arrests in “Charlotte’s immigrant-heavy Central Avenue and South Boulevard corridors.”

Also Saturday, U.S. Border Patrol agents were seen roaming an east Charlotte neighborhood in a dark-colored unmarked minivan.

Video showed masked agents approaching two men using a ladder to hang Christmas lights in a front yard.

One agent tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, homeowner Rheba Hamilton said. The workers did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

Also Saturday, a detention was caught on video.

Border Patrol agents were spotted arresting a man at an immigrant shopping center in east Charlotte around 10:15 a.m. Saturday.

The man was grabbed at the corner of Rosehaven Drive and Central Avenue, according to WFAE. Agents chased the man into a laundromat, then take him into custody, according to WFAE which captured the video.

Meanwhile, a bakery in Charlotte decided to close indefinitely while the ICE crackdown was underway.

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

Manolo Betancur owns Manolo’s Bakery — a popular Latin bakery in East Charlotte — said he decided to close after watching raids in the parking lot Saturday.

“I have seen these people in SUVs, cars that are not marked with their faces covered — throwing immigrants to the floor and taking them away,” Betancur said.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/11/video-ice.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:43.438204

Earlier this month, District Judge Karin Immergut ruled in favor of Oregon and found that Trump exceeded his authority by deploying hundreds of Oregon and California National Guard troops to, in part, protect federal staff and property at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in South Portland.

""The court acknowledged large-scale violent protests in June, but treated them as irrelevant to the President's determination just a few months later,"" the federal government wrote in its motion.

PAST COVERAGE | Trump administration appeals court ruling blocking troop deployment to Portland

On Saturday, the number of Oregon National Guard troops remaining on standby to deploy was reduced to 100, according to ABC News.

The troops are scheduled to remain under federal control until Nov. 26, ""but the Department of War intends to extend this mobilization,"" according to the federal government's newest court filing.

In its new motion to stay the district court ruling, the Trump administration argued that in mid-June, approximately 450 protesters engaged in activities such as starting fires, assaulting officers, blocking traffic, and vandalizing the ICE facility.

The protests and demonstrations, according to the appeal, made it difficult to carry out immigration laws.

The appeal says the Department of Homeland Security sought assistance from the Department of War to safeguard federal personnel and facilities in Oregon, and President Trump granted the request, directing the federalization of a small number of Oregon National Guard members.

The administration claims that the President's determination was lawful under laws that allow federalization when regular forces are unable to execute U.S. laws or when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion.

However, the district court's ruling, presided over by Judge Karin J. Immergut, permanently barred the administration from deploying troops to Portland, stating that the ""facts on the ground"" showed the protests did not prevent federal agents from carrying out immigration laws and their duties.

Portland Police only designated a gathering at the ICE facility as a riot on one occasion this summer, in June.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield responded to the administration's appeal on Friday, stating, ""The district court’s ruling made it clear that this administration must be accountable to the truth and to the rule of law."" Rayfield's office has not yet responded to the Trump administration's motion to stay.

And last week, Lewis & Clark College law professor Tung Yin commented on the ruling, saying, ""It's not that they can't win an appeal, but they would have to get a legal rule that essentially says, the president's determination is conclusive when the president says, my people can't enforce federal law.""

The Trump administration is requesting an administrative stay by Nov. 21 to prevent the defederalization of Oregon Guard members, citing harms and alteration of the status quo caused by the injunction. The appeal contends that threats against federal officials are often crimes and that officials cannot know in advance which threats will materialize.",https://kfoxtv.com/resources/media/1583f77f-2d26-431a-8e45-c2ead2d0f231-ICEPortlandDMorrison_21.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:56:46.078916

He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” he explained.
“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said.
As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center for assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer.
KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.","A 45-year-old Riverside County man, who reportedly works as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, is accused of illegally detaining a minor at gunpoint while off duty last week.

The Nov. 10 incident, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, played out at around 10:30 pm outside a home in the 32000 block of Daybrook Terrance in Temecula.

Lawyer Greg Kirakosian, who represents the boy and his family, told KTLA that the 17-year-old was driving home after dropping a friend off down the street when he saw the suspect, identified by investigators as Gerardo Rodriguez, pointing a gun at his vehicle, demanding he pull over.

“In the moment, I think he was just scared for his life. He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” he explained. “Then that same person came up to his driver’s side door and pulled him out at gunpoint.”

In footage of the incident obtained by KTLA, the 45-year-old is seen pulling a gun from his waistband as he walked up the street, pointing it at the teen’s truck and demanding he stop the vehicle while reportedly brandishing his badge.

“Freeze, police,” Rodriguez shouts. “Put the car in f****** park. Get out of the car. Turn it off, get out. You’re speeding in the f****** neighborhood. Come over here, sit down, get your a** down. You have a driver’s license?”

The 45-year-old, who is known to residents on the street as an ICE agent and also reportedly told the boy he worked for ICE, then began interrogating the Mexican American teen, asking him who he was, where he is from and demanding documentation, eventually drawing the attention of others who live on the street.

“By the time our client’s parents showed up, the neighbors had essentially come to the rescue and stopped him from doing what he was doing, calming him down and forcing him to go back inside his house and leaving the boy alone,” Kirakosian said.

The teenager’s parents had been alerted by a friend to what was happening, prompting them to rush over from their home with their son’s passport, fearing the incident could be some type of immigrant enforcement operation. They called 911 after they arrived.

Responding deputies turned the investigation over to RCSD’s Investigation Bureau, who contacted Rodriguez later that same night, arrested him and conducted a search of his house “where evidence related to the investigation was collected,” the department said in a news release.

“I think right now a lot of Mexican Americans, whether they are in a situation like this or not, who are angry upset and scared and this just really came close to home for them,” Kirakosian said when asked how the family was doing after the harrowing ordeal.

The L.A.-based civil rights attorney added that he believes the 45-year-old has become emboldened by what he does and sees other ICE agents doing on a day-to-day basis.

“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said. “I don’t know how much worse the situation is going to get, honestly. This kid could’ve been shot.”

This incident comes after several others where federal law enforcement agents have pulled their firearms on citizens.

On Nov. 9, video captured a ICE officer pointing his gun at a woman behind him in an intersection in Santa Ana, which was witnessed by a Fullerton police officer returning from the Santa Ana Jail facility, who refused to get involved if no crime had been committed.

Federal officials later claimed the woman was following the agent.

On Oct. 30, a 24-year-old Ontario man was shot by a federal agent who was reportedly trying to notify officers involved in an enforcement operation that there were children across the street.

In that instance, federal officials claimed the agent fired “defensive shots” while fearing the 24-year-old was attempting to run over officers.

As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center for assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer. Jail records show he posted bond and was released the same night.

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it,” and for the last decade the battle over immigration has been turbocharged. Now’s the time to step back and realize this isn’t a so much contest between how many immigrants the country wants or needs or the cultural impacts of mass migration so much as an issue of control of immigration. But under the Constitution, Congress, accountable to the voters, ultimately controls.

“Control Is a Tough Nut”

The newly installed Pope, Leo XIV, was recently asked to name his favorite movies.

Of the four he named, three were what you would expect the pontiff to enjoy: The Sound of Music (1965), a semibiographical account of a novice nun who leaves the cloister to care for a large, motherless family; It’s a Wonderful Life (1946), a tale of despair, self-sacrifice, and redemption; and Life Is Beautiful (1997), a story about a father who “uses a perfect mixture of will, humor and imagination to protect his son from the dangers around” the concentration camp to which they’ve been sent.

The fourth, however, is telling: Ordinary People (1980). If you’ve never seen it, the IMDb summary tells you all you need to know: “The accidental death of the older son of an affluent family deeply strains the relationships among the bitter mother, the good-natured father and the guilt-ridden younger son.”

It’s dark, and even the “happy” ending leaves little resolution as the mother (Beth Jarret, played by Mary Tyler Moore), leaves the son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), and father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland) just when Conrad accepts that he’s not to blame for his brother’s death.

That it beat Raging Bull for the best picture Oscar tells you more about America pre-Reagan than it does about artistic merit, but in any event, the whole movie is about control: Beth can’t accept that fate derailed her overweening efforts to create the perfect family, and responds by trying to control her husband and son.

The story begins after Conrad attempts suicide, and his parents send him to a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch). Berger eventually gains Conrad’s trust and tells the doctor he wants to be “more in control”. Berger admits that he’s “not big on control”, but agrees to help because “control is a tough nut”.

That the spiritual leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics would “enjoy” a grueling, quarter-century-old flick about the challenges of control says much about the burdens of the papacy but also a lot about the world outside of the Vatican’s walls.

Because much of our current angst stems from a belief that we are increasingly losing control.

Few can understand, let alone control, AI; it promises incomparable change, but we don’t know whether it will be calamity (The Terminator) or some form of salvation (Interstellar).

AI is also driving stock markets, but is it a bubble or a boom? Having lived through downturns in 1987, 2000, and 2008, I have my thoughts, but regardless, it’s the difference between eating chateaubriand at retirement or roasting squirrels over a trash-can fire, though there’s little we can do to control it.

Why are Democratic Socialists like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on the ascent even though we all know how socialism ends? Because Gotham is the most chaotic place in the world, both good and bad, and he promised to control it in favor of the proletariat.

Or consider Covid, when billions sacrificed their liberties for what they were told was the common good. “Covid Karens” who snitched on those who broke nonsensical rules were the spiritual heirs to the hundreds of thousands of East German civilians who were “occasional” Stasi informants, in that while neither could control their government, at least they could control their neighbors.

Shifting Fronts in the Battle over Control of Immigration

Then, there’s immigration.

The battle for control over the subject has stirred up popular resentment in the Western world, with clashes following the “Unite the Kingdom” march in London in September and hundreds of thousands taking to German streets to protest a proposed bill to crack down on illegal migrants in February.

Each is a physical manifestation of a political opinion — both for and against immigration — in the face of a government and “elite” that doesn’t share the protesters’ views — in other words, a battle for control.

The First Trump Term

Nowhere, however, have the fronts in that battle shifted as they have in the United States since Donald Trump descended the golden escalator at his eponymous NYC tower on June 16, 2015, to announce his campaign for the 2016 presidential election.

In a seemingly unscripted address that day, he attacked one of his Republican opponents, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), as “weak on immigration”, promised to end President Obama’s “illegal executive order on immigration” (DACA), asked “when do we beat Mexico at the border?”, and vowed to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and “have Mexico pay for that wall”.

Trump’s campaign was derided as a ”publicity stunt” until his opponents realized — too late — he was serious, but more importantly that he had tapped into a desire by Americans to control immigration.

His rhetoric alone quickly triggered a “Trump effect”, with an initial downturn in illegal entries at the Southwest border once he took office and a slowing of new migration over his first term.

The cartels and smugglers quickly reasserted control, however, as waves of illegal migrants (mostly families) exploited loopholes the new president was powerless to fix without congressional help, and immigrant advocates vied for control using the courts to stymie Trump’s immigration and border policies.

Trump, likely to his detriment, failed to highlight his immigration successes on the 2020 presidential campaign trail, even as a largely supine media echoed claims by his opponent, Joe Biden, that the incumbent “separated children from their parents at the border”.

“Biden’s Border Fiasco”

Once Biden took over, the gains of Trump I were lost, as the border descended into disaster in response to the new president’s “catch-and-release” policies and major cities began falling off fiscal cliffs in an effort to accommodate hundreds of thousands of improperly released migrants.

Biden’s supporters in the press downplayed the burgeoning migrant tsunami and did their candidate no favors once the sheer magnitude of the surge made its way into the public sphere. By August 2022, the editors at Bloomberg Opinion were warning that “Biden’s Border Fiasco Is Expanding”, while calling for “leadership” on the issue.

That leadership never appeared, and a last-ditch effort to blame Trump’s opposition to a deeply flawed and poorly understood 2024 “Senate border bill” fell on the deaf ears of an electorate that wanted control of the border, to the degree it became increasingly dour on “immigration” itself.

Trump redux found his old immigration script, and though Democratic party elites swapped Biden for his Vice President, Kamala Harris, as their 2024 presidential candidate, Harris couldn’t escape the stigma of having been the president’s “border czar”.

“Voters Were Fed Up Over Immigration”

Consequently, as a New York Times headline the day after the 2024 election explained: “Voters Were Fed Up Over Immigration. They Voted for Trump.”

In other words, the electorate wanted control over the entry and removal of aliens in the United States, and when they didn’t get it from one side, they picked the other.

The Trump II administration has viewed the election as a mandate to undo the harm of the Biden years by answering “mass migration” with “mass deportations”.

That has required a huge influx of additional manpower and detention resources for ICE and CBP, which Congress provided in H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”.

It has also prompted a reassessment of whether aliens who entered illegally but are present in the United States are eligible for bond.

Trump’s DHS has pointed to the detention mandates for alien “applicants for admission”, i.e., aliens who haven’t been formally admitted, in section 235(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in concluding illegal entrants present here cannot be released on bond, and DOJ’s appellate immigration tribunal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has agreed.

Immigrants and their advocates have pushed back against that interpretation in demanding bond release hearings, and as Politico reported on October 31, “More than 100 federal judges have now ruled at least 200 times that” the administration’s interpretation of the law is in error.

You can add Judge Jeffrey Cummings of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to that list. In a November 13 order, he directed the government to release 615 aliens who were detained during DHS’s Chicago-area “Operation Midway Blitz” on bond under a different provision, section 236(a), of the INA.

Advocates’ efforts to retake control of the immigration issue through the courts harken back to Trump I, with the differences being (1) Trump II has “flooded the zone” by engaging in different enforcement efforts in various ways, and (2) this time around, Trump rolled out his initiatives quickly, giving his DOJ time to seek judicial review (Judge Cummings’ order is on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, for example).

The Protestors’ Veto

But not all of the opposition has involved legal niceties. Protestors countered Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts more directly, impeding ICE from arresting aliens by blocking immigration facilities, ramming federal vehicles, and (allegedly) doxxing officers. DHS claims there’s been an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against ICE, and a tenfold increase in assaults.

I’ve omitted the assassination attempts at immigration facilities in Dallas, Alvarado, and McAllen, all in Texas.

The protestors’ implicit argument isn’t that certain aliens should be protected from deportation, but that no alien should be removed, so long as they have made it here.

On November 12, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) joined that chorus, issuing a “Special Message” on immigration, which stated: “We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people.”

To say many of the factual assertions they make in that message, including their plaints about “the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care” and “that some immigrants in the United States have arbitrarily lost their legal status”, beg the question would be an understatement. The letter is replete with talking points, not facts, and many are questionable if not wrong.

Regardless, it raises the question of how the bishops think the Trump administration should respond to the millions of aliens who came here illegally between 2021 and January 20, 2025.

The bishops make clear that they “advocate for a meaningful reform of our nation’s immigration laws and procedures” (read: “amnesty”), but they never say what they would reform, how that reform would work, or whom they would allow to stay.

In any event, if amnesty were popular, it would have happened under Obama when Democrats held the House and White House and had a supermajority in the Senate. It’s beyond a non-starter after the past four years of non-enforcement.

And while the bishops “recognize that nations have a responsibility to regulate their borders and establish a just and orderly immigration system for the sake of the common good”, they never explain how the United States can fulfill that obligation without deporting those here illegally.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Capitol-social.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 03:56:19.817261

Clergy representing Catholic, Jewish, Episcopal and interfaith coalitions gathered Friday morning to demand an end to workplace raids and mass detentions. The protest escalated when officers ordered the group to disperse; several faith leaders refused, kneeling in the street in prayer before being taken into custody, according to Reuters. Organizers say at least one of the arrestees was a 72-year-old priest who has participated in immigration vigils for more than a decade.

The arrests come just weeks after a separate incident in Chicago in which a Methodist minister was struck in the head by a pepper-ball projectile during a police response to a protest outside a migrant intake center. Earlier this fall, a group of faith leaders including priests and nuns were detained after being refused admission inside to administer communion, an essential element of a Catholic’s faith life. Immigrant-rights groups say the pattern reflects a broader escalation in the policing of clergy-led actions, many of which have historically been peaceful.

Legal experts note that faith-led protests often invoke First Amendment protections for both free exercise of religion and free assembly, making these clashes particularly sensitive. While authorities argue that restrictions are tied to safety and facility security, civil liberties groups warn that aggressive enforcement, especially when directed at clergy, can have a chilling effect on religious and political expression.

ICE officials said the Broadview arrests occurred only after “multiple lawful orders were ignored.” Organizers counter that civil disobedience is central to their mission and vowed to continue holding weekly vigils outside the facility, calling the arrests a sign that we are in “a spiritual emergency.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2235816386.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:54.801252

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday announced Operation Southern Spear, aimed at what he calls ""narco-terrorists"" who are allegedly bringing illegal drugs into the country. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Saturday also announced it was launching Operation Charlotte's Web — matching the name of the classic children's book — in Charlotte, N.C., to target undocumented immigrants.

""There is no parent who has read Charlotte's Web to a child who cannot be outraged by this,"" Dan Shapiro, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Israel from 2011 to 2017, wrote on X.

""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,"" McLaughlin said in the statement. ""There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens. President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't.""

NPR also reached out to the Defense Department for comment but has not received a response.

Here is what to know about military operation names.

Naming military operations is not new. Neither is criticism of names

Code names for U.S. military operations date back to the World War II era and began for security reasons, according to Lt. Col. Gregory C. Sieminski in the article ""The Art of Naming Operations,"" in The US Army War College Quarterly: Parameters. The names were based on colors at first, such as Operation Indigo, but as World War II spread, military officials switched to a name-based system that included projects and locations.

After the Vietnam War, military officials started using a computer system to reconcile nicknames and code words, called the Code Word, Nickname, and Exercise Term System, or NICKA.

Routine military exercises use the NICKA system for naming operations, according to Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Highly visible operations generally get two-word names chosen outside the system, such as operations Just Cause in Panama, Iraqi Freedom, and Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Cancian told NPR.

""The ones that are chosen are chosen for a reason to project a message,"" Cancian told NPR. ""So, going back to Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, the message is freedom. With the recent ones, Midnight Hammer and Southern Spear, the message is lethality.""

Although DHS is not considered part of the U.S. military, using the name ""Charlotte's Web"" could also have been chosen because ""you've got the spider's web that catches people,"" but it could also be the administration trying to be ""tongue in cheek,"" he continued.

And other military operations have received backlash and criticism in the past, including what is now known as Operation Enduring Freedom. It was first called Operation Infinite Justice, but was changed after backlash that it was offensive to Muslims.

""The fact that these names get scrutiny is not unusual,"" Cancian said. ""Now, I think in this case, given the administration's aggressive rhetoric, I think that inspires maybe pushback, but it's not unusual that names get a lot of scrutiny.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x576+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2F23%2Fa86dcca248fc8f30447dbf9531f4%2Fgettyimages-2244880522.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:57.365321

Mahmood's torrent of new policy announcements in recent days are certainly bold - from limiting refugees to temporary stays, to overhauling human rights law to help increase deportations, and threatening countries with visa bans unless they accept the return of criminals and illegal immigrants.

But the plans are controversial too. The Refugee Council, which supports asylum-seekers, says making refugee status temporary is both ""highly impractical"" as well as ""inhumane"".

The home secretary's team are delighted at the newspaper headlines and TV coverage their announcements have secured in recent days, yet they know that was the easy bit.

Persuading Labour MPs from all wings of the party to vote en masse for the plans is a far bigger challenge.

Backbench frustration over winter fuel payments and welfare reform led to embarrassing government U-turns. Will restive Labour MPs try to shift government policy yet again?

That may depend on whether a politician's constituency is under threat from Reform UK and Conservatives on the right, or the Liberal Democrats and Greens on the left.

Some ministers are already raising concerns about Mahmood's proposals in private, and sceptical MPs have started to speak out in public.

Rachael Maskell, a prominent critic of the government's botched welfare reforms, told me many of her colleagues are ""seriously concerned"".

She said the government is going in ""completely the wrong direction"" on immigration and its plans to change how human rights law is applied in the UK are a ""step too far"".

Another sceptical Labour MP, Brian Leishman, told me he had ""big reservations"" about the proposals, and cautioned ministers against ""trying to copy Farage and Reform who only want to demonise people"".

To minimise the prospect of parliamentary opposition, Mahmood has been meeting groups of Labour MPs in recent weeks to make what her allies call ""the persuasive moral case for reform"".

But privately they concede that it will be a difficult balance.

Partly because many in Labour are uncomfortable with both these policies and the accompanying rhetoric.

Both the Conservatives and Reform can sense those tensions and both are trying to capitalise on them.

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage even put out a statement to say something he knows Labour MPs won't like - ""The home secretary sounds like a Reform supporter"".

Farage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch both doubt these plans will even get through the Commons.

The government is billing these changes as the most significant reforms to the asylum system since World War Two.

Oxford University's Migration Observatory says Mahmood's overhaul will make the UK's immigration system amongst the strictest countries in Europe.

But that doesn't mean the number of small boat arrivals will come down.

""This won't be the silver bullet and I think the government recognises that"", argues Dr Peter Walsh, a senior researcher at the organisation.

""It is taking a broader approach, focusing on enforcement and return deals. Will people know about restrictions enough to deter them? We will have to wait and see.""

Reducing ""pull"" factors and making the UK less attractive to migrants is a massive long-term battle.

In this fight the government is up against sophisticated people-smuggling gangs who have shown they can adapt fast.

The home secretary will be hoping her ""throw the kitchen sink at it"" approach gradually reduces arrivals and increases deportations.

Mahmood believes community cohesion across the country depends on it.

But so does her future and that of her government.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04d7/live/88733380-c395-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:58:44.172718

Many of those arrested have reported encountering Vietnamese officials inside jails or immigration detention facilities and during check-in meetings with Thai immigration authorities.
Vietnamese Authorities Harassing Refugees in Thailand Several Hmong and Montagnard refugees who were held in Thai immigration detention in February through May, as well as refugees who spoke with detainees held there through August, said that Thai authorities allow Vietnamese police to visit detainees.
They’ll tell the Thai police to arrest us.” In April, Vietnamese police pulled aside some Montagnard men during their check-in sessions with Thai immigration authorities.
Some former detainees said that during visits to Thai detention, Vietnamese officials said that they had requested that Thai immigration authorities continue their detention until they agreed to return to Vietnam.","Increased cooperation between Thai and Vietnamese authorities is putting Vietnamese refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand at heightened risk of forcible return to Vietnam, Human Rights Watch said last Friday (14 November). By facilitating Vietnamese cross-border abuses, known as transnational repression, Thai authorities are violating international refugee law protections.

Thai police have carried out several large-scale operations in 2025 detaining scores of Vietnamese nationals, many of whom are recognized by the United Nations as refugees and asylum seekers. Many of those arrested have reported encountering Vietnamese officials inside jails or immigration detention facilities and during check-in meetings with Thai immigration authorities.

“Vietnamese exiles are facing increased insecurity in Thailand,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Thai authorities should immediately stop detaining refugees and stop cooperating with Vietnamese police seeking their return.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 34 Vietnamese refugees and asylum seekers in Bangkok from July through October 2025, including 7 people previously involved in human rights activism in Vietnam, 3 relatives of current political prisoners, as well as over 20 ethnic Montagnards and Hmong facing persecution in Vietnam for their religious beliefs or involvement in protests. Nearly all have been recognized as refugees by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) or are registered with the UN as asylum seekers and are awaiting interviews to determine their status.

Most of the exiled Vietnamese interviewed said fears of arrest, abduction, or extradition to Vietnam have grown in the past two years due to increased visits by Vietnamese authorities to Thai immigration detention centers. They also cited the April 2023 abduction of dissident journalist Duong Van Thai, 42, a UNHCR-registered refugee who had fled Vietnam in 2019 and was awaiting resettlement to a third country. Unidentified men forcibly took him to Vietnam, and in late October 2024, after a closed one-day trial, a Vietnamese court sentenced him to 12 years in prison for publishing information “aimed at opposing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.” Exiles’ apprehension increased further after Thai authorities, assisted by Vietnamese security personnel, arrested the dissident Y Quynh Bdap in June 2024. The Vietnamese government has labeled Bdap’s human rights group, Montagnards Stand for Justice, as a “terrorist” group.

In 2025, Thai police have carried out multiple operations targeting Vietnamese exiles, including in February, March, April, July, and October. Many of those arrested are ethnic Montagnards or Hmong from Vietnam’s Central Highlands, most of whom are recognized by UNHCR as refugees or asylum seekers with applications in process. Several Montagnards and Hmong detained in February through April gave consistent accounts after their release of Vietnamese police in Thai facilities pressing them to agree to return to Vietnam and later harassing them during check-in sessions with Thai immigration authorities.

Many refugees said Vietnamese police had visited their relatives in Vietnam in the last year, telling them that the police had located their relatives in Thailand and were arranging to have them returned.

Several human rights groups in Thailand have interviewed detainees and released exiles who corroborate these findings and have sent private reports to UN officials with allegations about cases of abuse.

Thai police regularly detain UNHCR-recognized refugees—including from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar—and hold them until they pay a bail bond, which most refugees and immigration advocates consider to be bribes. Human Rights Watch reported in July that Thai police routinely arrest and solicit bribes from Myanmar asylum seekers and migrants. Another Human Rights Watch report documented Thai authorities assisting foreign governments to target refugees.

The Thai government is obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, or non-return, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture or other serious ill-treatment, a threat to life, or other comparable serious human rights violations. Refoulement is prohibited by the UN Convention Against Torture, to which Thailand is a party, as well as customary international law. The prohibition on refoulement is incorporated in Thailand’s 2023 Act on Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearances.

Vietnam and Thailand appear to have agreed to cooperate more closely and exchange information about Vietnamese refugees, especially those in detention, since early 2024 when the two countries began negotiating an extradition treaty. In May 2025, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Thailand’s then-Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra signed a Comprehensive Agreement in which they “agreed to enhance legislative and judicial cooperation and committed to effectively implementing signed agreements between the two countries on preventing and combating crime, transferring sentenced persons, and cooperating in the enforcement of penal sentences.”

In July, several UN human rights experts sent letters to the governments of Vietnam and Thailand requesting information about many of these cases. The UN experts stated that “[t]here are concerns that the Government of Viet Nam may be exchanging information with the Government of Thailand to identify Vietnamese Montagnard refugees in Thailand for their possible forced repatriation to Viet Nam, including those recognized as refugees by the UNHCR and being considered for resettlement in third countries.”

The experts also expressed alarm about the reported incidents of “reprisals and intimidation” against exile human rights defenders in Thailand and “the undue restrictions” imposed on diaspora organizations, which they determined were “designed to further discourage cooperation with the United Nations” and prevent people from providing information to the UN.

Countries that have previously resettled Vietnamese refugees, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, and other European states, should consider increasing their resettlement of those at serious risk, Human Rights Watch said. The US has all but suspended refugee resettlement programs, including for refugees in Thailand.

“Thailand is now cooperating and is complicit in Vietnam’s transnational repression of exiles in Thailand,” Sifton said. “Outside governments need to expedite resettlement of refugees at risk in Thailand and urge the government to prevent Vietnam’s interference in refugee cases.”

Thailand-Vietnam Cooperation, Pressure on Refugees

Immigration Raids

Thai authorities for years have carried out sweeps to detain migrants and immigrants, many of them refugees or asylum seekers from Myanmar, Vietnam, and elsewhere in the region. Those arrested are typically charged for entering Thailand illegally or working without a valid visa. Asylum seekers and refugees registered with UNHCR are generally not authorized to work under Thai law.

Those arrested are usually held short term in Thai jails. Some obtain release after paying what authorities call fines, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 Thai baht (US$30 to $150) each. Detainees unable to pay or otherwise obtain release from jail are then usually transferred to immigration detention centers, where they are held until they can post a bond, typically 50,000 baht (US$1,500), and demonstrate that they have obtained a Thai guarantor. In some other cases, they are deported or later resettled as refugees to third countries.

On February 23, 2025, in Nonthaburi province, just outside Bangkok, Thai police detained over 60 Montagnard people, including several UNHCR-recognized refugees, according to witnesses and UN reporting. Most were convicted of “illegal entry and stay” and sent to jail. Detainees subsequently were placed in immigration detention centers, women with children were transferred to an immigration detention center in Bang Khen in Bangkok, while others were sent to the Suan Phlu center. Police in May also detained several other Montagnard refugees and asylum seekers in and around Bangkok.

In other raids in March, April, and July, Thai police arrested dozens of Hmong refugees and asylum seekers. Some were able to pay fines or post bail to be released, but many Hmong people detained from early 2025 remained in detention as of early November.

In a more recent operation in Nonthaburi on October 29, Thai police detained 70 Montagnards in an early morning raid. According to local sources, those detained included 42 people whom UNHCR had determined were refugees or who were awaiting processing of their asylum claims. Several had been detained in the earlier raids.

The authorities soon released 20 of them, who had previously been released on bail, and took the rest to the Suan Phlu immigration detention facility. A member of the Montagnard community in Nonthaburi said that the next day, the Thai authorities fined the remaining detainees 5,000 Thai baht (US$150) each, indicating that they would be released on payment of the fine.

Threats to Families in Vietnam

Human Rights Watch interviewed over a dozen men and two women in Thailand from the Montagnard community in Bangkok who had fled Vietnam at various times from 2015 to 2023. Several said that government officials had regularly visited the exiles’ relatives in their home districts in Vietnam’s Central Highlands in recent months and urged them to tell their exiled family members to return. A Montagnard man in his 30s said police went to his village in February and told his parents that they knew where her son was and that they should tell him to come home, saying that if he returned, “there will be less trouble.”

Some refugees said that relatives arrested during the immigration raid in Nonthaburi province in April and May told them by telephone that Thai authorities had allowed two Vietnamese police officials to interrogate them in detention soon after their arrest. The police, their relatives said, threatened several of them with forced repatriation, demanding that they sign documents in which they would agree to be returned. Some said that while they were detained, Vietnamese police visited their families in Vietnam and attempted to coerce them to convince their relatives to return.

Several Hmong refugees reported similar incidents and trends. A Hmong woman, whose husband was a leader of an unregistered Christian church and who had fled with him and the rest of their family in 2022, said the police now regularly visit her parents and parents-in-law in Vietnam.

“They came on August 1 [2025] and told them, ‘We have an agreement with the Thai police to bring him back,’” referring to her husband, who had been in Thai immigration detention. They told them, “We’re going to put him in jail for his anti-state activities.” The woman said she believed the police were suggesting that if his parents and parents-in-law helped convince her husband to return voluntarily, he would be rewarded with some leniency.

Nguyen Viet Dung, a former political prisoner convicted in 2018 for conducting “propaganda against the state,” who fled Vietnam after his release in late 2024, said that his relatives in Vietnam had faced growing intimidation. He provided multiple examples of Vietnamese police visiting his parents and sister in 2025. He expressed concern that Vietnamese authorities would seek his arrest in Thailand because he was on still on parole from his 2018 conviction when he fled Vietnam, making his departure illegal.

An asylum seeker who fled in 2023, Hoang Hao, whose brother Hoang Duc Binh is a political prisoner in Vietnam, said the authorities have frequently harassed his sister in Vietnam. He said they press her to speak with him by telephone and urge him to return, while suggesting that they will otherwise compel Thailand to have him returned. Two other Vietnamese refugees gave similar accounts.

Vietnamese Authorities Harassing Refugees in Thailand

Several Hmong and Montagnard refugees who were held in Thai immigration detention in February through May, as well as refugees who spoke with detainees held there through August, said that Thai authorities allow Vietnamese police to visit detainees. With the involvement of Thai officials, they have repeatedly sought to convince or compel detainees to sign documents agreeing to return to Vietnam, which detainees have refused. And in March 2024, several Montagnards said Vietnamese police visited their community near Bangkok accompanied by Thai police, pressured them to return to Vietnam, and questioned them about other Montagnards who they said were wanted for arrest in Vietnam.

Several Montagnards described their interactions with Vietnamese police in detention or during check ins. “First they say they’ll be more lenient if you agree to return,” one said. “Of course we don’t believe them. They have been harassing our community for a long time.” Another said a Vietnamese police officer pulled him aside from the others when he had his monthly check-in with Thai immigration officials: “‘You’ve been here [in Thailand] for a long time, and still not been resettled to the United States. When are you ever going to get to go?’ They said, ‘If you stay here and the government here makes problems for you, then you can call us, and we’ll help you.’ The meaning to me was a threat. They’ll tell the Thai police to arrest us.”

In April, Vietnamese police pulled aside some Montagnard men during their check-in sessions with Thai immigration authorities. “They took some of us aside and yelled at us,” said a Montagnard Christian. He said that the police officer threatened them: “All Montagnards here are terrorists. We’ll tell them [Thai police] that you’re terrorists, and if you worship together [in church], the Thai police are to arrest you.”

After the arrests of scores of Montagnards in February, immigration lawyers successfully posted bail for most detainees, but Thai authorities rejected bail for two of them, Y Phuong Enuol and Y Duong Bkrong, reportedly because of warrants for their arrest in Vietnam, said advocates familiar with their case. UN rights experts noted in their July letter to the Thai government that Vietnamese officials in March visited these detainees, who, the experts said, “have expressed a fear of persecution by the Vietnamese authorities.”

Separately, Thai authorities in February through April arrested over a dozen Hmong men registered as refugees with UNHCR. Family members and rights advocates said most were affiliated with the Hmong Human Rights Coalition, a civil society group that monitors and reports on human rights violations against Hmong people in Vietnam. Vietnamese officials visited these detainees on multiple occasions in late April and early May at the Suan Phlu immigration detention center. They encouraged detainees to voluntarily return to Vietnam and to sign forms to facilitate their repatriation. None agreed. Most of the men remain in detention as of November 2025.

Thai authorities have detained Giang A Au, a Hmong Christian pastor who fled Vietnam with his family 10 years ago, with his wife and daughters several times, including as recently as April. His son, Giang A Nanh, 25, told Human Rights Watch in August that his father called him from immigration detention in early May and told him that he had been visited by a Vietnamese official, who identified himself as “Mr. Hung,” who had the father’s Vietnamese passport and national ID card, confiscated by Thai authorities during his arrest.

Giang A Nanh said that Hung told his father: “You and your family have been in Thailand for nearly 10 years. Vietnam has changed a lot. The United States has also closed its doors to refugees. There is no place left for you to go. Now you must return to Vietnam.” Giang A Au refused, and Hung said: “Remember, you have children waiting for you outside. You also have relatives in Vietnam, we know them all.” Hung then said that even if Giang A Au obtained bail, Thai police would rearrest him and that he would not be able to work in Thailand. If he tried to work, Hung said, Thai police would arrest him again.

Human Rights Watch learned in November that Thai authorities in late September had arrested the son, Giang A Nanh, and sent him to a Thai jail. After a month, the authorities transferred him to Thai immigration detention, where he has been held with his father and mother along with other Vietnamese detainees. His younger sisters, 18 and 21, are now the only adult caregivers of his younger brothers, ages 11 and 14.

The wives of five other detained Hmong activists said that their husbands had told them by telephone in April through July that Vietnamese security officials had visited them in detention and attempted to compel them to sign papers agreeing to be repatriated to Vietnam. The men refused, aware that the government considers them to be dissidents who have broken the law.

Vietnam state-run media have repeatedly broadcast reports that Hmong dissidents who left Vietnam without permission and criticized the government were criminals. A June 2024 broadcast on the government ANTV State Security Television featured a report on some of the 13 Hmong men arrested in March 2025, including Ma Seo Chang, Ma A Dinh, and Ma A Sinh.

The report said they had “illegally emigrated” to Thailand and claimed that the men were “defaming the policies of the [Communist] Party and Vietnamese State, fabricating false accusations about democracy, human rights, or religious freedom is the way these expatriates make a living.” Ma A Dinh and Ma A Sinh, who later obtained bail, said that the government considers them and other Hmong men arrested in March “enemies of the state.” ANTV again focused on the three men in April 2025, just after their arrest in Thailand, and in July 2025, and mocked their views.

Another Hmong activist, Lu A Da, a coordinator with the Hmong Human Rights Coalition in Thailand who fled Vietnam in 2020, said that he also encountered Vietnamese authorities twice after he was arrested and placed in Thai immigration detention in December 2023. His arrest had occurred just two weeks after he had spoken virtually on a UN human rights panel addressing discrimination against Indigenous groups in Vietnam.

Lu A Da said a Vietnam police official visited him in detention and that the official’s attempts to pressure him suggested to him that the Vietnamese government had sought his arrest. The official attempted to convince him to return to Vietnam, saying he would quickly process paperwork before the upcoming Lunar New Year. Lu A Da said, “When I refused his offer, he threatened me, warning, ‘You may do whatever you want in Thailand, but think about your family in Vietnam,’ This was intended to intimidate me into stopping my human rights work.”

Immigration Detention as Possible Vietnamese Proxy Detention

Several refugees and immigration and human rights advocates in Bangkok expressed concern that the Vietnamese authorities effectively made use of Thailand’s immigration detention system to incarcerate and punish prominent Montagnard and Hmong exiles, as well as to exert pressure on them and their communities to return to Vietnam.

Some former detainees said that during visits to Thai detention, Vietnamese officials said that they had requested that Thai immigration authorities continue their detention until they agreed to return to Vietnam.

In at least one case, the Thai authorities rebuffed a Vietnamese government request after the UN intervened. Lu A Da, of the Hmong Human Rights Coalition in Thailand, said that Vietnamese authorities, after pressing him to return when he was in Thai detention in late 2023, were subsequently unable to have his detention extended, after the UN officials secured his release. The Vietnamese government then ramped up their public campaign against him and other Hmong exiles, labeling them criminals.",http://prachataienglish.com/sites/default/files/styles/super_cover_upload/public/files-super-cover/2025/2025-11/54889889535_9c9d08e8e8_k.jpg.webp?itok=YITPFM_p,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:42.188065

Steven Fazzari, the Bert A. and Jeanette L. Lynch Distinguished Professor of Economics, and Chris Varvares, the regional director for the Americas at the Economist Intelligence Unit and a WashU alumnus, were invited to discuss the impact of President Donald Trump’s economic policies.

The event, titled “High Stakes, Uncertain Gains: Trump’s Economic Experiment So Far,” was hosted by the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy. Both panelists invoked the Center’s late founder and namesake Murray Weidenbaum, a former WashU professor and economist who served in the Nixon and Reagan administrations.

“I think to a large extent, he would be appalled,” Fazzari said of Trump’s economic policies, adding that this year has seen the “most unusual” economic agenda of his lifetime.

Varvares identified some of the key areas of what he called a “smorgasbord” of economic policies pursued by the Trump administration, which included tariffs, immigration, industrial policy, energy production, and regulation reduction. He added that the administration’s proposed tariff rates would raise domestic prices and increase costs for Americans.

“It’s like a tax on consumers, because ultimately firms will pass [tariff costs] forward into final goods prices,” Varvares said. “And so it acts almost like a sales tax. It raises the cost to consumers.”

Both Varvares and Fazzari also attributed instability in the economy to the White House’s unpredictable announcements implementing and retracting various tariffs.

“The chaotic rollout of these tariffs has created a huge amount of uncertainty,” Varvares said.

Varvares said that the economic uncertainty produced by the administration is contributing to companies’ decreased investments and job offerings.

“If you drive into a fog bank, what’s the first thing you do? You slow down,” Varvares said. “And so that lack of visibility of exactly what was going to happen was anticipated to lead firms to pull back on investment, either scale back or delay decisions, but also to reduce hiring, not knowing exactly whether the demand was going to be there for their products.”

Varvares also criticized the White House for “strong-arming” private firms and foreign governments into increasing their investment in the United States.

“This is actually a type of governmental extortion where ‘If you want this lower tariff rate, you must invest in our country,’” Varvares said.

Varvarves did acknowledge the positive revenue effects of the tariffs, which he said could increase annual revenue for the federal government by as much as 300 billion dollars. He also said that while inflation had not increased as much as some expected after the tariff announcements, he still forecasted a bump in inflation in the next couple of financial quarters.

Fazzari said that a recession seemed likely earlier in the year after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, which the White House dubbed “Liberation Day.” He attributed the more modest economic damage so far to a lack of retaliation from other countries, with China being a notable exception, and the administration repeatedly cancelling its own tariffs after previous announcements.

“What [the tariffs] means in the long term could easily be that other countries say we really can’t rely on the United States, as we did before, and we should decouple our economy from the U.S.,” Fazzari said. “You see some of that already happening, but at least in the short term, we’ve seen less retaliation than we might have expected.”

Varvares pointed out that while one of the administration’s goals in implementing new tariffs has been to incentivize more domestic manufacturing, manufacturing jobs have decreased over the past few months. Fazzari said that advances in technology and automation will continue to reduce manufacturing jobs regardless of where products are produced.

While the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), previously spearheaded by Elon Musk, drew headlines earlier this year for its cuts to federal programs and jobs, Fazzari said that most of its efforts were “theater” that had little effect on the overall economy.

Both panelists also panned the administration’s interference in independent federal agencies. Varvares criticized Trump’s “jawboning” of the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and for threatening the independence of the Fed. Fazzari also expressed concern that Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after July jobs reports and revisions to previous reports indicated a weakening labor market.

“[McEntarfer was fired] for not any particular reason, except the president didn’t like the numbers,” Fazzari said. “That was controversial and upsetting to economists that really rely on good data coming out of these very professional institutions in the federal government that put together our data.”

Fazzari and Varvares both objected to the administration’s cuts to research and universities, saying that both are critical to producing new technologies that improve economic growth and productivity over time.

“It’s very disturbing in terms of the longer-run prospects to see the U.S. government cutting back on science and technology and hammering universities,” Fazzari said. “Universities are a source of a lot of the new ideas that find their way into new technologies and find their way into economic growth.”

Varvares added that the administration’s deportations and restrictive immigration practices would impede population growth and therefore slow future economic growth.

Fazzari noted that large investments in artificial intelligence have stimulated economic growth and financial markets, offsetting negative economic impacts from policies like tariffs.

“Without that, many analysts say the economy may well have been in a recession now, but we have this kind of offsetting effect that’s coming from the AI,” Fazzari said. “There’s, of course, a fear that’s a bubble. There’s a fear that that might all collapse and that we could have a problem.”

Despite their criticisms, both panelists emphasized the uncertainty around the future and that many of the administration’s economic policies will take time before we see their real effects.

“I think 44 years of economics, if it’s taught me anything, it’s that we have to be very humble in terms of what we can predict and what we can’t predict,” Fazzari said.",https://www.studlife.com/files/2025/11/trump-economic-by-Rachel-Benitez-Borrego-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:56:50.628595

The Guardian says the home secretary's plans to overhaul the asylum system have prompted ""significant unease"" among senior Labour aides and ministers, with at least one on ""resignation watch"". Party insiders have told the i Paper that the success - or otherwise - of the changes will determine whether or not Labour wins the next general election. The Times describes the plans as a ""significant escalation"" of government action against illegal immigration. But the Daily Mail claims that Labour backbenchers and left-wing lawyers are poised to defeat them.

The Sun's editorial also sounds a note of scepticism about the likely success of Shabana Mahmood's plans. It says they are ""doomed to failure unless she takes the only step that deep down she must know will end the crisis - quitting the flawed and outdated European Convention on Human Rights"". The Telegraph focuses on the government's plan to stop issuing UK visas to people from three African countries which refuse to take back failed asylum seekers. The paper says the bans mirror a policy introduced by Donald Trump, and could in the future be applied to Iran, Bangladesh, and Somalia.

There is still plenty of pre-Budget speculation. The Times claims a new tax will be levied on tourists, which will allow metropolitan mayors to raise hundreds of millions of pounds for local services. The Telegraph claims a tax on milkshakes is being lined up, to make the public healthier. The Financial Times thinks online sports gambling is in the chancellor's sights - but says that horseracing will be exempted.

The Mirror says all plaques bearing the name of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor have been removed from the Falkland Islands. It says he was once hailed as hero there, but he has now been ""erased"" because of his links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The Times thinks there are signs that striking resident doctors in England are turning against their union, the BMA. It quotes a letter to hospital chiefs from the NHS chief executive, which says ""there have been fewer doctors striking"" in this walkout than in any of the 12 previous rounds of industrial action. The BMA has said striking is a last resort.

The Texas National Guard members sent to Chicago were returning to their home states, two U.S. officials told ABC News on Saturday.

The federalized Guard troops arrived to the Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago in early October, but they never deployed operationally because of legal challenges that continue playing out in court.

The Texas Guard members had been activated on federal orders by President Donald Trump in early October and placed on an active duty Title 10 status.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's office shared the following statement with ABC7 Chicago Saturday evening:

""While there are reports the Texas guard is leaving, the Trump Administration is also saying they will keep federalizing national guards to ""ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence"" in cities.

""Illinois will continue fighting for our state sovereignty, protecting people's rights, and keeping our communities peaceful.

""And, as we have said since the beginning...

""No, the Trump Administration does not provide the Governor's office updates on military movements within our state. There has never been a serious willingness from the federal government to coordinate or cooperate with the state.""

DHS makes it easier for immigration agents to destroy records

The Department of Homeland Security’s new text preservation policy will reduce the number of records saved and make it harder to hold immigration officials accountable.

DHS recently submitted a court filing as part of a lawsuit brought by the watchdog group American Oversight, stating that it had deactivated its system that automatically preserved text messages. It now requires officials to take screenshots of their text messages, which leaves too much room for human error and doesn’t capture links or attachments.

Public records hand Justice Department, FBI two black eyes

The Justice Department’s case against former FBI director James Comey hinges in large part on an assertion that Comey authorized someone “at the FBI” to engage with the media about the bureau’s investigation into Hillary Clinton. Lawfare’s Anna Bower dug through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act records, recently released in response to a 2018 FOIA lawsuit brought by The Daily Caller and posted in the FBI’s online FOIA library, “The Vault,” and discovered evidence that appears to undermine Justice’s case against Comey. The public records show that the person “at the FBI” — Daniel Richman — wasn’t a bureau employee during the communications cited by prosecutors.

Considering the possible implications for the Comey case, my big question is: How long will it take FBI director Kash Patel, who is already allegedly furious that his public flight schedules revealed he was abusing government property to visit his girlfriend and visit a place called “Boondoggle Ranch,” to try and take down politically inconvenient documents from The Vault?",https://media.freedom.press/media/images/26250149848_380687e3a3_b.original.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 00:57:02.426748

Last month, about 200 federalized California National Guard soldiers were sent to Portland, while another 200 federalized Texas National Guard soldiers were sent to Chicago. All those soldiers will return, the official said.

In both cases, the White House had argued that the troops were being sent to ""protect federal assets and personnel,"" with the president invoking Title 10 of the federal code, which allows for its use if the president deems that ""there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.""

Federal judges, however — in response to lawsuits brought by city and state officials — had so far blocked federalized National Guard soldiers from actually being deployed on the streets of Portland and Chicago, keeping them in a kind of holding pattern while they awaited the legal wrangling of their cases to play out.

Federal agents visited his home and questioned family members.","CHICAGO -- Baltazar Enriquez starts most mornings with street patrols, leaving his home in Chicago’s Little Village on foot or by car to find immigration agents that have repeatedly targeted his largely Mexican neighborhood.

Wearing an orange whistle around his neck, the activist broadcasts his plans on Facebook.

“We don’t know if they’re going to come back. All we know is we’ve got to get ready,” he tells thousands of followers. “Give us any tips if you see any suspicious cars.”

Moments later, his phone buzzes.

As an unprecedented immigration crackdown enters a third month, a growing number of Chicago residents are fighting back against what they deem a racist and aggressive overreach of the federal government. The Democratic stronghold’s response has tapped established activists and everyday residents from wealthy suburbs to working class neighborhoods.

They say their efforts — community patrols, rapid responders, school escorts, vendor buyouts, honking horns and blowing whistles — are a uniquely Chicago response that other cities President Donald Trump has targeted for federal intervention want to model.

“The strategy here is to make us afraid. The response from Chicago is a bunch of obscenities and ‘no,’” said Anna Zolkowski Sobor, whose North Side neighborhood saw agents throw tear gas and tackle an elderly man. “We are all Chicagoans who deserve to be here. Leave us alone.”

Perhaps the clearest indicator of Chicago’s growing resistance is the sound of whistles.

Enriquez is credited with being among the first to introduce the concept. For months Little Village residents have used them to broadcast the persistent presence of immigration agents.

Furious blasts both warn and attract observers who record video or criticize agents. Arrests, often referred to as kidnappings because many agents cover their faces, draw increasingly agitated crowds. Immigration agents have responded aggressively.

Officers fatally shot one man during a traffic stop, while other agents use tear gas, rubber bullets and physical force. In early November, Chicago police were called to investigate shots fired at agents. No one was injured.

Activists say they discourage violence.

“We don’t have guns. All we have is a whistle,” Enriquez said. “That has become a method that has saved people from being kidnapped and unlawful arrest.”

By October, neighborhoods citywide were hosting so-called “Whistlemania” events to pack the brightly colored devices for distribution through businesses and free book hutches.

“They want that orange whistle,” said Gabe Gonzalez, an activist. “They want to nod to each other in the street and know they are part of this movement.”

Even with its 2.7 million people, Chicago residents like to say the nation’s third-largest city operates as a collection of small towns with Midwest sensibilities.

People generally know their neighbors and offer help. Word spreads quickly.

When immigration agents began targeting food vendors, Rick Rosales, enlisted his bicycle advocacy group Cycling x Solidarity. He hosted rides to visit street vendors, buying out their inventory to lower their risk while supporting their business.

Irais Sosa, co-founder of the apparel store Sin Titulo, started a neighbor program with grocery runs and rideshare gift cards for families afraid of venturing out.

“That neighborhood feel and support is part of the core of Chicago,” she said.

Enriquez’s organization, Little Village Community Council, saw its volunteer walking group which escorts children to school, grow from 13 to 32 students.

Many also credit the grassroots nature of the resistance to Chicago's long history of community and union organizing.

Trump's “border czar” Tom Homan said Chicago area residents were so familiar with their rights that making arrests during a different operation this year was difficult.

So when hundreds of federal agents arrived in September, activists poured energy into an emergency hotline that dispatches response teams to gather intel, including names of those detained. Volunteers would also circulate videos online, warn of reoccurring license plates or follow agents' cars while honking horns.

Protests have also cropped up quickly. Recently, high school students have launched walkouts.

Delilah Hernandez, 16, was among dozens from Farragut Career Academy who protested on a school day.She held a sign with the Constitution's preamble as she walked in Little Village. She knows many people with detained relatives.

“There is so much going on,” she said. “You feel it.”

More than 3,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws have been arrested during the so-called “ Operation Midway Blitz.” Dozens of U.S. citizens and protesters have been arrested with charges ranging from resisting arrest to conspiring to impede an officer.

The Department of Homeland Security defends the operation, alleging officers face hostile crowds as they pursue violent criminals.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who’s brought controversial tactics from operations in Los Angeles, called Chicago a “very non permissive environment.” He blamed sanctuary protections and elected leaders and defended agents’ actions, which are the subject of lawsuits.

But the operation's intensity could subside soon.

Bovino told The Associated Press this month that U.S. Customs and Border Protection will target other cities. He didn't elaborate, but Homeland Security officials confirmed Saturday that an immigration enforcement surge had begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

DHS, which oversees CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has said operations won't end in Chicago.

Alonso Zaragoza, with a neighborhood organization in the heavily immigrant Belmont Cragin, has printed hundreds of “No ICE” posters for businesses. Organizers in Oregon and Missouri have asked for advice.

“It’s become a model for other cities,” Zaragoza said. “We’re building leaders in our community who are teaching others.”

The turnout for virtual know-your-rights trainings offered by the pro-democracy group, States at the Core, doubled from 500 to 1,000 over a recent month, drawing participants from New Jersey and Tennessee.

“We train and we let go, and the people of Chicago are the ones who run with it,” said organizer Jill Garvey.

Enriquez completes up to three patrol shifts daily. Beyond the physical exertion, the work takes a toll.

Federal agents visited his home and questioned family members. A U.S. citizen relative was handcuffed by agents. His car horn no longer works, which he attributes to overuse.

“This has been very traumatizing,” he said. “It is very scary because you will remember this for the rest of your life.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/be83d873-9bdc-4037-8614-ae28334d13bc/wirestory_df72b2ba4e57befc085d692d227363b8_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:39.156637

Britain will overhaul its approach to human rights laws to make it easier to deport migrants who arrive in the country illegally as part of a major shake-up of asylum policy to be set out on Monday.

Interior minister Shabana Mahmood will outline changes to how the European Convention on Human Rights will be interpreted by courts, the government said.

""These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here,"" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.

In what the government claims to be the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

Britain's Labour government is taking a tougher stance as it struggles to curb clandestine migration, particularly via small boat crossings. Polls indicate immigration is a top concern of voters, and the populist Reform UK party has a commanding lead in polls.

TOUGHER STANCE

The government said Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a family life, was being misused by migrants to delay their removal from Britain.

It wants new laws to make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from ""using dubious connections to stay in the UK"".

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the ""definition of 'inhuman and degrading treatment' has expanded beyond what is reasonable.""

The government has said it wants to remain in the European Convention on Human Rights, amid calls from Reform and some in the Conservative Party for Britain to leave it altogether.

However, the government's harder stance on immigration has been criticised by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

""These proposals will punish people who've already lost everything,"" said Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture. ""Stripping away protections that prevent people being sent back to their torturers is not who we are as a country.""

Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said Britain was a ""fair, tolerant and compassionate country,"" but that in a more volatile world ""people need to know our borders are secure.""

The government added that there would also be reforms to streamline the appeals system, to fast-track the deportation of criminals and to prevent against misuse of modern slavery laws to impede removals.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:41.821972

Mahmood is to warn concerned Labour MPs that the changes are necessary to address public concern about the levels of migration as well as counterattacks from Reform UK.
The Conservatives have suggested the party could support the plans brought forward by Mahmood if she faces a rebellion from Labour backbenchers.","Shabana Mahmood has warned Labour MPs that “dark forces are stirring up anger” over migration, amid growing alarm among senior party figures over the most sweeping overhaul of refugee rights in a generation.

On Monday, Mahmood will announce controversial new laws to overhaul refugee status, which must be reassessed every two years, as well as curbing asylum appeals and toughening the approach to rights to family life.

The home secretary warned in an article for the Guardian that anger about illegal migration could turn on second-generation immigrants such as her and rupture community relations.

“I know that a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me,” she said.

But the Guardian understands the harshness of Mahmood’s plans has led to significant unease among senior Labour aides and ministers, with at least one on resignation watch. Two said they were particularly concerned about the plans to ramp up deportations of refugee families, including those with children.

Charities warned it would risk “another Windrush scandal” and leave refugees in near-permanent limbo, with children liable to be unrooted from schools and adults unable to build careers, and make integration harder.

The home secretary will announce three new safe routes for refugees to legally come to the UK from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Eritrea, but even the status of those refugees will be under constant review.

Mahmood confirmed on Sunday that refugees would be liable to be returned if their country was no longer deemed dangerous, with their status reviewed every 30 months, including families with young children in school.

The government will announce that it will legislate to toughen how courts apply the European convention on human rights (ECHR) regarding family life, enabling more deportation of people with family members still in the UK.

On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.

The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.

In her article for the Guardian, Mahmood said she knew the changes would “face opposition” but said the alternative would risk public support for all refugees collapsing.

“Dark forces are stirring up anger in this country, and seeking to turn that anger into hate. We must take the opportunity we have to stop that from happening. And I know we can,” she wrote.

“The true nature of this country is openness, tolerance and generosity. We want to provide sanctuary to those in danger. We want to be a Greater Britain, not a littler England. To do so, we must restore order and control.”

Mahmood will announce three “modest” routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan, Palestine or Eritrea to come if they are students and those seeking to work in certain professions, as well as those sponsored by community and voluntary organisations who support them when they arrive. Refugees arriving via those routes will not be given permanent settled status.

Other key measures to be announced on Monday include:

Restricting asylum seekers to one single appeal rather than different appeals on multiple grounds.

Creating a new body for fast-tracking cases for dangerous criminals and those with little hope of success.

Legislating to restrict last-minute modern slavery claims

Joining other countries in seeking reform of ECHR article 3 rights, to more narrowly define the risk of torture and degrading treatment.

Changing the Home Office’s duty to provide support to asylum seekers to a discretionary power, enabling them to potentially be removed from accommodation.

Several senior aides are understood to have severe reservations about how that would affect school-age children and MPs are understood to be particularly concerned about Ukrainian refugees, many of whom brought young children who have now fully integrated into British life.

“These sweeping changes will mean that a child who is settled at school, studying hard for their GCSEs, will be uprooted and forcibly removed, possibly being put in detention as part of that process,” the Refugee Council’s Enver Solomon said, likening it to how long-settled people were treated under the Windrush scandal.

Mahmood is also understood to be seeking to legislate to change the way the ECHR is interpreted by UK judges. Asylum seekers often use its provisions on right to family life in order to stay in the UK.

The effect of the changes could mean many more people are deported from the UK even if they have young children living here. Judges will be required to prioritise “public safety” over family rights. A Home Office source suggested this would be more likely to apply to extended family.

On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.

The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.

Mahmood is to warn concerned Labour MPs that the changes are necessary to address public concern about the levels of migration as well as counterattacks from Reform UK.

“Unless we act, we risk losing popular consent for having an asylum system at all. In a country that is seeing division stirred up on our streets, we will not bring unity unless we restore order to our borders,” she wrote in the Guardian.

“My goal is to ensure there are legal routes into this country for those who are truly fleeing peril, and for whom this is the first safe country they have encountered.”

The Home Office has briefed widely that Mahmood has been inspired by the Danish system, which has much tighter rules on family reunions as well as on refugee status.

Mahmood’s predecessor, Yvette Cooper, temporarily suspended new applications in September from a family reunion route that allowed those granted asylum in the UK to bring their family.

Home Office sources have suggested the asylum changes will have far wider effects than anything brought in by the Conservatives.

Almost 40,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats to claim asylum in the UK so far this year and the number of asylum applications in the UK is at a record high. Government figures show 111,084 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to June 2025.

Both the Conservatives and Reform UK have said they would leave the ECHR in order to undertake more severe measures to cut migration. Mahmood has said she will not leave the ECHR, but there are likely to be significant legal challenges to what she is proposing on Monday.

The Conservatives have suggested the party could support the plans brought forward by Mahmood if she faces a rebellion from Labour backbenchers.

But the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, criticised the plans as “very small steps in the right direction with a few gimmicks”.

He told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme: “We want no illegal immigration whatsoever. We need to have a cap on legal inward migration each year, so the numbers are very, very dramatically lower.”

Several loyalist MPs told the Guardian they were deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of disrupting the lives of settled refugee families if their countries became safer to return to. At least one minister is understood to have severe reservations.

The Labour MP Tony Vaughan urged the government to “think again” on the changes. “The prime minister said in September that we are at a fork in the road. These asylum proposals suggest we have taken the wrong turning,” he posted on X.

“The idea that recognised refugees need to be deported is wrong. The rhetoric around these reforms encourages the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

The Labour MP Stella Creasy wrote in the Guardian that leaving refugees in a state of “perpetual limbo” for 20 years was economically as well as morally damaging. “If we want to stop the boats we need to stop the BS when it comes to what is generating refugees or how to respond to them,” she said.

“If you can’t stabilise your status, you will always struggle to get a job, a bank account or a mortgage, making it more likely you will be dependent on state or voluntary support.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0306afc05b3889975ec0cccb99b6e3b7b91945a/556_190_3808_3046/master/3808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57c95e34d7dea960e716f67ac913f689",N,,2025-11-16 18:56:45.797224

Under sweeping reforms unveiled by the home secretary, the government will attempt to change the way the European Convention on Human Rights is interpreted by UK judges in a bid to stop asylum seekers using their rights to a family life to avoid deportation.

Home Office officials have claimed the ECHR “is allowing large numbers of people to stay in the UK, against the public’s wishes”, and that new legislation will allow Britain to ramp up the number of removals.

The radical measures are part of much-publicised reform of the asylum system, billed by the government as “the most sweeping reforms in modern times”, as Labour looks to see off the threat of Reform UK and Nigel Farage.

But critics have hit out at the proposals, warning any move to alter how the UK interprets the rules will drive asylum seekers underground and leave them vulnerable to exploitation.

Sile Reynolds, the head of asylum advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the changes “will punish people who’ve already lost everything”, adding: “Either we all have human rights, or none of us do.”

The measures could also spark discontent on the backbenches, with one Labour MP accusing the party leadership of “chasing Reform”. They told The Independent: “The dehumanisation of people in desperation is the antithesis of what the Labour Party is about.”

Announcing the changes, Sir Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said they will “block endless appeals” and “stop last minute claims”.

He said: “Britain has always been a fair, tolerant and compassionate country – and this government will always defend those values.

“But, in a more volatile world, people need to know our borders are secure and rules are enforced.

“These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here.”

Shabana Mahmood will set out plans to rewrite how Britain grants refuge to those fleeing conflict and upheaval on Monday, drawing heavily on ideas used in Denmark, where Home Office officials were dispatched last month to study its border control and asylum policies.

Under the proposed changes, ministers want to bring forward a Bill to change how Article 8 of the ECHR – the right to a family life – is interpreted by judges in migrant court cases a bid to stop migrants “gaming the system” and to “rebalance public interest tests in favour of the British people’s expectations”.

The home secretary also wants to tighten up rules on family connections so that only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay in future.

Rules will also be updated to change modern slavery laws, which officials claim are being abused by “bogus” claims, while the appeals process will be updated to restrict illegal migrants to a single route of appeal to stop them “chancing their arm with challenge after challenge”.

The UK will also be working on further reform around Article 3, which relates to the prohibition of torture. Officials have claimed the definition of inhuman and degrading treatment “has expanded too far”, citing cases where serious criminals have remained in the UK after claims their healthcare needs could not be met in their homeland.

Ms Mahmood teased the changes on Sunday, telling Sky News that ministers want to “constrain in legislation the way that that is applied in immigration cases”, when it comes to Article 8.

She said it is the “right thing to do, because we've seen an expansion of the way that that right is applied in a way that is designed to frustrate the removal of those that, under our immigration rules, would not have the right to be in this country”.

But the Refugee Council, a charity advocating on behalf of refugees, warned that watering down these laws risks chaos and will drive desperate people underground, leaving them prone to exploitation.

Following the home secretary’s comments on Sunday morning, Enver Solomon, the charity’s chief executive said: “After the horrors of the Second World War, Britain helped draft the European Convention on Human Rights as part of our collective vow of ‘never again’. Its purpose was to protect all of us from atrocities and ensure people who come to our country seeking safety get a fair chance to apply for asylum.”

He described the UK’s legal system as “the difference between life and death for many” and added: “The government has a choice to make: we can build a fair and compassionate asylum system that determines who qualifies for protection and who does not. Or we can water down laws that protect us all and risk chaos: desperate people would still arrive on our shores, but be driven underground and left vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.”

Ms Reynolds accused political parties of being in a “race to the bottom – trying to outdo one another in cruelty towards refugees”.

She said: “Every day we see the trauma of people who have survived torture in countries like Syria, Eritrea and Sudan for standing up for the same freedoms we cherish in Britain. Instead of offering safety, political parties are locked in a race to the bottom – trying to outdo one another in cruelty towards refugees.

“These proposals will punish people who’ve already lost everything, cutting them off from safety and hope. But either we all have human rights, or none of us do.

“Stripping away protections that prevent people being sent back to their torturers is not who we are as a country. This is a cynical attempt to scapegoat vulnerable people to win political points. We can and must do better.”

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has said it is “welcome that Shabana Mahmood is finally talking seriously about tackling illegal migration”, but added: “As we saw with Keir Starmer’s lamentable U-turn on modest welfare cuts, the prime minister always folds in the face of opposition from his left-wing backbenchers.

“If the home secretary actually wants to cut illegal immigration, she should take up my offer to sit down with her and work on a plan that will actually stop the boats, rather than a few weak changes that will meet the approval of Labour MPs.”

Other changes expected as part of the raft of measures are the removal of the automatic right to housing and financial support for asylum seekers, and changes to refugee status which will make it temporary and subject to review every two-and-a-half years. Those who arrive in the UK via means such as a small boat or lorry also face a 20-year wait to stay in the country permanently.

Jennifer McKiernanPolitical reporter

Plans to fast-track the deportations of illegal migrants as part of a sweeping reforms of the UK's asylum policy are to be announced by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.

In a statement to MPs on Monday she will outline plans to end multiple appeals against removal and for an overhaul of legislation on human rights law.

For those granted asylum they will only be given it on a temporary basis and will be returned home if their country is at any time deemed safe. They will have to wait 20 years to apply to settle permanently.

Mahmood is also warn the UK will stop granting visas to people from three African countries if their governments do not improve co-operation on removals of illegal migrants.

Mahmood told the BBC on Sunday: ""This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.""

Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said he would go further and deport failed asylum seekers ""within a week"".

The plans have prompted criticism from some Labour MPs, including Rachael Maskell, who said the government was going in ""completely the wrong direction"" on immigration.

The government wants to reduce the number of people arriving to the UK on small boats and the reforms aim to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals as well as make it more difficult for successful asylum seekers to remain.

Under the plans people will be restricted to arguing their grounds for appeal within a single appeal and if a case fails, they will be deported.

The government will follow the Danish model of creating an independent body to fast-track the deportation of foreign criminals and cases with little prospect of success through the appeals system.

As part of the reforms, Mahmood wants to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied in migration court cases.

Only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

The UK will join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

The government believes this has been used to support unreasonable claims, including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their healthcare needs cannot be met.

Similarly, the Home Office said the Modern Slavery Act will be tightened up to prevent last-minute claims to block removal.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the reforms would stop ""endless appeals"" to increase the removals of ""those with no right to be here"".

Mahmood said the reforms recognised the ""pace and scale"" of immigration had destabilised and divided communities and would allow the government to ramp up the removal of those with no right to be in Britain.

She continued: ""To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.""

Earlier the home secretary told the BBC she would create new safe and legal routes for refugees through work and study routes.

Under the new measures there will be tighter restrictions placed on successful asylum seekers, who will have their case reviewed every two and a half years and if their home country is considered safe they will be returned.

A refugee will have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

They will not be able to bring family members to join them unless they are immediate relatives, including parents and children, while housing and weekly allowances will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

'Years of limbo'

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.

The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year.

There has also been criticism of the proposed reforms from within Labour, with Maskell saying lots of her fellow MPs were ""really concerned"".

She said it was important to have a robust human rights framework and described ""reordering our relationship with the ECHR"" as a ""step too far"".

Reform leader Nigel Farage said the home secretary ""sounds like a Reform supporter"".

""It's a shame that the Human Rights Act, ECHR and her own backbenchers mean that this will never happen,"" he added.

Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson said the government should ""focus on processing claims quickly, getting them right first time, and swiftly deporting people with no right to be here"".

Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said rather than deter migrants, the 20-year time frame would ""leave people in limbo and in tense anxiety for many, many years"".

As first reported in the Times, the threat of the visa ban for Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo comes after thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from the three nations were said to be in the UK.

A Home Office source said the countries were being targeted ""for their unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive returns processes"".

Both have been blamed for hindering Britain’s ability to remove illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers.
Even in her constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, one of the most diverse areas of the country, Mahmood said that migration was causing problems.
“I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country … I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.” Mahmood added: “What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system.
A plan to convert the Crowborough camp into accommodation for asylum seekers was rejected by the last Tory government due to safeguarding concerns.","Under the present system, introduced by the last Labour government in 2005, refugees can apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after five years, providing access to benefits and public funds and a route to citizenship.

The new 20-year qualifying period will apply to those who arrive illegally, such as in small boats or in lorries, and claim asylum, or those who overstay their visas and then claim. It will be the longest route to settlement in Europe; Denmark is second, with an eight-year pathway.

The changes, hailed as the largest overhaul since the Second World War, will apply only to new arrivals.

In the year to June, a total of 111,000 people claimed asylum in the UK. In the year ending March, 172,798 people were granted ILR under the process.

There will be some mitigations for skilled refugees, enabling them to truncate the 20-year qualification period by going into “specific” work or study routes. “It will be essentially a system whereby the more you contribute, you can bring forward that [20-year] period,” Mahmood said.

A ten-year pathway will also be created for those who arrive in the UK legally, under new specific refugee settlement routes to be announced by Mahmood on Thursday.

The plans are modelled on reforms in Denmark, which has reduced the number of asylum applications to a 40-year low, with 95 per cent of applicants rejected.

Mahmood will also revoke the statutory duty to provide support for asylum seekers. The government intends to use legislation to repeal a European Union directive that underpins the requirement.

‘We want them to work’

Housing and weekly allowances will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to. Those who break the law will also face having their support withdrawn.

Mahmood said: “Before that directive, we actually had a much more discretionary power that we could use, where we could make our own decision about whether we are going to offer someone asylum support or not. The reason we’re doing that [reverting to the previous powers] is that there are some people who currently receive asylum support who can work, who have the right to work, and we want them to work.”

She will also announce reforms to the application of key elements of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), including article 8, the right to a family life. She is expected to raise the need for international reform of article 3, covering torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. Both have been blamed for hindering Britain’s ability to remove illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers.

‘Our fundamental nature is generous’

The home secretary believes the changes are necessary to address voters’ sense of unfairness when asylum seekers are treated more generously than economic migrants who arrive on visas, despite the fact that the latter group must meet strict financial and integration requirements.

Even in her constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, one of the most diverse areas of the country, Mahmood said that migration was causing problems. “I think that people rightly feel that the pace and the scale of what we’ve seen is out of control. It’s putting a huge amount of pressure on communities,” she said. “My patch is 70 per cent non-white, but immigration is something that’s causing just as much concern here as it does all across other parts of the country.

“I think our fundamental nature as a people is that we are open, tolerant and generous,” she said, but the “precondition of unlocking the full extent of that openness is order and control”.

President Trump told GB News on Friday that Sir Keir Starmer “better do something on immigration”, describing some of those who arrived on small boats as “bad people” and warning: “If you don’t get them out, you’re not going to have a country left”.

Mahmood argued that the changes would make it both easier to remove illegal immigrants already in Britain and deter those considering crossing the Channel in small boats. “I can see a system that is out of control, I can see a system that is unfair and I can see a system that’s putting huge pressure on communities, including my own,” she said.

‘It’s designed to say: Do not get on a boat’

Her reforms would seek to “change the assumptions” about what it means to be a refugee, while also changing the “calculus and the thinking” of those people who are risking their lives on small boats by reducing the so-called pull factors that are drawing illegal immigrants.

This will include ending the “automatic path” to settled status after a refugee has been in Britain for five years. That will rise to 20 years and will have certain conditions attached, such as having no criminal record.

“That is designed to essentially say to people: do not come to this country as an illegal migrant, do not get on a boat,” she said. “I think it’s important that we send a very clear signal to those people who are currently trekking across multiple safe countries across Europe looking to get on a boat in the north of France: this is not a journey worth making.”

President Macron of France has called on the UK to address the pull factors behind small-boat crossings. Germany is already committed to working with the UK on the issue and Mahmood is understood to be in “embryonic talks” with Belgium and the Netherlands.

Mahmood, the eldest daughter of immigrants from the Pakistani side of Kashmir and a devout Muslim, said that she knew the reforms would be a hard sell to some in her party, who are concerned that Labour is trying to mimic Conservative and Reform policies.

Some Labour MPs on the left have branded the reforms as “racist”, including Nadia Whittome, the member for Nottingham East, who accused the government of pursuing the “policies of the far right”.

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, called the plans “harsh and unnecessary”, arguing they “won’t deter people who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars”.

Mahmood said she rejected “entirely” suggestions that her policy change was racist, pointing out that her parents came to the UK legally in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

“This is a moral mission for me,” she told Sky News on Sunday. “I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country … I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.”

Mahmood added: “What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system. It’s not right-wing talking points or fake news or misinformation that is suggesting that we’ve got a problem..”

She said that the Home Office would “bring order and control back” into the asylum system while also creating new safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to enter the UK.

The government announced last month that two army barracks, one in East Sussex and one in Scotland, would be used to house asylum seekers from December, as ministers seek to end the use of hotels within a year.

This month, a leaked Home Office document suggested that the government had identified at least 14 sites that could host up to 10,000 migrants.

On Sunday, about 2,000 people marched through the streets of Crowborough, East Sussex, to protest against plans to house 600 lone male asylum seekers in a nearby army camp.

The Crowborough site and Cameron Barracks in Inverness are the only two to have been publicly announced so far.

A plan to convert the Crowborough camp into accommodation for asylum seekers was rejected by the last Tory government due to safeguarding concerns.

Mahmood is seen as a rising star and has hinted that she may harbour leadership ambitions. Last week, Mahmood, who is one of Starmer’s closest allies, pledged her support to the prime minister and chancellor, adding: “I know that they will put the best interest of the whole country absolutely first and foremost as they make the difficult choices that are needed to get the budget to balance.”

However, she will know that if they fail, she could soon be in a new job and it will be her facing all the difficult choices — and not just how to stop the boats.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fe2ca745c-962c-4a02-9b0c-35bbf0b16603.jpg?crop=4236%2C2383%2C1374%2C492&resize=1200,N,,2025-11-16 20:56:55.091827
