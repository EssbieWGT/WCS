“These children have every right to pursue SIJS,” said Sophia Gregg, ACLU senior immigrants’ rights attorney.
According to the ACLU, their detention is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to classify immigrant youth with SIJS as “arriving noncitizens,” subject to mandatory detention and ineligible for bond hearings.
The ACLU is seeking the immediate release of the named plaintiffs, as well as a ruling that would guarantee bond hearings for similarly situated minors nationwide.
The complaints accuse the federal agencies of tampering with webpages and automatic out-of-office emails to blame Democrats for the government shutdown.","The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia has filed a class-action lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s administration’s policy of detaining immigrant children without bond hearings, stating the practice violates decades of federal law intended to protect vulnerable youth.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Eastern District of Virginia, names four plaintiffs who came to the U.S. after being abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents. All have obtained or applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, a legal designation Congress created nearly 40 years ago to provide a pathway to citizenship for children who cannot safely return to their home countries.

“These children have every right to pursue SIJS,” said Sophia Gregg, ACLU senior immigrants’ rights attorney. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “recategorizing and reconsidering the entire federal regulations … and their justification really doesn’t hold any water.”

The four plaintiffs are currently being held at the Farmville and Caroline detention facilities in Virginia. According to the ACLU, their detention is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to classify immigrant youth with SIJS as “arriving noncitizens,” subject to mandatory detention and ineligible for bond hearings.

“We’re seeing this across the country for all individuals. Millions of people, potentially, are in immigration detention who would otherwise not have been a few months ago,” Gregg told WTOP. “Those unaccompanied minors are protected under the many federal laws and anti-trafficking laws that are specifically intended to protect children.”

Under the SIJS process, immigrant children must first be released to a sponsor, placed under custody orders from a state judge, and then they can apply for status. Visa availability can take years, but the protections Congress established were designed to prevent children from being detained while they wait.

Instead, the ACLU lawsuit argues, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is keeping children locked up and cutting them off from the ability to pursue their cases and effectively pressuring them to abandon their rights.

Gregg called the policy part of “a mass deportation agenda,” adding these are kids “Congress intended to protect … and identified as being the most vulnerable and in need of protection.”

“The immigration courts are now taking the position, as is the rest of the Trump administration, that nobody, including this specifically vulnerable group, is entitled to hearings for the release under bond pending their immigration cases,” Gregg said.

The case, Sarmiento v. Crawford, was filed with co-counsel Tanishka Cruz of Cruz Law, and Patrice Kopistansky. The ACLU is seeking the immediate release of the named plaintiffs, as well as a ruling that would guarantee bond hearings for similarly situated minors nationwide.

Violation of the Hatch Act

On Friday, the watchdog group Public Citizen filed 11 complaints against major agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of the Treasury, Department of Justice, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration and the White House.

The complaints accuse the federal agencies of tampering with webpages and automatic out-of-office emails to blame Democrats for the government shutdown.

As of Friday afternoon, HUD’s website featured a banner and a pop-up message blaming the “Radical Left” for the current federal government shutdown.

Ethics experts argue the edits violate the Hatch Act, which bars political activity in federal workplaces and protects employees from partisan pressure. They warn the coordinated changes not only misrepresent federal workers but also use government resources to sway voters.

“This is unique. … These agencies are the biggest agencies in the federal government. You’ve got a coordinated effort coming from the White House to get the entire federal government and all the different agencies working together to try to influence the electoral mood of the American public to support Donald Trump and oppose Democrats. I’ve never seen this type of scope of violation of the Hatch Act before in my life,” government affairs lobbyist Craig Holman said.

Holman, who filed the complaints with Public Citizen, added, “This ought to be enough to actually make the Office of Special Counsel do something, or if they don’t do something, it gives me grounds for litigation.”

The migrants called the accusations “baseless and dangerous,” arguing that the administration was misrepresenting the lower courts’ work.
They warned the justices that allowing Trump to strip protected status would tear families apart and cause billions in economic losses, including Social Security and other tax revenue.
Lower court judges have reportedly become increasingly agitated by the Supreme Court’s scant explanations on the emergency docket.
“A temporary pause in implementing a policy change — even an important one — cannot by itself constitute irreparable harm,” the migrants wrote.","WASHINGTON (CN) — The Supreme Court sided with President Donald Trump Friday in a tug-of-war over protected status for nearly 300,000 Venezuelan migrants living in the U.S., spurning lower courts facing the White House’s wrath.

In an unsigned statement, the court said legal arguments had not changed since May, when the justices previously ruled in favor of Trump in a nearly identical appeal.

“The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here,” the court wrote, declining to explain its decision further.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, both Barack Obama appointees, said they would have denied the application.

Just like in May, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Joe Biden appointee, wrote a solo dissent arguing that the court was abusing its emergency docket.

“This court should have stayed its hand,” Jackson wrote. “Having opted instead to join the fray, the court plainly misjudges the irreparable harm"" and was instead “privileging the bald assertion of unconstrained executive power over countless families’ pleas for the stability our government has promised them.”

With a choice between allowing 300,000 people to remain working legally in the United States or subjecting those individuals to job loss, family separation and deportation, Jackson said the lower courts had chosen the obvious, least disruptive and most humane option.

“We once again eschew restraint … and wordlessly override the considered judgments of our colleagues,” Jackson wrote. “We once again use our equitable power (but not our opinion-writing capacity) to allow this administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible.”

Trump filed an impassioned emergency appeal asking the justices to let his administration strip temporary protected status from the migrants, who face dangerous conditions in Venezuela. According to the administration, the lower courts blocked the White House’s policy in defiance of a prior Supreme Court order.

The migrants called the accusations “baseless and dangerous,” arguing that the administration was misrepresenting the lower courts’ work. They warned the justices that allowing Trump to strip protected status would tear families apart and cause billions in economic losses, including Social Security and other tax revenue.

Following the Supreme Court’s May ruling, the lower courts held subsequent hearings in the case, concluding that when the case proceeds, the migrants should prevail.

On Sept. 5, Senior U.S. District Judge Edward Chen issued a final judgment finding that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sidestepped review requirements. The Barack Obama appointee called Noem’s actions unprecedented and illegal.

The Ninth Circuit refused to pause Chen’s September ruling, stating that the high court’s one-page, unexplained stay order from May left judges to guess at the justices’ view of the merits of the case. The appeals court reasoned that the more developed record bolstered the migrants’ claims against the government.

Lower court judges have reportedly become increasingly agitated by the Supreme Court’s scant explanations on the emergency docket. The administration, however, viewed what some judges called confusion as insubordination.

“This court’s orders are binding on litigants and lower courts,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote. “Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them — as the lower courts did here — is unacceptable.”

Temporary Protected Status is a designation applied to nationals of certain countries where violence or economic duress make deportation difficult or unsafe. Venezuelans make up the largest number of such status holders in the nation.

Before leaving office, former President Joe Biden issued an 18-month extension of TPS for Venezuelans. In February, Noem revoked the extension, ending TPS status for almost 350,000 migrants.

During a Fox News interview, Noem called Venezuelan immigrants “dirtbags” and insinuated they were members of criminal gangs. Venezuela migrants and the National TPS Alliance, an immigrant advocacy group, sued the administration in February, claiming that Noem’s actions were unlawful and motivated by racial animus.

Chen ruled that Noem’s comments and actions against all beneficiaries showed that she made sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS holders.

The Trump administration dismissed the claims, arguing that Noem’s actions were based on reasoned policy determinations. The Justice Department faulted Chen for stepping into the case, claiming that the ruling interfered with executive branch prerogatives and delayed sensitive policy decisions.

The migrants said interfering with Trump’s policy preferences did not meet the high standard for a stay, noting that the justices denied applications from the Biden administration on those same grounds.

“A temporary pause in implementing a policy change — even an important one — cannot by itself constitute irreparable harm,” the migrants wrote. “If it did, this court would have granted stays of the lower court orders that halted pro-immigrant federal policies promulgated during the Biden Administration. The same rules must apply now.”","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/07/donald-trump-and-kristi-noem-tour-alligator-alcatraz.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-03 23:57:38.816297

Reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity near Santa Barbara City College, UC Santa Barbara, and Franklin Elementary school on Thursday, October 2, raised the alarm among immigrant rights advocates who are concerned federal immigration operations are creeping closer to spaces that have traditionally been protected from ICE enforcement.

The 805 Immigration Coalition — which runs the 24/7 Rapid Response Hotline to monitor potential federal immigration enforcement on the Central Coast — reported several sightings of ICE vehicles early Thursday morning, including in the areas of Chino, Milpas, and Haley streets in Eastside Santa Barbara, with one sighting reported near Franklin Elementary School (though the school was closed for a holiday, and no students were on campus).

Rapid Response Hotline volunteers immediately follow up to verify reported incidents as they happen, sending legal observers to document any arrests and cross-reference the often-unmarked vehicles with a list of “known ICE vehicles” that have been confirmed to be used during previous operations, either for arrests or transporting individuals to ICE processing facilities in Santa Maria or Camarillo. These incidents are further corroborated by legal representatives who work directly with the families of individuals detained, arrested, or deported.

Just after 7 a.m. the same morning, Rapid Response Hotline legal observers were alerted to another incident near the Santa Barbara City College campus, in the adjacent residential neighborhood on Oceano Avenue. In this incident, 805 Immigrant Coalition confirmed at least four people were taken into custody by ICE officers in bulletproof vests and federal agents wearing navy blue “FBI” jackets. According to witnesses at the scene, the four people were taken away in unmarked vehicles after the federal agents smashed the driver’s side window of the detainees’ car.

After the early-morning incidents in Santa Barbara, 805 Immigrant Coalition dispatched multiple community response teams to patrol neighborhoods on the Eastside, Westside, and other areas of the city that have become hotspots for ICE activity in recent months. “Let’s protect each other and keep watch for our community,” the group wrote in a post on Instagram.

Another incident involving federal immigration enforcement — originally reported by UCSB’s student-run newspaper the Daily Nexus — occurred at a student dormitory on El Colegio Road around 10:30 that same morning. According to reports from firsthand witnesses, an individual who later identified himself as a federal immigration officer was able to gain access into the main lobby of the Santa Catalina Residence Hall (an area accessible only to residents with an electronic key), likely after a resident either entered or exited the front door.

The Daily Nexus spoke to a staff member who asked to remain anonymous, who reportedly said the officer — who was either with ICE or another federal agency — showed a front desk worker a file with the name of an individual whose address was listed at the student dorm. Santa Catalina Residence Hall staff could not confirm whether the individual in question currently lives in the building, and federal agencies could not confirm whether the officer had a warrant to enter the property.

Dormitory staff members and supervisors did not reveal any information about the individual, due to university policies which prevent the disclosure of any information about student residents without the student’s permission. After a few minutes, the federal agent reportedly left the dormitory without any further incident.

The Independent reached out to UCSB and the Department of Homeland Security for more information regarding the incident at the Santa Catalina Residence Hall. ICE did not respond to specific questions, and the agency does not comment publicly regarding day-to-day operations.

UCSB spokesperson Kiki Reyes addressed the incident in a statement sent to the Independent on Friday afternoon, in which she said the federal agent who entered the lobby of the student dormitory may not have been from ICE, but could have been from another agency inquiring about a student’s immigration status.

“The university is looking into a report concerning individuals identifying themselves as federal representatives who entered the lobby of one of our housing residences and asked to speak to an individual regarding an expired international student immigration status,” Reyes said. “By university policy, and in accordance with [The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act], the university did not disclose any information and the individuals were denied access to the residence hall. At this time, the campus does not believe that the individuals were agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”

According to University of California’s informational page regarding immigration policies (updated July 28, 2025), UCSB does not technically have the authority to prevent federal immigration enforcement officers from coming on campus to enforce federal law, though staff and UCPD are not required to assist in any capacity.

The policy makes a distinction, however, between public areas of the campus — which are accessible to any member of the public, including ICE officers — and “private” areas, such as dormitories and buildings with monitored entryways restricted to those with key cards. Specifically, the policy states, ICE requires a judicial warrant (signed by a judge) to enter non-public areas like college dorm rooms.

“UC employees are not required to affirmatively assist federal immigration authorities or grant permission to enter limited access space when officers do not have a judicial warrant to enter,” the policy states. “If an immigration officer seeks your consent to enter limited access space or requests information or documents from you about another individual, take steps to ensure that you have authority to provide the requested access, information or documents. Ask the officer for their documentation of their name, identification number, agency affiliation, and business card; ask for a copy of any warrant they may have.”

Since January, there have been more than 600 immigration-related arrests on the Central Coast, with more than 100 confirmed arrests in Santa Barbara County (though these arrests, recorded by 805 Immigrant Coalition, represent a low estimate, counting only those reported through the Rapid Response Hotline). The vast majority of ICE-related activity has occurred in neighborhoods with high concentrations of working-class Latino families, such as Santa Barbara’s Eastside and Westside and Old Town Goleta. While reports of ICE activity near school campuses has raised the level of fear among immigrant advocates and community watchdogs, there have been no confirmed instances of ICE entering a school property in Santa Barbara County this year.",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-11.00.15-AM-Large.jpeg,N,,2025-10-04 00:57:21.767679

This year protests against aggressive operations by Ice have been small in Portland, but Trump has used them as justification to deploy troops.","Protests in Portland, Oregon, continued on Thursday night, with locals clashing with officials and rightwing provocateurs, amid the latest federal deployment by the Trump administration.

A rightwing commentator was arrested and briefly detained by local officials after allegedly engaging in a fight outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility, local police said. Nick Sortor, a rightwing commentator who regularly visits protest sites to record videos, was released on Friday morning.

“You PROVED what we’ve all been saying for years: you’re CORRUPT and CONTROLLED by violent Antifa thugs who terrorize the streets,” Sortor posted on X in a message to the local Portland police.

Another rightwing commentator said he spoke with the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, who promised a “surge” of Ice resources in Portland following Sortor’s arrest.

For the past few weeks, protesters in Portland have been demonstrating outside of the Ice facility in opposition to the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies. In response – despite fervent opposition by local leaders – the Trump administration had pledgedto deploy national guard troops on federal orders and federal officials to the city.

A coalition of 17 mayors in the state are opposing the deployment. Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, filed a lawsuit fighting the activation of 200 federalized members of the Oregon national guard. A federal judge will hear arguments on Friday on whether to temporarily block the troop deployment.

For years, Donald Trump has promoted an inaccurate narrative that Portland is a “war-ravaged” city with anarchists engaging in chronic chaos. In late September, the president designated “antifa” as a “major terrorist organization”. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is not a centralized organization in the US but closer to an ideology with a loose network of activists.

During his first administration in 2020, Trump deployed federal forces to the city amid the protests over the murder by police in Minneapolis of George Floyd. The protests spread nationwide and internationally but were especially politically polarized in Portland as it became the site of rightwing gatherings, counterprotests and clashes. This year protests against aggressive operations by Ice have been small in Portland, but Trump has used them as justification to deploy troops.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44f0d9dcbe63fcb6f73f781880ed09515d0bd9ee/458_0_4583_3667/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c447d0ba67ed5820fbf07a30035ab620",N,,2025-10-03 23:56:55.172962

A three-judge panel of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an injunction won by Democratic-led states and immigrant rights advocates that stopped the Republican president's executive order from taking effect.

Trump's order, issued on his first day back in office on January 20, directs agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of U.S.-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, also known as a ""green card"" holder.

The principle of birthright citizenship has been recognized in the U.S. for more than 150 years, deriving from the 14th Amendment that states that anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen.

Another appeals court, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in July similarly upheld a nationwide injunction blocking Trump's order from taking effect on the grounds that it violated the citizenship clause of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment.

The administration last week asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its appeal in that case and a related one. If the Supreme Court agrees, it would mark the second time the litigation is before the high court, after its 6-3 conservative majority in June limited the power of judges to block that and other actions by Trump on a nationwide basis.

The Supreme Court at that time did not weigh in on the validity of Trump's birthright citizenship order. But in three cases where judges had declared it unconstitutional, the court limited the ability of judges to issue so-called universal injunctions and directed lower courts that had blocked Trump's policy nationally to reconsider the scope of their orders.

The Supreme Court's ruling opened the door to Trump's order taking effect in parts of the country, fueling uncertainty for immigrants and states grappling with the implications of a potentially patchwork system of citizenship rules. Yet in the months since, lower-court judges have repeatedly blocked it from being implemented anywhere in the country.

The 1st Circuit was reviewing a ruling by U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, who ruled in favor of 18 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia in February.

After the Supreme Court's June ruling, he reaffirmed his original decision to halt the policy nationwide.

He said a patchwork approach to citizenship would generate confusion, given the substantial movement of noncitizen parents and children between states and the impact Trump's order would have on administering social services to them.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108162838-17507131022025-06-17t160330z_1656582856_rc2e4fa07nci_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump-venezuela.jpeg?v=1750713142&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-10-04 01:57:18.188519

What we know:

Ald. Jessie Fuentes (26th Ward) says she went to Humboldt Park Health after learning ICE agents brought a man who they were chasing to the hospital after he fell and broke his leg. It is unclear if the man is undocumented.

In a video posted to her official Facebook page, Fuentes is heard asking the agents if they had a warrant signed by a judge for the man they had detained. During their exchange of words, and after the agents repeatedly asked her to leave, one of them is seen grabbing her aggressively and placing her in handcuffs.

She was then walked outside and released.

What they're saying:

At an afternoon press conference, Fuentes said the man at the hospital is about 37 years of age and that he will need surgery for his broken leg. She added that he has signed documentation to have lawyers represent him. However, she claims the agents are not letting the lawyers speak with him.

""This is a common practice,"" Fuentes said. ""ICE has been taking individuals into hospital rooms, into emergency rooms, because people are harmed while ICE is trying to detain people in the city of Chicago.

As Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem met with employees inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in Broadview, a crowd grew over several hours, some riled by newly installed barricades to separate them from law enforcement officers stationed outside. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the protests and any detentions at the scene.

Noem, whose visit to Chicago was confirmed by Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, also accompanied agents Friday on a raid near a local Walmart store, according to conservative media personality Benny Johnson. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Noem’s visit to the area.

Some protesters have aimed to block vehicles from going in or out of the area in recent weeks, part of growing pushback to a surge of immigration enforcement that began in early September. Federal agents have repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls and other projectiles toward crowds in response, and at least five protesters have faced federal charges after being arrested in those clashes.

Local law enforcement stepped up its own presence Friday at the facility about 12 miles west of Chicago. Several streets around the site were closed, patrolled by Illinois State Police officers wearing riot helmets and holding batons on patrol. The state police set up concrete barriers Thursday night to segregate protesters and designate spaces to demonstrate.

It was unclear how many people were detained Friday. One man was seen struggling on the ground with agents after he appeared to break through a line into the roadway and in front of a vehicle.

“Every week, ICE escalates its violence against us,” said Demi Palecek, a military veteran and candidate for Congress. “With this level of escalation, it’s only a matter of time before someone is killed.”

A spokesperson for Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker lashed out at President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday afternoon for the way federal agents, many of them masked to hide their faces, have been treating protesters over the past month, saying that they have “grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility.” The spokesperson said in a statement that the agents had engaged in “inhumane” tactics including slamming protesters to the ground, arresting a reporter and firing chemical agents into the crowds.

Pritzker’s spokesperson said a newly established “unified command” of the Illinois State Police, Cook County Sheriff’s Department and others on Broadview’s streets will control crowds while ensuring protesters their First Amendment right to free speech.

“They show their faces, they have proper identification, and they are accountable to the people of Illinois,” the governor’s spokesperson said in the statement. “It is clear federal agents cannot be trusted to act to protect the safety and constitutional rights of the public.”

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations from the governor’s spokesperson.

On Thursday, Pritzker demanded Noem face the public by answering reporters’ questions and divulging details about the ongoing operation.

Noem, alongside Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector, was surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew while standing beside a sniper’s post, according to footage shared online by Johnson. Johnson also posted video outside a Walmart store where he said agents, accompanied by Noem, had conducted a raid.

Noem said in a post on social media on Friday afternoon that she and her team were blocked from accessing the Village of Broadview Municipal Building in Illinois.

The village of Broadview said in a statement Friday afternoon that since Noem had appeared that morning “unannounced, at Broadview’s Village Hall asking for a meeting while Mayor Katrina Thompson was out of the building, the mayor returned her visit.”

“Mayor Thompson went to the ICE center, accompanied by the Broadview Police Chief Thomas, and officers, to ask for the illegal fence to be dismantled,” David Ormsby, the village’s spokesperson said in the statement. “The mayor was told by agents at the gate the secretary was unavailable to meet.”

Several demonstrators said they were frustrated by the designated protest zone, saying keeping them off public streets violated their First Amendment right to free speech. Others were angered by officers from local or state agencies standing shoulder to shoulder with federal officers, including Homeland Security Investigations, ICE, the Bureau of Prisons and others.

Most ignored the zone to protest on the other side of the facility, where Illinois State Police officers held them back.

Jonny Bishop, a 28-year-old former teacher from Palatine, Illinois, who is from a Mexican immigrant family, said he has been hit by tear gas and pepper balls at previous protests. He said the main contrast between Friday’s protests and earlier efforts is local, county and state law enforcement agencies working alongside federal agents.

“ICE acts with impunity,” he said. “They know that they can shoot at us. They can tear gas us. And Broadview Police Department is not going to do anything.”

The Broadview Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At one point, state police officers joined Border Patrol in advancing toward protesters, forming a larger perimeter around the building. Some protesters yelled in law enforcement officers’ faces while the officers grabbed them by the shoulders and pushed them back.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251003--broadview-protest-ew-246p-93e30f.jpg",N,,2025-10-03 22:56:31.878967

Critics of the tech giants capitulating to the Trump administration say it shows the sway President Trump has over Silicon Valley in his second term.

Apple said it yanked an app called ICEBlock from its app store after the ""safety risks"" of the app were made known to the company. The anonymous, crowd-sourced app describes itself as ""Waze but for ICE sightings,"" and claims to serve as an early warning system informing people when ICE agents are nearby.

The app was launched in April and garnered hundreds of thousands of downloads, but it was only after Attorney General Pam Bondi put Apple on notice, demanding the app be pulled from the App Store, that the company made it unavailable.

""We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so,"" said Bondi in a statement to Fox News.

The Justice Department did not respond to NPR's questions about its request.

Since the app never had an Android version, it was not on Google's Play Store. Still, a company spokesperson told NPR that it, too, ""removed similar apps for violations of our policies,"" falling in line with Apple's actions.

The developer of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, said he made the app in response to the Trump administration's stepped up immigration enforcement. After it was booted from Apple's app store, Aaron blamed political pressure and vowed to fight it.

He argued the app's service was engaged in a type of protected speech not unlike some of Apple's own apps, like the company's mapping app which allows users to crowdsource accidents, hazards and police speed traps along roadways.

""Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move,"" Aaron said in a statement.

Apple's action has reignited the debate about what's known as jawboning, when government officials censor speech through intimidation and threats.

Conservatives for years accused the Biden administration of this tactic over communications it had with tech companies related to accounts that were spreading COVID and election misinformation.

Jimmy Kimmel's brief suspension by ABC following comments from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr was widely regarded by legal experts as illegal jawboning.

Kate Ruane, Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Free Expression Project, said Apple's move should also be viewed as the government's heavy hand muzzling free expression.

""When companies agree to the administration's demands in order to achieve some other goal, whether it be avoiding tariffs or getting merger approval, they send a message to others that it's ok to do the same,""Ruane said. ""What's worse, they erode the promise of the First Amendment for all of us at the same time.""

Apple CEO Tim Cook has made strides to ingratiate himself with Trump, as the administration enacts an aggressive tariff policy that could hurt Apple's bottom line, since much of its production happens in China, India and elsewhere overseas.

Cook in August walked into the White House and gave Trump a 24-karat gold plaque, a move that has come to symbolize Silicon Valley's deference to the president.

Trump has given Apple and other tech companies something of a gift, too, by exempting smartphones, including Apple's iPhones, from tariffs.

""I think many large organizations are trying to keep their metaphorical heads down and act cautiously, even when the government is acting improperly or even unconstitutionally,"" said Gautam Hans, a law professor at Cornell University, who believes Apple would have a jawboning case but does not expect the company to pursue it. ""Compliance will only incentivize further government demands.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7874x4429+0+697/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2Fd4%2F955ed608460aa801a278ec1b4478%2Fgettyimages-2233926823.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 23:56:58.577923

Lawyers representing children who entered the country apart from their immediate family have told LAist they are deeply concerned about the program because it appears children will be asked to waive their rights to see an immigration judge before being removed from the country.

This effort by DHS comes after the department attempted earlier this year to stop funding a program to provide legal support to children in the immigration system. All funding to the program was halted in March but ordered by District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín to resume in April in accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and federal policies. Last month, 76 undocumented minors were nearly flown to Guatemala in the middle of the night, before the deportations were stopped by District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan.

Representatives for DHS and HHS have not immediately responded to LAist’s requests for comment.

What we know so far

Unverified reports spread through social media and immigration rights advocate circles Thursday, citing supposedly leaked information about an Immigration and Customs Enforcement action called “Operation Freaky Friday” set to begin today.

The reports suggested ICE was planning to send “offer” letters to unaccompanied children in the immigration system 14 years and older, where they would be promised $2,500 in return for waiving their rights to see an immigration judge.

It was also claimed that if children refused the offer they would be detained upon turning 18 and their family members living in the U.S. would also be arrested. Plans to threaten detention or arrest have not been independently verified by LAist.

In a social media post today, a spokesperson for DHS denied the name of the operation, saying that it was made up by “anti-ICE activists,” but acknowledged that there is now a program in place that is similar in some regard to what was shared in the unverified reports.

“ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families,” the DHS account wrote, also referencing an option for “access to financial support when returning home.”

Unaccompanied children are required to be transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee and Resettlement, known as ORR, shortly after they are detained by DHS according to a legal settlement made by the federal government in 1997.

In an email from HHS to legal service providers that was shared with LAist, HHS confirmed that DHS will provide $2,500 to undocumented children 14 years or older who take the offer, excluding minors from Mexico or those who have left their custody.

What lawyers are saying

Yasmin Yavar, deputy director for the American Bar Association’s Children’s Immigration Law Academy, told LAist that children who take this offer could end up waiving their rights.

“[The offer is] problematic because they are giving up their opportunity to be before a judge,” Yavar said, adding that children may not understand the consequences of that choice.

Yavar said that children who are detained and in the custody of ORR are supposed to get a “Know your Rights” presentation and be able to consult with an attorney to provide information about their rights and responsibilities.

Mickey Donovan-Kaloust, legal services director at Immigrant Defenders Law Center, told LAist in an emailed statement that they represent hundreds of unaccompanied children and that the $2,500 incentive “has the potential to exploit their unique vulnerabilities as unaccompanied minors in government custody.”

The DHS social media post defended the move saying many unaccompanied children had no choice in coming to the U.S. and would be returning to family outside the country.

Multiple lawyers who spoke to LAist said that unaccompanied children commonly live with family in the U.S., and that federal regulations direct ORR to prioritize releasing children to parents or immediate family members in the country while they go through immigration court.

Some lawyers say that taking this offer could put children at greater risk.

“ It is really difficult to explain to kids what their rights are in not just clear language, but also child-friendly language,” said spokesperson Bilal Askaryar from the Acacia Center for Justice. He said the idea that an agent with no background in child welfare could get their informed consent to sign something that returns them to danger is “deeply troubling and it's cruel.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fc97bc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1886x990+0+126/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F09%2F22%2Fbb76d65c4411af814d1495677ba7%2Fgettyimages-2235443593.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 23:57:08.014952

While protesters have flocked to the facility for weeks to protest the Trump administration's enhanced immigration enforcement, the scene outside Broadview looked markedly different Friday morning.

On Beach Street, long concrete barriers were erected overnight to create a designated area for protesting, keep demonstrators and federal agents apart and keep the street clear for emergency vehicles.

Protesters began gathering in that area early Friday morning, but just before 8 a.. that area started to empty out and the demonstrators moved to the 25th Street entrance around the corner and about a block and a half away.

That was around the time Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was spotted on the roof of the facility Friday morning, where she appeared to be filming something. Later she was seen outside, chatting with Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, who is overseeing ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

The largest concentration of law enforcement — including officers from the Broadview Police Department, Illinois State Police troopers, Cook County sheriff's deputies and officers from neighboring suburbs like North Riverside, Hillside and Maywood — was and remains as of 11 a.m. around that front entrance to the building, as well as the usual federal agents behind the facility gates and on the roof. About 100 to 200 protesters gathered at that area throughout the morning.

At one point, police formed a line keeping protesters back from the ICE facility. A special team of officers dressed in black and wearing riot gear marched in and helped control the crowd.

The crowd of protesters has steadily thinned out since the morning. As of 11 a.m., there were more law enforcement officers than protesters remaining at the facility.

At least five people have been arrested by either Illinois State Police or Broadview Police; some for aggravated battery to a police officer, others for resisting and obstruction, according to the Cook County Sheriff's office:

Ezra Q. Imes, 27, was arrested by Broadview police and charged with aggravated battery to a police officer.

Rafael L. Menon, 20, was arrested by Illinois State Police and charged with resisting and obstruction.

Audrey J. Gladson, 32, was arrested by Illinois State Police and charged with resisting and obstruction.

Eman T. Abdelhadi, 36, was arrested by Illinois State Police and charged with battery to a police officer, resisting and obstruction. She is a sociology professor at University of Chicago.

Tricia Black was arrested by Illinois State Police and charged with resisting and obstruction.

Court records show only Gladson had any prior criminal history. She pleaded guilty earlier this year to trespassing, tied to another protest in 2024.

At least a dozen people were detained and lined up behind the Broadview facility Friday morning. It was unclear if any of those seen being detained were among the five people arrested and charged. At least one person who was detained was also given medical attention in a nearby ambulance.

Shortly before 9:30 a.m., a large armored vehicle with an armed agent stationed out its top, made its way slowly through the crowd, though it was not apparent why.

There are also counter-protesters at the facility in support of ICE and federal agents.

There are digital signs around the facility warning people to stay off the streets and the majority of the state and local police involvement appears to be related to keeping people out of the roadway.

25th Avenue is closed until further notice between the entrance to the Eisenhower down to Roosevelt due to the protest.

The village of Broadview shut down its municipal building around noon, and the police chief did not respond to numerous calls from CBS News Chicago to ask if this was the kind of response or police support he had hoped for after asking for Illinois State Police and Cook County Sheriff's deputies to help handle the crowds of protesters.

Protests outside the ICE facility have repeatedly grown heated, with ICE agents firing projectiles and using tear gas at times. So far, none of that has happened on Friday.

Illinois and Broadview police said they are not assisting ICE with any detention operations in accordance with state law.

The Illinois State Police released a statement, writing, ""At the request of the Broadview Police Department, the Cook County Sheriff's Office (CCSO) and the Illinois State Police (ISP), with assistance from the Cook County Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA), have established a temporary Unified Command to coordinate public safety measures in Broadview around the facility being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Unified Command set up designated areas where people can safely exercise their rights, which will support the safety of the public, and ensure local vehicular traffic can safely access the roads in the area. As part of this, ISP has deployed a crowd control team. The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law.

Much of the activity was centered around a 9 a.m. news conference by aldermen, previously arrested demonstrators, and political candidates, who demanded transparency and safety protocols.

(AP) — Federal officials reported the arrests of 13 people Friday protesting near an immigration facility outside Chicago that has been frequently targeted during President Donald Trump's administration’s surge of immigration enforcement this fall.

As Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem met with employees inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in Broadview, a crowd grew over several hours, some riled by newly installed barricades to separate them from law enforcement officers stationed outside.

Noem also accompanied agents Friday on a raid near a local Walmart store and later engaged in a tit-for-tat over unannounced visits — and even bathroom use — with the Broadview mayor.

Immigrants’ rights advocates and residents separately reported that federal agents had used tear gas near grocery or hardware stores they had targeted for enforcement elsewhere in Chicago on Friday and detained a city council member as she questioned the attempted arrest of a man. The federal government has restricted airspace over Broadview, officials said Friday, and Gov. JB Pritzker called for an investigation into an immigration raid on the city's South Side early Tuesday morning.

Objections to barricades, local police step up

At the ICE facility, some protesters have aimed to block vehicles from going in or out of the area in recent weeks, part of growing pushback to a surge of immigration enforcement that began in early September. Called “Midway Blitz,” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced Friday that it has resulted in more than 1,000 immigration arrests.

Federal agents have repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls and other projectiles toward crowds in response and at least five people have faced federal charges after being arrested in those clashes.

While Friday's demonstration was quieter at Broadview, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reported 13 protesters were arrested. Charges were not released but McLaughlin said they included alleged assaults on federal officers.

The Illinois State Police, whose officers patrolled the grounds wearing riot helmets and holding batons, set up concrete barriers Thursday night to segregate protesters and designate spaces to demonstrate, with several adjacent streets being closed. Many demonstrators ignored the zones to protest on the other side of the building, saying the corrals prevented free speech rights.

Others were angered by local and state officers standing shoulder-to-shoulder with federal agents, including Homeland Security Investigations, ICE, the Bureau of Prisons and others. At one point, Illinois State Police joined Border Patrol in pushing back a crowd.

Jonny Bishop, a 28-year-old former teacher from Palatine, Illinois, and from a Mexican immigrant family, said the cooperation concerned him.

“ICE acts with impunity,” said Bishop, who’s previously encountered tear gas and pepper balls. “They know that they can shoot at us. They can tear gas us. And Broadview Police Department is not going to do anything.”

The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it has restricted Chicago airspace, with Border Patrol citing “a credible threat” against law enforcement amid ongoing clashes with protesters at the Broadview site. The restriction, which is in effect from Oct. 1-12 and targets drones, extends in a radius of 15 nautical miles (28 kilometers) and includes Broadview. Critics question the length of time and the geographic breadth of the prohibition, worried about oversight of ICE operations.

Tear gas used on quiet street; city council member handcuffed at hospital

In a Chicago neighborhood, Andrew Denton, 39, stopped at a grocery store for lunch and heard honking from an SUV stopped behind a motorcycle parked in the middle of the street. He realized ICE agents were in the SUV and started shooting video just before the agents threw canisters of gas near passersby.

“There was no reason to use tear gas on the crowd,” he said. “No one was threatening them in any way.”

Denton said he immediately began tearing up. His nose began running, and he felt like he was choking. He said the 20 or so people in the area included seniors, families with children and children outside at recess at an adjacent elementary school.

In a near West Side neighborhood a few miles away, Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes shared video appearing to show her being handcuffed as she confronted federal agents at a hospital. She said a resident had fallen and broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

Fuentes arrived after an emergency room staff member called to say there were ICE agents in the room with him. In the video, none of them answers when she asks if they have a signed warrant. One agent then says, “You need to leave,” and handcuffs her from behind as she repeats her question about a warrant and then says, “You’re hurting me.” Fuentes said agents escorted her outside and released her.

Noem participates in raid, engages in restroom dispute

Noem, alongside Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector, appeared on the Broadview building's roof, surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew while standing beside a sniper's post, according to footage shared online by conservative media personality Benny Johnson.

Johnson also posted video outside a Walmart store where he said agents, accompanied by Noem, had conducted a raid. Another video showed detainees in a parking lot where Noem noted “consequences for breaking the law and jeopardizing our law enforcement.""

Noem attempted to visit Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson at the village hall, but she was not there, and Noem was turned away when she asked to use the facilities.

“The city police wouldn’t even let us use the restroom,” she said in a video.

Broadview village spokesperson David Ormsby said Thompson later “returned her visit” at the ICE facility, where she too was refused access.

""We are distressed to hear that the bathrooms are unavailable at the ICE facility,” Ormsby said in a statement.

Governor decries anonymous, ‘inhumane’ tactics

Pritzker, the governor, lashed out at the Trump administration for the way federal agents, many of them masked to hide their faces, have treated protesters over the past month. He castigated officers’ “inhumane” tactics including slamming protesters to the ground, arresting a reporter and firing chemical agents into the crowds.

“It is clear federal agents cannot be trusted to act to protect the safety and constitutional rights of the public,” the Democrat said.

Pritzker also ordered state agencies to coordinate possible action to “hold federal agents accountable” for a raid on an apartment building in the city's South Shore neighborhood early this week in which residents, regardless of status and including children, were detained for hours, some handcuffed. Children were separated from their parents, while officers smashed windows and tore through apartments, leaving piles of debris in the hallways.

Homeland Security officials said 37 undocumented immigrants were arrested, some with criminal histories and two allegedly members of a criminal Venezuelan gang.

ACE President Ted Mitchell and others in the higher education community responded by noting that this is yet another instance of the administration weaponizing federal funding to achieve its ideological and political aims. They made clear that the goal of this effort is to pressure higher education leaders in ways that are wholly inappropriate and threatening to core concepts of academic freedom.

The compact acknowledges that “American higher education is the envy of the world and represents a key strategic benefit for our Nation.” It goes on to say that, “To advance the national interest arising out of this unique relationship, this Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education represents the priorities of the U.S. government in its engagements with universities that benefit from the relationship. Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits.”

It is not entirely clear just what federal funds and benefits might be withheld from institutions that elect not to sign the compact. May Mailman, senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told The Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration doesn’t plan to limit federal funding solely to schools that sign the compact but that they would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials.

The compact’s conditions include a range of major demands including that institutions: ban the use of race or sex in hiring and admissions; freeze tuition for five years; cap international undergrad enrollment at 15 percent; require that applicants take the SAT or a similar test; and quell grade inflation. It also focuses on issues around free speech, asking institutions to ensure a “vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” and change governance structures or close departments that “punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”

ACE’s Mitchell told The New York Times that the document seemed to him like a naked exercise of power, lacking internal coherence. He said that if institutions agreed to the compact, it would set “a horrible precedent to cede power to the federal government.”

Mitchell added in an interview with The Washington Post that the administration’s new initiative violates campus independence and undermines free speech. “It’s not worth the compromises that they would have to make,” he said. “This is a Faustian bargain.” And in other comments in USA Today, he added that, “Any effort to reward or punish institutions based on their adherence to the views of government officials should trouble all Americans.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times that the compact and its conditions are “extortion, plain and simple,” noting that a White House official indicated the administration wants to extend the compact to all institutions of higher education.

Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and Harvard University president, told The Washington Post that while “elite universities” need to undertake some reforms the compact is like trying to “fix a watch with a hammer—ill-conceived and counterproductive,” adding that, “The backlash against its crudity will likely set back necessary reform efforts.”

ACE Senior Vice President for Government Relations and National Engagement Jon Fansmith told The Chronicle of Higher Education that the compact might not hold up in court because it involves placing criteria into a grant program that gives an advantage for aligning with the administration’s priorities. In addition, some grant programs, as well as direct student loans and Pell Grants, have eligibility standards that are set in law, and it is not clear if the compact can circumvent that.",https://www.acenet.edu/PublishingImages/Photo-Library/White-House-Snow.jpg?RenditionID=14,N,,2025-10-03 23:56:50.077860

At times, protesters are interacting with city police, county deputies or federal agents, and each agency handles arrests differently, which makes it harder for the public and journalists to track what is exactly happening.

Arrests versus prosecutions

Most of the time, law enforcement around the ICE facility involves federal officers, who are responsible for securing the federal facility and enforcing federal law around the building, ranging from relatively minor charges, like trespassing, to more serious offenses, like assaulting a federal officer.

KGW has found that in many cases, those taken into federal custody aren't formally charged. Thus, people on the scene might hear of an arrest in the moment but never see it go to a courtroom.

For instance, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon announced Thursday morning that a woman was in federal court on a felony offense of assaulting a federal officer Tuesday night at the ICE facility.

According to court documents, the woman had ""applied red paint to the driveway of the ICE facility,"" and while being processed by federal officers, allegedly ""struck one."" That woman has been released pending further court proceedings.

In contrast, KGW also received a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, saying that six people were arrested for various offenses Tuesday night — but with no names or details.

Without names, KGW cannot track these arrests in the federal judicial system, and if they have not been booked and held at the Multnomah County Jail, KGW does not know if they are detained.

As with the case of the woman accused of putting red paint in front of the ICE building Tuesday, the U.S. Attorney's Office will sometimes later put out statements regarding cases they intend to prosecute. But those cases appear few compared to the number of people arrested or detained by federal officers.

According to an infographic shared by the FBI on Thursday, federal officers made one arrest at the ICE facility in the prior 24 hours, allegedly for destruction of federal property. The agency said it has 27 active and pending investigations, though they claim 128 arrests since June 9.

Still, Wamsley said ICE staff remain committed to their mission despite the unrest.
“That’s a force to be reckoned with.” Portland remains a flashpoint for unrest, with the ICE facility at the center of nightly confrontations.
The warnings follow an attack on an ICE facility in Dallas on Sept. 24.","Federal immigration officials say their Portland, Oregon, facility has come under nightly attack, with little help from local police because of political directives from city leaders.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Bill Melugin, Cammila Wamsley, director of Portland’s ICE office, said the facility has faced violence for more than 100 consecutive nights, with Portland police largely absent under guidance from the mayor and city council.

“I just, I can’t figure out what’s happening at the FDA. I’m totally baffled by it,” Wamsley said, describing her frustration at seeing federal staff attacked outside the building while officers inside lack jurisdiction to intervene. “It’s frustrating for us to watch people be attacked on the street and know that we don’t have the authority to be able to really step in unless there’s some nexus to federal law.”

She said nightly protests have escalated beyond chants and signs, with bottle rockets striking the ICE building, rocks shattering windows, lasers targeting officers’ eyes, and barricades blocking vehicles.

Wamsley said protesters have followed ICE staff members home and doxxed at least six employees.

“Later, towards the evening and around dark, there are a lot of folks that come up dressed in all black,” she explained. “They are here to wreak havoc. They’ll block our cars, throw paint, damage property, and even try to follow our folks home.”

She warned that when crowds swell quickly, the violence becomes more dangerous.

“We’ve seen it before. The folks here can go from a crowd of 50 to a crowd of 1,000 in 30 minutes,” she explained. “Sometimes we only have 20 officers here. We would not be able to defend the building with that show of force.”

Wamsley said the Portland Police Department has been slow to respond — and sometimes doesn’t respond at all — because of city policy. She explained that assaults have occurred outside and across the street from the building, but police have either taken too long to arrive or not shown up at all.

“That is not the stance they would take six blocks from here, but it is the stance they take with us because of guidance from the mayor and city council,” Wamsley said.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Portland mayor’s office and police department for comment.

Still, Wamsley said ICE staff remain committed to their mission despite the unrest.

“The people that work here are here to serve the American public,” she said. “They are here to enforce the same immigration laws we’ve had in place since the 1950s. Nothing has changed in that regard. We come to work every day. We do our job the way we have been doing it, and we’ll continue to do that.”

Todd Rignel, assistant special agent for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Oregon, said federal agencies are targeting Antifa-linked groups they blame for organizing much of the unrest.

“They’re not just facing HSI. They’re facing the FBI, ATF, DEA, IRS — all of these agencies,” he said. “That’s a force to be reckoned with.”

Portland remains a flashpoint for unrest, with the ICE facility at the center of nightly confrontations.

President Donald Trump announced plans to send 200 National Guard troops to Portland to support immigration authorities. Officials said the troops would be stationed near protest areas.

The court’s ruling came at a time of simmering tensions between the United States and Venezuela.
The Supreme Court has sided with the administration in almost every case it has been called upon to review since Mr Trump returned to the presidency in January.
“This is another win for the administration affirming what we have always maintained: Temporary Protected Status is, by definition, temporary.
“This is perhaps the most extreme sign that the Supreme Court has abandoned law for politics,” Prof Arulanantham said.","WASHINGTON - The US Supreme Court again cleared the way on Oct 3 for Donald Trump’s administration to revoke a temporary legal protection for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the United States, backing a key priority of the Republican president as he pursues a policy of mass deportations.

The justices granted the administration’s request to put on hold a judge’s ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted to the migrants under Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden while litigation proceeds.

The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Its three liberal justices dissented.

The court’s ruling came at a time of simmering tensions between the United States and Venezuela.

The TPS programme is a humanitarian designation under US law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the United States deportation protection and access to work permits.

The Supreme Court previously sided with the administration in May to lift a temporary order that San Francisco-based US District Judge Edward Chen had issued at an earlier stage of the case that halted the TPS termination while a legal challenge by TPS holders and an advocacy group played out.

Judge Chen issued a final ruling on Sept 5, finding that Ms Noem’s actions to terminate the programme violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies.

The judge’s ruling meant that more than 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders would be able to remain in the country for now, even though Ms Noem had determined that to be “contrary to the national interest,” according to the administration.

The Supreme Court said in an unsigned order on Oct 3 that although the litigation had advanced to a later stage, “the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not. The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here.”

“I view today’s decision as yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,” liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a sole dissenting opinion.

The court, Ms Jackson wrote, is “privileging the bald assertion of unconstrained executive power” over judgments made by lower courts that these 300,000 people should not be “left vulnerable to job loss, family separation and deportation” to Venezuela until the legality of the administration’s actions is fully resolved.

Ms Jackson noted that the US government in January concluded that Venezuela was experiencing a humanitarian crisis.

“We once again use our equitable power (but not our opinion-writing capacity) to allow this administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible,” Ms Jackson added.

Mr Trump’s administration has repeatedly turned to the Supreme Court’s emergency docket to ask the justices in 2025 to allow implementation of his policies that have been impeded by lower courts.

In contrast to the court’s regular work, these decisions are made quickly, without the benefit of oral arguments and extensive written briefing.

The Supreme Court has sided with the administration in almost every case it has been called upon to review since Mr Trump returned to the presidency in January.

“This is another win for the administration affirming what we have always maintained: Temporary Protected Status is, by definition, temporary. It was never intended to be a pathway to permanent status or legal residency,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said after the decision.

Judge Chen also faulted Ms Noem’s “discriminatory statements” concerning the Venezuelans, noting that her generalisation of the alleged crimes of a few migrants “to the entire population of Venezuelan TPS holders, who have lower rates of criminality and higher rates of college education and workforce participation than the general population, is a classic form of racism.”

Lawyers for the plaintiffs decried the Supreme Court’s decision.

“The court is throwing aside its standards to green light the Trump administration’s lawless actions. The damage to the rule of law as well as directly affected American families is profound,” said Ms Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped represent the plaintiffs.

The decision also extends the Supreme Court’s emergency power “to the final judgments of lower courts, beyond mere interim rulings,” added Professor Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of a UCLA immigration law centre and another lawyer for the plaintiffs.

“This is perhaps the most extreme sign that the Supreme Court has abandoned law for politics,” Prof Arulanantham said.

Mr Trump has made cracking down on immigration - legal and illegal - a central plank of his second term as president, and has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees.

The US government under Mr Biden designated Venezuelans as eligible for TPS in 2021 and 2023.

Just days before Mr Trump returned to office in January, Mr Biden’s administration announced an extension of the programme to October 2026.

Ms Noem, a Trump appointee, rescinded that extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who had benefited from the 2023 designation.

The San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put Judge Chen’s final ruling on hold, prompting criticism from the administration, which said it amounted to defiance of the Supreme Court given the prior action by the justices in the case.

On Saturday afternoon, Attorney General Pam Bondi warned of plans to send additional federal agents to ICE facilities around the country.
“In addition to their inhumane tactics on immigration enforcement, they have grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility,"" the spokesperson said.
Broadview police launched three criminal investigations at the ICE facility, including two alleged hit-and-run cases and a criminal damage to property incident.
''As a local law enforcement official, I have to have faith that federal law enforcement partners will cooperate with us in this investigation,'' said Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills.","Illinois police officers in riot gear, new concrete barriers and a designated protest zone were seen at the Broadview ICE facility Friday as demonstrations continued following weeks of heightened tensions outside the building.

U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Border Control Commander Greg Bovino could be seen visiting the building as protesters and agents once again clashed, resulting in numerous arrests.

""We're fighting fascism, literally. They call Chicago a war zone and yet they're the ones bringing guns,"" one protester, a Marine veteran who served overseas, told NBC Chicago at the scene.

Illinois State Police officers wore riot gear, federal agents lined the roof of the facility, and officers from the Cook County Sheriff's office and Broadview Police Department were present, marking one of the largest law enforcement responses to the area since protesting began. State and local officers were assisting with maintaining a perimeter and monitoring street closures.

As of 4 p.m., five arrests had been made, according a unified command coordinating public safety at the site. Of the arrests, three people were apprehended for resisting and obstruction, while two people were accused of aggravated battery of a police officer.

Demonstrations began early Friday morning on both sides of the building, including in a new designated protest area, which was requested by state and local law enforcement due to safety concerns and is situated more than a block away from the building.

The Broadview facility, being used by the Trump administration for the immigration campaign known as ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" has frequently been the site of escalating clashes between protesters and armed guards, with reports of agents using tear gas, pepper spray and other chemical agents.

In the past few weeks, NBC 5 reporters have witnessed tensions escalate between agents and protesters at the facility. Some protesters have been thrown to the ground and arrested; others were hit with pepper balls and tear gas. DHS told NBC Chicago protesters have lit fireworks and trespassed, adding they have been violent toward ICE agents.

On Saturday afternoon, Attorney General Pam Bondi warned of plans to send additional federal agents to ICE facilities around the country. Days later, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said 100 military personnel would be sent to Illinois at the direction of the Department of Homeland Security.

A spokesperson for Pritzker, in a statement released Friday, accused federal agents of ""acting with impunity"" at the scene.

“In addition to their inhumane tactics on immigration enforcement, they have grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility,"" the spokesperson said. ""This includes firing chemical agents at protesters and media, arresting a reporter, slamming people to the ground, and wreaking havoc on Broadview residents and nearby businesses.""

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson, at a news conference on Tuesday, denounced what she said were displays of force at the facility in the western Chicago suburb and called for the removal of added fencing near the building.

""This extreme response is not only violating the rights of protesters but is actively endangering nearby Broadview residents and hampering the essential work of the village's first responders,"" she said.

Broadview police launched three criminal investigations at the ICE facility, including two alleged hit-and-run cases and a criminal damage to property incident.

''As a local law enforcement official, I have to have faith that federal law enforcement partners will cooperate with us in this investigation,'' said Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills. ''We will do our best, we will leave no stone unturned. We will continue to visit that facility, requesting to speak to people.”

NBC 5 reached out to DHS and received a statement from an ICE spokesperson, saying in part the ''Broadview Processing Center continues to face violence and unlawful activity by rioters. The relentless actions of these individuals — and their attempts to obstruct the enforcement of federal law — are unacceptable.”

The statement goes on to say, “We have repeatedly requested assistance from state and local law enforcement, including your own police department, to disperse these unlawful assemblies. Instead, local inaction has enabled agitators to escalate violence and placed federal officers, first responders, and Broadview residents in harm’s way.”

Broadview police said they have responded to the facility and alleged that officers have been verbally insulted by federal agents and exposed to chemicals.

Meanwhile, some local politicians joining protesters at the scene Friday expressed concern about conditions inside the facility.

“We are gathered here in solidarity and perseverance, to demand transparency, to know what is happening behind those boarded up windows, and to allow elected officials Delia Ramirez and Chuy Garcia to inspect the facility like they are allowed to by law,"" Illinois congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh said.

At a press conference on Monday, Eréndira Rendón, vice president of immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project, delivered an emotional statement calling out what she said were ""inhumane conditions"" inside the Broadview facility.⁠

""Right now in Broadview, there are 200 people in a place that is not a detention center,"" Rendón said. ""They are being held in inhumane conditions. There are no beds, there are no showers, there is limited food. They order children's meals from Subway to eat. We are not allowed to speak to any of our clients that are held in that facility. It is a black hole, and people go missing for days. People are being forced to sign their voluntary departure forms, and their families are being denied access to them.""

In a statement to NBC Chicago, DHS denied claims of overcrowding.

""Any claim that there is overcrowding or subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers,"" the statement read. ""As we arrest and remove criminal illegal aliens and public safety threats from the U.S., ICE has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding. Secretary Noem has called on states and local government to help with bed and detention space capacity.""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/10/IMG_2688.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-03 20:59:25.556237

Secretary Mayorkas’s extension applied to two prior designations of TPS for Venezuela – one issued in 2021 and a second issued in 2023.

On January 28, new DHS Secretary Noem announced that she was vacating Secretary Mayorkas’s extension. The vacatur meant that TPS for Venezuela would revert to its prior expiration dates of April 2, 2025 (for the 2023 designation) and September 10, 2025 (for the 2021 designation), while Secretary Noem decided whether to extend protections in her own right. Shortly thereafter, the Secretary made the decision not to further extend the 2023 designation and specified April 7, 2025 as the date that 2023 Venezuela TPS benefits would expire.

The Supreme Court issued a May 2025 emergency ruling that meant the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation was deemed terminated as of early April, while litigation continued. However, on September 5, in National TPS Alliance et al. v. Noem et al. (N.D. Cal., No. 3:25-cv-01766), the federal district court granted summary judgment in favor of TPS plaintiffs, finding that DHS’s vacatur and termination of the 2023 TPS designation were unlawful, and setting those actions aside under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). DHS filed an appeal of that September 5 district court order with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and with the U.S. Supreme Court. The Ninth Circuit denied the government’s request to stay the lower court decision while it continued to hear the appeal on the merits. Today, however, the Supreme Court granted the government’s stay request, permitting DHS to enforce the early April termination date for the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation.

While appeals of the September 5 district court reinstatement decision continue, DHS will be permitted to take enforcement action against former beneficiaries of the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation, including placement of these individuals in removal proceedings. Employers of affected foreign nationals should contact their Fragomen professional or the firm’s Government Strategies and Compliance Group for counsel.

As a reminder, DHS announced that it would not extend the 2021 Venezuela TPS designation that was scheduled to expire on September 10, but would grant a transition period through November 7, 2025 for these beneficiaries.

Officials said last month that a gunman who opened fire on an ICE facility in Dallas had searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.

Bondi has previously said that crowdsourced apps that allow people to communicate about the location of law enforcement officers is not allowed - specifically referring to ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron in a July interview on Fox News.

""We are looking at him and he better watch out because that's not a protected speech,"" Bondi said at the time.

But advocates say that tracking ICE activity is a form of free speech protected by the First amendment. They maintain that such platforms are primarily used among individuals looking to protect themselves from surprise raids or potential harassment from immigration officials.

The Health and Human Services Department’s Administration for Children and Families emailed migrant shelters saying children 14 years of age and older would get $2,500 each, according to a copy obtained by The Associated Press.

The Trump administration offered to “provide a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500 … to unaccompanied alien children, 14 years of age and older, who have elected to voluntarily depart the United States as of the date of this notice and moving forward,” adding that the “benefit is intended to support reintegration efforts following departure,” according to CNN, who also reviewed a copy of the correspondence.

Children were given 24 hours to respond without penalty for declining to return to their home country, per the AP.

Shelter directors, however, were asked to acknowledge the offer within four hours.

“This voluntary option gives UACs [unaccompanied alien children] a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future,” Emily Covington, the assistant director from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Public Affairs said in a statement to The Hill.

“Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin. Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option,” she added.

Officials from ICE said the opportunity is first being offered to 17-year-olds. It follows a May offer from the Trump administration to allow adult migrants to self-deport using a government app in exchange for a $1,000 payment.

However, migrant advocates say the offer unfairly targets minors who are unable to weigh the permanent consequences of self removal.

“Voluntary departure has always been an option for unaccompanied children and when this option is explained by an attorney who has the child’s best interest in mind, the risks and benefits can be fully explored,” Neha Desai, managing director of Children’s Human Rights & Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law, said in a statement to CNN.

“There is no legitimate reason for the government to affirmatively provide children with this option and incentivize it with a financial payoff,” Desai added.

Migrant children have faced increased uncertainty in recent months as the Trump administration attempted to revoke funding for legal aid to unaccompanied children provided by the Department of Health and Human Services.

A judge ultimately blocked the stop-work order aimed at ceasing funding for migrant youth in an effort to protect individuals under the age of 18 as outlined in the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008.

“Children who arrive in the U.S. unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians have often survived targeted violence, abuse, persecution, or trafficking. Legal providers working with these children provide a critical safeguard in protecting them from further harm or exploitation,” the Acacia Center for Justice said in a statement.

“Particularly at a time when the administration is expediting removal proceedings that force people through our nation’s deportation system at an alarming rate, legal services for vulnerable children are more crucial than ever.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/659dc3330e1ea7.53960913-e1759529787277.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-03 19:56:35.590939

“We just received a message from Apple’s App Review that #ICEBlock has been removed from the App Store due to ‘objectionable content’,” the app’s social media team said in a post on the platform BlueSky. “The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure from the Trump Admin. We have responded and we’ll fight this!”

The move marks a rare instance of an app being taken down due to demands from the US government, raising concerns about pressure on private companies and limits to free speech.

ICEBlock is a free iPhone-only app that allows users to anonymously report and track Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity.

It was developed in April in response to President Trump’s hardline immigration agenda and the recent increase in ICE arrests.

ICE has been a central part of Trump’s push for mass deportation since he took office for a second term. Its agents have regularly raided workplaces, homes and courthouses to arrest migrants, and rights advocates say free speech and due process are often being infringed upon in the government’s deportation drive.

Apple’s decision to remove the ICEBlock app from its platform has also shed light on the growing ties between major tech firms and the Trump administration. Many companies, including the iPhone maker, have sought to avoid clashes with a White House that has not been shy about issuing threats — particularly around tariffs — against specific firms.

“Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store,” Apple said in an emailed statement.

Fox Business first reported the app’s removal on Thursday, citing a statement from US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who said the Department of Justice contacted Apple and that the company complied with its request to pull the app.

“ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed,” Bondi told Fox Business.

Joshua Aaron, the Texas-based creator of ICEBlock, disputed that characterisation and criticised Apple’s decision.

“I am incredibly disappointed by Apple’s actions today. Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move,” Aaron told the Reuters news agency.

David Greene, the civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a digital rights group, said the move underscored a pattern of government overreach.

“It is not surprising — they have been threatening this for a while and we do expect to see more of this and other blatantly unconstitutional actions going forward,” Greene told Al Jazeera.

The Trump administration has shown “little to no regard” for the rule of law, Greene explained, pointing out that the app’s activities are protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution, which enshrines the right to free speech.

He also argued that the public should know how its government is operating, particularly when it comes to sensitive issues like immigration. But, Greene added, the Trump administration has “never sincerely cared about the free flow of information”.

“Publishing truthful information about matters of public interest is worthy of the highest level of First Amendment protection, and the operations of government, and the identities of who the operators are, is certainly a matter of high public interest,” Greene said.

‘Watch out’

Bondi, however, has previously argued that Aaron is “not protected” under the Constitution and that they are looking at prosecuting him, warning him to “watch out”.

Civilian surveillance of federal immigration agents has become more assertive in recent months, as activists try to protect their communities from aggressive enforcement by ICE agents.

Since Trump returned to office, ICE has ramped up its enforcement efforts, and a bill passed in July has assured the agency of $75bn in new funding through 2029.

The agency has also arrested visa holders and permanent US residents targeted by the Trump administration over pro-Palestinian advocacy.

In one high-profile case, Mahmoud Khalil, a US resident of Palestinian origin, was arrested after serving as a spokesperson for the antiwar protests at Columbia University, a move that rights groups condemned as intimidation.

While Khalil was released from detention in June, he continues to face deportation proceedings. In September, an immigration judge in Louisiana ordered his deportation, though Khalil has 30 days to appeal.

Legal experts have said that civilian surveillance of ICE is largely protected under the US Constitution, as long as observers do not try to obstruct law enforcement activities.

Apple removed more than 1,700 apps from its App Store in 2024 in response to government demands, but the vast majority of those requests — more than 1,300 — came from China.

Russia filed the second-highest number of demands, at 171, followed by South Korea with 79.

Over the last three years, the US was typically not among the countries where apps were removed due to government demands, according to company transparency reports.

A majority of Apple’s iPhones are manufactured in China, making the company particularly sensitive to tariff policies.

San Diego City Attorney Heather Ferbert said in a statement, ""Here in San Diego, our residents face real risks from wildfires, flooding, earthquakes, and other disasters.
These unlawful conditions jeopardize our ability to keep San Diego families safe, and we are taking action to ensure our city continues to receive the resources needed to protect our communities.""

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Northern California alleges the federal government has threatened to withhold more than $350 million in Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency grants unless the municipalities assist in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts, as well as abandon their own diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

The San Diego City Attorney's Office says that locally, those funds support wildfire and flood prevention projects, counterterrorism emergency response efforts, port and transit security infrastructure, and fire department staffing.

The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing the federal government from imposing any such conditions and a declaration that states those conditions are unconstitutional.

The complaint states that the local governments ""now face a choice that is not only untenable and unlawful, but also urgent: either accept conditions that are unconstitutional and contrary to law, or lose millions of dollars in federal grant funding used to keep their residents safe and ensure continuity of government.""

San Diego City Attorney Heather Ferbert said in a statement, ""Here in San Diego, our residents face real risks from wildfires, flooding, earthquakes, and other disasters. Federal preparedness funding is meant to save lives, not advance a political agenda. These unlawful conditions jeopardize our ability to keep San Diego families safe, and we are taking action to ensure our city continues to receive the resources needed to protect our communities.""

The city of San Diego is also part of separate, but similar litigation filed earlier this year alleging that funds for key city services in the form of Department of Transportation and U.S. Housing and Urban Development grants are being threatened unless the city and other local governments adhere to Trump administration policies.

Individuals will be required to obtain an approved special government interest airspace waiver to fly drones or other aircraft, the notice adds.
However, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the FAA restriction may limit potential documentation for journalists and residents alike.

Individuals will be required to obtain an approved special government interest airspace waiver to fly drones or other aircraft, the notice adds. Those found violating the restriction face risk seizure, damage or destruction of their property.

Upon inquiry, a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesperson said measures were taken after the agency received a “credible threat of small, unmanned aircraft systems being used against law enforcement during Midway Blitz.”

Midway Blitz is an operation led by the DHS to arrest and deport immigrants in the Chicago area who lack permanent legal status.

Hundreds have been arrested at the raids, which began in early September. Local residents said they have been subject to the military’s removal of men, women and children from their apartment homes while they were naked, according to reports from WBEZ.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) said Monday that Illinois National Guard soldiers were told 100 troops would be deployed throughout the state.

Amid concerns, the Democratic governor has encouraged citizens to record military interactions to attest to their treatment.

However, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the FAA restriction may limit potential documentation for journalists and residents alike.

“The FAA’s ‘temporary flight restriction’ (TFR) comes amid abusive immigration raids in Chicago and President Trump’s authoritarian flooding of the city with National Guard troops and federal law enforcement agents,” the ACLU wrote in a statement.

“That raises the sharp suspicion that it is intended not to ensure the safety of government aircraft, but (along with violence, harassment, and claims of “doxing”) is yet another attempt to prevent reporters and citizens from recording the activities of the authorities,” it added.

A three-judge panel of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an injunction won by Democratic-led states and immigrant rights advocates that stopped the Republican president's executive order from taking effect.

Trump's order, issued on his first day back in office on January 20, directs agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of U.S.-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, also known as a ""green card"" holder.

The principle of birthright citizenship has been recognized in the U.S. for more than 150 years, deriving from the 14th Amendment that states that anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen.

Another appeals court, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in July similarly upheld a nationwide injunction blocking Trump's order from taking effect on the grounds that it violated the citizenship clause of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment.

The administration last week asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its appeal in that case and a related one. If the Supreme Court agrees, it would mark the second time the litigation is before the high court, after its 6 to 3 conservative majority in June limited the power of judges to block that and other actions by Trump on a nationwide basis.

The Supreme Court at that time did not weigh in on the validity of Trump's birthright citizenship order. But in three cases where judges had declared it unconstitutional, the court limited the ability of judges to issue so-called universal injunctions and directed lower courts that had blocked Trump's policy nationally to reconsider the scope of their orders.

The Supreme Court's ruling opened the door to Trump's order taking effect in parts of the country, fueling uncertainty for immigrants and states grappling with the implications of a potentially patchwork system of citizenship rules. Yet in the months since, lower-court judges have repeatedly blocked it from being implemented anywhere in the country.

The 1st Circuit was reviewing a ruling by U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, who ruled in favor of 18 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia in February.

After the Supreme Court's June ruling, he reaffirmed his original decision to halt the policy nationwide.

He said a patchwork approach to citizenship would generate confusion, given the substantial movement of noncitizen parents and children between states and the impact Trump's order would have on administering social services to them.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/15/USAT/83644868007-xxx-usat-1284548-433204.JPG?crop=5622,3159,x2,y98&width=3200&height=1799&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-03 21:00:01.798061

States use these funds to assist nearly 9 million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year.
Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to States based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
These grants will continue to be provided to states with no requirement that States assist DHS in immigration enforcement.
In addition to New Jersey, this lawsuit is being co-led by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha.","After leading a multi-state lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin today announced that the DOJ will remove illegal conditions on over $1.3 billion in Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants. Earlier this year, the Trump Administration, disregarding the clear letter of the law and intent of Congress, has declared that States will be unable to access these funds – used to support victims and survivors of crimes – unless they accede to the Trump Administration’s demands that States assist in federal immigration enforcement.

“When the Trump Administration recklessly attempted to mistreat victims of crime in New Jersey and across the country, we took action and led a 20 Attorney General coalition to ensure continued funding under the Victims of Crime Act,” said Attorney General Platkin. “Now the Trump Department of Justice has agreed to drop illegal conditions on this critical funding, which will ensure that advocacy services, sexual assault forensic exams, medical and funeral expenses, and other critical resources for victims of crimes will continue to be available. While this fight over DOJ’s unlawful and politicized use of grant conditions is not yet over, I am glad to have achieved this significant victory for our residents alongside our coalition.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable States to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives: victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more. These funding streams—totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide—have long ensured that States could fulfill their most fundamental duties: to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents. States use these funds to assist nearly 9 million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year. Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to States based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump Administration, through the DOJ, previously declared that States, along with the victims and survivors they serve, would be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the Administration’s political agenda – namely its immigration enforcement priorities. In order to receive these funds, States were told that they must assist the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with civil immigration enforcement efforts – a federal, not state, government responsibility.

Following the lawsuit brought forward by the coalition, the DOJ has abandoned its plans to impose these conditions on $178 million in VOCA Victim Assistance grants and $1.2 billion in VOCA Victim Compensation grants. These grants will continue to be provided to states with no requirement that States assist DHS in immigration enforcement.

In addition to New Jersey, this lawsuit is being co-led by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha. It is joined by the Attorneys General of Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

On Friday, the court’s conservative majority granted the administration’s request to put on hold a judge’s ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted to the migrants under Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden while litigation proceeds.

The Supreme Court previously sided with the administration in May to lift a temporary order that San Francisco-based District Judge Edward Chen issued at an earlier stage of the case.

“The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here,” the conservative majority wrote Friday in an unsigned order.

Some migrants have lost their jobs and homes, while others have been detained and deported after the justices stepped in the first time, lawyers for the migrants told the court.

The court’s three liberal justices dissented from Friday’s decision.

“I view today’s decision as yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote. “Because, respectfully, I cannot abide our repeated, gratuitous and harmful interference with cases pending in the lower courts while lives hang in the balance, I dissent.”

Chen’s May ruling had halted the TPS termination while the litigation played out in court. He also issued a final ruling on September 5, finding that Noem’s actions to terminate the programme had violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies.

The judge also faulted Noem’s “discriminatory statements” concerning the Venezuelans, noting that she had generalised the alleged crimes of a few migrants “to the entire population of Venezuelan TPS holders”, calling her remarks a “classic form of racism”.

He added that members of that population “have lower rates of criminality and higher rates of college education and workforce participation than the general population”.

Chen’s ruling meant that more than 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders would be able to remain in the country for now, even though Noem had determined their stay to be “contrary to the national interest”, according to the administration.

Trump has made cracking down on immigration – legal and illegal – a central plank of his second term as president, and he has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees.

The TPS programme is a humanitarian designation under US law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients protection from deportation and access to work permits.

The US government under Biden designated Venezuelans as eligible for TPS in 2021 and 2023. Just days before Trump returned to office in January, Biden’s administration announced an extension of the programme to October 2026.

Noem, a Trump appointee, rescinded that extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who had benefitted from the 2023 designation.

The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put Chen’s final ruling on hold, prompting criticism from the administration.

Trump officials argued that the decision amounted to defiance of the Supreme Court, given its prior action in the case.

“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court’s orders on the emergency docket,” the Department of Justice told the Supreme Court in its filing.

Some lower courts have expressed confusion and frustration in recent weeks as they attempt to follow Supreme Court emergency orders that often are issued with little or no legal reasoning presented.

“This court’s orders are binding on litigants and lower courts. Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them – as the lower courts did here – is unacceptable,” the Justice Department said.

In another case, the Supreme Court on May 30 let the administration revoke a different type of temporary legal status, “humanitarian parole”, for 532,000 Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan migrants.

Humanitarian parole is a form of temporary permission under US law to be in the country for “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit”, allowing recipients to live and work in the country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25241626462111-1759525674.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-03 18:57:44.648395

The court’s opinion was clear that Trump’s order, which denies citizenship to children born in the United States if their parents are undocumented or on temporary visas, directly conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment.
“Under both the Citizenship Clause and § 1401(a), such persons are citizens at birth,” the court ruled.
Multiple courts have already blocked Trump’s order as unconstitutional.
With Friday’s First Circuit ruling, the legal consensus that the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil and no president can order it away is only growing stronger.","In a major blow to President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, the First Circuit Court of Appeals flatly rejected the administration’s attempt to enforce his executive order ending birthright citizenship.

The three-judge panel unanimously refused to lift a lower court injunction, meaning the order remains blocked and federal officials are barred from enforcing the order while appeals continue.

Chief Judge David Barron, appointed by former President Barack Obama, writing for the court and joined by Judges Julie Rikelman and Seth Aframe, stressed that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment leaves no room for Trump’s interpretation. The court’s opinion was clear that Trump’s order, which denies citizenship to children born in the United States if their parents are undocumented or on temporary visas, directly conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment.

“Under both the Citizenship Clause and § 1401(a), such persons are citizens at birth,” the court ruled. “We thus conclude that the plaintiffs are exceedingly likely to succeed in showing that the Executive Order conflicts with both the Citizenship Clause and § 1401(a).”

Section 1401(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act codifies birthright citizenship into federal law.

Multiple courts have already blocked Trump’s order as unconstitutional.

The Ninth Circuit, in a decision this summer, affirmed that a president “was not granted the power to modify or change any clause of the United States Constitution” and agreed with a district court that denying citizenship to people born in the U.S. is “unconstitutional.” While in New Hampshire, a federal court certified a nationwide class action and barred enforcement, protecting “the citizenship rights of all children born on U.S. soil.”

Trump is now pinning his hopes on the Supreme Court, where his Justice Department petitioned the justices last week to overturn these lower court decisions and greenlight his order.

The case is New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support v. Donald J. Trump.

The First Circuit Court of Appeals decision stems from a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of New Hampshire, ACLU of Maine, ACLU of Massachusetts, Asian Law Caucus, Democracy Defenders Fund, and Legal Defense Fund on behalf of New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), and Make the Road New York.

This ruling is the latest in a series of court decisions rejecting President Trump’s executive order since it was signed on January 20, Inauguration Day. This lawsuit was filed within two hours of Trump signing the order. In February, the federal judge in this case temporarily blocked it from taking effect, prompting the appeal, which was heard August 1.

(In addition, the attorneys in this lawsuit filed a second related case, Barbara v. Donald J. Trump, following the Supreme Court’s June ruling limiting the use of nationwide injunctions in three other challenges to the executive order. In Barbara, a federal court certified a class of all babies subject to the executive order and blocked its enforcement against them. The government has sought Supreme Court review in Barbara, along with a case brought by Washington and other states.)

In a related decision also rejecting the Executive Order that it issued simultaneously, the First Circuit said: “The ‘lessons of history’ . . . give us every reason to be wary of now blessing this most recent effort to break with our established tradition of recognizing birthright citizenship and to make citizenship depend on the actions of one's parents rather than -- in all but the rarest of circumstances -- the simple fact of being born in the United States.”

“This ruling is the latest rebuke of President Trump’s blatantly unconstitutional efforts to end birthright citizenship,” said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, who argued the case. “In fact, not one judge has bought the administration’s flawed arguments. The government is now petitioning the Supreme Court in hopes of getting a different answer. But the Constitution is clear, and we will keep fighting this lawless order until it is struck down once and for all.”

“The federal appeals court today reinforced that this executive order is a flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution — and we agree,” said SangYeob Kim, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire. “Our Constitution is clear: no politician can decide who among those born in this country is worthy of citizenship.”

“The Constitution has always been clear — if you are born here, you’re a citizen. Today’s decision upholds not just the letter of the law but also the promise of America,” said Aarti Kohli, executive director of Asian Law Caucus. “For generations, immigrant families have built lives and contributed to this country because birthright citizenship means that you belong here. We will continue fighting against this administration’s unconstitutional attempts to strip away the rights that define American citizenship.”

“This ruling is another decisive blow against the blatantly unlawful effort to gut the fundamental constitutional rights of American citizens and their immigrant families.” said Tianna Mays, legal director of Democracy Defenders Fund. “Birthright citizenship has been a clear principle of U.S. law for over a century and no president can change that with the stroke of a pen.”

“Today's decision affirms that birthright citizenship is not subject to shifting political winds. Every child born on U.S. soil is a citizen of the United States. We are incredibly pleased with the court's decision and we will continue fighting to ensure that this constitutional right is not undermined,” said Ashley Burrell, senior counsel at the Legal Defense Fund.

“As the Trump administration continues its crusade to attack immigrants, once more, this ruling affirms a constitutional right: U.S.-born children cannot be stripped of their U.S. citizenship. In recent months, we have seen this administration's repeated attempts to sidestep the Constitution, take away people’s rights, and endanger the foundations of our democracy. We remain steadfast in our commitment to challenge these unlawful actions and defend our communities,” said Harold Solis, co-legal director of Make the Road New York.",https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/themes/aclu-wp/img/content-types/fallback-press-release.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 18:57:04.767239
,Policy,2025-10-03 21:31:13+00:00,the Guardian,Republican bill targets migrants who re-enter US illegally with mandatory 10-year sentences,"Guardian staff, Roque Planas",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/03/republicans-bill-prison-sentence-immigration,"For those who commit a crime punishable by up to two years in prison, the mandatory minimum jumps to 10 years.
That’s the same mandatory minimum imposed on people convicted for sex-trafficking children.
The bill targets offenders facing prosecution for illegally crossing the border after removal, a crime known as “illegal re-entry”.
Those figures would probably be much higher now, because the Trump administration prosecutes illegal re-entry cases more aggressively than the Biden administration did.
While the Republican-majority House of Representatives passed the bill easily, HR3486 gained less liberal backing than the last major immigration bill passed by Congress.","Republicans members of Congress have rallied behind a new approach to deterring unauthorized immigration – jailing migrants for a decade at a time.

The GOP has toyed with the idea of imposing mandatory minimums on immigration offenses for a decade, most famously with a proposal called “Kate’s Law”, which would have imposed five-year sentences on those convicted of illegal re-entry with certain criminal histories.

But the new Stop Illegal Entry Act took that idea and ran with it, imposing a mandatory minimum of five years in prison for anyone who enters the US illegally and then commits a crime punishable by more than one year in prison. For those who commit a crime punishable by up to two years in prison, the mandatory minimum jumps to 10 years. That’s the same mandatory minimum imposed on people convicted for sex-trafficking children.

The bill passed the House of Representatives on 11 September, largely along party lines, with the support of 11 Democrats and the White House. Ted Cruz, the Republican Texas senator, is now trying to shepherd the measure through the Senate.

Mike Johnson, the Republican US house speaker, applauded the bill in a statement as a “commonsense” deterrent against “those who repeatedly and deliberately violate US immigration law.”

But criminal justice groups describe the bill, HR3486, as a wildly impractical measure that would shunt tens of thousands of people into prisons for a non-violent offense over the next few years, while logjamming the federal courts – at a cost of roughly $440,000 for every person incarcerated, according to an estimate from the Federal Public and Community Defenders Legislative Committee.

The measure would impose draconian new penalties on defendants that often have urgent reasons for migrating to the US, criminal justice reformers say – like attempting to reunite with family members here or escaping violence or poverty in their country of origin.

“This is a mass incarceration bill,” said Jesse Franzblau, the associate director for policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. “It’s really a handout to private prison companies just to lock up more people. It should be outright rejected by anyone who believes in any semblance of due process when it comes to immigration or law enforcement.”

HR3486 would also impact a staggering number of people. The bill targets offenders facing prosecution for illegally crossing the border after removal, a crime known as “illegal re-entry”. Under current law, crossing the border without authorization is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months for the first offense and up to two years for subsequent offenses. Federal prosecutors may also charge illegal re-entry as a felony punishable by up to two years, with enhancements that can theoretically extend the penalty up to 20 years – though in practice such prolonged sentences are rare.

It’s not entirely clear how many defendants would be subjected to mandatory minimums if HR3486 became law, but current trends indicate that the number is well into the thousands. The Federal Public and Community Defenders Legislative Committee estimated that 7,000 people would easily get slapped with 10-year mandatory minimum sentences under the proposed law, based on 2024 statistics. Those figures would probably be much higher now, because the Trump administration prosecutes illegal re-entry cases more aggressively than the Biden administration did.

The Congressional Budget Office has not yet scored HR3486. The US Sentencing Commission estimated that the comparatively modest Kate’s Law would have inflated the federal inmate population by 57,000 over five years.

It’s common for people facing illegal re-entry charges to have previous immigration convictions on their records, some of which would invoke a 10-year mandatory minimum under the proposed law. Immigration offenses account for more than half of the federal criminal caseload, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse database, with illegal entry and re-entry cases accounting for the lion’s share.

The possibility of adding thousands of new inmates to federal prisons on decade-long sentences would have a massive impact on the Bureau of Prisons, whose total inmate population stands at approximately 155,000.

“The cascading effects of subjecting thousands of individuals to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence cannot be overstated,” reads a letter to congressional leaders penned by the Federal Public and Community Defenders Legislative Committee. “The entire system would be driven by the demands of section 1326 [illegal re-entry] cases, at the expense of violent crimes and other offenses that pose a far greater threat to public safety.”

Criminal justice and legal groups also warn that the bill could paralyze the federal courts. Nearly all illegal entry and re-entry cases are convicted through plea deals with reduced sentences in order to shuttle them quickly through the system.

But it wouldn’t make sense to plead guilty to a crime carrying a 10-year mandatory prison sentence.

“If this passed, the federal courts would implode,’’ said Kara Hartzler, an attorney with Federal Defenders of San Diego. “No one would have any incentive to take a plea. Suddenly the number of cases that go to trial would just go through the roof. Any court that has a significant number of these prosecutions would just be completely overwhelmed.”

Illegal re-entry cases are prosecuted across the country, though the vast majority of defendants face charges in jurisdictions that lie near the US-Mexico border. The House version of the bill was sponsored by Republicans who in most cases live far from the courts most likely to be affected – Republican representatives Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, Ryan Zinke of Montana, Brad Knott of North Carolina, Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, and Brandon Gill of Texas.

While the bill would impose massive costs, it’s unlikely to accomplish its goal, critics say. Many migrants who cross into the US are already risking their lives. A strong body of research indicates that mandatory minimums do not deter offenders, according to Liz Komar, a lawyer with the the Sentencing Project.

“When we look at the research on deterrence, it’s really about the certainty of punishment, not the severity,” Komar said. “It’s a well-established criminological principle at this point. That’s in terms of talking about actual crime, actual public safety concerns. What we’re talking about here, though, is really about migration.”

It remains to be seen whether Cruz will have enough bipartisan support to push the bill through the Senate. While the Republican-majority House of Representatives passed the bill easily, HR3486 gained less liberal backing than the last major immigration bill passed by Congress. That measure, the Laken Riley Act, garnered four dozen Democratic votes in the House and 12 Democratic votes in the Senate.

Cruz would need the support of all GOP senators, plus at least seven Democrats or independents to hit the 60-vote threshold needed to bring the Stop Illegal Entry Act to a vote on the Senate floor.

That doesn’t mean the bill is dead. Republican supporters could still find a way to tack the measure to must-pass legislation. And the fact that the bill made it this far suggests that Congress may see more attempts to saddle immigration offenses with mandatory minimums in the future, Komar said.

“Even if this bill does not progress in the Senate, it’s part of a broader trend of normalizing mandatory minimums – particularly in the context of immigration,” Komar said. “And even a more modest bill could have dramatic impacts that the Bureau of Prisons does not have the capacity to handle and which will not benefit public safety.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce0b0f58a0e622d44b875972c91db8aa2b634043/379_0_3785_3029/master/3785.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=df7db672bb5fef2d84a7717171612b03",N,,2025-10-03 17:57:28.710942

The justices granted the administration's request to put on hold a judge's ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted to the migrants under Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden while litigation proceeds.

The Supreme Court previously sided with the administration in May to lift a temporary order that San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Edward Chen issued at an earlier stage of the case that had halted the TPS termination while the litigation played out in court. Chen issued a final ruling on September 5, finding that Noem's actions to terminate the program violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies.

The judge also faulted Noem's ""discriminatory statements"" concerning the Venezuelans, noting that her generalization of the alleged crimes of a few migrants ""to the entire population of Venezuelan TPS holders who have lower rates of criminality and higher rates of college education and workforce participation than the general population is a classic form of racism.""

Chen's ruling meant that more than 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders would be able to remain in the country for now, even though Noem had determined that to be ""contrary to the national interest,"" according to the administration.

Trump has made cracking down on immigration - legal and illegal - a central plank of his second term as president, and has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees.

The TPS program is a humanitarian designation under U.S. law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the United States deportation protection and access to work permits.

The U.S. government under Biden designated Venezuelans as eligible for TPS in 2021 and 2023. Just days before Trump returned to office in January, Biden's administration announced an extension of the program to October 2026.

Noem, a Trump appointee, rescinded that extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who had benefited from the 2023 designation.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put Chen's final ruling on hold, prompting criticism from the administration, which said it amounted to defiance of the Supreme Court given the prior action by the justices in the case.

""This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court's orders on the emergency docket,"" the Justice Department told the Supreme Court in its filing.

Some lower courts have expressed confusion and frustration in recent weeks as they attempt to follow Supreme Court emergency orders that often are issued with little or no legal reasoning presented.

""This court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts. Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them - as the lower courts did here - is unacceptable,"" the Justice Department said.

In another case, the Supreme Court on May 30 let the administration revoke a different type of temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan migrants. The justices put on hold another judge's order that had halted the administration's move to end the immigration ""parole"" granted under Biden to 532,000 of these migrants while a legal challenge played out.

Federal authorities previously didn’t ask unaccompanied kids from countries other than Mexico and Canada if they wanted to self deport.
The efforts to repatriate migrant children who are in immigration proceedings to determine whether they have protections in the US have sparked alarm among immigrant advocates and attorneys.","The Department of Homeland Security is preparing to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers in the United States the option to voluntarily leave the country and receive a $2,500 payment, according to three sources familiar with the plans and an administration memo obtained by CNN.

The Trump administration has already been offering financial incentives — including a $1,000 exit bonus — to undocumented adult immigrants in the US to depart the country. Administration officials have argued that self-deportation incentives are more cost effective, given the high price tag of immigrant detention and deportation.

A notice sent to legal service providers Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services, seen by CNN, said the administration “will provide a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500 U.S. Dollars to unaccompanied alien children, 14 years of age and older, who have elected to voluntarily depart the United States as of the date of this notice and moving forward,” adding that the “benefit is intended to support reintegration efforts following departure.”

The voluntary option is expected to first be offered to 17-year-old migrants and would need to be approved by an immigration judge. The payment would be given once the migrants arrive in their home country.

CNN reached out to HHS, which is charged with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. HHS referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security.

“ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families. This voluntary option gives UACs a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future,” an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said in a statement to CNN, referring to unaccompanied migrant children.

“Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin. Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option,” the spokesperson added.

Trump administration officials have increasingly focused on migrant children who arrived in the US southern border alone and are awaiting to be placed with a sponsor, typically a parent or relative, in the United States. As of October 2, there were around 2,100 kids in HHS custody.

The latest move appears to be an extension of ongoing efforts to repatriate migrant children in custody. In late August, the Trump administration prepared dozens of Guatemalan children to be sent back to their home country — a move that was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Declarations from some parents of the children in Guatemala revealed that they were unaware their child was being deported and raised concern over their safety if returned. That case is ongoing.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which has been in place for more than two decades, provides protections for unaccompanied migrant children who arrive and reside in the US, including being screened to see if they are victims of human trafficking or have a credible fear of persecution in their home country.

Generally, kids in custody are not affirmatively offered the option to leave voluntarily, and those who request it must have it approved by an immigration judge. ICE said kids, in this case, will also go before an immigration judge, who are there to ensure the child knows what it means, are making the choice of their own free will, and aren’t being put in harm’s way.

“Voluntary departure has always been an option for unaccompanied children and when this option is explained by an attorney who has the child’s best interest in mind, the risks and benefits can be fully explored. There is no legitimate reason for the government to affirmatively provide children with this option and incentivize it with a financial payoff,” said Neha Desai, managing director of Children’s Human Rights & Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law, in a statement.

Earlier this year, the administration separately moved to rapidly deport some migrant children who arrived in the US without a parent or guardian by having federal agents ask teens whether they want to voluntarily depart the country.

The directive marked a departure from long-standing protocol which required that federal authorities turn over most unaccompanied children to HHS. Federal authorities previously didn’t ask unaccompanied kids from countries other than Mexico and Canada if they wanted to self deport.

The efforts to repatriate migrant children who are in immigration proceedings to determine whether they have protections in the US have sparked alarm among immigrant advocates and attorneys.

While immigrant advocates maintain that child safety should be a priority, particularly when dealing with vulnerable migrant children, they argue that the Trump administration’s policies risk doing more harm than good if they result in kids being sent back to dangerous conditions.

The administration has also implemented additional vetting checks and other protocols prior to releasing a child from custody that have prolonged their stays in shelters.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2021-03-12t180113z-1405354606-rc2u9m9wjuhn-rtrmadp-3-usa-immigration-children.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-03 17:57:43.015461

The TPS program is a humanitarian designation under U.S. law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the United States deportation protection and access to work permits.

The U.S. government under Biden designated Venezuelans as eligible for TPS in 2021 and 2023. Just days before Trump returned to office in January, Biden's administration announced an extension of the program to October 2026.

Noem, a Trump appointee, rescinded that extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who had benefited from the 2023 designation.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put Chen's final ruling on hold, prompting criticism from the administration, which said it amounted to defiance of the Supreme Court given the prior action by the justices in the case.

""This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court's orders on the emergency docket,"" the Justice Department told the Supreme Court in its filing.

Some lower courts have expressed confusion and frustration in recent weeks as they attempt to follow Supreme Court emergency orders that often are issued with little or no legal reasoning presented.

""This court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts. Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them - as the lower courts did here - is unacceptable,"" the Justice Department said.

In another case, the Supreme Court on May 30 let the administration revoke a different type of temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan migrants. The justices put on hold another judge's order that had halted the administration's move to end the immigration ""parole"" granted under Biden to 532,000 of these migrants while a legal challenge played out.

Immigration parole is a form of temporary permission under U.S. law to be in the country for ""urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit,"" allowing recipients to live and work in the United States.

""It's an injustice what's happening to all of us Latinos, with brown skin,"" Garcia Venegas said.","An Alabama man is suing the Trump administration after immigration agents arrested him twice in three weeks despite having a valid REAL ID and U.S. citizenship.

The new lawsuit alleges that masked immigration agents are targeting people based on their race, ethnicity or occupation and terrorizing U.S. citizens who fit a certain profile.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY that ""allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in 'racial profiling' are disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE.""

Reports of Americans being detained in President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown are rising, from the Iraq War veteran held for three days in Southern California to the citizens whose apartments were ransacked in a recent Chicago raid.

""I'm suing because it's not right what they did to me,"" Leonardo Garcia Venegas told USA TODAY. ""I don't want it to happen to anyone else.""

The lawsuit is asking a judge to block DHS policies that allegedly permit agents to target people on private property without a warrant, who fit a racial or ethnic profile. Garcia Venegas is also seeking unspecified damages.

Detained while working construction

The 25-year-old construction worker said he was preparing to lay the foundation for a new home in Foley, Alabama, on May 21 when five agents in camouflage – three wearing masks – rushed onto the worksite around 8 a.m.

There were two crews on site, according to the complaint filed Sept. 30 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.

Five Latino men, including Garcia Venegas, were there to set the foundation. A separate crew of two Black men and two white men were there to deliver the concrete.

The complaint alleges that, without a warrant, ""officers ran right past the white and Black workers … and went straight for the Latino workers.""

When Garcia Venegas started filming the arrests with his cellphone, an agent grabbed him by the arm and forced him to the ground. Two more agents rushed over and held him to the ground.

He shouted that he was an American citizen: ""I'll show you my papers now,"" he told them, according to the complaint.

The first agent fished Garcia Venegas' wallet out of his pocket and found his REAL ID, an active driver's license only available to U.S. citizens and lawful residents, compliant with federal guidelines. According to the complaint, agents alleged the ID was fake and held him in handcuffs for more than an hour.

The ID was genuine, and the agents released him.

Then it happened again

Still, the encounter shook him enough that he stayed home from work for days, according to the complaint.

Garcia Venegas was born in Florida but spent much of his childhood in Mexico, with his parents, before he returned to the U.S. for high school. He is dark-skinned, still more comfortable in Spanish than English. He feared those characteristics could make him a target.

Not two weeks after he returned, it happened again.

On June 12, Garcia Venegas was working inside a partially finished home, headphones on, listening to music while he finished a job.

Agents ""spotted Leo working through the bedroom window, thought he fit DHS's generalized profile of an undocumented worker … and (an agent) entered the home through an unlocked door,"" according to the complaint.

Agents allegedly entered the private property without a warrant.

They led Garcia Venegas outside; he showed them his Alabama-issued REAL ID and, again, they said it could be fake. They marched him to their vehicle and detained him for 30 minutes before determining his REAL ID was authentic.

McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said DHS ""enforces federal immigration law without fear, favor or prejudice.""

""What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. – NOT their skin color, race or ethnicity,"" McLaughlin said. ""Under the fourth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, DHS law enforcement uses 'reasonable suspicion' to make arrests. There are no 'indiscriminate stops' being made.""

Immigration enforcement stirs fears

Situated along Alabama's Gulf Coast near white-sand beaches, once-rural Baldwin County is one of the fast-growing areas in the state, with a population that jumped 66% in two decades to more than 260,000 people, according to the Baldwin County Economic Development Alliance.

Residential construction is booming, and Garcia Venegas has had work nonstop since he went into construction full-time five years ago.

But the continuous immigration raids are chilling the business climate, said Grace Resendez McCaffery, publisher of La Costa Latina, a Spanish-language newspaper distributed in Baldwin and nearby counties.

Even American workers who are Hispanic fear going to jobs in industries that may be perceived by authorities as having undocumented workers, like construction sites and restaurants, she said.

""You are left to prove you are not undocumented,"" she said.

""We've seen where American citizens are being handcuffed and detained on site until the ICE agents determine they won't take them,"" she said. ""At one point are they going to believe you? If you went through the process of getting a REAL ID, which is supposed to be unquestionable identification, still how can you trust you will be believed?""

When a valid REAL ID isn't enough

It's a question Garcia Venegas has had to ask himself.

Alabama's REAL ID Act was passed in 2005 in a legislative package that included some of the most stringent, anti-illegal immigration provisions in the country. To get his REAL ID, Garcia Venegas had to present government documents to verify his Social Security number and U.S. citizenship.

What more could he do to prove his citizenship?

""It's an injustice what's happening to all of us Latinos, with brown skin,"" Garcia Venegas said. ""It's racism. They've got to stop.""

Trump notified Congress this week that he has “determined” that the U.S. is at war with drug cartels in Latin America. The U.S. killed another four people in another strike in the Caribbean on Friday.

Of course, Trump has no authority to simply “determine” that the U.S. is at war — particularly not against gangs that experts say don’t even constitute armed groups under international law.

The people Trump has targeted in the Caribbean are at most criminal suspects, not “enemy combatants.” These killings are murder, and Congress must exert its authority to stop them.

Here at home, Trump is waging a “war from within,” as he put it, telling military leaders on Tuesday he plans to use American cities as “training grounds” for foreign wars.

The administration announced that it is deploying more troops onto our streets, this time to Portland, as ICE continues military-style raids that are terrorizing communities around the country.

As part of “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago this week, armed ICE agents in military fatigues descended on an apartment building from a Black Hawk helicopter, throwing stun grenades and dragging entire families out onto the streets in zip ties in the middle of the night.

“They just treated us like we were nothing,” one resident said. “It felt like we were under siege,” another witness recalled.

Meanwhile, Trump has issued new directives cracking down on his political opponents under the guise of combating “domestic terrorism” and political violence.

This week, Trump unveiled a presidential memorandum granting his administration sweeping authority to prosecute groups it deems are anti-American, anti-capitalist, or anti-Christian, or hold “extremist” views on issues like gender, race, and migration justice.

Already, the administration is targeting the Open Society Foundations, which has supported a wide range of human rights and democracy initiatives nationally and globally, including FCNL’s work.

With the twin threats of authoritarianism and militarism on the rise, we will continue to speak out in solidarity with those being targeted and to urge Congress to act with moral courage to defend democracy, peace, and human dignity.

Remembering the Trauma of Indian Boarding Schools

This past week, September 30, the U.S. and Canada observed Orange Shirt Day, a day of remembrance for Indian Boarding Schools. For over a hundred years, the U.S. government ripped Native children from their homes and sent them to abusive “boarding schools,” many of which were run by churches. This attempted forced assimilation sought to erase Native identity, languages, and cultures. Many of these children never came home.

Contact your members of Congress today to urge them to act on legislation that could bring a measure of truth and healing from Native Boarding Schools!

The court on Oct. 3 paused a federal judge's September ruling that the administration had wrongly ended a program that allowed hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants to live and work temporarily in the United States amid perilous conditions back home.

The high court also sided with the administration at an earlier stage in the case. In May, the justices lifted a California federal judge's temporary order, keeping the program in place while the case is litigated.

In a brief, unsigned order, the court on Oct. 3 said that while the posture of the case has changed, the legal arguments and balance of potential harms to both sides have not.

“The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here,” the court said.

The court’s three liberal justices said they would have rejected the administration’s request.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a dissenting opinion, called the decision “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket.”

“Because, re­spectfully, I cannot abide our repeated, gratuitous, and harmful interference with cases pending in the lower courts while lives hang in the balance, I dissent,” she wrote.

Earlier this month, Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his final ruling against the administration. Chen and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put that ruling on hold while the administration appeals it.

The Justice Department said that the lower courts were disregarding the Supreme Court's earlier intervention, a move it called ""indefensible.""

""This Court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said when asking the court in September to pause the judge’s ruling. ""Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them − as the lower courts did here − is unacceptable.""

The court's May decision did not explain why it let the administration proceed.

""We can only guess as to the Court’s rationale when it provides none,"" the appeals court said when explaining why that ruling did not control the outcome at this stage of the litigation.

In addition, the appeals judges said the courts now have more evidence to consider, including that the Department of Homeland Security had run a ""barebones process"" when it ended the program with ""unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner.""

“This case is about whether a federal agency acted outside the scope of its delegated authority and contrary to the procedures Congress required it to follow,” lawyers for the advocacy group and the Venezuelans challenging the administration’s actions told the Supreme Court.

The lawyers also said the court should let the appeals process play out before intervening since the justices didn’t get involved during the Biden administration when a judge temporarily halted some of President Joe Biden’s immigration policies.

""Our presence here is not an emergency, no matter what the government says,"" said one of the Venezuelans, identified as M.H., who is married to a U.S. citizen and has two children.

In February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered an end to the program called Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans. She concluded that the immigrants burden local governments and said some Venezuelans were members of the gang Tren de Aragua, which President Donald Trump has declared a foreign terrorist organization.

The advocacy group National TPS Alliance and a handful of Venezuelans sued, arguing it’s not safe for them to return to their home country.

When the Supreme Court, in May, allowed the administration to end deportation protections temporarily, thousands of families were torn apart, lawyers for the National TPS Alliance told the Supreme Court in September.

“People lost their jobs, were jailed, and ultimately deported to a country that remains extremely unsafe,” they wrote.

More would be at risk of detention and deportation, they said, if the court again sides with the administration.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/19/USAT/86247320007-usatsi-27033472-168410238-lowres.jpg?crop=1408,793,x0,y100&width=1408&height=793&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-03 17:57:35.771542

Undermines the economy: Economists agree that H-1B workers create U.S. jobs and drive new industries.

San Francisco, CA — A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations filed suit today to stop President Trump’s latest anti-immigration power grab: a sweeping executive action that slaps an unlawful new $100,000 price tag on every new H-1B application. The proclamation – issued on September 19, 2025, and made effective just 36 hours later – has already thrown employers, workers, and federal agencies into chaos. Plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, South Asian American Justice Collaborative (SAAJCO), Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation.

The H-1B visa program was created by Congress to provide a critical path for the United States to attract highly skilled professionals from around the world to fill urgent needs in the economy and public services to strengthen American innovation. Under the program, U.S. employers can hire qualified foreign talent — such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, and researchers — after a rigorous review process.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenges the order as unconstitutional and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs include Global Nurse Force; Global Village Academy Collaborative; Society of the Divine Word; the Fathers of St. Charles; Church on the Hill; International Union; United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW International); UAW Local 4811; American Association of University Professors (AAUP); Committee of Interns and Residents, SEIU (CIR), a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in the Appalachia region, and a citizen of India residing in the Northern District of California.

These plaintiffs represent medical residents, fellows, interns, and nurses serving rural and medically underserved communities, a school that relies on H-1B workers to serve their students, religious organizations that depend on the H-1B program to hire pastors and religious professionals that minister to underserved communities, major labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals and higher education members, and individual highly skilled workers whose careers and lives were upended overnight.

Plaintiff and co-counsel’s quotes can be found here.

When the government makes it prohibitively expensive or impossible for these professionals to come to America, or for current H-1B workers to transition to a more permanent status, entire communities lose — patients wait longer for care, students have fewer teachers, and local economies miss out on the innovation and jobs these experts create.

The complaint details how the sudden $100,000 demand:

Defies Congress: The H-1B program has a carefully crafted fee and oversight system set by law. The President cannot rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by proclamation.

Invites chaos and favoritism: The order offers a vague “national interest” loophole with no clear standards for fee exemptions, opening the door to arbitrary, pay-to-play decisions.

Hurts communities nationwide: Rural hospitals warn they will be unable to keep needed doctors and nurses; schools say the unlawful fee is more than many teacher salaries; and nonprofit organizations and research institutions can’t absorb the significant expense. All will lose if they cannot utilize H-1B workers.

Undermines the economy: Economists agree that H-1B workers create U.S. jobs and drive new industries. Forcing talent away means companies move operations—and good jobs—overseas.

Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators. The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.

A newborn baby died in Gaza City’s Al-Helou Hospital as infants were being evacuated to escape Israel’s onslaught. Al Jazeera is reporting that at least seven people were killed in southern Gaza’s al-Mawasi area that Israel designated as a safe zone.

It comes as Médecins Sans Frontières denounced the killing of its 14th staff member in Gaza, occupational therapist Omar Hayek. Meanwhile, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder recounted harrowing conditions at Al-Aqsa Hospital.

James Elder: “This is just absolutely out of control.

It comes as Hamas is reportedly demanding key revisions to President Trump’s ceasefire deal. A Hamas source tells The Guardian that the condition to disarm would be difficult for the group to accept.

Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunted the Global Sumud Flotilla activists taken into custody by Israel on Thursday, pointing at them and calling them “terrorists.” Reporters Without Borders said that there were more than 20 foreign reporters on board the flotilla.

Meanwhile, demonstrators took to the streets all over the world, from Karachi, Pakistan, to Barcelona, Spain, in response to Israel capturing more than 450 activists. Italian students occupied universities, and Italian unions called a general strike for Friday with more than 100 marches expected across the country. Protesters also took to the streets of Athens, Greece.

Georgia Bozioti: “We demand that all the participants who were there be freed now. We are here to shout again for freedom to Palestine, and we demand that our country stop any cooperation with the murderous state of Israel, which has been intensifying the genocide of the Palestinian people with the support of the United States, NATO and the European Union.”

We’ll get an update on the Global Sumud Flotilla later in the broadcast.

Here in New York, more than 1,000 rabbis and Jewish peace activists led a protest Thursday demanding a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an end to U.S. arms transfers to Israel. They gathered at Brooklyn Borough Hall for a mass public memorial service on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, known as the Day of Atonement. Nearly 60 people were arrested as they nonviolently blocked traffic to the Brooklyn Bridge. This is New York City comptroller — and ally of mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani — Brad Lander.

Brad Lander: “We must today take collective responsibility for what the Israeli government has been doing, is doing today, on Yom Kippur, says, makes clear it is going to keep doing to Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank also, the bombs funded by our taxpayer dollars in the name of the Jewish state, but a desecration of Judaism.”

President Trump has embraced the government shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to punish his political opponents while slashing the federal workforce and cutting off funding to whole government agencies. On Thursday, Trump said budget chief Russell Vought will have the power to decide if cuts should be “temporary or permanent.” And he said he would continue to target projects and agencies favored by Democrats.

President Donald Trump: “Well, there could be firings, and that’s their fault. And it could also be other things. I mean, we could cut projects that they wanted, favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

Democrats are demanding the reversal of cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that will result in some 15 million people losing their health insurance coverage over the next decade. This is House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries: “This is day two of Donald Trump’s shutdown, but it is day 256 of the chaos that the Trump presidency has unleashed on the American people. Republicans have shut the government down because they don’t want to provide healthcare to working-class Americans.”

Meanwhile, the Labor Department will delay publication of its monthly jobs report that was scheduled for release today. It was expected to show a slowdown in hiring in September. Economist Erica Groshen, who formerly led the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told The Washington Post, “It’s a bad time to be missing data. We are flying blind right as the economy could be turning.”

In California, a massive explosion tore through a Chevron oil refinery in the Los Angeles suburb of El Segundo Thursday evening, sparking a fire that burned through the night and could be seen from miles away. The explosion occurred around 9:30 p.m. and prompted shelter-in-place orders until 2 a.m. No injuries have been reported. This comes as the Trump administration has moved to shut down the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, an independent federal agency tasked with uncovering the causes of industrial disasters.

The Trump administration is asking nine public and private universities to sign a deal to help promote conservative ideas on campus in exchange for federal funding. The administration is calling it a 10-point “compact” and promised “substantial and meaningful federal grants” if universities take action against academic departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”

The Trump administration is also demanding that the universities ban the use of race or sex in hiring or admissions and cap foreign students to 15% of undergraduates. Walt Heinecke, a faculty member at the University of Virginia, one of the universities targeted by the Trump administration, warned that the memo threatens academic freedom.

Walt Heinecke: “It’s a threat. And it’s a threat that should be taken seriously and should be reacted to in a way in which I think all colleges and universities who this is — this is meant to actually be applied later to all universities and colleges, not just to the nine or 10 that have received the letter. So, that means that we should all be thinking about how to resist this particular form of intrusion.”

On Thursday California Gov. Gavin Newsom warned administrators against signing trump’s 10-point “compact.” Newsom wrote on social media, “If any California university signs this radical agreement, they’ll lose billions in state funding—including Cal Grants—instantly. California will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom.”

A federal court in Georgia has denied an emergency request by the award-winning Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara to remain in the United States, paving the way for his deportation to El Salvador today. According to the ACLU, Guevara was not allowed to say goodbye to his wife and three children. Guevara has lived in the United States for some 20 years and has built a large following for his reporting on anti-ICE protests. He was jailed by ICE for more than 100 days, even though an immigration judge granted him bond. He was arrested in June while live-streaming a “No Kings” demonstration, even though he clearly identified himself as a journalist. We’ll have more on his case after headlines.

President Trump is declaring that the U.S. is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, following recent strikes on boats in the Caribbean — that’s according to a memo obtained by the Associated Press. The memo also states, “The United States has now reached a critical point where we must use force in self-defense and defense of others against the ongoing attacks by these designated terrorist organizations.” It comes after the U.S. attacked three boats in the Caribbean last month, reportedly killing 17 people. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino blasted the U.S. Thursday after detecting five F-35 fighter jets close to the Venezuelan coast.

Vladimir Padrino López: “The presence of these aircraft flying near our area of influence, nearby the Caribbean Sea and off the Venezuelan coast, is a vulgarity and a threat to national security. It is a serious threat. So I denounce before the world the military harassment and the military threat from the United States government against the people of Venezuela, who only want peace, work and happiness.”

The United Nations is calling for urgent action to prevent large-scale, ethnically driven atrocities in El Fasher, the besieged capital of Sudan’s North Darfur state. On Thursday, the U.N.’s top human rights official warned at least 91 civilians were killed in El Fasher last month, as the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, carried out artillery shelling, drone strikes and ground incursions. The U.N. also warned the RSF against starving civilians in El Fasher as a method of warfare, amid credible reports of civilians being tortured and killed by RSF fighters for bringing food and essential supplies into the city.

British police have identified the suspect who drove a car at members of the public outside a Manchester synagogue on Thursday before attacking people with a knife. Thirty-five-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie was a British citizen of Syrian descent. He was shot dead by firearms officers just minutes after the rampage began. Manchester police report one of the two victims killed in the attack was hit by police gunfire, and one of the three people hospitalized was struck by a bullet fired by police.

On the third day of the shutdown, another Senate vote to advance a Republican bill that would reopen the government failed on a 54-44 tally — well short of the 60 needed to end a filibuster and pass the legislation. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the chamber would close for legislative business next week, a move meant to force the Senate to work with the government funding bill that has been passed by House Republicans.

Following the failed vote, senators quickly headed for the exits of the Capitol, expecting no more votes over the weekend and showing few signs of any real progress towards ending the congressional standoff. Instead, both sides dug in for a prolonged shutdown fight that thrusts federal workers into more uncertainty, threatens to ripple into the broader economy and gives the Trump administration an opportunity to reshape the federal government.

“I don’t know how many times you’re going to give them a chance to vote no,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said at a news conference Friday. After the vote, he said he was flying home to South Dakota for the weekend, adding, “I’ll be available.”

The vote showed hardening lines in the Senate. The same three members of the Democratic Caucus — Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman and Angus King — who voted for the funding bill previously did so again, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was once again the only Republican opposed.

“They thought they could bludgeon us and threaten us and scare us. It ain’t working,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

Democrats are demanding that Congress extend healthcare benefits, while Republicans are refusing to commit to anything until the government is reopened. They are trying to wear Democrats down to vote for a House-passed bill that would reopen the government temporarily, mostly at current spending levels.

Although Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Senate’s filibuster rules make it necessary for the government funding legislation to gain support from at least 60 of the 100 senators. That’s given Democrats a rare opportunity to use their 47 Senate seats to hold out in exchange for policy concessions. The party has chosen to rally on the issue of health care, believing it could be key to their path back to power in Washington.

Their primary demand is that Congress extend tax credits that were boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic for health care plans offered under marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law.

“Everyone is about to experience dramatically increased premiums, co-pays and deductibles because of the Republican health care crisis. Everyone,” warned House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries during a news conference Friday.

The shutdown gamble

Democrats are running the high-risk strategy of effectively voting for a government shutdown to make their stand. Trump has vowed to make it as painful as possible for them.

The Republican president has called the government funding lapse an “unprecedented opportunity” to make vast cuts to federal agencies and potentially lay off federal workers, rather than the typical practice of furloughing them. Trump shared a social media video Thursday night that depicted White House budget director Russ Vought as a grim reaper.

Vought has already announced that he is withholding billions of dollars for infrastructure projects in states with Democratic senators, and on Friday morning, he said he would withhold another $2.1 billion for Chicago infrastructure projects to extend its train system to the city’s South Side.

Democratic leaders have displayed no signs of budging under those threats.

“The cruelty that they might unleash on everyday Americans using the pretense of a shutdown is only going to backfire against them,” Jeffries said during an interview with The Associated Press and other outlets at the Capitol Thursday evening.

Still, the shutdown, no matter how long it lasts, could have far-reaching effects on the economy. Roughly 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and they could lose out on $400 million in daily wages. That loss in wages until after the government reopens could drive down wider demand for goods and services.

“All around the country right now, real pain is being endured by real people because the Democrats have decided to play politics,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday.

The White House also began its press briefing on Friday by rattling off the various consequences of the shutdown that were already hitting Americans. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed a report that said military families are already seeking food aid as troops go without a paycheck.

“This madness must end,” she said.

Talks in the Senate

A bipartisan group of senators, including moderate Democrats who have said they want to find a quick resolution, has been discussing possible health care compromises through one-on-one talks over the last two days. One option floated by South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican, would extend the higher subsidies for one year and then phase them out to pre-pandemic levels.

Thune acknowledged those conversations on Friday, telling reporters, “Honestly, I think the more productive conversations are happening outside of the leader’s office at the moment.”

Thune and Schumer later spoke briefly on the Senate floor. The Republican leader expressed some openness to talks on the ACA subsidies, but insisted “we can’t get to that conversation until we get the government back into place.”

A number of Republicans have voiced support for extending the subsidies. Their expiration would cause significant increases in health care premiums for plenty of people in states with GOP senators — especially in rural areas where farmers, ranchers and small business owners purchase their own health insurance.

Still, it was unclear if they would be able to find a solution that could appease the White House and Republican leaders, who want to see cuts to the subsidies. Thune also said he wasn’t sure if a compromise would have the votes to pass.

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Friday that “more reforms are coming” to the ACA subsidies and argued that they “are not working.”

Schumer also said that he’s supportive of the informal talks, but “unfortunately, last night,” Democrats returned from the discussions and said Republicans didn’t offer them anything.

“You need Trump to get it done,” he said.

The administration said that the Working Families Tax Cut Act, which goes into effect in October 2026, closes the loophole by prohibiting the use of taxpayer money to provide healthcare coverage to undocumented immigrants and other noncitizens.
In the memo, the White House accused congressional Democrats of wanting to repeal those policy reforms as a condition to keep the government running.
""But the White House makes the claim that California uses the money they get from the provider tax to pay for care for undocumented immigrants,"" Tolbert said.
What's more, California is among several states that offer some level of Medicaid coverage to all immigrants regardless of status.","Of all the finger-pointing and recriminations that come with the current federal government shutdown, one of the most striking elements is that the Trump administration blames it on Democratic support for granting taxpayer-funded healthcare coverage to undocumented immigrants. The White House has called out California specifically, saying the state exploits a legal ""loophole"" to pay for that coverage with federal dollars, and other states have followed suit.

""California utilized an egregious loophole — since employed by several other states — to draw down federal matching funds used to provide Medicaid benefits for illegal immigrants,"" the White House said in a policy memo released Wednesday as a budget stalemate forced a shutdown of the U.S. government.

The administration said that the Working Families Tax Cut Act, which goes into effect in October 2026, closes the loophole by prohibiting the use of taxpayer money to provide healthcare coverage to undocumented immigrants and other noncitizens.

In the memo, the White House accused congressional Democrats of wanting to repeal those policy reforms as a condition to keep the government running.

Izzy Gardon, a spokeswoman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said there's nothing to the administration's underlying assertion that California and other states have found some sort of loophole that enables them to funnel Medicaid money to noncitizens.

""This is false — CA does not do this,"" Gardon said in a one-line email to the L.A. Times.

Healthcare policy experts agree. California is not exploiting a “loophole,” said Adriana Ramos-Yamamoto, a senior policy analyst at the California Budget & Policy Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that studies inequality.

""The state is making lawful, transparent budget choices to invest in health coverage with its own dollars,"" Ramos-Yamamoto said in a statement to The Times. ""These investments improve health outcomes, strengthen communities, and lower health care costs in the long run.”

At issue is Section 71117 of the Republican-backed ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which imposes nearly $1 trillion in reductions to federal Medicaid healthcare spending for low-income Americans over the next 10 years. The provision allows states ""to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid spending through multiple sources, including state general funds, healthcare related taxes (or 'provider taxes'), and local government funds,"" as long as taxes on healthcare providers are imposed uniformly so as not to unfairly burden providers of Medicaid services.

The bottom line, analysts said, is the administration is citing a problem with the law that doesn't seem to exist, at least not in California.

""The so-called California loophole references a provision in the law that ends a waiver of the uniformity requirements for provider taxes — this provision has nothing to do with using federal funds to pay for care for undocumented immigrants,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, a healthcare expert at the nonprofit healthcare research, polling and news organization KFF.

""But the White House makes the claim that California uses the money they get from the provider tax to pay for care for undocumented immigrants,"" Tolbert said.

Fact-checking the administration's claim is all the more difficult because there are no official data on how states spend money collected from provider taxes, Alice Burns, another KFF analyst, added. What's more, California is among several states that offer some level of Medicaid coverage to all immigrants regardless of status. And because California cannot be federally reimbursed for healthcare spending on people who are not in the country legally, those expenses must be covered at the state level.

The White House memo goes on to claim that if Democrats were to succeed at repealing the provisions in the Working Families Tax Act, the federal government would have to spend an additional $34.6 billion in taxpayer money ""that would continue to primarily be abused by California to fund healthcare for illegal immigrants.""

This assertion also misconstrues the facts, according to KFF.

""What we do know is that the $35 billion in savings that is referenced in the White House Fact Sheet refers to the federal government's estimated savings ... resulting from states making changes to their provider tax systems,"" KFF spokesperson Tammie Smith said. That is, the projected savings aren't connected to healthcare for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

Political squabbling aside, California's approach to medical coverage for low-income, undocumented immigrants is set to undergo a major shift thanks to provisions in the 2025-26 state budget that the Democrat-led legislature and Newsom approved in June.

Starting on Jan. 1, adults ""who do not have Satisfactory Immigration Status (SIS)"" will no longer be able to enroll in Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, according to the state's Department of Health Care Services webpage. Those who already have this coverage can keep it and continue to renew their enrollment. And starting on July 1, Medi-Cal enrollees who are age 19-59, undocumented and not pregnant will have to pay a $30 monthly premium to keep their coverage.

The changes, which Newsom called for in the spring to offset a ballooning Medi-Cal budget deficit, drew criticism from some immigrant rights groups, with the California Immigrant Policy Center describing the moves as ""discriminatory.""

“In light of the militarized mass immigration raids and arrests causing fear and chaos across California, we are disappointed that the governor and the leadership in the Legislature chose to adopt a state budget that makes our communities even more vulnerable,” Masih Fouladi, the center's executive director said at the time.

Everyone in California who qualifies for Medi-Cal will still be eligible to receive emergency medical and dental care, no matter their immigration status.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/9be350abba70497f464a714efe11f248,N,,2025-10-03 19:56:45.638619

Vought said the money for major projects on Chicago’s subway mass transit system – including extensions of the Red Line route and modernizations “have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting”.

On Wednesday, Vought said the Trump administration had frozen $18bn for major transit projects in New York, too, including a rail tunnel under the Hudson River that flows between New York from New Jersey, and an extension of the Second Avenue subway underground rail system, citing the same justification.

The outgoing administration of former president Joe Biden finalized a nearly $2bn award of federal funds in its final days to help extend the Red Line 5.5 miles to connect Chicago far South Side to the main subway rail system, known locally as the “L”, for elevated, as a lot of the lines run overground and above the streets in the downtown area.

Vought cited a new rule from the US transportation department that took effect on Wednesday to review whether any small-business contractors are engaged in what the White House would regard as improper diversity initiatives. This is one of a series of efforts intended to pressure Democratic lawmakers in the US Congress over the partial government shutdown that began just after midnight on Wednesday.

Any substantive delays in federal funding over partisan political squabbles are almost certain to face swift legal challenges.

In New York, the $17.2bn Hudson River tunnel project, which received more than $11bn in federal grants, involves repairs to an existing tunnel, and the building of a new one for passenger railway operator Amtrak and commuter lines between New Jersey and Manhattan.

Any failure of the current Hudson tunnel, which was heavily damaged by 2012’s Hurricane Sandy, would hobble commuting in the metropolitan area that produces 10% of US economic output.

In a separate move on Friday, the Trump administration reversed its plan to cut $187m in security funds for New York, said Kathy Hochul, the state’s Democratic governor.

CHICAGO — Federal agents — with the Homeland Security secretary and a right-wing social media influencer in tow — raided an Austin Walmart on Friday. Elsewhere, they handcuffed an alderperson and lobbed tear gas onto a Logan Square street while neighbors stood nearby.

Residents in and around the Chicago area on Friday noticed a flurry of ICE activity as the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement campaign barreled into its second month.

Marcus, an employee who witnessed the raid at the Walmart at 4650 W. North Ave. before noon Friday, said that it almost made him take the rest of the day off.

“It’s terrible, man,” he said. “Tons of cars just pulled up speeding and there was a ton of yelling and commotion. They just grabbed a random shopper.”

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem participated in the raid, and Benny Johnson, a right-wing social media influencer, could be embedded with federal agents as he filmed content for his X account.

“They rolled up a couple of guys and it’s rowdy,” Johnson said in one video, smiling. “… The Secretary for Homeland Security is right now doing raids at Walmart.”

In Humboldt Park, agents handcuffed Ald. Jessie Fuentes (26th) as she confronted them Friday at Humboldt Park Hospital. Agents handcuffed Fuentes, forced her out of the hospital and threatened her with arrest, Fuentes told a Block Club reporter. The agents appeared to be with ICE, she said. Fuentes was there asking agents if they had a signed warrant and telling the agents a man — who they had detained — has constitutional rights.

In another incident caught on video Friday, federal agents inside a car threw tear gas and what appeared to be smoke grenades into a Logan Square street while people were outside nearby. Bystanders included a couple and their 2-year-old who briefly got caught in the smoke as they pushed the child in their stroller after school.

Agents Again Attack Protesters Outside Broadview ICE Facility

Federal agents led by border patrol chief Gregory Bovino attacked protesters Friday morning outside the suburban Broadview ICE facility.

At one point, a Block Club reporter saw an agent put his hands on the neck of a priest while pushing him.

The Rev. Michael Woolf, of Lake Street Church in Evanston, was protesting outside the facility when an agent attacked him while pushing protesters, he said.

“Around 50 to 100 of them basically marched down for a photo op,” Woolf said. “And all of a sudden, now we need to clear out. And then they just started using their gloves and pushing.

“One person grabbed my nipple and twisted, and then they put their hands on my throat. They were not gentle. … I’m completely peaceable. I’m a pastor. I’m committed to nonviolence.”

The violence is the latest assault on people who have been protesting the Trump Administration’s operations Midway Blitz and At Large, which have targeted people in and around Chicago.

Protesters have been gathering outside the facility for weeks, hoping to pressure the government into ending the operations and to stop cars that go into and out of the ICE facility at 1930 Beach St. in Broadview.

Federal agents have repeatedly tear gassed and shot pepper bells and rubber bullets at the protesters — even as Broadview officials have demanded they stop and said the agents are harming local police officers, firefighters, paramedics and neighbors.

On Thursday night, Illinois State Police announced the agency would send first responders to Friday morning’s protest to keep people out of the street near the facility to “support the safety of the public,” according to a news release.

Officers put that into effect early Friday, trying to keep protesters off the street. Demonstrators accused officers of assisting ICE; about 8:45 a.m., when some protesters tried to block federal vehicles’ entrance into the facility, officers hit them with batons and pushed them to the ground. State and local police took several protesters into custody.

“It’s a f—king outrageous escalation by the state of Illinois,” said protester Michael Boyte after a peaceful but tense exchange with an officer. “What [the state] should be doing is getting in the way of these kidnappings. Instead, the state of Illinois has sent the Illinois State Police. This is supposed to be a sanctuary state. JB Pritzker goes on TV every other day talking about how evil Trump is, but the State Police are collaborating with ICE.”

A Lenco BearCat vehicle repeatedly circled protesters Friday morning, while agents in technical gear clung to the military truck’s sides. Federal agents and state troopers were armed with pepper ball guns while some officers from the state’s tactical unit held M-4 rifles.

Shortly afterward, at 9 a.m., Bovino came outside of the facility with a group of federal agents. He yelled at protesters that this would be their one warning — and then he and the agents walked toward protesters, who were not in the street.

Protesters yelled at Bovino and the agents, telling them to quit their jobs. The agents grabbed several protesters and pushed some to the ground. They detained at least two people.

During the incident, drones circled overhead, people with the federal agents recorded video. Before Johnson, the social media influencer embedded with agents Friday, followed Noem to the Walmart raid, he could be seen nearby filming content for his X account.

Bovino and Border Patrol have been staging photo ops in the city to produce social media videos. It was not clear why Border Patrol would be involved with responding to protesters.

Agents had not used tear gas, rubber bullets or pepper balls on protesters as of about 9:45 a.m., but they were seen putting on gas masks.

At least five people were arrested and charged for incidents stemming from the protest, according to a Cook County Sheriff’s Office news release.

Around 11 a.m., protesters began to trickle out of the area and federal agents dispersed accordingly. State Riot Police arrived about 11:15 a.m., to the confusion of the roughly 20 protesters still ambling about the otherwise anonymous patch of grass in front of the Orkin warehouse at 2000 S. 25th Ave. Officers held their riot shields at a rest position as the stragglers heckled them.

The Trump administration said Operations Midway Blitz and At Large are focused on arresting and removing undocumented immigrants with serious criminal histories — but federal agents have repeatedly detained U.S. citizens, including children, and immigrants with proper status.

One demonstrator who identified himself on Friday as “Tony Montana” wore a traditional indigenous poncho while bellowing “Get off my land! This isn’t your’s! We were here first!” at several federal officers, including one border patrol agent who appeared visibly moved by some of Montana’s appeals to his humanity.

“You look like me,” Montana told the officer. “What if your daughter was kidnapped by these people? What would you do?”

“Well, I’d probably not just be yelling about it at people,” the border patrol agent replied. “I’d get out there and actually do something about it.”

Happening In Chicago

At 8:20 a.m. Friday, ICE and Border Patrol agents in green uniforms were seen detaining two people near the intersection of North Avers and West Montrose avenues. Neighbors were asked to be on the lookout for a White Chrysler Pacifica with Illinois plates beginning with 24939, according to Northwest Side Rapid Response team.

An older Korean man was taken by three ICE agents around 7 a.m. Friday near the intersection of West Leland and North Knox avenues.

A man was taken by three ICE agents around 9:20 a.m. Friday near the intersection of North Tripp and Fullerton avenues.

A street vendor was questioned by “three masked agents” around 9:55 a.m. Friday near the intersection of North Lockwood and West Fullerton avenues.

Organizers across the Southwest Side reported “multiple abductions” Friday morning, according to the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and Southwest Side Rapid Response.

Three people were detained by federal agents around 8 a.m. near West 43rd Street and South Christiana Avenue.

As of 11:30 a.m., agents have been seen along large roads including Archer Avenue, Western Boulevard, 47th Street and Pulaski Road. At least five people have been detained across the Back of the Yards, Brighton Park and West Lawn neighborhoods.

At 9:13 a.m., ICE agents appeared to have detained someone at The Home Depot, 4555 S Western Blvd., in Back of the Yards.

At 9:23 a.m., ICE agents appear to have detained someone at a shuttered Walgreens parking lot, 1614 W. 47th St., in Back of the Yards.

At 10:10 a.m., federal agents were “threatening and throwing a smoke bomb” at people before detaining someone near West 51st Street and South Damen Avenue.

At 11:34 a.m. three ICE agents detained a father and son, one a U.S. Citizen, “after beating them” near the intersection of West 27th Street and South Harding Avenue.

Happening In The Suburbs

At 8:20 a.m., a person was detained in the 700 block of Hill Drive of suburban Hoffman Estates, according to Elgin Area Rapid Response.

When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials approached Roberts, he identified himself then sped off, abandoned his vehicle, and hid in a brushy area about 200 meters away, where ICE officers located him with help from Iowa State Patrol officers. At the time of arrest, a loaded handgun, hunting knife and $3,000 cash were found in his vehicle. On Oct. 2, he was charged with being an illegal alien in possession of firearms.

Roberts’ rap sheet and immigration history reveal a long record of criminal conduct in the United States. He should never have been serving in a role overseeing children in Iowa’s largest school district.

“Ian Andre Roberts, a criminal illegal alien with multiple weapons charges and a drug trafficking charge, should have never been able to work around children,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “When ICE officers arrested this Superintendent, he was in possession of an illegal handgun, a hunting knife, and nearly $3,000 in cash. This criminal illegal alien is now in U.S. Marshals custody and facing charges for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearms. Under Secretary Noem, ICE will continue to arrest the worst of the worst and put the safety of America’s children FIRST.”

It is not clear how many people are being held at the Doremus Avenue site, which sits next to the Essex County Jail near Newark Bay.
But reports about brutal mistreatment and squalid conditions have surfaced regularly, and riots erupted in June after angry detainees confronted their guards about a lack of food.
Afterward, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement decided to transfer scores of detainees to red states where judges would be more favorable to the Trump administration, immigrant advocates said at the time.
“The treatment of visitors should reflect this importance … No one should have to risk their safety simply to see their loved one.” Both ICE and GEO Group have denied accusations that they mistreat visitors or detainees.","A half-dozen members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation slammed the Trump administration’s inhumane treatment of visitors to Newark’s Delaney Hall in a letter to federal officials — and gave the feds two weeks to detail their plans to fix the troubled immigrant detention center.

The Sept. 30 letter — sent to Kristi Noem of the Department of Homeland Security and David Donahue, CEO of the private prison firm GEO Group, also condemned reports of “poor conditions within the facility itself,” which The Jersey Vindicator recently buttressed in its own reporting.

But the lawmakers mostly focused on the visitors and referenced a September incident in which GEO Group guards forced detainees’ friends and family to stand along a metal fence outside the 1,000-bed, privately run facility during a summer storm that brought torrential rain, booming thunder, and flashes of lightning.

“It is both shocking and deeply irresponsible to line people up against a metal fence during an active lightning storm, a situation that poses obvious and severe risks of electrocution,” the members of Congress wrote.

“Reports have also surfaced of visitors left standing for hours in the heat of the summer sun, exposed to extreme temperatures and health risks,” they wrote. “These conditions are unacceptable and reflect a profound disregard for the dignity, well-being, and basic rights of those who come to visit individuals who have been detained.”

Delaney Hall has been a lightning rod for controversy since the feds opened it this spring to house undocumented people swept up in the Trump administration’s massive immigration raids.

It is not clear how many people are being held at the Doremus Avenue site, which sits next to the Essex County Jail near Newark Bay.

But reports about brutal mistreatment and squalid conditions have surfaced regularly, and riots erupted in June after angry detainees confronted their guards about a lack of food.

Afterward, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement decided to transfer scores of detainees to red states where judges would be more favorable to the Trump administration, immigrant advocates said at the time.

But it is not just the detainees who are suffering.

People who come to visit have complained about a range of issues, including long waits, poor communication from guards, favoritism toward certain visitors, and retaliation against anyone who speaks to either advocates or the press, civil rights advocates have said.

The lawmakers’ letter — which was signed by Democratic Reps. Donald Norcross, Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, Josh Gottheimer, and Nellie Pou — urged officials to “immediately provide human accommodations for visitors” that include covered waiting areas, consistent visiting hours, and bathroom and parking access.

The letter also said the Department of Homeland Security and the GEO Group, the private company that runs the facility’s day-to-day operations, should revamp its entry process to avoid lengthy delays, improve communication and transparency, and give visitors access to clothes in case of dress code violations.

The legislators set a deadline of Oct. 16 for the agencies to send a written response detailing how they would fix these “unacceptable practices.”

“Visitation plays a vital role in correctional settings by supporting family bonds and sustaining community relationships,” they wrote in their letter. “The treatment of visitors should reflect this importance … No one should have to risk their safety simply to see their loved one.”

Both ICE and GEO Group have denied accusations that they mistreat visitors or detainees.

The plan had been privately relayed to immigrant advocates earlier this week by what they said were sources inside the government.
According to advocates, as soon as unaccompanied immigrant children turned 18, they would be detained by ICE.
Immigrant children in federal government custody are held by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement.
Many unaccompanied immigrant children also lack legal representation, largely due to budget cuts by the Trump administration.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is beginning to target unaccompanied immigrant children, pressuring them to accept cash payment in exchange for agreeing to be deported, according to a government memo to immigrant aid groups obtained by The Intercept.

The operation — which immigration rights advocates said was called “Freaky Friday,” though ICE denied the name — is a part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing mass deportation campaign. With deportation continuing apace amid the federal government shutdown, advocates speculated that the latest scheme to pay off immigrant children was deliberately timed by ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, to minimize public attention.

“The idea that masked men would now go to 14-year-olds and ask them to waive their rights to return to the countries that they fled is shocking.”

The memo said immigrant children 14 years or older would receive $2,500 in exchange for agreeing to be deported.

“The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will provide a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500 U.S. Dollars to unaccompanied alien children, 14 years of age and older, who have elected to voluntarily depart the United States as of the date of this notice and moving forward,” said the memo, which was issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that holds children in immigration custody.

Alarmed by word of the new operation, immigrant rights advocates began to widely circulate information about the plan in private email chains earlier this week.

“The idea that immigration enforcement agents can coerce children into waiving their rights and protections under this memo to meet President Trump’s political goals is cruel,” said Bilal Askaryar, director of communications at Acacia Center for Justice, which represents and advocates for unaccompanied immigrant children. “Americans have been shocked by the tactics that ICE is using in communities across the country, and the idea that masked men would now go to 14-year-olds and ask them to waive their rights to return to the countries that they fled is shocking.”

The government memo stipulated that children who elected to take the payment, must arrange to meet with an ICE officer. In order to waive their right to a removal hearing so that they can receive the payment, the child themself would have to sign a form to change their status with the U.S. government.

“If the child agrees to the stipend, DHS will issue a l-210 addendum declaration for the child to sign,” the memo says.

In a statement to The Intercept that was subsequently posted online, an ICE spokesperson confirmed that the agency would begin to target unaccompanied minors for deportation, calling the plan “voluntary.”

The agency said ICE and DHS “are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families” and that financial support would only be provided at the approval of an immigration judge.

ICE told The Intercept the “voluntary option” would initially be offered to 17-year-old unaccompanied children.

The plan had been privately relayed to immigrant advocates earlier this week by what they said were sources inside the government. The advocates had gotten word that ICE was expected to target children aged 14 or older and was considering lowering the range to children as young as 10. For children who decline ICE’s offer, advocates said they had heard from sources that ICE agents would threaten the children as well as their relatives in the U.S. with detention.

The ICE spokesperson said, “Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin.”

According to emails sent by advocates, ICE agents are expected to track down and visit the children who arrived in the U.S. without their parents. Many live in shelters, with relatives, or with host families.

In the plan, according to advocates, agents would first target children who are currently in federal immigration detention, followed by those who have already been released from custody.

According to advocates, as soon as unaccompanied immigrant children turned 18, they would be detained by ICE. Immigrant children in federal government custody are held by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement.

By Friday afternoon, immigrant rights organizations and attorneys who were mobilizing against the operation began to receive emails and texts from the government about the deportation plan. Advocates have urged immigrants, especially children, not to sign any documents that attempt to threaten or incentivize children to waive their rights without first seeking legal advice.

In its statement to The Intercept, ICE declined to say whether children would be threatened with detention.

The Trump administration has shown a willingness to lock up unaccompanied children. Over Labor Day weekend, the government targeted 300 Guatemalan children for deportation, with agents hastily rounding up 76 of the children from their caregivers’ homes in the middle of the night and boarding many of them onto planes. A federal judge blocked their deportation hours before takeoff.

Many unaccompanied immigrant children also lack legal representation, largely due to budget cuts by the Trump administration.

In February, the Trump administration began to track the whereabouts of unaccompanied minors in the U.S. with the intent to deport them, according to a Reuters report. Then, in March, the administration cut a federally funded program that provided legal representation for minors in their immigration cases. The program supported more than 26,000 children, according to the University of California, Los Angeles, Latino Policy and Politics Institute.

From 2023 to 2024, the U.S. government received referrals for 93,356 unaccompanied children entering the country, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and El Salvador, according to government data.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2195569259-e1759512751353.jpg?fit=4000%2C2000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-03 17:57:58.033303

It is unclear if those arrested at the South Shore apartment building are included in that number.
People detained no matter their status Tenants said it appears everyone in the building was detained by federal officers, including US citizens.
“It was scary, because I had never had a gun in my face,” Pertissue Fisher, who lives in the building, told CNN affiliate WLS.
“Federal law enforcement officers will not stand by and allow criminal activity flourish in our American neighborhoods,” DHS said.","Adults and children alike were pulled from their Chicago apartments, crying and screaming, during a large overnight raid that has left tenants and neighbors shaken.

“I’ve been on military bases for a good portion of my life,” said Darrell Ballard, who lives in the building next door. “And the activity I saw – it was an invasion.”

Ballard recalled seeing residents detained outside the building for hours, after seeing a Black Hawk helicopter flying over the five-story building in the city’s South Shore neighborhood and military-sized vehicles and agents filling the parking lot early Tuesday morning.

All were part of a multiagency operation that led to the arrest of 37 undocumented immigrants, most of them from Venezuela but also including people from Mexico, Nigeria and Colombia, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN.

In the past weeks, federal agents have been deployed on the streets of Chicago and have arrested more than 800 undocumented immigrants since September 8 during what the administration has titled “Operation Midway Blitz,” according to a news release from DHS.

It is unclear if those arrested at the South Shore apartment building are included in that number.

The building was targeted because it was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members and their associates,” and two people arrested are believed to be members of the Venezuelan criminal gang, according to DHS. A number of others arrested had criminal histories that included aggravated battery and possession of a controlled substance, the agency said.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker condemned the federal operations in a statement released Friday.

“Federal agents reporting to Secretary Noem have spent weeks snatching up families, scaring law-abiding residents, violating due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. They fail to focus on violent criminals and instead create panic in our communities,” the governor said.

Shattered windows marked the apartment building as seen in photos from the aftermath of the raid. Hallways were lined with debris and plastic bags while clothing, wall decor and lamps became piles of litter inside apartment units. CNN has reached out to the apartment building managers for comment.

People detained no matter their status

Tenants said it appears everyone in the building was detained by federal officers, including US citizens.

“It was scary, because I had never had a gun in my face,” Pertissue Fisher, who lives in the building, told CNN affiliate WLS. “They asked my name and my date of birth and asked me, did I have any warrants? And I told them, ‘No, I didn’t.’”

Fisher said she was handcuffed anyway, before being released around 3 a.m. and was told anyone with an outstanding warrant, even if it was unrelated to immigration, would not be released.

At least one US citizen with an active narcotics warrant was arrested during the operation and turned over to the Chicago Police Department, DHS said.

Ballard said the majority of those he saw handcuffed outside were Black residents and “quite a few” were detained for two to three hours.

Four children who are US citizens with undocumented parents were taken into custody, DHS said, including a child who was allegedly found with a Tren de Aragua member.

“For their own safety and to ensure these children were not being trafficked, abused or otherwise exploited, these children were taken into custody until they could be put in the care of a safe guardian or the state,” a DHS spokesperson said.

Across the country, US-born children have become collateral damage in the Trump administration’s unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants. CNN identified more than 100 US citizen children, from newborns to teenagers, who have been left stranded without parents because of immigration actions this year, according to a review of verified crowdfunding campaigns, public records and interviews with families, friends, immigration attorneys and other advocates.

Another neighbor, Eboni Watson, said she and others ducked for cover when hearing several flash bangs go off.

“They was terrified. The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other,” Watson told WLS, recalling trucks and military-style vans were used to separate adults from their children.

In its statement addressing the raid, DHS noted it was still gathering information about those arrested “due to the size” of the operation and will provide more information.

“Federal law enforcement officers will not stand by and allow criminal activity flourish in our American neighborhoods,” DHS said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-10-03t113520z-1864893076-rc2u3hazouza-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-03 16:57:46.733887

Chicago Activist on Organizing Community ICE Patrols as Trump Escalates Immigration Crackdown (Democracy Now!)","Hello, Carlos De Loera here. This will be my last edition of the Latinx Files for now, as I will be handing the reins back to Fidel Martinez next week. It’s been fun leading this newsletter for the past couple of months. I’m honored that Fidel trusted me with taking care of his work baby while he took care of his IRL baby.

It’s become a common saying that everyone in the United States is “living in unprecedented times.”

The Times is no stranger to the saying. Neither is the other Times. It’s even been meme-ified, with many people online expressing that they are tired of living through unprecedented times.

Raucous election cycles, a pandemic, an insurrection, a litany of mass shootings, government shutdowns, Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, landmark Supreme Court decisions, recall elections and special elections — all occurrences that have marked these unprecedented times in the U.S.

But when looking at these events through the lens of the history of the Americas, they all seem to follow a familiar playbook.

“It’s a movie that we have seen already and it’s so frustrating,” Paula Ávila-Guillén, the executive director of the Women’s Equality Center, told The Times when discussing the chaos taking place in the U.S.

“You just need to look at the history of some countries that maybe you have never thought you would become — and realize that you are becoming them, but when you’re plagued with American exceptionalism it’s really hard [to recognize].”

Ávila-Guillén grew up in Colombia, where she became a lawyer, and passed the bar exam in New York. She previously worked at the Center for Reproductive Rights as an advocacy strategist and is an active member of the Green Wave movement: a feminist movement for the decriminalization of abortion, which originated in Argentina and has spread throughout the world.

She has been a strident observer of authoritarian regimes throughout the Americas and identifies the key pieces of legislation that tip countries toward an autocratic society. Up until recently, she was hesitant to label the actions of the Trump administration as an authoritarian — but one of Trump’s latest presidential memorandums tipped the scales for her.

Issued on Sept. 25, NSPM-7 — titled “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence” — authorizes government-wide investigations into non-profits, activists, their donors and funders by using the vague labels of “terrorism” and “conspiracy against rights,” according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The directive expressly states that it enables the National Joint Terrorism Task Force to “coordinate and supervise a comprehensive national strategy to investigate, prosecute and disrupt entities and individuals engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation designed to suppress lawful political activity or obstruct the rule of law.”

“This is exactly the same thing that many other authoritarian regimes have done in the past,” Ávila-Guillén said. “By threatening [human rights activists] that anything that we could say could be seen as domestic terrorism is a very specific tactic to dismantle and discredit the work that we do and that was also a tactic that many regimes that have leaned to the right have used in the past.

“There was a time in Colombia and in Peru, and again in Argentina, Chile and Brazil, where being a human rights defender or women’s rights defender was seen as just belonging to the left, and therefore political, and therefore you become a target. And that’s exactly what that missive is doing.”

Reflecting on how such regimes tend to choose their first targets, Ávila-Guillén noted that they always start with what they perceive to be the weakest points of society — and that usually involves targeting women’s rights.

“When women are just simplified by our reproduction, and that’s the only value that we add to society, we are not seen as leaders,” she said. “It’s harder for us to re-initiate some of those changes and revolution of changes. So they always start with with women and with regulating our bodies.”

Naturally, Ávila-Guillén argued, the next target in line would be transgender people as they challenge societal norms and often stand at the intersection of healthcare and bodily autonomy. The Colombian attorney pointed out that the current administration’s continued attention and antagonism toward such a small, minority population would be used, in part, as a distraction from Trump’s other legislation, like last week’s federal budget reallocation.

Ongoing ICE raids, the disappearance of hundreds of ICE detainees, targeting the Latinx community, regulating trans and child-bearing bodies, demonizing autism and deeming fat bodies “a bad look” all make one thing clear to Ávila-Guillén.

“It’s white supremacy. It’s an ideal of what people should look like, and it’s rhetoric that’s also helpful for them when they are literally disappearing immigrants,” she said. “Everybody is going to wake up one day and wonder how it’s possible that we let so many people disappear, how it’s possible that we let so many people be in prison for so long without due process. And it’s because while we were talking about fat people, about trans issues, they were doing [those] deeds, and it’s very hard to pay attention.”

She explained the psychological process of allowing authoritarianism to reign freely. The first part is that people must actively live in denial, because accepting it would involve making an effort to change things. The next part that people are being bombarded with narratives that point the finger at immigrants for all problems — not at “capitalism, corporations or corruption.” The key element of this section of the psychological process is dehumanizing the “other”; the final part is the devaluation of the truth.

She drew parallels between the Trump administration and that of Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, as well as Javier Milei in Argentina.

“They started with the press, by saying it is not legitimate. ‘The truth doesn’t exist anymore. The press is propaganda,’” Ávila-Guillén said. “They start targeting young men to make them believe that the reason they are struggling is because of women’s progress. Milei threatened to eliminate legal abortion in Argentina and Bukele has promised to keep El Salvador’s total abortion ban. Both of them also have started dismantling of programs to protect those who are more vulnerable.”

The good news is that she believes that it’s not too late for people to recognize what is happening and to do something about. Her weapons of choice for combating authoritarianism? Skepticism and the truth.

“The most important step right now is that we get out of our bubbles of information and start relying a lot more on good journalism,” Ávila-Guillén said. “You need to start questioning the things that you thought were not possible, because legally, maybe they are possible. And as you see, there are multiple presidents who have reformed constitutions in every country to stay in power longer... or they have found another way. When the system becomes questionable and legality becomes questionable, there are no [more] hard truths and hard no’s. That’s why it’s so important to to be able to fight back now, while we can still do it.”

But don’t expect politicians to be the ones to quell authoritarianism, Ávila-Guillén advised. Community members are the ones that are more likely to make an immediate impact in helping and protecting their neighbors from the thumb of the government. In her view, it’s the friend from across the street that drives his neighbor across state lines to get an abortion; or the activists that drive ICE agents out of their neighborhood to protect the local street vendors that can make the biggest differences.

“Don’t comply in advance. You wait until you’re forced to it. Recognize that we might be afraid, but also that we are not alone, that we have tons of people who are showing up in multiple events and in multiple forms and understanding in which way you can show up,” she said.

“Maybe you can only share info on social media. Maybe you can support some funds that are collecting money for immigrants or women who are traveling to other places to have abortions. Maybe you can serve virtually as a translator. There is no one, exclusive way to help. But the most important thing is sharing good sources of information, because the priority for us to get out of this system is of us to all start seeing the same level of real, truthful information of what is happening and to not turn a blind eye.”

“Therefore, the President determined these cartels are non-state armed groups, designated them as terrorist organizations, and determined that their actions constitute an armed attack against the United States,” it added.
The memo did not specify the groups in question although the Trump administration has labelled several Latin American cartels “foreign terrorist organizations” and has particularly focused on Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua.

The memo, reported by The Associated Press news agency and The New York Times on Thursday, comes after the US military last month struck three alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean, killing 17 people. Rights observers and war powers scholars have said the attacks appear illegal under US and international law and likened them to extrajudicial killings.

The memo is the clearest picture yet of how the administration is seeking to justify such attacks and what its approach could portend.

“Although friendly foreign nations have made significant efforts to combat these organizations, suffering significant losses of life, these groups are now transnational and conduct ongoing attacks throughout the Western Hemisphere as organized cartels,” the memo said, as reported by the AP.

“Therefore, the President determined these cartels are non-state armed groups, designated them as terrorist organizations, and determined that their actions constitute an armed attack against the United States,” it added.

The argument is an extension of the Trump administration’s reframing of cartels as “narco-terrorists” who seek to destabilise the US by pushing illegal drugs across its borders and not profit-driven criminal entities.

The memo did not specify the groups in question although the Trump administration has labelled several Latin American cartels “foreign terrorist organizations” and has particularly focused on Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua.

Under the US Constitution, only Congress has the right to authorise the use of military force or declare war; however, presidents may take unilateral actions in some cases, particularly in matters of the country’s immediate self-defence.

There is currently no authorisation of use of military force from Congress (AUMF) that would even remotely apply to the strikes in the Caribbean.

Because of that, members of Congress have come under increased pressure to assert the legislative branch’s war powers authorities to rein in Trump. Still, several members of Trump’s Republican Party, which holds a majority in both the House of Representatives and Senate, have cheered the attacks.

Other lawmakers have warned of allowing Trump’s actions to go unchecked.

In a post on X after Thursday’s reports on Trump’s memo, Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: “Every American should be alarmed that Pres Trump has decided he can wage secret wars against anyone he labels an enemy.”

“Drug cartels must be stopped, but declaring war & ordering lethal military force without Congress or public knowledge – nor legal justification – is unacceptable,” he wrote.

On Bluesky, Brian Finucane, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group and former US Department of State lawyer, said there was “so much wrong” with the Trump administration’s legal justification for the strikes in the Caribbean.

He pointed to the claim that Trump had “determined” that drug smuggling constituted an “armed attack” on the US, which appears to underpin the administration’s stance that the strikes did not stray into unconstitutional war.

“‘Baloney’ is the technical legal term for that claim,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_68dedc0a-1759435786.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-03 16:56:55.393744

“Mario and his family are being punished for his reporting,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a post on BlueSky.
Over the course of his career in the United States, he won numerous awards, including an Emmy, and was named one of the 50 Most Influential Latinos in Georgia.
Guevara came to the U.S. on a B1 visa, is authorized to work in the United States, and has a social security number.
“I have to remain strong and confident that the United States still has some caring and decency left and that in the end justice will prevail,” he wrote.","Emmy award-winning journalist Mario Guevara was deported today to El Salvador – a country he fled over 20 years ago — in retaliation for filming law enforcement activities, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ.)

On Tuesday, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denied an emergency request to temporarily block the Board of Immigration Appeals’ order to deport Guevara. The three judges on the immigration appeals board were all appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi under President Donald Trump.

“Mario and his family are being punished for his reporting,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a post on BlueSky. “This cruelty is meant to stifle our free press.”

“Words cannot begin to describe the loss and devastation my family feels,” said Mario’s son, Oscar, in a statement released on Thursday. “I am in utter shock and disbelief the government has punished my father for simply doing his life’s work of journalism.”

“He is the reason our home feels like home,” he continued.

Oscar said after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, “it was my dad who centered me, who drove me to my medical appointments, and who lifted me up.”

In 2004, Guevara came to the United States from El Salvador to escape persecution for his journalism. He settled in Georgia and continued his work as a reporter. Over the course of his career in the United States, he won numerous awards, including an Emmy, and was named one of the 50 Most Influential Latinos in Georgia. In 2019, his reporting was the subject of a New York Times documentary, and in 2024, he founded his own news organization, MGNews.

In June, officers arrested him while he was reporting at a “No Kings” protest against Trump, even though he was wearing a vest with “PRESS” written on the front and back. Guevara was taken to the local jail and then placed in ICE custody. All charges were dropped, but the government fought to deport him, arguing that he was a danger to the community based on his livestreams and videos of law enforcement activities.

“I was following them,” Guevara told the Altanta-Journal Constitution in a phone interview published in July. “I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.”

He said that during his detention, officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. Hey, remember me?”

Over the course of his more than 100 days of imprisonment, he has been subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, confined to his cell for 22 hours a day, according to the ACLU.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously told Truthout in an email that Guevara was in custody because he entered the country illegally in 2004, which is false. Guevara came to the U.S. on a B1 visa, is authorized to work in the United States, and has a social security number. He is also eligible for a green card.

Local lawmakers, human rights groups, and press freedom organizations condemned Guevara’s detention and called for his immediate release. On Tuesday, more than a hundred scholars, journalists, and writers sent a letter to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to demand his release. Signatories included Art Spiegelman, Arundhati Roy, David Remnick, Ibram X. Kendi, Jelani Cobb, John Cusack, Judith Butler, Judy Blume, and Julianne Moore.

In response to the news that Guevara would be deported on Friday, Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said in a statement that Guevara was “ripped from his family and community because the Trump administration punishes journalists to protect its own power.”

“The only thing that journalists like Guevara threaten is the government’s chokehold on information it doesn’t want the public to know,” he continued.

Amnesty International USA’s Executive Director Paul O’Brien said in a statement that deporting Guevara “sends a chilling and dangerous message: that journalists can be detained, silenced, and deported simply for doing their jobs.”

“The already cruel immigration system is being used as a testing ground for widespread authoritarian practices under Trump, and now, with the deportation of Mario Guevara, it is being weaponized to silence a journalist,” he continued.

Last month, Guevara penned an essay about his imprisonment.

“I have to remain strong and confident that the United States still has some caring and decency left and that in the end justice will prevail,” he wrote.

“Hopefully, soon all my tears and my family’s tears will be wiped away, and we can have fun and smile, triumphant, as we did before, together and in absolute freedom.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/cropped-2025-10-3-Mario-With-Family-1-scaled-e1759514522880.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 17:58:02.876975

I Grew Up Hearing His ...,Amal Ahmed,,,,,https://www.texasobserver.org/ice-marwan-marouf-dallas-trump/,"When I saw Marwan Marouf’s face plastered on my Instagram feed, under bright red letters announcing he’d been arrested and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the first thing I remembered was his distinctive, gentle voice.
For nearly three decades, Brother Marwan, as we know him, has been a constant presence in our community.
ICE arrested him that day, and he’s since been detained at the notorious Bluebonnet detention facility some 200 miles away from home.
He never sought the spotlight, but everyone who’s been in town long enough knows the name Marwan Marouf.
So far in Dallas, the community has turned out for Marouf.","When I saw Marwan Marouf’s face plastered on my Instagram feed, under bright red letters announcing he’d been arrested and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the first thing I remembered was his distinctive, gentle voice.

For nearly three decades, Brother Marwan, as we know him, has been a constant presence in our community. Long before the Dallas area attracted thousands of Muslims and high-profile religious leaders, we grew up in small congregations, and people like Marouf led prayers and delivered short sermons to a few-dozen families now and then. He’d arrived in the city in the ’90s as a student, and he later worked as an engineer at the same company as my dad and some of my friends’ parents.

Once, in high school, during late evening Ramadan prayers, I fell asleep while he was giving a lecture, lulled into a sense of peaceful drowsiness. In the women’s section of the mosque, there was a running joke that the mics weren’t strong enough to amplify Marouf’s soft-spoken delivery. I remember being annoyed that I had missed most of his sermon, as he’d been coming around to our masjid less frequently, since there were dozens of them now to rotate between. His sermons were almost always uplifting reminders about how to live more compassionately and generously at a time when it felt like both these forces were dwindling in our society.

Marouf, who is Palestinian, had been seeking permanent legal status since 2012 after receiving student and work visas, according to his lawyers in a press release, but he was first denied a green card in 2020. On September 22, ICE informed him he was denied again, his lawyers say, based on a decades-old claim that Marouf—through his support for the Palestinian-led charity the Holy Land Foundation—had supported terrorist activities. ICE arrested him that day, and he’s since been detained at the notorious Bluebonnet detention facility some 200 miles away from home. The Muslim Legal Fund for America (MLFA), which is handling his case, declined to comment for this story as he awaits a bond hearing, but the group has said that Marouf’s arrest and detention are “a direct affront to the due process protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.”

In North Texas, where I grew up, Marouf is best known in the community for his work with the Muslim American Society of Dallas, supporting youth programming. He sponsored a Boy Scouts troop, led volunteer initiatives, and worked with programs for refugees as well. During the pandemic, he drove around Dallas and its sprawling suburbs delivering meals and supplies to people who needed extra help. Last year, he was recognized by the City of Richardson, one of the inner-ring suburbs, for his community service.

On social media, the Muslim American Society quickly started collecting stories in his support, with the hashtag #BecauseOfMarwan. Many people affectionately called him Amo, the Arabic word for uncle, recalling his humble nature and the small ways he would make people smile—never getting mad at kids running amok at the center; making volunteers feel proud of the tasks they were assigned; and constantly working in the background to make everything run smoothly. He never sought the spotlight, but everyone who’s been in town long enough knows the name Marwan Marouf.

“When I moved to Dallas with my family, Amo Marwan and his family really helped us feel like we’d lived here our whole lives,” said Noor Wadi, a community organizer who’s been supporting public outreach efforts for his case. “When … we’re at civic events, it feels empty without Amo Marwan. But we have hope that he will come back home. We’re going to apply pressure from every single angle.”

The Holy Land Foundation case, which the government tenuously tied Marouf to, was a major milestone in the U.S. government’s targeting of Muslims and Palestinians. The W. Bush administration designated the foundation a terrorist organization in 2001, saying that it had secretly sent funds to Hamas. The charity, which had provided food and medical aid and supported other aid programs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, was at that point the largest Muslim-led charity in the United States. It distributed funds to reputable organizations in Palestine that also received funds from the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the European Commission.

In what many observers, including the ACLU and Human Rights Watch, consider a sham trial, the five leaders of the charity were convicted and sent to prison. Their sentences ranged from 15 to 65 years. The convictions relied on testimony from anonymous witnesses from the Israeli military and evidence gathered from government wiretaps of the charity’s leaders. Former Treasury Department officials later admitted that Muslim-run charities were an “easy, soft target” in the early years of the War on Terror.

According to Marouf’s legal team, he was transparent about his time volunteering with the foundation, when they had fundraisers locally, when immigration officials questioned him about it during his green card application process. And his donations and volunteer work pre-dated the Bush administration’s questionable terror designation anyway.

“This volunteer work included ordering pizza and hiring a clown to entertain children while their parents attended [foundation] fundraising events,” MLFA said. “Marwan’s donations included sponsorship of an orphan in Palestine. And yet, some thirty years later, the government still chooses to wrongfully penalize Marwan for these ordinary acts of charity—acts which he considers obligatory to his faith.”

Wadi said that the case could raise fears among the community about being targeted for similar donations or civic engagement. The accusations made 20 years ago against the Holy Land Foundation, and other Islamic charities, are similar to the accusations that Israel has recently leveled against the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, for example. In 2024, the Biden administration froze funding to the humanitarian organization after Israel accused some of its staff of participating in terrorist acts.

What’s different now, Wadi said, is that the general public isn’t blindly accepting such claims about Muslims in their communities, especially after watching what a United Nations commission and a growing number of scholars have declared a genocide in Gaza, along with the blatant targeting of Palestinian student activists like Mahmoud Khalil. “People from all walks of life are saying, ‘That’s enough.’”

Imam Omar Suleiman, a well-known Dallas preacher, said that Marouf’s arrest was particularly shocking as the Trump administration has targeted Palestinians involved in demonstrations. “His arrest makes it apparent that the administration is now interested in targeting any Palestinian immigrant, whether they voice their opinions or simply serve quietly within their communities,” Suleiman said in an email.

So far in Dallas, the community has turned out for Marouf. At a packed community gathering the day after his arrest, Suleiman told the gathered crowd not to despair. “This is not a funeral, this is not us bidding farewell to someone,” he said. “The heart of our community, the pillar of our community, has been taken away from us, and we can’t rest, nor can we accept that this is the way this is going to go.”",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:58:16.090620

“This is the Trump term,” said Josh Blackman, professor at South Texas College of Law.
And a series of immigration arrest and deportation cases and federal spending cases are also winding their way to the justices’ docket.

The court said that violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which courts have cited to prod states to maximize Black voting power.","The Supreme Court is ready to kick off the “Trump term,” with the justices on Monday opening a session in which they will grapple squarely with questions about President Trump’s aggressive first-year agenda and the limits of executive power.

Cases about presidential firing powers and tariffs are already on the docket, and other cases about immigration and spending powers are speeding their way to the court.

Those join what was already shaping up to be a monumental term for the justices, with three cases that could determine the scope of transgender rights and a voting rights dispute that could see the court deliver a final word on whether the Constitution is color-blind or demands special consideration for historically oppressed minorities.

The justices have been dealing with Trump executive actions over the last nine months in preliminary rulings, and the president has done exceptionally well on what’s known as the emergency docket.

But now the cases will be firmly before the court, fully briefed and argued, and ready for rulings that will shape the contours of the American presidency for decades to come.

“This is the Trump term,” said Josh Blackman, professor at South Texas College of Law. “So many of the Trump cases that came to the Court on the emergency docket will now need to be resolved on the merits docket.”

The first major test comes on Nov. 5, when the court takes up a case challenging Mr. Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs.

The president says he’s acting with authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows him to impose customs and duties. He says that includes tariffs, but lower courts have questioned that, saying the word “tariff” doesn’t appear anywhere in the law.

A president’s power to fire at will is also on the line in a pair of cases.

One, scheduled for oral arguments in January, will test whether Mr. Trump’s attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board for cause was valid. The other could overturn a 90-year-old precedent and grant Mr. Trump wide-ranging latitude to fire members of independent agencies for disagreeing with his policies.

The justices have already ruled in emergency docket cases, allowing him to carry out firings of members at the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Federal Trade Commission. But those were interim rulings that froze things in place while the cases developed in lower courts.

Now the justices have agreed to hear the FTC firing case in full.

In a 1935 case known as Humphrey’s Executor, the court ruled that then-President Franklin Roosevelt broke the law by firing an FTC member over policy differences.

Mr. Trump has also asked the justices to overturn a court decision blocking his attempt to limit birthright citizenship for babies born to illegal immigrants. And a series of immigration arrest and deportation cases and federal spending cases are also winding their way to the justices’ docket.

“It is fair to say that litigation over the administration’s executive orders is going to be a major part of this term,” said Daniel Sullivan, a partner at Holwell Shuster & Goldberg LLP and a former clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

Carolyn Shapiro, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, said the justices will firm up the rest of the term’s calendar in several months, which will show just how Trump-centric the term will be.

“We don’t know what all of those cases will look like,” said Ms. Shapiro. “Usually, I would think by December — maybe the very beginning of January — is usually when they are done granting cases that will be argued during the term.”

Transgender and voting rights

The court’s 2025-2026 term kicks off Monday with lower-profile oral arguments for a case involving defendants’ ability to discuss their case with their lawyers and another involving judicial rules for dismissing complaints.

The first transgender case begins Tuesday: A Christian licensed counselor is challenging Colorado’s rules forbidding “conversion therapy” for transgender minors, saying it violates her free speech rights.

Next week the court will hear the voting rights case, which grew out of Louisiana’s attempt to draw congressional maps. Its first map after the 2020 census only included one majority-Black district out of six.

Prodded by Black voters, a federal court ruled that was too skimpy, given the state’s population, which is 34% Black. The court said that violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which courts have cited to prod states to maximize Black voting power.

Louisiana redrew its lines to create two majority-Black districts, which is the current map. Non-Black voters in the state then challenged the map, saying the Legislature was too focused on race.

The case came to the high court last term, but the justices delayed a ruling and ordered a rehearing this term — and specifically ordered all sides to file briefs on whether focusing so heavily on minority voting power violates the 14th or 15th Amendments to the Constitution.

Depending on how the case plays out, it could directly challenge a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, known as Section 2. That part pushes states to maximize minorities’ voting power as a way of making up for past oppression.

Justice Clarence Thomas, the court’s senior jurist and one of its two Black members, said it’s impossible to square the favored treatment of minority voters required by the Voting Rights Act with the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

When the court announced it would rehear the case, he urged his colleagues to settle the matter — and side with the Constitution.

“I am hopeful that this court will soon realize that the conflict its Section 2 jurisprudence has sown with the Constitution is too severe to ignore,” Justice Thomas wrote.

The justices have another election-related case in a challenge to campaign finance limits.

Current law limits how much political committees can directly coordinate with candidates’ campaigns for office. The National Republican Senatorial Committee says that’s a violation of the First Amendment.

The court has a death penalty case on its docket in which it will weigh the factors that judges can consider in deciding when a convict’s IQ is so low that carrying out an execution would violate the Constitution’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

In addition to the conversion therapy case, the high court will review Idaho and West Virginia laws barring transgender athletes from competing outside of their biological sex.

Lower courts have blocked the laws, arguing they discriminate against transgender athletes, violating the Equal Protection Clause.

Roughly two dozen states have laws restricting transgender athletes’ participation in girls’ sports.

Decisions in the cases are expected by the end of June, when the justices wrap up their in-person work for the 2025-2026 term.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/25/Supreme_Court_33848_c0-0-3847-2244_s1200x700.jpg?4e3334b5f60e1a620fe178ccc810e951e7302e23,N,,2025-10-03 16:57:54.725443

Ten miles west of Chicago, camouflage-clad and masked federal agents—some reportedly positioned like snipers from the rooftop of the building—fired tear gas and pepper balls against a crowd of 100 protestors and journalists outside of the Broadview ICE facility. Federal agents are conducting immigration raids in Chicago and its suburbs with aggressive shows of force, including helicopters, flash bang grenades, and dozens of trucks and agents. And federal law enforcement is arresting people for alleged immigration violations without warrants, including U.S. citizens.

The governors of California, Oregon and Illinois have objected to federalized troop deployments in their states, but other governors are volunteering their troops in support of the administration’s agenda. In Missouri, the governor authorized the state’s National Guard to provide logistics support for immigration enforcement, while Louisiana’s governor has requested federal assistance to activate up to 1,000 of the state’s National Guard on general “public safety” grounds.

National Policing Force Poses Civil Liberties Threat

Deploying military troops and masked federal agents is part of something larger that is happening under our noses. The Trump administration is trying to build out a sprawling national military and police force—intended to be accountable to the president, not the people. The administration is intentionally blurring the lines of law and accountability that limit federal law enforcement, the military, and state and local police to their proper roles. It is cycling through false justifications and purported mandates to do so—invoking crime, homelessness, immigration, and now even “domestic terrorism.”

In Florida last week, the state’s National Guard joined federal, state, and local law enforcement agents in a massive, multi-day immigration arrest operation—its legal authority and constraints are unclear. In Washington, D.C., ICE is reportedly joining local police on patrol, even after the expiration of a 30-day emergency declared by the president.

The legal and ethical constraints that govern each of the law enforcement agencies involved, as well as the military, are critically important and we can’t let them be blurred or cast aside.

The Trump administration is going after the most vulnerable people in our communities, targeting immigrants, Black and brown people, as well as anyone who protests these cruel actions. But we know it does not stop here. A national policing force can be wielded against anyone who doesn’t pass the president’s loyalty test.

A Movement to Protect Our Communities

The administration’s overreach is spurring new opposition and concern across the ideological spectrum.

A judge appointed by Ronald Reagan recently said in a decision on the free speech rights of non-citizens: “Can you imagine a masked marine? It is a matter of honor—and honors still matters. To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history, we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.”

Videos of reckless federal personnel pushing people to the ground, and assaulting journalists and protestors, have sparked outrage. California Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed a suite of bills under the banner of fighting “secret police” tactics—a step we believe will further embolden governors and legislatures across the country in the coming months to build a firewall of freedom. Already, more than half of states have passed Firewall measures to push back on Trump’s attempts to violate our rights.

As the threats continue to grow, we need even more concrete protections. States and cities should move to limit or withdraw from partnerships with the Trump administration that are being used to terrify and attack our neighbors and loved ones, like ICE’s expanding 287(g) program Governors and legislatures should enact measures to ensure that no state employee volunteers state and local resources, including data and equipment, to federal personnel who would use it to violate our rights.

Our schools, healthcare facilities, libraries, and shelters should establish protocols to limit law enforcement access without a warrant so that they are safer for our community members to visit. Our state and local governments should invest in proven public safety strategies and reject the administration’s attempt to redeploy the military as a police force in America’s streets

Remember: We Are Stronger Together

While much of the formal power to stop these deployments lies in the hands of local, state, and federal officials, we are not powerless—and it’s imperative that we keep speaking out. The Trump administration is relying on people being too scared to resist its cruel and unlawful measures. But the deployments in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Portland, and Memphis have shown us that we are stronger together. Whether it’s going to a No Kings protest, filming ICE activity, taking a Know Your Rights training, or simply helping your neighbors’ children get safely to school, we can all help protect not just our loved ones, but our communities.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/10/no-national-guard-in-dc-sign-s.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:58:42.189167

Ultimately, the Democrats’ communications crisis won’t be solved until they have a presidential nominee who can actually speak the language of the moment.","Donald Trump has made politics into a dystopian reality show he loves to host, but Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are playing by the old rules — and the mismatch may cause Democrats to get blamed for a government shutdown.

This is not because they’re dumb (they’re not) or incompetent (as the top Democrats of the Senate and House and as representatives of New York, both have risen to positions that require a Lyndon Baines Johnson-esque dexterity most of us couldn’t sustain for a single PTA meeting).

You can see it playing out in the government shutdown. Schumer and Jeffries seem almost neurologically incapable of operating in the world Trump has created — one where politics is less about governing or even persuasion, and more about staying on offense and generating spectacle.

Schumer exudes old-fashioned backroom politics and insider deal-making, which is another way of saying that he’s scripted, sweaty and stilted. It’s not that he’s bad at speaking; it’s that the kind of speaking he has mastered — the methodical, over-enunciated style that once charmed donors and editorial boards — is the equivalent of trying to fax something in 2025.

Jeffries, by contrast, is calm and disciplined. He speaks slowly, often channeling a rhythmic pattern that is reminiscent of a preacher or litigator. In a different era — the kind of era when “normal politics” still existed — this trait might have worked brilliantly. Today, it just feels tired. He’s supposed to be the hip one, once marketed as a “bad, brilliant brother from Brooklyn.” But his recent attempts at communication feel more like a corporate onboarding seminar.

And it’s not like he’s compensating for this shortcoming by electrifying the progressive base. Jeffries’ recent praise for New York Mayor Eric Adams (calling him a man who “served courageously and authentically for decades”) was a bit like praising Nickelback for artistic innovation. It’s not just inaccurate; it’s weirdly tone deaf to the moment.

To be fair, competing with Trump’s megaphone requires a skill set that is closer to professional wrestling than to 20th century politics. Trump is chaotic and often incoherent to the point of parody. But, and this is key, he never sounds like a normal politician.

In a game where authenticity — however poorly defined and cynically constructed — is the only real currency, the Democrats’ undynamic duo come across as high-functioning androids.

Countering Trump’s superpower calls for Democrats who can compete in the attention economy: leaders who feel authentic, actually enjoy picking constant political fights and understand that “going viral” is the new “getting quoted in the New York Times.”

Indeed, the only Democrats who have shown any capacity for being able to survive in this era have been Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Schumer and Jeffries do not have these skills, despite having plenty of material to work with.

Case in point: Republicans are about to make healthcare more expensive for millions of Americans. In theory, that’s a devastating talking point. In practice, it’s difficult to imagine Schumer and Jeffries delivering it in a way that can compete with Trump’s bogus assertion that the Democrats are shutting down the government because they want free healthcare for illegal immigrants and “transgender for everybody,” whatever that means.

Faced with these mistruths and the anemic response we’re getting from Schumer and Jeffries, the best-case scenario may be that Republicans — by virtue of being the “anti-government” party — take some blame for a government shutdown. But that’s not a strategy. That’s hoping partisan inertia is still on your side.

Regardless, the shutdown is merely the latest example of Democrats struggling to compete with MAGA. The larger problem is that the Democratic Party doesn’t really have a communicator right now. It hasn’t had one since Barack Obama left the stage.

It’s probably not fair to compare a congressional leader with a presidential candidate. But even by the standards of modern congressional leaders, Schumer and Jeffries are ill-equipped for the task at hand.

Democrats need someone with Newt Gingrich’s manic energy, revolutionary zeal and theatrical flair, coupled with Nancy Pelosi’s more pragmatic toughness and ruthless discipline. This is to say, someone who understands that politics is now a form of entertainment, but who still has the moral seriousness to prevent it from devolving totally into nihilism.

Instead, they’ve got two men who might as well be AM radio hosts trying to livestream on Twitch.

Ultimately, the Democrats’ communications crisis won’t be solved until they have a presidential nominee who can actually speak the language of the moment. Until they can find one, Democrats are stuck with two guys who are no match against a man who has turned political chaos into performance art.

And if Democrats don’t find one — and soon! — they won’t just lose the narrative: They’ll lose the country that depends on it.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/da03c52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4416x2318+0+313/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2Fdb%2Ff87219c34a1387287e66bf35f77f%2Fcongress-shutdown-86882.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:57:56.494710

The groups are asking Congress to push the administration to restore the funding to protect thousands of trafficking survivors across the US.
The plea for help comes after a Guardian investigation found the administration has rolled back efforts across the federal government to combat human trafficking.
“Allowing these funds to disappear would enable human trafficking and put survivors’ lives at risk,” the letter says.
“Many regions will lose their only service provider, leaving survivors with no safe emergency housing, case management, or counseling.","Anti-trafficking groups across the US have sent Congress a letter raising alarms about the Trump administration’s failure to release $88m in funding to protect survivors of human trafficking.

The letter from 74 legal, religious and advocacy groups says that the US Department of Justice has frozen funding for more than 100 service organizations across the country that help victims “escape their traffickers” and gain access to “the services and support that they need to survive”.

The groups are asking Congress to push the administration to restore the funding to protect thousands of trafficking survivors across the US. The plea for help comes after a Guardian investigation found the administration has rolled back efforts across the federal government to combat human trafficking. Trump officials deny the federal government has made any retreat on anti-trafficking.

An array of local, state and national groups signed the letter, including Freedom Network USA, the Human Trafficking Legal Center, the Minnesota Alliance on Crime and the National Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd.

“Allowing these funds to disappear would enable human trafficking and put survivors’ lives at risk,” the letter says. “Many regions will lose their only service provider, leaving survivors with no safe emergency housing, case management, or counseling. Communities will be made less safe as traffickers would exploit with impunity, and fewer survivors will be able to come forward.”

Many service organizations saw their federal funding end as of the last day of September, according to Freedom Network USA, a national coalition of service providers, researchers and trafficking survivors.

In response to a query from the Guardian last month about the frozen funding, the justice department said money appropriated by Congress would be spent eventually, but that organizations that received money in the past wouldn’t necessarily do so in the future. Future appropriations, the department said, would be made in accordance with Trump administration priorities.

The letter from the anti-trafficking groups notes: “Congress has overwhelmingly voted to continue these programs over the last 25 years … Protecting and fully funding these lifesaving programs is critical to protecting survivors and preventing re-exploitation.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9aff0e6f7a948da23a57f041e82684cbfe3e25c/468_0_4680_3744/master/4680.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e79309a7fbaaf5320d58250f32d42998",N,,2025-10-03 13:57:26.197025

On July 31, Thompson postponed the termination of the TPS program for Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras until Nov. 18.

In her order granting class certification, Thompson agreed with the plaintiffs’ argument that a nationwide class is appropriate because the case raises a common question and injury.","SAN FRANCISCO (CN) — A federal judge approved class certification Thursday for more than 60,000 immigrants from Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras with temporary protected status who claim that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s recent orders ending the program were unlawful and motivated by racial animus.

U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson certified three separate classes that include individuals from Honduras, Nepal or Nicaragua who have been granted TPS and who have not been granted lawful permanent residence.

“Thousands of Nepali nationals in the United States risk losing rights, losing income, losing connections with loved ones, and losing freedom in this country because of the secretary’s decision. The same is true for thousands of Hondurans and thousands of Nicaraguans,” the Joe Biden appointee said in her order.

The TPS program protects individuals from certain countries due to violence or economic duress. While those with TPS status can’t be deported and can work legally in the U.S., they do not have a path to U.S. citizenship.

National TPS Alliance and individual TPS holders from Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras sued the Trump administration on July 7, claiming Noem’s actions terminating protections for the three countries violated the Administrative Procedure Act and were motivated by racial animus.

On July 31, Thompson postponed the termination of the TPS program for Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras until Nov. 18. However, a federal appeals court stayed that ruling, greenlighting the Trump administration to go ahead with its termination of TPS status for the three countries while litigation plays out.

Thompson tentatively approved class certification on Sept. 16, but declined to specify the size of the class or who would be included.

In her order granting class certification, Thompson agreed with the plaintiffs’ argument that a nationwide class is appropriate because the case raises a common question and injury.

“Examination of whether the secretary exceeded her authority by terminating the TPS designations for Nepal, Nicaragua, and Honduras will generate a classwide resolution because deprivation of the protections provided by TPS effect 'all of the class members or … none of them,’” she said.

In crafting the class definitions, Thompson settled some of the government’s concerns by ruling that foreign nationals who are no longer in the United States or are otherwise ineligible for TPS, such as those with a criminal record, were excluded from the class.

“Those foreign nationals who resided outside of the United States during the duration of their country’s TPS designation would not have been a TPS holder and are definitionally excluded from the classes,” she said. “The eligibility requirements for TPS sufficiently limit the scope of the proposed classes to mitigate defendants’ concerns.”

However, Thompson said that individuals who would have otherwise qualified for protected status but didn’t register in time would be included.

“Because late registrants may still ultimately receive the benefits of TPS, even those foreign nationals who fail to timely register for TPS retain a legal interest in the continued TPS designation of their country,” she said.

In a statement to Courthouse News, Lauren Wilfong, an attorney for the plaintiffs from the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said that they were pleased with the court’s ruling.

“We are pleased the court recognized that all TPS holders from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua are suffering devastating harms as a result of the Trump administration's unlawful terminations, and that their claims all revolve around a common claim that the Trump administration failed to follow basic rules for reasoned agency decisionmaking when ending lawful status for these long-term residents,” Wilfong said.

A representative for the defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Oct. 2, the Trump administration filed a motion to stay the case during the government shutdown.

But so far, enforcement against undocumented people on dairy farms had been sporadic and far from the Midwest.
While last Thursday’s raid in Manitowoc didn’t take place on a dairy farm, most of the individuals arrested were dairy workers.
Beyond that, they were dairy workers in the county with the highest concentration of dairy factory farms in the state.
I think that immigrant workers are essential to Wisconsin dairy, and that when they are threatened, farmers in our rural communities are threatened too.”","The morning of Sept. 25, federal agents and immigration authorities swept into Manitowoc to arrest people alleged to be in the country without proper documentation. Agents first went to a Walmart parking lot where dairy workers are known to meet up before driving to the farms where they work. The action then moved on to private residences, where migrants were arrested as they left the house.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims the ICE raid in Manitowoc was aimed at dismantling an international sex and drug trafficking ring, but has so far provided little evidence to support that claim. Federal authorities initially said 21 migrants had been arrested in the raid, before later saying 24 had been picked up.

On Tuesday, DHS released the names of six of the 24. Only one individual named in the release has been charged with a sex crime — Jose Hilario Moreno Portillo, who was charged in Manitowoc County court in May with the 2nd degree sexual assault of a child. However, Moreno Portillo has not yet been convicted and court records show he’s been in ICE custody since July.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment on why Moreno Portillo was named as being arrested in the Manitowoc action when he was already in ICE custody.

The five other named individuals have been convicted of identity theft, hit-and-run, disorderly conduct, driving under the influence, possession of narcotic equipment, traffic offenses and a failure to appear charge.

In Wisconsin, immigrants without documentation aren’t able to obtain driver’s licenses, which often causes them to wrack up several criminal traffic offenses when they’re pulled over and ticketed for driving without a license.

With little proof that ICE actually broke up a ring of sex traffickers, immigration advocates and farm groups see the raid as a direct threat to the state’s dairy farms and the immigrant workers that keep the industry afloat.

Farmers and immigrant advocates in Wisconsin have been watching ICE’s actions on dairy farms across the country closely. In March, ICE raided a dairy farm and petting zoo in New York. In April, a raid on a dairy farm in Vermont resulted in eight arrests. And in early June, ICE arrested 11 immigrants in a raid on a dairy farm in New Mexico.

But so far, enforcement against undocumented people on dairy farms had been sporadic and far from the Midwest. In June, President Donald Trump announced and then retreated from guidance that ICE would not aggressively target farms and the hospitality industry.

While last Thursday’s raid in Manitowoc didn’t take place on a dairy farm, most of the individuals arrested were dairy workers. Beyond that, they were dairy workers in the county with the highest concentration of dairy factory farms in the state. Manitowoc County and its northeast Wisconsin neighbors are the epicenter of the modern farming powerhouse that maintains Wisconsin’s status as “America’s Dairyland.”

“It’s just sending an economic ripple effect across the dairy industry, which is Wisconsin’s rural economy,” says Luis Velasquez, statewide organizing director for immigrant advocacy group Voces de la Frontera. “And then also there’s the symbolic and political dimension to it as well. We are America’s Dairyland, and so this enforcement is not just an administrative matter, but it threatens the industry’s well being. Who are we going to be after all of this? Are we still going to be America’s Dairyland?”

Velasquez says the raid sent a “big anxiety wave” through immigrant communities across the state.

“These views have just spiraled out of control in terms of the rumors that have been sent out across the community, rumors of ICE coming into their neighborhoods, to their homes, to their schools,” Velasquez says.

“I have had serious conversations since the raid in Manitowoc of folks who are planning to leave after many years of being here,” he adds. “They just don’t feel like this is a humane lifestyle anymore. They’ve given many years of their lives, and many of them have children here.”

Michael Slattery, a Manitowoc County farmer who grows grain and raises Holstein steers, points to data that shows 70% of the labor on Wisconsin’s dairy farms comes from immigrants and estimates that the dairy industry is the driver of 20% of Manitowoc County’s economy.

Slattery says farmers can’t survive without that migrant labor because no one else is willing to do the work.

“Do you want to get up at 3 a.m. seven days a week to go out in the cold, the heat, to get kicked by cows when you’re putting the suction cups on, to be shat upon, pissed on, pushed around by 1,400 pound cows? People don’t want that,” he says. “I’ve tried to hire part time labor here, I cannot get people, they don’t want to do this sort of stuff.”

Simply expecting farm families to pick up the slack isn’t the answer, he adds. “These dairy farms, they don’t have enough family members that can come out and replace immigrant labor, both documented and undocumented, that are leaving,” Slattery says. “They’re in a money-losing situation now.”

Losing the dairy labor force would have ripple effects across the economy in Wisconsin and the country.

“What do they do in that situation? If your cows cannot be milked, in two, two and a half weeks they’ll go dry,” he says. “The cows get milk fever, get ill, that’s your cheap hamburger in the stores. They’re selling the cows at a loss, that’s what they’ll do. There’s less milk in the market, that will drive up prices for cheese, milk and butter.”

Danielle Endvick, executive director of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, says if Wisconsin’s immigrant workers leave the state — either from being arrested by ICE or leaving on their own to avoid arrest — farms could close and prices could increase.

“Immigration raids and mass deportations can shrink rural economies, are terribly destabilizing for communities and can harm schools, churches, just the fabric of our rural communities too,” Endvick says. “Our rural spaces, our farmers can’t thrive if we’re treating a key workforce like they’re disposable. I think that immigrant workers are essential to Wisconsin dairy, and that when they are threatened, farmers in our rural communities are threatened too.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0124-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:58:33.579648

The administration has fired thousands of federal employees this year through the Department of Government Efficiency.","The Trump administration’s plan for mass federal layoffs will test the bounds of executive power in court.

In the hours leading up to the government shutdown, a group of unions filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing its threats to distribute reduction-in-force notices during the shutdown violate federal law.

The question at the heart of the case will be whether a government shutdown provides a legal justification for the White House’s threat to fire federal employees. As a fight plays out on Capitol Hill about which party is responsible for a shutdown, the union’s complaint sets up a high-stakes legal battle that could have massive implications for the federal bureaucracy.

“Any [reduction in force] that does take place will be one that we know we can win in a court of law,” a senior White House official told NOTUS of the impending notices, adding, “We’re no stranger to lawsuits.”

The White House budget director, Russell Vought, “knows these laws better than anyone,” the official said, specifying that anything they do will be “well above the law, in our legal opinion.”

Rushab Sanghvi, general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions in the suit, told NOTUS that “there’s no basis” for the White House’s directive.

Previous shutdown guidance from the White House claims that “furloughs during a shutdown are what you need to do, not RIFs,” said Sanghvi. “So it’s contradictory to their own previous statements.” (The unions’ complaint states that the White House did not address why the position changed.)

Asked if the intention behind the RIFs went beyond simple cost saving matters, a senior White House official did not directly answer. But the official acknowledged the unions’ arguments that RIFs had never been done before in a shutdown.

“I guess we are setting precedent, by nature of doing them,” the official said.

Democrats dispute the idea that a shutdown changes the legality of mass federal firings.

“A shutdown does not give the president any additional ability to fire people or to do what he is doing today,” Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, told NOTUS.

“He’s just taking this unprecedented action to hurt people,” Murray added, “to try and intimidate all of us who are fighting to make sure average citizens don’t see their health care increases by over half they cannot afford it.”

As for how Democratic lawmakers can push back on the firings, Murray said she will be following the unions’ case. (Members of Congress have limited standing in cases against the executive branch.)

Republicans in Congress have defended the firings as necessary because of dwindling federal resources during a shutdown — and if the government opened the RIFs would stop.

“It could end today, if the Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing for the American people,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Thursday. “But if they don’t, and if they keep the government closed, it’s going to get more and more people because the resources run out, and more and more things have to be reduced and eliminated.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Trump had never needed a shutdown to fire people before. The administration has fired thousands of federal employees this year through the Department of Government Efficiency.

“Guess what?” Jeffries said. “They’ve been firing federal employees all along.”",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/d6b904b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7476x4205+0+389/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F4f%2Ff217e32f41069832c30aab9a4ad9%2Fap25272798347261.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 13:57:39.673564

The administration delivered the notification after a mid-September strike on an alleged drug boat hailing from Venezuela.
After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.
Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.
The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13.","The Trump administration has determined the U.S. is in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, it said in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News.

The administration delivered the notification after a mid-September strike on an alleged drug boat hailing from Venezuela. It was the second of three publicly disclosed U.S. attacks on boats in the southern Caribbean Sea last month.

The notice calls the three individuals killed by the Sept. 15 strike ""unlawful combatants,"" which is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.

Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.

The New York Times first reported on the notification to Congress.

A White House official said the information was part of a report to Congress required by the National Defense Authorization Act after the U.S. military conducts an attack. The specific notification concerned the strike on Sept. 15 against an alleged cartel boat. The report ""does not convey new information,"" the official said.

The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In the notification to Congress after the Sept. 15 strike, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an ""armed attack"" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels.

""Although this strike was limited in scope, U.S. forces remain postured to carry out military operations as necessary to prevent further deaths or injury to American citizens by eliminating the threat posed by these designated terrorist organizations,"" the notice read.

This notification uses language like ""armed conflict"" not seen in a previous letter to Congress from the White House that justified the Sept. 2 strike. That notice, which was signed by President Trump and obtained by CBS News last month, was submitted to Congress under a separate requirement.

Asked about the notice, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: ""As we have said many times, the President acted in line with the law of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring deadly poison to our shores, and he is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans.""

Brian Finucane, a former attorney-adviser at the State Department who advised the U.S. government on counterterrorism and the use of military force, said the explanation given to Congress is not enough to justify the administration's actions.

""This justification put out here that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict does not do the trick because it's not supported by the facts,"" Finucune said in an interview. ""There has been no armed attack on the United States.""

Some members of Congress have also questioned the legal justification for the three boat strikes. The administration has said little about who was in each boat or what drugs were on board. Mr. Trump has alleged the first two boats — including the one hit on Sept. 15 — hailed from Venezuela, but didn't specify a country of origin for the third strike.

The initial strike on Sept. 2, killed 11 people, according to a post on President Trump's Truth Social, which didn't include details about what drugs were on board.

When asked what legal authority the Pentagon used to justify the strike, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters traveling with him to Fort Benning, Georgia, ""We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that,"" without citing any specific legal justification.

""If foreign terrorist organizations are poisoning people with drugs from drug cartels, it is no different from Al Qaeda, and they'll be treated as such."" Hegseth said.

Since then, the U.S. military has struck two more alleged drug boats, one on Sept. 15, killing three people, and another on Sept. 19, killing another three, and has threatened further strikes.

After the initial strike, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky had an online dispute with Vice President J.D. Vance about the actions — and the lack of information from the administration.

""I'm just disappointed that, you know, the leaders of a country like ours that is famous for having due process for trying to make sure that the innocent aren't harmed in any way would glorify the idea of killing people without any sort of evidence presented as to who they are,"" he told reporters on Capitol Hill.

The strikes come amid growing tensions between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the U.S. has accused of collaborating with gangs — a charge Maduro's regime denies.

Maduro said earlier this week he is considering declaring a state of emergency in response to U.S. ""aggression,"" following the boat strikes and a deployment of several U.S. Navy vessels off the waters of Venezuela.

Separately in March, the White House invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua, accusing its members of engaging in ""irregular warfare"" against the U.S. ""both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela."" The administration has controversially tried to use the law as a rationale to rapidly deport accused Tren de Aragua members, in some cases sending them to a Salvadoran prison.

Nothing in the Republican Beautiful-for-Billionaires Law changes these policies, meaning repeal of the law’s more than $1 trillion in health care cuts makes no changes to this prohibition for undocumented immigrants.
Whitehouse’s office remains open to help Rhode Islanders navigate the Republican government shutdown.","Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today slammed Vice President JD Vance’s social posts, which egregiously misrepresent Democrats’ push to end the Republican government shutdown and to fix the chaos and destruction Republicans have unleashed on the American health care system:

“The lawless Trump administration is using every trick in their propaganda playbook to distract from the fact that health insurance premiums for Rhode Island families are about to more than double, unless there is bipartisan action from Congress. The Vice President knows very well that people who are not in this country legally have NEVER been eligible for federally funded Medicaid, Medicare, or Affordable Care Act tax credits.

“This is a Trump shutdown manufactured to continue Republicans’ strange fetish for taking away Americans’ health care. While Republicans control the presidency and both chambers of Congress, Democrats will use every lever of power we have to end the Republican health care crisis and end their shutdown.”

On Tuesday night, before the government shut down, Whitehouse explained that Republicans were repeating baseless lies about Democrats shutting down the government to give health care to undocumented immigrants. Vance responded to the Senator on X with a bizarre post erroneously showing a state-funded health care policy in New York. After Whitehouse pointed out the Vice President’s mischaracterization of a state-funded policy, not federal at all, Vance issued another statement this morning trying to clean up his misleading post by saying that “money is fungible.”

Undocumented immigrants are prohibited from buying Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace coverage and receiving ACA tax credits. Undocumented immigrants also cannot receive federally funded Medicaid and Medicare coverage. Nothing in the Republican Beautiful-for-Billionaires Law changes these policies, meaning repeal of the law’s more than $1 trillion in health care cuts makes no changes to this prohibition for undocumented immigrants.

In July, President Trump and Congressional Republicans jammed through their Big, Beautiful-for-Billionaires bill, which cuts almost a trillion dollars from Medicaid, triggers a half-trillion in Medicare cuts, and raises health insurance costs, all to bankroll tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. Without bipartisan action to extend the ACA enhanced premium tax credits, health insurance premiums are set to more than double on average next year.

The new law also included a hidden cut to Medicare from adding $4.1 trillion to the national debt, automatically triggering the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act, which will impose $536 billion in automatic cuts to Medicare over the next decade.

Did the feds trick her?,"Melissa Gomez, www.latimes.com, melissa-gomez",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-03/film-director-brazil-detained-by-ice-green-card-interview,"As of Thursday, she had been moved to Arizona and will return to California while her deportation proceedings remain open, her attorney said.
According to her attorney, Marcelo Gondim, Marques May arrived in the U.S. in 2018 on a tourist visa.
She ended up overstaying her visa, he said, and in 2019, the government sent her a notice to appear for a court hearing to begin deportation proceedings.
In April 2025, the couple got married and she began the process to apply for a green card, Gondim said.
Until a judge rules on the case, Gondim said, ICE cannot deport her.","On Sept. 16, Barbara Gomes Marques May and her husband arrived at the downtown Los Angeles federal immigration building for what they believed would be the final step in Marques May’s process to obtain her green card.

The interview process had gone smoothly, Tucker May recalled. But toward the end, a federal immigration official she had met with said he needed Marques May to follow him so he could photocopy her passport, he recalled. She and her husband believed the trip would be brief and they would be able to leave.

Instead, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent arrested Marques May, a 38-year-old Brazilian national who has no criminal record and works as a film director in Los Angeles. She was handcuffed and transferred to the ICE facility in Adelanto in San Bernardino County before being sent to Louisiana. Meanwhile, her husband and her lawyer scrambled to try to stop her deportation.

On Wednesday, Marques May was scheduled to board a 6 a.m. flight to her home country, but her attorney was able to file a motion to reopen her deportation proceedings and keep her on U.S. soil, at least temporarily. As of Thursday, she had been moved to Arizona and will return to California while her deportation proceedings remain open, her attorney said.

“It’s very much an ongoing nightmare,” Tucker May said in an interview this week.

Department of Homeland Security officials did not respond to a request for comment about Marques May’s case.

According to her attorney, Marcelo Gondim, Marques May arrived in the U.S. in 2018 on a tourist visa. Gondim said she applied for an extension but was denied. She ended up overstaying her visa, he said, and in 2019, the government sent her a notice to appear for a court hearing to begin deportation proceedings.

But Marques May had moved and had not kept her address up to date with immigration court, and so the letter never reached her, Gondim said. Because she failed to appear, the government issued a removal order against her.

In April 2025, the couple got married and she began the process to apply for a green card, Gondim said. Under the Biden administration, he said, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would have notified Marques May that there was a removal order issued for her and directed her on how to get it resolved.

Overstaying a visa is not considered a criminal offense, and penalties are issued if the person leaves the country. In cases involving married couples, Gondim said, there’s an automatic forgiveness for overstaying a visa, relief that Marques May would’ve been eligible for.

But the Trump administration has instead used courthouses and Citizenship and Immigration Services offices to engage in mass arrests of migrants attending mandated hearings and appointments. Soon, the USCIS will have expanded powers.

In September, the Department of Homeland Security issued a new directive that will allow the agency — which administers and oversees immigration applications — to enforce immigration law with “special agents.” The order goes into effect Monday.

“USCIS will have greater capacity to support DHS efforts by handling investigations from start to finish, instead of referring certain cases to Homeland Security Investigation within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” the agency said in a statement.

After Marques May was arrested, May struggled to figure out where federal authorities had sent his wife. Finally, he was able to get in touch with her, and she detailed how, when she was arrested in L.A., she burst into tears, and an ICE agent took a selfie with her, he said.

During her transfer between detention facilities, she told him, she was subjected to harsh conditions, including how she went without food or water for more than 12 hours and had access to bathrooms with no toilet paper. She was given only bread and water and a couple of times an apple.

Marques May, who had surgery this year for chronic back problems, was also denied medical treatment for a device she uses to manage her pain, he said. May went public with her arrest more than a week after she was detained, he said, because he had run out of all legal avenues.

“There is an open disdain being shown by ICE for the basic rule of law for this country,” he said.

May began posting about her arrest online, garnering hundreds of responses and support. A GoFundMe page had raised more than $50,000 as of Thursday. U.S. Rep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park), who counts Marques May as one of her constituents, said she was “doing everything possible to prevent her deportation and I’m demanding that ICE follow the law.”

“Unfortunately, Barbara’s case is not unique, it reflects a broader pattern under Trump’s immigration policies that are unlawful and cruel,” she posted on X.

Gondim said he repeatedly tried to stop her from being transferred to facilities outside California, only to find barriers and delays by ICE officials to getting legal documents for her to sign. From Adelanto, she was transferred to Arizona, then Louisiana.

The government is not doing anything wrong by complying with the removal order, he said, “but they cannot prevent the person from having access to counsel and be able to present their case to file some form of relief [so they] don’t get unjustly deported.”

To stop Marques May’s imminent deportation, Gondim filed separate motions to reopen her deportation proceedings and terminate her deportation proceedings. Until a judge rules on the case, Gondim said, ICE cannot deport her. He said he’s hopeful that she will end up being released.

“Since she has already an approved petition from her U.S. citizen husband, and she has a clear path to filing a new [application] and getting her green card,” he said, an immigration court judge will not be interested in pursuing a case against a person who should be approved for permanent residency by law.

Until then, May said his wife’s first feature film has been put on hold until she can be released. In 2021, Marques May premiered her short film, “Pretas,” at the Culver Theater for the L.A. Brazilian Film Festival. The film centers on Black women and their experiences dealing with racism and carries a message of creating a more anti-racist society.

“I love Los Angeles so much,” she said in an interview at the time. “I couldn’t be happier. It was a premiere I wasn’t expecting.”

It was their shared love of films that bonded the couple, who met on a dating app, May said. They spent a lot of their time together watching movies, sharing popcorn and then discussing what worked and didn’t in the films.

May says he now thinks about all the immigrants who have not committed any crimes but lack the legal resources to avoid deportation.

“These are human beings that these terrible things are happening to,” he said. “If anybody reads stories like this, if they think this doesn’t apply to them because they’re not married to an immigrant, I beg those people to consider what they think comes next.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9acb9b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/960x504+0+145/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2F1a%2Fc769d2b042f9b8b1d8376fd3f579%2Fcrop-95095053-1759018927547645-r.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 15:57:33.063689

“Every American should be concerned that Trump's hand-picked security force is once again buying and using location data without a warrant.” The Independent has contacted ICE and PenLink for comment.
One of the products, Tangles, “automatically ingests historical data from multiple communication channels, mobile forensics, internet-based communications, location data, financial records and web intelligence,” according to procurement records obtained by Forbes.
That same year, CBP said it would stop using commercially sourced smartphone location data, and ICE did the same by early 2024.
“This seems to be part of a much larger pattern of ICE trying to collect anything and everything it can,” he said.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is reportedly seeking to buy access to a powerful suite of highly controversial surveillance tools that will allow the agency to monitor people’s locations based on data from hundreds of millions of mobile phones.

The move, which comes after immigration agencies scaled back the use of such data under the Biden administration, has alarmed privacy advocates.

Don Bell, policy counsel at the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, warned that the surveillance tools could let ICE get around the privacy protections of the warrant process and the Fourth Amendment.

“This is probably unconstitutional,” Bell told The Independent. “Usually, if law enforcement wants to take your phone, and is interested in getting your location data, they would need a warrant, but because the law has not kept up with technology, there is this loophole that effectively has allowed law enforcement to purchase location data, which is highly sensitive, without getting a warrant first.”

In a redacted acquisition document obtained by the tech news site 404 Media, the immigration agency proposes entering into a contract to buy “all-in-one” tools from a company called PenLink that will allow agents to “compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices.” The document also mentions payments for services involving “face detection,” “advanced face search,” and a “dark web data feed.”

“The Biden Administration shut down DHS’s location data purchases after an inspector general found that DHS had broken the law,” Senator Ron Wyden told the outlet. “Every American should be concerned that Trump's hand-picked security force is once again buying and using location data without a warrant.”

The Independent has contacted ICE and PenLink for comment.

One of the products, Tangles, “automatically ingests historical data from multiple communication channels, mobile forensics, internet-based communications, location data, financial records and web intelligence,” according to procurement records obtained by Forbes.

The company that originally created Tangles, Cobwebs, was founded by a former member of Israel’s elite cyber intelligence agencies, and it was reportedly kicked off Meta in 2021 after allegedly being found using Facebook and WhatsApp accounts to snoop on activists and opposition politicians in Hong Kong and Mexico. The company later merged with PenLink in 2023.

The ICE documents also describe the agency testing out a tool called Venntel, whose creators the Federal Trade Commission in 2024 accused of “unlawfully tracking and selling” sensitive location data, including information about mobile users’ visits to health-related locations and places of worship.

ICE’s reported purchase of these high-powered tools reverses the trend from the Biden administration, when law enforcement's purchasing of mass amounts of consumer data for surveillance came under heavy scrutiny.

A 2023 report from the Department of Homeland Security inspector general found that ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and DHS failed to follow internal privacy guidelines and federal law in their use of such location data.

That same year, CBP said it would stop using commercially sourced smartphone location data, and ICE did the same by early 2024. By April of that year, the House of Representatives passed the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which would ban the government from buying Americans’ data from data brokers it they would otherwise need a warrant to obtain it.

That momentum has reversed under the second Trump administration, which has pushed to obtain vast new surveillance powers as part of its overall mass deportation campaign and infusion of unprecedented funding into federal immigration enforcement.

The Trump administration has reportedly restarted a $2 million contract with Paragon Solutions (US) Inc., a spyware company founded in Israel whose products have been accused of facilitating the surveillance of journalists and activists. The deal had previously been frozen to review whether it complied with a March 2023 Biden administration executive order limiting the use of commercial spyware that could pose counterintelligence risks to the U.S. or that might be improperly used by a foreign government, WIRED reported.

Paragon’s “zero-click” Graphite program can quietly invade the mobile phone of its target and extract its contents, even from encrypted apps.

Under Trump, ICE has also struck agreements with fellow government agencies to access highly sensitive data, including from the Internal Revenue Service and Medicaid.

Bell, the Constitution Project attorney, warned that the combination of recent leaps in computer and AI power, ICE’s mass expansion of surveillance and data access, and the Trump administration’s willingness to brand ideological opponents and protesters as domestic terror threats could pave the way to arbitrary and concerning action from federal agents.

“This seems to be part of a much larger pattern of ICE trying to collect anything and everything it can,” he said. “Even if that means scooping up information on Americans, which is different from their purported goal, and it is made all the more concerning and dangerous because it seems like this administration is also redefining what it means to be in opposition.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/30/3/07/GettyImages-2237820258.jpg?trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-03 15:57:38.188546

“This is the most important case involving U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba to reach this Court in the past sixty years,” one of the companies seeking compensation wrote in its Supreme Court petition.
In the other, the company that built and operated the piers at Havana’s port is seeking to reinstate a $440 million award it won against some of the world’s biggest cruise lines.
A lower court ordered the cruise lines to pay Havana Docks $440 million.
That issue is as factbound as it gets,” the cruise lines wrote in court filings.","The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a pair of cases involving Exxon and major cruise lines that could ease the ability of U.S. companies to seek compensation for property confiscated by the Castro regime in Cuba.

Congress created a pathway for such lawsuits nearly three decades ago but allowed presidents to suspend it. Each president did so until President Trump enabled cases to commence during his first term.

Now in his second term, the justices asked for the Trump’s administration’s input on whether they should take up two of the cases that had reached the high court. Trump’s Justice Department urged the court to do so, and it wants the justices to ultimately rule it should be easier for the lawsuits to proceed.

“This is the most important case involving U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba to reach this Court in the past sixty years,” one of the companies seeking compensation wrote in its Supreme Court petition.

The cases are set to be heard during the court’s upcoming term, with decisions expected by next summer.

In the first, Exxon is suing Cuban state-owned companies. In the other, the company that built and operated the piers at Havana’s port is seeking to reinstate a $440 million award it won against some of the world’s biggest cruise lines.

The cases present distinct legal questions, but both concern the scope of the Helms-Burton Act, which Congress passed in 1996 to strengthen the U.S. embargo against Cuba. Its passage was spurred by the Cuban Air Force shooting down two unarmed civilian planes.

The law includes a provision enabling U.S. nationals to file lawsuits against anyone who “traffics” in property confiscated by the Cuban government after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959.

Exxon sued CIMEX and UnionCuba Petroleo, both Cuban state-owned enterprises, over the Castro regime’s confiscation of an oil refinery and more than 100 service stations owned by a subsidiary of Exxon, which was then known as Standard Oil. A U.S. commission later certified the company’s losses totaled roughly $71.6 million.

Exxon pleaded with the justices to review a lower court holding that its lawsuit can only proceed if it also meets an exception under a separate federal law that grants foreign sovereigns broad legal immunity in U.S. courts. Exxon argues the specific pathway laid out in the Helms-Burton Act supersedes those general rules.

“That erroneous holding impedes private suits against Cuban agencies and instrumentalities and stymies important foreign-policy interests in holding the Cuban government accountable for continuing to benefit from its illegal expropriations,” the Justice Department wrote in support of Exxon’s petition.

The state-owned companies urged the justices to turn away the appeal, writing that “the Court has repeatedly warned of the fallacies and perils of this approach to statutory interpretation.”

The Supreme Court will hear the case alongside a lawsuit against some of the world’s biggest cruise lines.

Havana Docks Corporation, which built and possessed 99-year rights to operate the piers at the Port of Havana, is seeking compensation after the Castro regime took over the port upon assuming power.

The company is suing Carnival, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean for disembarking nearly 1 million tourists on the docks between 2015 and 2019 and taking in hundreds of millions of dollars from those trips — paying Cuba but not Havana Docks.

A lower court ordered the cruise lines to pay Havana Docks $440 million. The Supreme Court will review an appeals panel’s decision to reverse the judgment since the company’s 99-year rights to the docks expired in 2004, before the voyages in question took place.

Havana Docks warned that would cut off legal claims Congress intended to allow, but the cruise lines said the petition was “full of overstatements” and the case didn’t merit the justices’ attention.

Earlier this year, members of the University of Virginia School of Law’s International Human Rights Law Clinic traveled to Costa Rica to attend a hearing at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on a matter that could ripple across international law.

The case, Chirinos Salamanca and Others v. Venezuela, concerned the state’s responsibility for alleged human rights violations of 12 police officers, who were incarcerated and tortured in the infamous Helicoide prison in Caracas.

The hearing, however, was not about whether there were human rights violations but rather who the court recognized as the legitimate government of Venezuela, which could determine if the international court had jurisdiction to hear the case.

That issue arose because of the existence of two competing governments: the de facto government led by President Nicolás Maduro and an interim government appointed by the National Assembly.

The Venezuelan government argued that the alleged human rights violations occurred during the gap between Maduro’s withdrawal of the country from the American Convention on Human Rights and the 2019 re-ratification of the treaty by the National Assembly government, then led by Juan Guaidó, which claimed power that year.

As a result, in Chirinos, the court had to address the question of whether it could recognize a de facto government when a rival constitutional government simultaneously claimed authority over the same state.

Recognizing the importance of the case for international human rights law and public international law, I and fellow clinic members Luci Harris ’25 and Elijah Brown ’26, along with Professor Camilo Sánchez, the clinic’s director, submitted an amicus curiae brief to the court.

The brief reviewed state practice and scholarly literature on how international law deals with competing governments, highlighting that while there is no single binding rule, customary international law provides a framework of principles (such as constitutional legitimacy, effective control and democratic legitimacy) that courts can apply to determine which government may bind the state in treaty matters.

The clinic urged the court to embrace this framework and emphasized that international tribunals are not powerless in these situations: They have both the authority and responsibility to decide questions of governmental identity when necessary to uphold human rights obligations.

In late August, the court issued its decision on the question of jurisdiction. In a unanimous decision, it held that the convention remained binding on Venezuela. The court cited the clinic’s brief in a footnote, and its reasoning reflected many of the same arguments. By emphasizing principles like state continuity and effet utile (the idea that treaties must be read in a way that preserves their effectiveness), the brief helped ground the court’s conclusion that Venezuela’s human rights obligations remained intact despite Maduro’s attempted withdrawal from the treaty.

This marked a significant victory for the clinic’s client and carries resounding implications for international human rights law. The decision serves as guidance to other international courts adjudicating human rights issues when authoritarian governments seek to withdraw from treaties to avoid accountability, such as the Taliban’s withdrawal of Afghanistan from the International Criminal Court.

The clinic’s work strengthened the court’s reasoning and gave added legitimacy to a decision that breaks new ground in international law.",https://www.law.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph_image/public/images/2340_human_rights_clinic_costa_rica_main.jpg?h=16e2d142&itok=qXz_st2k,N,,2025-10-03 13:57:29.622137

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

Government shutdown projected to have a light impact on border and migration enforcement: Congress failed to pass a budget by September 30, triggering the first U.S. government shutdown since 2019. While all federal employees face delayed pay, nearly all DHS personnel—including over 93% of CBP and ICE staff—are deemed essential and are required to continue working. Military personnel deployed to the border will also continue operations, though National Guard members in particular risk hardship in a prolonged shutdown. Immigration courts may be forced to postpone cases if the shutdown drags on.

Abuses continue to accompany “mass deportation” operations: The Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago has led to more than 800 arrests, highly visible federal deployments, violent response to protests at an ICE facility in Broadview, and a late-night raid that traumatized residents of an apartment complex. Similar incidents in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Washington, DC show a pattern of increasingly aggressive enforcement. Detention numbers remain near record highs, with growing shares of non-criminal migrants held in poor or secretive conditions. Civil liberties concerns are mounting over warrantless arrests, data-mining surveillance tools, and the Supreme Court’s green light for racial profiling.

Notes from Mexico: About 1,200 mostly Cuban migrants left Tapachula, Chiapas on October 1 in a caravan bound not for the United States but for Mexico City. Meanwhile, Mexico’s former migration chief issued a court-ordered apology for the 2023 Ciudad Juárez detention fire that killed 40, which victims’ families condemned as inadequate. At the border, officials continue to block asylum processing as Border Patrol sought to debunk smugglers’ online disinformation.

THE FULL UPDATE:

Government shutdown projected to have a light impact on border and migration enforcement

The U.S. government’s 2025 fiscal year ended on September 30, and Congress was unable to agree on an appropriations bill to keep the government running. Until that changes, the federal government is “shut down” for the first time since 2019. Government employees are working without pay, although those deemed “essential” are required to report to work. Federal employees receive back pay after shutdowns conclude; however, a prolonged shutdown can cause financial hardship for those without significant savings.

Approximately 95 percent of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees, or nearly 258,000 workers, are expected to continue working as the government shuts down, as the Department’s contingency plan designates them as essential. That includes over 93 percent of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees, whose agencies are flush with cash from the giant “big beautiful bill” appropriation that Congress passed in early July.

At the U.S.-Mexico border, Border Patrol agents and CBP officers will continue working during the shutdown. Border Patrol agents will also remain in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, where the Trump administration sent agents “due to violence outside ICE facilities” late last week, the Washington Examiner reported.

The Defense Department, listing the U.S.-Mexico border as one of its top priorities, announced that military personnel deployed there will not be furloughed during the government shutdown. Active-duty troops and reservists will continue their border activities, with pay halted after October 15, according to the Washington Examiner. That may be a major hardship for many National Guard personnel, who typically serve part-time and are already pulled away from their civilian jobs. The Examiner, citing the Defense Department, noted that “a total of 8,500 military personnel assigned to the Joint Task Force Southern Border remain on duty.”

Elsewhere in the immigration system, a prolonged shutdown could force the immigration court system (Executive Office for Immigration Review, within the Department of Justice) to reschedule “tens of thousands of cases,” according to the American Immigration Council.

Abuses continue to accompany “mass deportation” operations

Chicago

The Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration crackdown, launched on September 8 in Chicago, continues at an intense pace. Arrests now exceed 800, according to DHS. Border Patrol agents and other federal law enforcement personnel, their faces often covered, were highly visible in the city’s downtown and tourist areas over the weekend of September 27-28. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) called them “jackbooted thugs roaming around a peaceful downtown.”

The administration announced that it is deploying 100 National Guard troops to protect federal facilities. Those likely include an ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, which has been the site of regular protests and escalatory official responses. Local officials, including the mayor and police chief, have voiced alarm at the violent nature of agents’ response to protesters, particularly their liberal use of tear gas and chemical agents, and have opened three criminal investigations.

Incidents under local investigation include two hit-and-run vehicle strikes of pedestrians, and what appears to be the totally unprovoked firing of a pepper ball at a CBS News Chicago reporter inside her vehicle on September 28. “People were peacefully standing behind the fence and for absolutely no reason, pepper balls were fired” on September 26, a pastor on the scene at Broadview told Reuters.

“The relentless deployment of tear gas, pepper spray, and mace at the ICE facility is endangering nearby village residents, harming police officers, harming firefighters, and American citizens exercising their First Amendment rights,” said Mayor Katrina Thompson. “I was offended,” said Police Chief Thomas Mills, citing ICE agents verbally abusing his officers. “I’ve worked with a lot of federal agencies on criminal investigations, that has never happened. We may not have always seen eye to eye, but we’ve always been able to work it out for the good of the community.”

“This is not Putin’s Russia,” Mayor Thompson added. “This is America.”

Nearly 300 ICE, Border Patrol, and other federal agents conducted a late-night raid on September 30, replete with military weapons and tactics, in an apartment building on Chicago’s South Shore, leading to the arrest of 37 people accused of drug trafficking, weapons crimes, and immigration violations. Residents and neighbors described it as a “traumatic event” as agents in camouflage uniforms and carrying heavy weapons pulled nearly every one of the building’s occupants from their apartments regardless of their age or state of undress, leaving many of the apartments badly ransacked, the local ABC affiliate and Chicago public radio reported. DHS claimed that the apartment’s neighborhood was “a location known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members and their associates,” referring to the Venezuelan criminal organization, but provided no evidence to back up that assertion.

Eboni Watson, a neighbor, told ABC of hearing several flash-bang grenades. “‘They was terrified. The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other,’ Watson said. ‘That’s all I kept asking. What is the morality? Where’s the human? One of them literally laughed. He was standing right here. He said, ‘f them kids.’’”

As dozens of onlookers watched and recorded, Border Patrol agents detained a family of asylum seekers from Guatemala while the children, aged eight and three, were playing in a fountain in Chicago’s lakefront Millennium Park on the afternoon of Sunday, September 28. Authorities sought to detain the family under a July 8 order to deny bond even to documented asylum seekers if they had entered U.S. territory without inspection. A federal judge ordered the release of the mother and kids on October 1, but the father is now detained in Texas. “There were a lot more people there [at the park], but the agents came directly to us because of how we look,” the mother told the Chicago Tribune. “It’s not fair.”

The Washington Post spoke to “four experts with decades of experience in criminal justice” who reviewed footage of the September 12 incident during which an ICE agent shot and killed a 38-year-old Mexican father, Silverio VIllegas-González, in the Chicago suburb of Franklin Park. They had strong criticisms of the way the agents chose to confront Villegas-González and their subsequent use of force.

“We don’t stop in front of the vehicle for routine stops,” said a senior Northern California police official. “That’s just an officer safety issue.” Another criticized agents’ decision to reach into a vehicle that might start moving and observed that shooting at the vehicle, as an agent did, is not “a reliable way of actually stopping that vehicle.” By hitting the driver, the agent “just created an uncontrolled, unguided missile.”

Other cities

In New York City, an ICE agent returned to duty on September 29, just three days after being caught on video grabbing a distraught Ecuadorian woman who was clinging to her detained husband, then roughly throwing her to the floor of a corridor at the 26 Federal Plaza building that houses Manhattan’s immigration court. ICE had announced on September 26 that the unnamed agent was “being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,” but he has been reinstated. The status of any investigation is unclear.

Four days later, citizen video caught ICE agents violently throwing two photojournalists to the ground in the Federal Plaza hallway. One had to be hospitalized. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) wrote on Twitter: “Masked ICE agents shoved and injured journalists today at Federal Plaza. One reporter left on a stretcher. This abuse of law-abiding immigrants and the reporters telling their stories must end. What the hell are we doing here?”

In Van Nuys, California, a 79-year-old car wash owner has filed a $50 million federal claim alleging he was body-slammed and detained by masked ICE and Border Patrol agents during a September 9 raid at his business. Rafie Allah Shouhed suffered multiple broken ribs, elbow injuries, and a traumatic brain injury, according to the claim, despite his attempts to show proof of his employees’ work authorization. The claim asserts that agents responded, “You don’t f— with ICE. We are here.”

In Chelsea, Massachusetts, Reuters reported, ICE dragged a Guatemalan permanent resident out of her car while she was accompanying a relative to an immigration court hearing, then threw her to the ground. “Reuters captured images of the woman on the ground, her hands pinned behind her back, being detained by federal agents while her son stood nearby crying.”

The New York Times looked at how Washington, DC has become “a testing ground for ICE,” as the agency arrested about 1,200 people between early August and mid-September, up from 85 between January 20 and the end of July. It largely did so by targeting immigrants during minor traffic stops alongside the city’s police force and the U.S. Park Police.

Profiling

Several Washington-based immigrant rights defense groups and Washington, DC citizens filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court seeking to stop practices like these, which they say rely on racial profiling. “In some instances, the racial profiling is blatant and explicit,” the suit reads, recounting several cases of agents holding citizens and legal residents for hours or more based on their appearance. Among examples is that of plaintiff José Escobar Molina:

Agents immediately handcuffed Mr. Escobar Molina, grabbed him by the arms and legs, and called him “illegal” repeatedly. When he responded that he has “papers” (in other words, immigration status), they replied, “No you don’t. You are illegal.” After the agents put Mr. Escobar Molina into a vehicle, when Mr. Escobar Molina told them again that he had “papers,” the driver of the car yelled at him, “Shut up, b—-! You’re illegal.”

At a Slate podcast, legal analysts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern recalled the September 8 Supreme Court ruling allowing immigration enforcement personnel to target individuals based solely on their apparent race, ethnicity, language, location, or employment while lower-court challenges proceed (see WOLA’s September 12 Border Update). In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh had stated that resulting stops of U.S. citizens would be “typically brief.” As cases of prolonged and abusive stops of citizens and residents accumulate, commentators are commonly referring to them with the ironic term “Kavanaugh stops.”

The New York Times identified at least 15 cases since January of U.S. citizens arrested or detained in immigration sweeps. They are usually Latino men mistakenly detained and questioned. Despite declaring their citizenship, many have been ignored, handcuffed, and held in immigration facilities without access to a lawyer or phone call. “You’ve got no rights here. You’re illegal, brother,” a Florida state trooper, recorded on mobile phone video, said to 18-year-old U.S. citizen Kenny Laynez-Ambrosio. Leonardo Garcia Venegas, who was born in Florida, was stopped twice in less than two months.

Gregory Bovino, the chief of Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector who is now a “commander-at-large” and the face of operations in Los Angeles and Chicago, faced criticism for comments he made to WBEZ public radio reporter Chip Mitchell. Shortly after agents chased a man, Mitchell asked Bovino why agents thought the man was undocumented. Bovino replied, “There’s many different factors that go into something like that. It would be agent experience, intelligence that indicates there’s illegal alienage in a particular place or location. Then obviously the particular characteristics of an individual, how they look. How do they look compared to, say, you?” Mitchell is a middle-aged White man. “How do they appear in relation to what you or other people look like?”

Gov. Pritzker accused Bovino’s forces of “harassing people for not being white.” Bovino said that Mitchell took his comments out of context, calling them “grossly inaccurate,” but WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times produced the recording and transcript.

Bovino was at the center of another news story, from his time heading the mass-deportation operation in Los Angeles over the summer. The acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California in Sacramento, career prosecutor Michele Beckwith, told the New York Times that she was fired for insisting that Border Patrol agents obey an injunction (not applicable to Los Angeles) prohibiting agents from carrying out indiscriminate raids in central California.

Her firing occurred shortly after she issued that warning to Bovino. The Times reported that on July 15, “she emailed Mr. Bovino to reiterate she expected ‘compliance with court orders and the Constitution.’ Hours later, her work cellphone went dark. Then her computer did, too. She checked her personal email account,” where she got a message—six hours after sending a message to Bovino—informing her of her immediate firing from the Department of Justice after 15 years of service.

Bovino shared with the Times a statement: “The former Acting US Attorney’s email suggesting that the United States Border Patrol does not ALWAYS abide by the Constitution revealed a bias against law enforcement.” (In fact, federal judges in two cases this year have found the behavior of agents under Bovino’s command to be at odds with the Constitution.) The Los Angeles Times noted, “Two days later on July 17, Bovino and his agents moved into Sacramento, conducting a raid at a Home Depot south of downtown.”

Detention

The latest numbers from ICE, released on September 25 and current as of September 21, show a population of 59,762 in the agency’s network of detention facilities, a number that may exclude many currently held at some state governments’ new detention sites. The overall population number remains slightly down from the 61,226 detained people noted in ICE’s August 29 report, which was likely a record.

Of the 46,015 in detention on September 21 who ICE had arrested in the U.S. interior, 36 percent had no criminal record, up from 6 percent at the end of the Biden administration. That category exceeded the other two reported statuses (34% “convicted criminal” and 30% “pending charges”). This is the first time that migrants with no criminal record have been the largest category during the Trump administration, according to immigration data analyst Austin Kocher.

The Guardian reported on deplorable conditions at a new, hastily opened, and not fully licensed detention center, run by the ICE contractor CoreCivic, in California City, California. Detained people cited a lack of access to hygiene supplies, inadequate food and medications, chronically backed-up toilets and sinks, and mistreatment by staff, including threats of solitary confinement. “This place is built to break us,” said a detained person from Cambodia. “There is nothing but harassment and torture here. It’s inhumane, unsanitary, and a health hazard every single day… Please, please help us, please.”

A Huffington Post investigation by Matt Shuham highlighted the Trump administration’s expansion of a network of state-run immigration detention centers, with the massive facility that Florida opened in the Everglades as a prototype. These detention sites are operating under murky legal authority, routinely restrict detained people’s access to legal counsel, and have notoriously harsh conditions, while those held there often fail to turn up in ICE’s locator database and are effectively missing. Reports include lack of medical care, sanitation failures, exposure to extreme elements as punishment, and hunger strikes. Similar facilities are popping up in Texas, Nebraska, Louisiana, and Indiana.

“Would the world know if someone died in Alligator Alcatraz?” Shuham asked, using the name that Florida’s government uses to refer to its Everglades facility. “After at least one medical emergency last month, when a man collapsed at the site, attorneys and activists aren’t so sure.” Two of those interviewed called the Florida facility a “black site.”

ICE is transferring many in detention to other facilities across the country, despite available space at nearby sites, the Los Angeles Times reported. The practice degrades detained people’s access to legal representation and medical care. Some are being moved multiple times within a short period. “Transfers have been used as a retaliatory tactic for those who make requests, file complaints, or stage protests such as hunger strikes,” noted reporter Gabrielle Lamarr Lemee. Between January and July, 12 percent of those in the detention system had been moved at least four times, up from 6 percent during the same period in 2024.

Miguel Ángel García, who was shot by a sniper while being held in a vehicle outside a Dallas ICE facility, died of his wounds on September 30. He is the second fatal victim of the September 24 incident. Brought to the United States from Mexico as a child, García was 31, and his wife is expecting their fifth child. Juan Proaño of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) told the Washington Post that while he lay unconscious for the previous several days, “García’s wife was allowed twice daily visits for two hours while a Department of Homeland Security officer guarded her husband’s hospital bed, and that officers kept soft restraints on his arms and shackled him.”

Cybersecurity and DHS data mining

ICE has purchased access to surveillance tools from contractor Penlink, known as Tangles and Webloc, which track the locations of hundreds of millions of mobile phones every day, including data from social media, according to 404 Media. The outlet has broken several stories about ICE data technology purchases that raise concerns about privacy and civil liberties. “The Biden Administration shut down DHS’s location data purchases after an inspector general found that DHS had broken the law. Every American should be concerned that Trump’s hand-picked security force is once again buying and using location data without a warrant,” read a statement to 404 Media from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon).

In-depth analyses

A New York Times Magazine piece by Bruce Schoenfeld discussed the tension between the Los Angeles Dodgers and their Latino fan base since ICE raids increased in the city in June. The team’s initially “strangely quiet” stance on the issue led to backlash and accusations of betrayal.

A report from the Migration Policy Institute documented the Trump administration’s radical expansion of expedited removal, a 29-year-old procedure, from a border-focused process to a nationwide means of fast-tracking asylum seekers’ cases and deporting most of them. Expedited removal “could, in theory, be applied to at least 2.5 million noncitizens,” estimate authors Muzaffar Chishti and Kathleen Bush-Joseph. The number includes asylum seekers and individuals granted temporary protections, such as Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole, that the Trump administration has revoked.

At his “Huddled Masses” column at the Bulwark, Adrián Carrasquillo highlighted the increase in detainee deaths since the Trump administration began. “They’re incarcerating people and allowing them to die, not providing medical facilities. There are no standards. It’s horrific,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington), the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement, told Carrasquillo. The column cited body camera footage of a September 4 arrest of a documented migrant in upstate New York, in which a Border Patrol agent discussed how he routinely denies detainees permission to leave cells, even for medical issues, concluding, “They’re animals anyway. That’s what I would tell my kids all the time.”

Writing for Workday Magazine and the American Prospect, Sarah Lazare contended that the Chicago crackdown has created fear and intimidation among workers, hindering their efforts to improve working conditions and to organize for labor protections.

At Vox, Christian Paz discussed the September 24 shooting at the Dallas immigration facility, drawing attention to Democratic Party politicians’ cautious, “splintered” response, even as President Trump and other Republicans pushed talking points blaming Democrats’ past criticism of ICE for inspiring the violence. “Republicans are all-in on ICE, while Democrats are coming to realize that they need to decide what to say, and what to propose to do, about the agency,” Paz concluded.

At her newsletter, former Biden administration official Andrea Flores discussed the Democratic Party’s lack of focus on comprehensive immigration reform, asylum policy, and border issues. “The Biden administration failed to confront the Republican governors busing migrants to Democratic states. They chose not to use their power and resources to direct new arrivals toward communities that needed workers and were willing to host them.” She contrasted that to Donald Trump’s far clearer anti-immigration vision, focused on restrictionist policies. Flores called for a more inclusive approach to immigration that addresses economic hardships faced by voters.

Notes from Mexico

“Caravan” protest in Chiapas

About 1,200 migrants, the majority of them citizens of Cuba, set out on foot from Mexico’s southern border-zone city of Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, in a so-called “caravan” protest. The intended destination of this journey, which began on October 1, is not the United States: it is Mexico City.

Reporting from Tapachula, Bryan Avelar of Spain’s El País noted that the “Trump effect”—the fear of the anti-immigrant climate in the United States—has made Mexico the place where “caravan” participants now wish to settle. “And why would I want to go to the United States? They hate us there!” said a woman from Cuba.

Instead, participants, who appear to be leaderless and to have organized themselves on social media platforms, are prodding the Mexican government to speed the issuance of documentation to live and work in Mexico, and to leave Chiapas, Mexico’s poorest state. Corruption is an obstacle, even in asylum cases, Avelar reported: “According to migrants, the slowness of the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance is due to a corruption network: outside the facilities, there are always one or two lawyers offering to expedite the process in exchange for a fee that can vary from 3,000 to 20,000 Mexican pesos ($150 to $1,000).”

Humanitarian aid organizations have observed an increase in the number of migrants establishing more permanent lives in Mexico, as noted by Mie Hoejris Dahl in a piece at the New Humanitarian. “Before, we didn’t see children enrolling in school,” said Joanna Williams of the Kino Border Initiative in Nogales. “There is more permanence now.” The article notes that the Trump administration’s foreign aid cuts forced a 60 percent cut in funding for UNHCR’s Mexico operations, which assist many humanitarian and migrant integration efforts, between February and June of this year.

Ciudad Juárez fire apology

The former head of the Mexican government’s National Migration Institute (INM), Francisco Garduño, issued a public apology to the victims of a March 2023 fire at the Ciudad Juárez immigrant detention station, in compliance with a court ruling. The fire killed 40 citizens of countries other than Mexico as INM guards vacated the facility with the migrants locked inside. Garduño, as the agency’s head, had faced homicide charges for the incident, but those were reduced to a minor offense requiring a court-ordered public apology.

“Reducing the responsibility of the former head of the INM to simple formal and administrative omissions is, for the victims and their families, an incomprehensible offense, a denial of the very seriousness of the events, of the value of the lives of the people who died there,” read a statement from the Fundación para la Justicia, which represents several of the victims. The Fundación called it “a case of selective justice and protection of the hierarchical structure.”

23-year-old Wilson Juárez Hernández, who suffered neural damage from smoke inhalation and cannot speak or walk properly, told Garduño “that he knew his apology was for his own personal benefit, as it would free him from criminal prosecution,” La Verdad de Juárez reported. “The difference between you and me, Garduño, is that you can walk.” Added a relative of one of the deceased, “We cannot accept an apology until there is a thorough investigation into what happened and who was responsible.”

Doctors Without Borders (MSF), one of the few migrant aid groups operating in Tamaulipas, regarded as Mexico’s most dangerous border state, will be ending its assistance project in Reynosa and Matamoros after eight years. MSF cited a need to reorganize its presence, in part a consequence of reduced migration to the United States since the Trump administration’s crackdowns began.

U.S. gun trafficking agreement with Mexico

The U.S. and Mexican governments announced a new initiative, “Mission Firewall,” that will take steps to address southbound weapons trafficking from the United States into Mexico. Measures include increased information sharing, more southbound inspections, and expanded Mexican access to a secure database called eTrace. “U.S. federal authorities in 2023 seized more than 1,100 pistols and rifles being smuggled to Mexico through southbound land U.S. ports of entry,” noted Border Report. “This year, that number is less than 600, according to Customs and Border Protection data.”

Border Patrol cites smugglers’ disinformation

Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector held a press conference in Spanish to seek to debunk misinformation spread by Mexican migrant smugglers on social media. The misleading messaging claims that the U.S. border is open and that new asylum laws allow for safe, easy entry. One viral video claims that, as of September 21, U.S. borders are open to migrants who have valid passports, lack significant tattoos, and can prove that they are fleeing their countries of origin. Another shows people covered with some sort of mesh, billed as a “new technique” for crossing the Rio Grande without being detected by radar.

The Trump administration continues to suspend all asylum processing at the border, though a court ruling allows people who arrive at the border claiming fear of return to their countries to seek “withholding of removal” or Convention Against Torture protections (see WOLA’s August 8 Border Update). Even those seeking such protections are ending up detained. “The days of turning yourself in and being released are over,” said supervisory Border Patrol agent Jesús Vasavilbaso.

Earlier this year, the Trump Administration, disregarding the clear letter of the law and intent of Congress, declared that States would be unable to access VOCA funds – used to support victims and survivors of crimes – unless they go along with the Trump Administration’s demands that States assist in federal immigration enforcement.

“These grants help a mom and her kids stay safe when they have nowhere else to turn. They make sure a survivor can sit with a counselor after trauma, and they help advocates be there when victims need them most,” said Attorney General Dan Rayfield. “The Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to put conditions on these federal funds would have put those services at risk. This outcome ensures that critical support for victims and their families will continue here in Oregon.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable States to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives: victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more. These funding streams—totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide—have long ensured that States could fulfill their most fundamental duties: to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents.

However, the Trump Administration, through the DOJ, previously declared that States, along with the victims and survivors they serve, would be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the Administration’s political agenda – namely its immigration enforcement priorities. In order to receive these funds, States were told that they must devote resources to assisting the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with civil immigration enforcement efforts – a federal, not state, government responsibility.

In Oregon, 146 victim service providers rely on VOCA grants, and faced a loss of around $15 million in 2025 under these federal cuts. Because VOCA is funded by criminal fines—not taxpayer dollars, it was designed to support victims, not to be used as leverage for unrelated political interests.

Following the lawsuit brought forward by the coalition, the DOJ abandoned its plan to impose these conditions on $178 million in VOCA Victim Assistance Grants and $1.2 billion in VOCA Victim Compensation grants. These grants will continue to be provided to states with no requirement that States assist DHS in immigration enforcement.

Trump Administration's immigration ...","Attorney General Neronha announces key victory in multistate lawsuit against Trump Administration’s imposition of illegal conditions on grants for crime victims

Attorney General Peter F. Neronha today announced that following the filing of a lawsuit, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has now dropped its plan to impose illegal conditions on nearly $1.4 billion in Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants. Earlier this year, the Trump Administration, disregarding the clear letter of the law and intent of Congress, declared that States would be unable to access VOCA funds – used to support victims and survivors of crimes – unless they accede to the Trump Administration’s immigration priorities.

“Because of the action taken by this coalition, more than a billion dollars in federal grant funding for victims of crime has been secured,” said Attorney General Neronha. “What does that tell us? The unlawful actions of this Administration are being recognized as such by the courts, and they are losing these lawsuits. It also tells us that as all-powerful as this President would like you to believe he is, he’s still limited by the letter of the law and the separation of powers. Today we celebrate the win, and tomorrow we continue the fight.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable states to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives. Supported programs include victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more. These funding streams—totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide—have long ensured that states could fulfill their most fundamental duties: to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents. States use these funds to assist nearly nine million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year. Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to states based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump Administration, through the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ), has declared that states, along with the victims and survivors they serve, will be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the Administration’s political agenda – namely its immigration enforcement priorities. To receive these funds, states must assist the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with civil immigration enforcement efforts – a federal government responsibility.

This directive conflicts with core principles of American governance – the separation of powers and federalism. Congress did not authorize USDOJ to impose conditions on these grant programs that coerce states to devote their resources to enacting the Administration’s immigration agenda. As such, Attorney General Neronha and the coalition are requesting that the Court permanently enjoin the Trump Administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.

In Rhode Island, VOCA grants are the primary source of funding for victim services. Most of that funding flows from VOCA’s two main grants: victim compensation grants, which provide direct financial support to crime victims, and victim assistance grants, which are almost entirely distributed to nonprofits throughout the state to provide additional support services to those impacted by crime. For federal FY 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3 million in VOCA victim assistance funds and another close to $300K in VOCA victim compensation funds. During that same time period, VOCA assistance funds were used to provide services to approximately 41,015 individuals through dozens of nonprofits, and 635 individuals received VOCA compensation payments through the State’s Crime Victim Compensation Program.

Attorney General Neronha co-led this coalition together with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and is joined in filing the lawsuit by the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

This is not the first time federal agents have detained a U.S. citizen since launching operations Midway Blitz and At Large in September, seeking to increase immigration enforcement in Chicago and throughout Illinois.
The raid happened early Tuesday at an apartment building at 7500 S. South Shore Drive.
About 300 federal agents, some landing on the roof from helicopters, descended upon the building, according to NewsNation, which was invited along for the operation.
South Shore had been a landing spot for many Venezuelans when tens of thousands of migrants were bused from the southern border to Chicago and other Democrat-led cities.","SOUTH SHORE — Federal agents detained four children who are U.S. citizens during an ICE raid this week in South Shore, according to a report.

The children were held “until they could be placed in the care of guardians,” according to a New York Times report, which cited Department of Homeland Security officials. No further details were immediately available.

This is not the first time federal agents have detained a U.S. citizen since launching operations Midway Blitz and At Large in September, seeking to increase immigration enforcement in Chicago and throughout Illinois. But it is the first time they’ve publicly acknowledged detaining American children during the operations.

The raid happened early Tuesday at an apartment building at 7500 S. South Shore Drive. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said federal agencies arrested at least 37 people in the operation at the building, which they claimed is frequented by members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

About 300 federal agents, some landing on the roof from helicopters, descended upon the building, according to NewsNation, which was invited along for the operation.

The report didn’t mention women and children appear to be among the detained, said Brandon Lee, a spokesman with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Organizers worry many people were taken without warrants.

“These were families with their children escorted out in the middle of the night,” Lee said. “This administration is using PR efforts to try to turn communities against their neighbors.”

Residents told Block Club that agents busted open residents’ doors and took away neighbors, leaving behind ransacked units.

Rodrick Johnson, who lives in the buildling and is a U.S. citizen, said he heard “people dropping on the roof” before FBI agents kicked in his door. He was stuffed inside a van with his neighbors for what felt like several hours until agents told them the building was clear, he said.

“They didn’t tell me why I was being detained,” Johnson said. “They left people’s doors open, firearms, money, whatever, right there in the open.”

The building has long had issues, neighbors said, but agents broke open its doors, allowing others to come in and steal from tenants in the hours after the raid.

On Wednesday, walls on the building’s second floor were spray-painted with “Venezuela,” but it was unclear how long the graffiti had been there. Many of the floor’s units had broken doors and appeared to be home to young children.

South Shore had been a landing spot for many Venezuelans when tens of thousands of migrants were bused from the southern border to Chicago and other Democrat-led cities.

“People stayed at shelters there and then found apartments,” Lee said.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/100125-7500-S-South-Shore-Raid-Colin-Boyle-4078.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:58:37.191964

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought first announced the freeze on the Chicago projects on Friday morning.
It was the third time in recent days that he revealed funding actions by the Trump administration targeting cities and states led by Democrats.
Vought on Wednesday revealed that the Department of Transportation was freezing $18 billion in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects in New York City.","The Trump administration on Friday froze $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding for two projects to improve Chicago's transit system.

The DOT in a statement blamed Congress' two Democratic leaders — Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries — for the federal government shutdown, which the department claimed would slow a review of the Chicago projects to ensure they do not involve ""unconstitutional practices"" related to the race or gender of construction workers.

That statement echoed a Trump administration talking point that Democrats in Congress are refusing to vote for a short-term funding agreement that would reopen the government because they insist on providing health-care benefits for ""illegal immigrants.""

Democrats call that claim a lie designed to distract from their goal of continuing the offer of enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance plan subsidies to more than 20 million Americans.

""At a time when federal agents are sowing chaos in Chicago, the Trump administration is holding bipartisan funding hostage,"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a social media post on X after the DOT's announcement.

""It's attempting to score political points but is instead hurting our economy and the hardworking people who rely on public transit to get to work or school,"" wrote Pritzker, who, like Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, is a Democrat.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought first announced the freeze on the Chicago projects on Friday morning.

It was the third time in recent days that he revealed funding actions by the Trump administration targeting cities and states led by Democrats.

President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have blamed Democrats in Congress for the shutdown, which hit its third day on Friday.

Trump said on Thursday that the shutdown had given him an ""unprecedented opportunity"" to cut what he called ""Democrat Agencies.""

Vought on Wednesday revealed that the Department of Transportation was freezing $18 billion in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects in New York City. Both Schumer and Jeffries are from New York City.

Later that same day, Vought said that the Department of Energy had cancelled nearly $8 billion in funding for climate-related projects and other efforts in 16 states, all of which were won by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

On Friday, Vought, in a post on X, wrote, ""$2.1 billion in Chicago infrastructure projects -- specifically the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project -- have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.""

Both projects are overseen by the Chicago Transit Authority, which operates the city's train and bus system.

The Red Line Extension project will extend that train line by 5.5 miles with four new stations between the existing terminal at 95th/Dan Ryan to 130th Street. The Red and Purple Modernization Project is reconstructing infrastructure along those color train lines.

The U.S. DOT later Friday said, ""This week, USDOT issued an interim final rule (IFR) barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants.""

""To continue implementation of this rule, USDOT today sent letters to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to inform them that"" the two CTA projects ""are also under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring,"" the DOT said.

The DOT in its statement said the freeze on the Chicago money ""is in addition to reviews of New York's Second Avenue Subway and Hudson Tunnel projects,"" the department said. ""Illinois, like New York, is well known to promote race- and sex-based contracting and other racial preferences as a public policy.""

The DOT also said that Americans ""don't care what race or gender construction workers, pipefitters, or electricians are. They just want these massive projects finally built quickly and efficiently.""

""Unfortunately, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries' decision to shut down the government has negatively affected the Department's staffing resources for carrying out this important analysis,"" the department said.

""We urge Democrats in Congress to stop holding the federal government's budget hostage so USDOT can get back to the important work of the American people,"" the DOT said.

""Just kind of a rainy morning in Portland with a couple people doing what they can,"" he said of the protests. ""And it's evolved.""

Jack is hard to miss in the images of these recent protests. He's always dressed in a bright yellow chicken onesie and draped in the American flag.

""It kind of dismantles their narrative that we're some radical terrorist organization,"" Jack said. ""We're just kind of Portlanders keeping Portland weird.""

The protests escalate at night, Jack acknowledged, when more demonstrators come down and get rowdier — and federal officers periodically come out to meet them.

Video taken by a KGW crew Wednesday shows one person being pepper sprayed; later, a group of federal agents walked out toward the crowd with riot shields up, grabbing one person from outside and pulling him inside the ICE building.

A FOX News correspondent posted images and footage from the roof of the federal building which appear to show the same person apprehended by federal agents. ICE has yet to respond to questions about the detainment.

Also on Wednesday, Portland Police Chief Bob Day was on CNN, responding to President Donald Trump's decision to deploy the Oregon National Guard in Portland.

""Do you believe having them there is necessary; do you need them there?"" asked CNN's Kaitlin Collins.

""No. As you highlighted a moment ago, we're talking about one city block in 145 square miles,"" Day said. ""There certainly been some challenges down at the facility; Portland police has been engaged down there extensively. Over the last nine months, we've made over 20 arrests ourselves, we've conducted assault investigations, ongoing.""

According to an infographic shared by the FBI on Thursday, the feds made one arrest in the last 24 hours, allegedly for destruction of federal property. The agency said it has 27 active and pending investigations, though they claim 128 arrests since June 9.

""We are not tolerating violence or vandalism or illegal behavior, but we also are huge proponents of free speech and for people to be able to travel freely and safely about the city,"" said Day.

Johanna King, 86, lives in senior housing not far from the ICE building. On Sunday, she said she was pepper sprayed by federal agents while outside the facility.

""I don't know where to even start ... I had my kids over here for dinner we were upstairs on the 24th floor and we saw these helicopters going by,"" King said. ""We decided to go down to have a look, see what was happening.""

At least one U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter has been circling the South Waterfront since an influx of federal law enforcement resources arrived in the city last Friday. Still to come are federalized troops from the Oregon National Guard.

King said she and her family members went down and stood on public property outside the ICE building Sunday night when some of her family members started shouting at federal agents inside.

""A bunch of these black-clothed fellows appeared behind the gate — 10 or 12 of them, big crowd,"" she said. ""The kids started taunting them, 'Hey, you gonna arrest this old lady,' and we thought that was pretty funny.""

Shortly after, King said they were hit with what she described as pepper spray.

""No warning whatsoever,"" she said. ""Suddenly, I started choking and coughing and coughing and coughing, and my daughter is sneezing and coughing.""

King said there's ""no question"" that the spray or whatever it had come from the federal agents.

""We walked back; I'm coughing the whole way,"" she said with a cough. ""I'm still coughing a little.""

King is a photographer and has been documenting protests for decades, going back to the Civil Rights Movement. She's got the pictures to prove it.

""I've been through this before, you know,"" King said. ""I'm old enough at 86 to have seen (that) number one, demonstrating is really important — standing up for the rights of yourself and other people, it's really important, you have to do it — and secondly, it makes a difference in the long run.""

“This action is very dangerous,” he told RFE/RL’s Radio Farda. “It normalizes the human rights situation in Iran and puts people at risk on their return.”

Herischi represents two of those among the first deportees -- one who had sought political asylum, another who had converted from Islam.

Both were escorted onto flights with “handcuffs,” Herischi said, only to be delivered back to the very country they had fled – a country which, according to Herischi, was not designated by his clients as their extradition destination.

“I’m worried about my clients, who have arrived in Tehran,” he said. “After a few days, the authorities will begin interrogating them.”

Families Separated, Cases Unheard

Beyond his own clients, Herischi describes a deportation process that was deeply flawed.

In some cases, families were split apart: mothers and children kept in the United States while fathers were suddenly deported. If those family members are later granted asylum, he argues, the deported parent would have qualified as well.

Herischi also points to what he sees as a failure of US immigration authorities to prioritize removals.

“There was no proper prioritization,” Herischi said. “Those deported are low priority. There are still people with criminal records or even former Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps members waiting here.”

Iranian officials say roughly 400 nationals have been targeted for expulsion, most accused of entering the United States illegally through Mexico. Yet the opaque process and lack of government transparency leave unanswered questions about who was deported -- and why.

The New York Times, which first reported the deportation flight, describes the arrangement between Washington and Tehran as a “rare moment of cooperation” between adversaries. But critics argue the deal has come at the expense of vulnerable migrants whose asylum applications were either denied, ignored, or left unresolved.

Human Rights At Stake

Human rights advocates have consistently urged the United States not to expel individuals to countries with poor rights records. Iran’s record, they say, is among the worst.

The Islamic republic continues widespread persecution of political dissidents, activists, religious minorities, and LGBTQ individuals -- the very groups that make up a significant portion of Iranians arriving at the American border.

SEE ALSO: Iran Expands Penalties For Espionage Amid Surge In Executions

In recent years, significant numbers of Iranians have joined larger migrant flows through Central America into the United States, citing those same risks as reasons for seeking asylum. While many cases stalled in the US asylum system, the current deportations show how quickly those claims can be swept aside.

For critics like Herischi, the deportation program highlights a blunt policy more concerned with optics than outcomes. “The government just wants to quickly solve the migration problem,” he said, “without thinking about what comes next.”

In some cases, families were split apart: mothers and children kept in the United States while fathers were suddenly deported. If those family members are later granted asylum, he argues, the deported parent would have qualified as well.

Herischi also points to what he sees as a failure of US immigration authorities to prioritize removals.

“There was no proper prioritization,” Herischi said. “Those deported are low priority. There are still people with criminal records or even former Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps members waiting here.”

Iranian officials say roughly 400 nationals have been targeted for expulsion, most accused of entering the United States illegally through Mexico. Yet the opaque process and lack of government transparency leave unanswered questions about who was deported -- and why.

The New York Times, which first reported the deportation flight, describes the arrangement between Washington and Tehran as a “rare moment of cooperation” between adversaries. But critics argue the deal has come at the expense of vulnerable migrants whose asylum applications were either denied, ignored, or left unresolved.

Human Rights At Stake

Human rights advocates have consistently urged the United States not to expel individuals to countries with poor rights records. Iran’s record, they say, is among the worst.

The Islamic republic continues widespread persecution of political dissidents, activists, religious minorities, and LGBTQ individuals -- the very groups that make up a significant portion of Iranians arriving at the American border.

In recent years, significant numbers of Iranians have joined larger migrant flows through Central America into the United States, citing those same risks as reasons for seeking asylum. While many cases stalled in the US asylum system, the current deportations show how quickly those claims can be swept aside.

For critics like Herischi, the deportation program highlights a blunt policy more concerned with optics than outcomes. “The government just wants to quickly solve the migration problem,” he said, “without thinking about what comes next.”

I hope if you’re coming to this online, you’ll consider subscribing right here. It’s easy—and free:

Welcome to the era of what history will remember someday as the Kavanaugh Raids. Earlier this week, DHS surrounded and raided an entire apartment building in Chicago and then posted a Gotham-like sizzle reel of the highlights of that raid — armed masked stormtroopers, heavy weapons, helicopters, and search lights, all set to a Hans Zimmer-like soundtrack. Local media had a different take on it: “Armed federal agents in military fatigues busted down their doors overnight, pulling men, women and children from their apartments, some of them naked, residents and witnesses said. Agents approached or entered nearly every apartment in the five-story building, and U.S. citizens were among those detained for hours.”

It was a dark and almost certainly illegal escalation of the out-of-control agency’s war on the American people, a portrait of an authoritarian secret police that seems set to model itself on history’s worst fascist enforcers.

But let’s actually begin a hundred years ago — back when the right-wing stirred up a moral panic about subversive, criminal immigrants that led to large-scale raids by an attorney general abusing civil rights and civil liberties. (Sound familiar?)

Today, the one thing we remember about Woodrow Wilson’s attorney general A. Mitchell Palmer is that he was on the wrong side of history. Palmer oversaw a series of sweeping raids against suspected Communists during the country’s first Red Scare (there are two and they’re worth distinguishing between!) that ultimately led to the arrests and detention of perhaps as many as 10,000 people across nearly 40 US cities. The raids were led by a rising bureaucratic star named J. Edgar Hoover. Many arrests and seizures happened absent any warrants; many “radicals” were detained for simply being members of entirely legal organizations.

A cartoon from the Washington, D.C. “Evening Star” by Clifford K. Berryman, Nov. 8, 1919.

In his incredible history of that era, American Midnight, Adam Hoschchild writes, “Never was this raw underside of our nation’s life more revealingly on display than from 1917 to 1921… Major candidates for both the Republican and Democratic Party presidential nominations in 1920 campaigned on promises of mass deportations. And some people, including the vice president of the United States, suggested going further: Why limit deportation merely to immigrants? Why not permanently expel troublemakers of every sort? Also during this period, army machine-gun nests appeared in downtown Omaha and tanks on the streets of Cleveland, and armed troops patrolled many other American cities, from Butte, Montana, to Gary, Indiana. The military crafted a secret 57-page contingency plan to put the entire country under martial law. During those four years more than 450 people were imprisoned for a year or more by the federal government, and an estimated greater number by state governments, merely for what they wrote or said…. Presumably excluding slavery, the historian Alan Brinkley calls the Palmer Raids ‘arguably the greatest single violation civil liberties in American history.’”

Reading about the Palmer Raids today seems shocking — they surely were some of the darkest hours of American history — and yet today, ICE seems to be speed-running the years-long run-up to the Palmer Raids in just a matter of weeks and months. And, it appears, that the 2020s version of those same, indiscriminate, Constitution-violating raids will be known henceforth as Kavanaugh Raids, after the Supreme Court justice who helped make them possible.

Chicago media this week has been ablaze with horrifying stories from Monday’s ICE raid on a South Shore apartment building; DHS has bragged that the raid ended with 37 arrests, but the on-the-scene witness reporting describes a level of scale and brutality we’ve never seen in ICE’s raids so far. ICE blew in doors, handcuffed American citizens, rousted people from their beds in the middle of the night, and zip-tied children as they waited to figure out who was undocumented and who was a US citizen. Some US citizens evidently were handcuffed and detained for between three and five hours.

“They was terrified. The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other,” one resident recalled to local media. “That’s all I kept asking. What is the morality? Where’s the human? One of them literally laughed. He was standing right here. He said, ‘fuck them kids.’” Some residents of the building have reported their apartments were gratuitously trashed and property is missing.

There are specific moments — and right now, to be honest they’re coming too frequently — where America crosses a once unthinkable bright line, moments that are worth noticing and calling out. This week’s Chicago raid was surely one of those.

There is no warrant any judge could give — or at least, in theory, that any reasonable judge would ever sign! — that gives federal authorities the right to break down the doors of every apartment in a building in search of undocumented immigrants. That is almost exactly the definition of the so-called “general warrants” or “writs of assistance” that the British used against US colonists that helped spur the Revolution — warrants then very specifically outlawed by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.

It's no surprise that ICE has been evasive about the legal basis for its Monday raid thus far: They surely don’t have one — and the fact that they feel this unhinged and can act so aggressively without possible consequence is astounding.

In part, though, the behavior by ICE is the natural and entirely foreseeable consequence of the crazy legal precedents set up by John Roberts and the Supreme Court earlier this fall in the case Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, which explicitly allowed ICE to racially profile brown people on the streets of America.

That Supreme Court decision laid bare the growing divide on the court and the Republican majority that seems set on enabling an authoritarian and inhumane regime.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor laid out the stakes and the very obvious downstream impact of a ruling that explicitly allowed racial profiling by immigration authorities: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work in a low wage job,” she wrote. “The Constitution does not permit the creation of such a second-class citizenship status.” And yet in its ruling, John Roberts’ Court did just that — switching the national presumption of innocence such that any non-white person on America’s streets now is, in the eyes of the Supreme Court and federal officers, presumed guilty of being an illegal immigrant unless and until he or she can prove to the officers’ satisfaction otherwise. (It matters, too, by the way that from what we’ve seen so far, there’s no agreed-upon way to prove your citizenship to those federal officers: We’ve even seen ICE reject the so-called gold standard “Real IDs” as sufficient for proving citizenship, after a years-long campaign by the government to force states to upgrade to Real IDs precisely in order to prove citizenship.)

Brett Kavanaugh, though, beclowned himself with a concurring opinion that laid out how he imagined friendly consensual encounters with immigration officers went on America’s streets:

The Government sometimes makes brief investigative stops to check the immigration status of those who gather in locations where people are hired for day jobs; who work or appear to work in jobs such as construction, landscaping, agriculture, or car washes that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English. If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U. S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go. If the individual is illegally in the United States, the officers may arrest the individual and initiate the process for removal.

Kavanaugh’s writing was laughed at as soon as it came out — with good reason. There was plenty of evidence even by then that this type of stop didn’t reflect reality — that ICE officers and federal immigrant raids were brutally rounding up brown people and holding them, sometimes for days or weeks, before figuring out they were US citizens. Plenty of bystander videos showed that ICE was attacking first and asking questions later — maybe much later.

Court observer Jay Willis over at Balls and Strikes called Kavanaugh’s invented picture of policing “some of the stupidest shit I have ever encountered in the U.S.” (It’s particularly striking that Kavanaugh wrote it as a concurring opinion — that means he didn’t necessarily need to write it and instead went out of his way to write it down. Kavanaugh felt these were words particularly important to get down on paper.)

Since then, plenty more evidence has surfaced of how immigration officers are abusing the constitutional rights, civil rights, and civil liberties of US citizens who happen to not look like Brett Kavanaugh or walk around in places other than his fancy wealthy DC neighborhood. The New York Times this week cited this week at least 15 documented cases of US citizens being detained by ICE or immigration authorities. (If we know of 15 — how many more don’t we know about?) In one case, a Florida state trooper tried to tase a US citizen in a vehicle stop as the citizen shouted, “I’m from here!”

“You’ve got no rights here. You’re illegal, brother,” a trooper is heard saying on video, a phrase that is simultaneously factually incorrect and deeply chilling.

The most dramatic case, though, came out in a lawsuit in recent days: A 79-year-old US citizen filed a lawsuit last week against DHS, alleging ICE officers broke his ribs — knocking him to the ground at least twice on camera — and detained him for more than 12 hours before releasing him. “This is the way ICE is operating in our community,” the man’s lawyer said. “They use physical force, they don’t speak to the people in order to ascertain who is there legally in order to do their job. Instead, they immediately resort to force.”

That rapid escalation to force in ICE enforcement actions is so common that military veterans are speaking out about how dangerous they think ICE is. “these are not trained professionals. As a military member, I can tell you the way they are handling weapons is reckless and dangerous,” on 14-year veteran said. “I’ve seen ICE agents with fingers on their trigger, using real M16s and M9s, pointing them at people. They’re just trigger happy, and there is no trigger discipline.” It does not seem an exaggeration to imagine that we are not that far on any given day away from a Kent State.

Online, people have taken to call ICE’s racial profiling by the historical name it rightly deserves: “Kavanaugh Stops.” Now, just weeks after getting permission from the Supreme Court to racially profile people on the streets and create exactly the type of “second-class citizens” that Justice Sotomayor warned about, ICE has escalated into what we should be calling “Kavanaugh raids.” (I, for one, am eager to see the first time “Kavanaugh stops” or “Kavanaugh raids” are cited in actual legal motions, opinions, and rulings because that is surely coming in the weeks and months ahead.)

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons fired back at a progressive mayor who accused the agency of waging a war on her community and slammed ""violent rioters"" who he said have been ""laying siege"" to immigration enforcement operations in the Chicago area for weeks.

The ICE processing center in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, has been at the center of chaotic protests for weeks. Protesters have blocked law enforcement vehicles and shouted threats against officers. In response, federal law enforcement officers have repeatedly deployed riot control measures and made several arrests.

On Friday, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson sent a letter to ICE Field Office Director Russell Hott last week in which she accused the agency of ""making war"" on her community and ""endangering nearby village residents"" with its response to the protests, WTTW reported.

In response, ICE accused Thompson of ""distorting reality"" and ""pointing her finger in the wrong direction, while our officers are protecting her community — and others — from real threats, while also facing skyrocketing violence against them, including at the Broadview facility.""

The agency said that ""in the past week alone, violent rioters have been arrested for assault and obstruction, and three of them were carrying loaded firearms to protest.""

Lyons responded to Thompson with a follow-up letter this week in which he criticized her for heating up the rhetoric against ICE and enabling ""agitators to escalate violence,"" placing federal officers and residents in harm’s way.

He said that repeated requests for assistance from state and local law enforcement, including the Broadview Police Department, have gone unanswered, forcing federal officials to take their own crowd control measures.

Blanket Order In practice, a blanket order forbidding DOJ lawyers from seeking stays in civil immigration cases would apply to a wide range of cases relevant to the Trump administration’s aggressive border security agenda.
Department veterans said they were surprised by the guidance, given that litigation extensions were sought in most civil immigration proceedings during prior shutdowns.
The exception for civil immigration cases was reserved for legitimate threats to national security or public safety, such as the removals of people convicted of violent crimes.
Various DOJ offices are also able to keep employees working if they have leftover funds from other noncongressional streams, such as from fees collected in settlements.","The Justice Department has directed US attorneys to proceed on all civil immigration cases during the government shutdown, departing from protocols that restricted work on such matters when federal funding lapses.

Guidance from the deputy attorney general’s office “is that we should NOT seek a stay on any civil immigration matters, whether affirmative or defensive,” said Francey Hakes, director of the Executive Office for US Attorneys, in an Oct. 1 email to all 93 US attorneys that was obtained by Bloomberg Law.

That directive appears contrary to DOJ’s shutdown contingency plan published this week. The plan said “civil litigation will be curtailed or postponed to the extent this can be done without compromising to a significant degree the safety of human life or the protection of property.”

It further advised civil litigators to request that courts postpone active cases, except for those that meet the exception for cases where life or property is at risk.

While in prior shutdowns—including during President Donald Trump’s first term—DOJ interpreted this same exception to generally not permit civil immigration work unless judges denied motions to postpone, this one comes after Trump declared a national emergency due to what he called the national security threat posed by illegal migration.

That declaration may prompt the administration to assert a broader interpretation of which federal employees and types of work can continue when Congress fails to fund the government.

A department spokesperson declined to comment about Hakes’ shutdown guidance. Hakes is a former prosecutor and Fox News commentator appointed in July to run the department’s central office for advising the nation’s chief federal law enforcement officials.

Breaking From Practice

There are other indications that Trump loyalists within the Justice Department are interpreting shutdown protocols for civil litigators to break from past practice.

US attorneys based in Los Angeles, Miami, and New Jersey have ordered their staffs, including civil litigators, to continue working since the shutdown began Oct. 1, according to multiple people familiar with the situation.

The Washington, DC, US attorney’s office, which has spearheaded a White House crackdown on street crime, has yet to issue any officewide shutdown instructions, said two people familiar with the matter.

Other US attorney’s offices and legal divisions within the Justice Department’s headquarters have mostly furloughed civil litigators, except when when judges deny extension requests, said additional sources familiar with those offices.

“Plans are based on each U.S. Attorney’s discretion (in consultation with EOUSA) based on the nature and scope of the district’s case load and relative staffing, which of course varies considerably across the 93 offices,” a department spokesperson said in a statement, referring to the shorthand for the executive office for US attorneys.

Criminal prosecutors remain working across the department, as is customary in past shutdowns.

The prohibition on seeking stays comes even as at least 10 district courts have issued standing orders automatically extending some deadlines or pausing civil cases in which the federal government is a party.

It also contradicts the posture of DOJ’s civil division, which sought a stay Oct. 1 in a major legal challenge to the administration’s cancellation of temporary protected status for about half a million Venezuelans. But that case is being handled by the civil division’s office of immigration litigation, which has distributed a greater share of its caseload to US attorney’s offices this year.

Blanket Order

In practice, a blanket order forbidding DOJ lawyers from seeking stays in civil immigration cases would apply to a wide range of cases relevant to the Trump administration’s aggressive border security agenda. It would affect individuals appealing final deportation orders or visa denials, denaturalization proceedings, and lawsuits challenging administration immigration policies.

Department veterans said they were surprised by the guidance, given that litigation extensions were sought in most civil immigration proceedings during prior shutdowns.

“Approaching it with a broad stroke is a tough fit with the statutory requirements,” said Jeff Robins, a longtime career official at DOJ’s office of immigration litigation, who left last year. “I suppose it’s a good thing for everyone that they may still be open for civil defensive business, but it’s not the normal.”

The safety of life and protection of property standard is laid out in the Antideficiency Act, which requires DOJ and other federal agencies to cease certain functions that haven’t been congressional appropriated.

In theory, members of the public can request that the Justice Department’s inspector general investigate alleged violations of the statute. But it’s rare for that to result in employee discipline or other consequences.

People who coordinated prior DOJ shutdown plans said that they couldn’t recall an instance in which offices would automatically declare their entire civil teams exempt from furloughs before giving the courts a chance to rule on requests for postponements.

These former department officials, who like most people interviewed spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal or to share internal deliberations, said the default was usually to ask judges for stays.

The exception for civil immigration cases was reserved for legitimate threats to national security or public safety, such as the removals of people convicted of violent crimes.

The Supreme Court in June used a group of challenges to Trump’s initiative to make it harder for federal trial judges to block disputed government policies nationwide.","The US Supreme Court so far has largely accommodated Donald Trump’s assertions of sweeping presidential power. The term that starts Monday will determine just how far the court is willing to go.

For eight months, the conservative supermajority has helped Trump amass power, temporarily lifting about 20 rulings that were thwarting his initiatives. The court now is positioned to consider the underlying legal questions behind his imposition of global tariffs, bid to control independent regulatory agencies - including the Federal Reserve - and effort to restrict automatic birthright citizenship.

The stakes are high. Chief Justice John Roberts and his court must decide what lines to draw with a president who has repeatedly said his election means he can do whatever he wants. With the Republican-controlled Congress showing little interest in resisting Trump, any constitutional guardrails will have to come from a court that under Roberts’ leadership for the past 20 years has expanded White House power.

“We’re going to learn about the extent to which this court is willing to stand up to the president,” said Gillian Metzger, an administrative and constitutional law professor at Columbia Law School.

The presidential-powers showdowns will occur alongside a series of cases that could transform federal voting law - and potentially bolster Republican prospects in the coming elections – as well as what are sure to be polarizing clashes over transgender athletes and counseling aimed at changing a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity.

The start of the nine-month term follows a flood of litigation during the opening months of Trump’s term, most of it stemming from the torrent of far-reaching executive actions he issued since his Jan. 20 inauguration.

The Supreme Court has already acted on 23 emergency requests from Trump, with the conservative majority giving him at least a significant part of what he sought in 20 of those cases, often over dissents from the three liberal justices. Those include fights over mass firings, federal grant funding, alleged racial profiling by immigration agents and access to sensitive Social Security information by the Department of Government Efficiency.

The justices took the unusual step of scheduling arguments in January to consider whether Trump can temporarily oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook while her case continues. The court said on Wednesday she could stay in the job until then. The move effectively put off until next year a test of its willingness to protect the Fed’s independence from the White House after Trump has repeatedly criticized the board and Chair Jerome Powell and demanded interest rate cuts.

The court also has pending emergency requests on the rights of Venezuelan immigrants and the gender designation on passports. And many more cases are certainly on the way.

Roberts’ vision

The 70-year-old Roberts has been a key player in Trump’s successes. The 2005 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush is a longstanding proponent of a strong presidency, though not the all-powerful one envisioned by Trump.

It was Roberts who authored Trump’s most far-reaching victory, the 2024 decision that gave presidents criminal immunity for official acts while in office. The ruling, which described the president as “the only person who alone composes a branch of government,” shielded Trump from a trial over the 2021 Capitol riot and, in the view of critics, let him start his new White House term with a sense of impunity.

The decision also marked a break from Roberts’ more measured views on presidential power, some legal experts say.

“It remains to be seen how much of the earlier version of Roberts remains – or whether he’s somehow become convinced that what the constitutional order needs right now is more presidential power and immunity,” said Kate Shaw, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

Roberts has long enjoyed a reputation as a minimalist who tends to prefer narrow, consensus decisions where possible. But since Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s 2020 confirmation, Roberts has had to manage a court with five other conservatives – including three Trump appointees - a group that at times wants to go further and faster in reshaping the law than he does.

“It’s clear that there is not a majority for minimalism, or at least not consistently, and that puts him in a difficult position,” said Jonathan Adler, a constitutional and administrative professor at William & Mary Law School.

Roberts didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Agency heads

Roberts has mostly been on board with this year’s Trump decisions. In the 20 rulings backing the president, Roberts has dissented even in part only twice, both times in cases involving the administration’s cutting off of federal grants.

He has been a driving force behind rulings that let the president fire the heads of independent agencies despite job protections Congress gave those officials to shield them from political pressure. In April he took the unusual step of clearing Trump to temporarily remove Democratic members of two independent agencies – the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board – without waiting for the full court to weigh in.

The court is preparing to hear arguments in December to consider overturning the 1935 precedent that provided the legal foundation for independent agencies. That ruling, known as Humphrey’s Executor, said President Franklin Delano Roosevelt lacked power to fire a Republican member of the Federal Trade Commission.

A key question will be how, if at all, the case affects the Federal Reserve. When the full court reaffirmed Roberts’ decision to let Trump remove the NLRB and MSPB members, the majority went out of its way to suggest the Fed could keep its independence, calling it a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.”

Trump, who has blasted the Fed for not cutting interest rates more quickly, is now effectively trying to sidestep that ruling by moving to fire Cook for alleged mortgage fraud, which she denies.

Signature tariffs

The court’s views on the legality of Trump’s tariffs are far less clear. The justices will hear arguments Nov. 5 without having been asked to issue the type of preliminary order that might have hinted at their leanings.

At stake are import taxes affecting trillions of dollars in trade. The central issue is whether Trump can impose them using a law that gives the president a panoply of tools to address national security, foreign policy and economic emergencies – but that doesn’t mention tariffs.

Although three lower courts have ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, the president will have some potentially key advantages at the Supreme Court. Justice Brett Kavanaugh has already signaled he won’t apply the so-called major questions doctrine, a legal argument the court invoked repeatedly to curb President Joe Biden’s agenda.

Under the major questions doctrine, federal agencies need explicit congressional authorization to take actions that have sweeping economic or political significance. But in a June ruling involving the Federal Communications Commission, Kavanaugh said the doctrine shouldn’t apply in the realm of foreign affairs and national security.

“The usual understanding is that Congress intends to give the president substantial authority and flexibility to protect America and the American people,” Kavanaugh wrote.

For Roberts, the question may be less about legal doctrine than about his stomach for invalidating a president’s biggest economic initiative. Roberts famously avoided doing that in 2012 when he cast the deciding vote to uphold President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

“They’re really going to have to grapple with whether they are going to overturn the president’s signature economic policy,” said former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who served as Biden’s top Supreme Court lawyer. That sort of consideration “weighs on” Roberts, she said in remarks last month at William & Mary Law School.

The justices are hearing the case on an ultra-expedited basis, suggesting they might try to rule well before their term ends in late June or early July.

Citizenship test

Birthright citizenship is all but certain to pose a third major test of Trump’s early agenda. Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order would jettison what has been the widespread understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on virtually everyone born on US soil. Trump would restrict that to babies with at least one parent who is a US citizen or green card holder.

The Supreme Court in June used a group of challenges to Trump’s initiative to make it harder for federal trial judges to block disputed government policies nationwide. Now the administration is asking the justices to take up two new appeals and uphold the executive order itself. Lower courts have uniformly ruled against Trump, saying his approach violates the Constitution and federal immigration law.

Although the court’s conservatives backed Trump the first time around, they didn’t indicate they agreed with his interpretation of the 14th Amendment or were inclined to back his executive order. The administration may get a “less receptive audience” than it has with its emergency requests, said Greg Garre, who served as solicitor general under Bush.

“It is still extremely early to gauge the relationship between the administration and the court and the trajectory they are on,” Garre said. “We’re not even a year into the second Trump presidency. Things could look different a year or two from now.”

“Information provided to Apple by law enforcement shows that your app violates” the app store guidelines because “it’s purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group,” the email states.
Aaron has said the ICEBlock app was intended to help people avoid contact with ICE agents.
Apple, in a statement, said the company removed the apps Thursday after communication with law enforcement.
When users log a sighting in the ICEBlock app, it warns: “Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification purposes only.","Following a request from the US Department of Justice, Apple has removed ICEBlock and similar apps that allow people to alert others nearby about sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their area. President Donald Trump and his administration have railed against the apps for months, arguing that they pose a threat to ICE agents.

In an email to ICEBlock creator Joshua Aaron, Apple wrote that “upon re-evaluation,” the app does not comply with its app store guidelines around “objectionable” and “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content,” according to a copy of the message viewed by CNN.

“Information provided to Apple by law enforcement shows that your app violates” the app store guidelines because “it’s purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group,” the email states.

Aaron has said the ICEBlock app was intended to help people avoid contact with ICE agents. FBI Director Kash Patel said last month that a man who shot at a Dallas ICE field office planned the attack for weeks and “searched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.” Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, said in June, “An app that lets anyone zero in on their locations is like inviting violence against them.”

The Justice Department, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond Friday to requests for comment. In a statement published on Fox News Digital, which first reported Apple’s removal of the apps, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said ICEBlock and similar apps crossed a line.

“ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed,” Bondi said in her statement to Fox.

ICEBlock and similar apps have been available on Apple’s app store since the spring. Apple, in a statement, said the company removed the apps Thursday after communication with law enforcement. The company didn’t specifically cite ICE or DHS, but Bondi told Fox that the Justice Department reached out to Apple, “demanding” the company remove the apps.

“Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store,” Apple said in a statement. Apple and its CEO Tim Cook have in recent months sought to strengthen the company’s relationship with the White House, amid policy changes from Trump that could threaten its business.

Aaron, the ICEBlock creator, has denied that the app was intended to incite violence against law enforcement. In a statement to CNN Friday, Aaron said he is “incredibly disappointed by Apple’s actions today” and called the claim that ICEBlock was designed to harm law enforcement officers “patently false.” The app had more than 1 million users prior to its removal, according to Aaron. The app was only available on Apple’s iOS, because Aaron previously said he would not be able to guarantee anonymity for users on Android.

“ICEBlock is no different from crowdsourcing speed traps, which every notable mapping application, including Apple’s own Maps app, implements as part of its core services,” he said. “This is protected speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. We are determined to fight this with everything we have.”

Aaron told CNN in June that he hoped the crowdsourced notifications would help people avoid interactions with ICE. When users log a sighting in the ICEBlock app, it warns: “Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification purposes only. It is not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.”

“Our mission has always been to protect our neighbors from the terror this administration continues to (rain) down on the people of this nation,” he said in his Friday statement.

But the White House has repeatedly admonished the apps and the media coverage about them. After CNN reported about ICEBlock in June, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt sharply criticized CNN, saying at a news briefing that it was “unacceptable that a major network would promote such an app that is encouraging violence against law enforcement officers who are trying to keep our country safe.”

In a statement at the time, CNN denied it was promoting the app.

“This is an app that is publicly available to any iPhone user who wants to download it,” a CNN spokesperson said. “There is nothing illegal about reporting the existence of this or any other app, nor does such reporting constitute promotion or other endorsement of the app by CNN.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-24t155217z-1447950275-rc2eyganyo1i-rtrmadp-3-usa-shooting-ice.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-03 10:57:17.901299

The Cook County Sheriff's Office said at least five people were arrested. They are facing charges such as resisting, obstruction and aggravated battery to a police officer.

The pushing, shoving and arrests happened shortly after 9 a.m. Chopper 7 was over the scene near 25th and Lexington, where at least eight demonstrators appeared to be detained.

That clash came after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino were seen on the ICE facility's roof just before 8 a.m.

Noem and Bovino were accompanied by several armed agents, cameras and a production crew.

Demonstrators against immigration enforcement have been at the facility all morning, demanding transparency and immediate action over possible safety violations and unlawful detentions.

The protesters are seeking answers about the conditions inside the ICE facility and want elected officials to be allowed inside to inspect it.

Illinois State Police and other law enforcement are on the scene, at the request of Broadview police, for extra enforcement.

Earlier Friday morning, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker shared that Noem was in Illinois.

The governor is demanding that Noem hold a press conference to answer questions about ongoing immigration raids in the Chicago area.

This all comes after ISP set up concrete barricades overnight to designate protest zones in an effort to ease tensions between demonstrators and federal agents.

The area has been overwhelmed, at times, with people unhappy with ICE operations in recent weeks. It has led to confrontations with agents, and five people were charged following protests last weekend.

Meanwhile, Broadview officials have launched three criminal investigations into ICE activity.

During a press conference earlier this week, village officials accused ICE of endangering first responders, residents and protesters near an ICE facility through the use of tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.

The Trump administration announced today that it is putting $2.1 billion in funding for Chicago infrastructure projects on hold, the latest move to target Democratic-run cities during the government shutdown.

The director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, said in a post on X that the funding is for “specifically the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project.” He said it has been “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.”

EMILY’s List, the political group supporting female Democratic candidates who favor abortion rights, endorsed Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton for the Senate today, picking sides in the state’s crowded Democratic primary.

It’s the group’s first endorsement in a Senate campaign in the 2026 midterm elections, and it’s a significant boost in support for Stratton — who isn’t the only woman running in the open Democratic primary.

Stratton is running against a field that includes Rep. Robin Kelly — a former state Democratic Party chair whom EMILY’s List has endorsed in the past, when she ran for her seat in the House — and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who has built up significant cash in his campaign account and has already spent more than $7 million on advertising in the race, according to AdImpact.

Trump’s victory last year was fueled in part by improvement among young voters. But new focus groups reveal why some young voters who backed Trump are beginning to sour on his administration’s approach to immigration and the economy.

“I believe my trust in the administration has completely nosedived because of how he’s mishandled things,” said Anthony H., a 22-year-old Republican from Nevada, pointing to immigration and foreign affairs.

Anthony was one of 14 swing-state Trump voters under age 30 who participated in recent focus groups observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 “Deciders” series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago.

These voters were a key part of Trump’s coalition in 2024, as he made gains among 18-to-29-year-old voters, especially young men, compared to his 2020 loss. Trump won 43% of young voters in this age group last year after winning 36% of them in 2020, according to the NBC News Exit Poll. The exit poll also showed Trump winning 49% of young men in 2024, compared to 48% for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, while Trump trailed among young women, winning 38% of that group.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., continued to blame Democrats for the government shutdown that began Wednesday in an interview on NBC’s “TODAY,"" saying it's up to them to end the impasse.

""We’ve done exactly what is always done, a very clean, very simple resolution to keep the government open so that we can negotiate all these other issues,"" Johnson said, explaining Congress was in the midst of negotiations on spending levels for the coming year, but ran out of time to pass those measures when the fiscal year ended.

""They’ve rejected it because they’re trying to make a political play,"" he said of Democrats, whom he accused of unnecessarily introducing a health care debate into what should be a simple, weekslong extension of current funding to buy time to talk about such issues.

""The ball is in the courts are the Democrats, not the Republicans,"" he said. ""The Republicans have done our job, done our work, and now Chuck Schumer and 43 of his colleagues have to decide to do the right thing.""

Johnson also dismissed multiple polls that found more Americans believe Republicans are responsible for the shutdown than Democrats.

Asked if Republicans are losing the messaging battle, he said, ""The Democrats are trying to make this about politics, and I'm not surprised by some of the polls, because the mainstream media is advancing their narrative.""

For people who closely follow the U.S. economy, the first Friday of every month is known as “jobs Friday,” when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the previous month’s employment report at precisely 8:30 a.m. ET.

But on this jobs Friday, September’s employment data — a critical window into the health of the U.S. labor market — will not be released. Like many other federal offices, the BLS is temporarily closed because of the ongoing government shutdown.

Until Congress approves its funding, the bureau’s more than 2,000 employees will remain furloughed, unable to release any reports. The data blackout comes at a perilous time for the U.S. economy.

Most of Trump’s supporters back keeping enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, the central obstacle in ending the government shutdown, according to a new poll from the nonpartisan health policy research group KFF. It was conducted Sept. 23 through Sept. 29, just days before Congress failed to pass a funding measure to keep the government open.

More than 22 million people receive the subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends them. Losing the subsidies could mean that average out-of-pocket premium payments could double in 2026, from $888 a year to $1,904, an earlier KFF analysis found.

Around 4 million people are projected to go without coverage next year because they can no longer afford it, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Extending them would cost the federal government around $350 billion over the next decade.

The new survey found 59% of Republicans and 57% of “Make American Great Again” supporters favor extending the enhanced subsidies.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS — U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN THE CARIBBEAN

President Trump has “determined” that cartels involved in drug trafficking are “nonstate armed groups” the actions of which “constitute an armed attack against the United States” and with whom the United States is engaged in “noninternational armed conflict,” the Trump administration told Congress in a confidential notice this week. The document also asserted that cartels “illegally and directly cause the deaths of tens of thousands of American citizens each year,” and refers to the crew of the vessel struck by U.S. forces in mid-September as “unlawful combatants.” The White House yesterday said that the notice was an explanation of the legality of Trump’s actions and does not represent a new policy shift. Charlie Savage and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times; Leo Shane III, Myah Ward, and Connor O’Brien report for POLITICO.

In a closed-door Senate Armed Services Committee meeting, senators from both sides of the aisle questioned the Defense Department’s legal justification for striking alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean and urged officials to devise a stronger legal case, sources say. During the Wednesday meeting, the Pentagon general counsel, Earl Matthews, repeatedly argued that Trump’s designation of some Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations granted the Defense Department unilateral authority to use military force. Matthews reportedly also refused to provide a written justification for the strikes. Lara Seligman, Alexander Ward, and Siobhan Hughes report for the Wall Street Journal.

Venezuela yesterday criticised what it described as an “illegal incursion” of U.S. fighter jets into an area of Venezuelan air traffic control, 75 kilometres from the Venezuelan coastline. Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said the U.S. activity was “vulgarity, a provocation, a threat to the security of the nation.” John Silk reports for DW.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Trump administration has approved and released $230 million in funding for Lebanon’s security forces this week, according to U.S. and Lebanese sources. A State Department spokesperson said that the U.S. assistance is intended to support the forces “as they work to assert Lebanese sovereignty across the country and fully implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701.” Patricia Zengerle and Maya Gebeily report for Reuters.

Taiwan “will not agree” to produce 50% of its semiconductors on U.S. soil, Taiwan’s Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said on Wednesday. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last weekend insisted in a TV interview that Taiwan should split its chip production evenly between domestic and U.S. facilities. John Liu reports for CNN.

Trump said yesterday that he would meet with the Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, to determine which “Democrat agencies” he could cut and whether the “cuts will be temporary or permanent.” Trump referred to the shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to achieve his agenda in the same social media post. In an interview yesterday, Trump said “we could cut projects that they wanted, favourite projects”, adding “I am allowed to cut things that should have never have been approved […] and I will probably do that.” Tony Romm reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

Several furloughed workers at the Education Department found out yesterday that their out-of-office email messages had been changed without their knowledge to reflect the Trump administration’s view that the shutdown had been caused by Democrats. “Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 531 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations,” the email said. Eileen Sullivan and Michael C. Bender report for the New York Times.

A third of White House staff will be furloughed during the shutdown, while all 45 DOGE officials and most Office of Management and Budget staff will continue working as their compensation comes from a source other than annual appropriations, according to a contingency plan posted online yesterday. Sophia Cai reports for POLITICO.

Senior federal officials have advised several agencies against firing employees during the shutdown, warning that the strategy might violate appropriations law, two sources told the Washington Post. Plans for such firings have been developed across several agencies, according to two federal officials. A senior White House official said those plans outline firings for fewer than 16,000 people, a smaller reduction in force than the White House previously projected. Emily Davies and Hannah Natanson report.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Justice Department is set to close the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, an inter-agency office created in the 1980s to tackle major drug cartels, according to documents seen by Reuters. The documents show the DOJ will also shutter the Community Relations Service, focused on mediating racial and ethnic tensions in the United States, and the Office for Access to Justice, which works on access to legal aid. Sources say that current and former officials said they are surprised by the plan to close the Task Forces, as the type of cases it oversees is aligned with the Trump administration’s efforts to pursue major drug-trafficking organizations. Sarah N. Lynch reports.

Trump is considering providing over $10 billion to U.S. farmers due to the economic fallout sparked by his tariffs, sources told the Wall Street Journal. Sources said that Trump and his team are thinking about using tariff revenue to fund the majority of the aid, with much of it going towards soybean producers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said yesterday that the government would make an announcement next Tuesday regarding support for U.S. farmers in light of China’s refusal to buy soybeans. Brian Schwartz, Patrick Thomas, and Natalie Andrews report; Reuters reports.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has stopped the release of hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency preparedness grants, requesting that states prove their population counts before receiving the money, FEMA told CNN. States started receiving notices on Tuesday that they must submit a population certification, outlining their methodology, and confirm those deported under US immigration laws are not included in the count. Gabe Cohen reports.

FBI Director Kash Patel has fired a FBI employee who displayed a Pride flag in his workspace, according to several sources. Patel did not mention the Pride flag by name in the dismissal but said he was being dismissed for “poor judgment” and “an inappropriate display of political signage.” The sources said that the employee had received multiple awards for service during his career and had been the field office diversity program coordinator. Josh Campbell and Jamie Gangel report for CNN.

The University of Texas said yesterday it would be eager to sign up to the Trump administration’s list of demands in return for favourable terms for government financial aid. Most of the eight other institutions that were approached have not indicated whether they would agree to the terms. Anemona Hartocollis, Michael C. Bender, and Alan Blinder report for the New York Times.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has fired Dr Jeanne Marrazzo, leading scientist at the National Institutes of Health, three weeks after she filed a whistle-blower complaint against the Trump administration, according to her lawyer and copy of the termination letter. The dismissal letter did not provide any explanation. Dr Marazzo’s lawyer has said that the firing was retaliatory. Benjamin Mueller reports for the New York Times.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Apple said yesterday that it had removed ICEBlock, the most popular ICE-tracking app, from the App Store following “information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated” with the app. Kanishka Singh reports for Reuters.

As of yesterday, the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo Bay is holding no detained migrants, following the transfer of the 18 remaining men on a charter flight to the United States. Since the base was set up in February, fewer than 700 people have been held there despite plans for the base to hold tens of thousands of migrants. The Department for Homeland Security has not responded to a question of why the base has been entirely cleared. Carol Rosenberg reports for the New York Times.

Training for the first group of Army Reserve lawyers selected to be temporary immigration judges by the Trump administration is set to start on Monday, according to an email reviewed by AP News.The administration is planning to bring in as many as 600 military-trained attorneys to make immigration decisions following the firing of dozens of existing immigration judges this year.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 57 Palestinians in Gaza yesterday, according to health officials. 29 people were killed by Israeli troops in southern Gaza, the Nasser Hospital indicated. Separately, officials at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said they had received 16 people killed by strikes. Doctors without Borders said one of its occupational therapists was killed in a strike that wounded four others. Wafaa Shurafa and Bassem Mroue report for AP News.

Mediators yesterday made contact with Izz al-Din al Haddad, the head of Hamas’s military wing in Gaza, who indicated that he would not agree to the U.S. ceasefire proposal as the plan is designed to destroy Hamas, BBC News has been told. Rushdi Abualouf reports.

Many Palestinians in Gaza have voiced their support for the current ceasefire plan, according to interviews in Gaza. Some said that news of the proposal on Monday sent a rare flash of hope through Gaza, while others said it was clear there were terms Hamas would not agree to. Abdelhalim Awad, living in Deir al Balah, said that he would accept almost “any price” to end the war but that Hamas would not do the same. “They don’t care about what people think […] if they cared about that, we wouldn’t be in this situation.” Liam Stack reports for the New York Times.

Israeli forces yesterday blocked the road to Gaza City, preventing those who had left the city in search of food or shelter from returning. “This is the last opportunity for Gaza residents who wish to do so to move south and leave Hamas operatives in Gaza City itself in the face of the IDF’s continuing full-scale operations,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

Israel’s interception of the boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla sparked protests across Europe and South America yesterday. Israel has detained more than 450 activists. Reuters reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

A U.S. federal judge this week dismissed a lawsuit accusing the U.N. aid agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) of allegedly allowing its funds to be diverted to support Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel. Contrary to the position advanced by the Trump administration, the judge found that as part of the United Nations, as UNRWA was protected by immunity and could not be sued. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of about 100 Israeli plaintiffs, the estates of some of the victims, and at least one person whom Hamas held hostage. Benjamin Weiser reports for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

U.S. long-range Tomahawk missile shipments to Ukraine appear unlikely as current stock is committed to the U.S. Navy and other uses, according to a U.S. official and other sources. The U.S. official said there was no shortage of shorter-distance weapons that could be supplied to Kyiv. Mike Stone reports for Reuters.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that he had no plans to invade NATO countries. Putin criticized “European elites” for “whipping up hysteria” about a “Russian threat,” denying Russia’s involvement in the drone violations of Danish and Norwegian airspace last week. Nataliya Vasilyeva reports for the New York Times.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.N. High Commission for Human Rights Volker Türk said yesterday that the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary killed at least 91 Sudanese civilians in the besieged city of el-Fasher last month. Türk said the city’s Draga Oula neighbourhood had been repeatedly attacked during RSF shelling, drone strikes, and ground incursions between September 19 and 29. According to the Sudan Doctors Network, an RSF missile yesterday killed 16 people and injured 21 others in the city. AP News

Türk also told the U.N. Human Rights Council yesterday he is concerned that Haiti’s use of “lethal force” against gangs was “unnecessary and disproportionate.” According to Türk, Haitian police units summarily executed 174 people for alleged gang affiliation this year, while government drone strikes against alleged gang members had killed at least 559 people. “Most of these drone strikes are likely unlawful under international human rights law,” Türk said. Farge reports for Reuters.

Russia has mounted a vast disinformation campaign in the Czech Republic ahead of the parliamentary elections today and tomorrow, according to an investigation by Czech outlet Voxpot. According to Voxpot, 16 Russia-linked websites containing false information and conspiracy theories, are producing more content than all Czech traditional media outlets combined. 300 TikTok accounts promoting pro-Russia narratives have garnered over 5 million views per week, more than the combined reach of mainstream party leaders, Czech analysts say.

Broadview ICE protest

What we know:

The protest marks the fifth consecutive Friday of demonstrations at the suburban Chicago processing center. Early Friday, the scene outside the facility was quiet, with a single police squad car present and new security measures in place, including fencing and concrete barriers at Lexington and Beech streets.

As of 7:30 a.m. dozens of protesters, carrying signs and protective gear, built up along the back entrance to the facility. Illinois State Police in riot gear and Broadview police were among several law enforcement agencies at the scene controlling crowds.

At least 12 protesters were seen being handcuffed and taken into custody.

Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Chief Patrol Agent Gregory K. Bovino also made an appearance on the roof of the ICE facility surrounded by armed personnel. An armored truck was also present at the scene.

Protest organizers said the Broadview center is not intended to hold detainees for more than 12 hours at a time, but claim individuals are being deprived of basic necessities such as beds, blankets and access to hygiene facilities.

Activists also allege ICE has blocked elected officials from inspecting the facility, despite requirements they say are set by law.

ICE agents have used pepper balls, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of protesters to allow vehicles to enter and exit the facility. Five people were charged in Saturday's demonstrations, including a couple who were reportedly carrying guns.

Big picture view:

The DHS announced Thursday that since launching Operation Midway Blitz on Sept. 8, over 900 people have been arrested in the Chicago area.

Pritzker calls out Noem

What they're saying:

Pritzker released the following statement early Friday, demanding answers from DHS Sec. Kristi Noem, who is reportedly in the state:

""Federal agents reporting to Secretary Noem have spent weeks snatching up families, scaring law-abiding residents, violating due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. They fail to focus on violent criminals and instead create panic in our communities.

Secretary Noem should no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability. Last time when the secretary was here, she snuck in during the early morning to film social media videos and fled before sunrise. It's been nearly 45 days since Secretary Noem has held an official press conference, so it’s time she faces the public and takes questions from the press to be held accountable for the Trump Administration’s gross misconduct.

Illinois is not a photo opportunity or warzone, it’s a sovereign state where our people deserve rights, respect, and answers.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/vlcsnap-2025-10-03-08h11m10s843.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-03 12:01:12.638799

On Tuesday night, .

On Thursday afternoon, we spoke with protesters at the ICE facility who condemned violence. Two of the people we talked to are veterans.

“Be more like MLK, peaceful, non-aggression is how we get things done here,” said Norman Sowards, a veteran. “I'm down here protesting because Trump is sending the National Guard to police cities when they're only trained one week in a month, two weeks a year. And when I was in Iraq, we were worried that the National Guard were gonna shoot us 'cause they weren't trained well enough.”

“I don't really like to see things like spray-painted or breaking windows. I don't think that that really helps our cause,” said Amanda Cochran, a veteran. ""I felt the need to go out there and lend my voice as a veteran to say that I don't agree with this, and I don't want to see my country become a militarized state, and I don't think that it's appropriate to be sending troops in this isn’t a war zone.”

On Tuesday night, we took video of officers pushing people out of the ICE facility driveway, eventually taking two people into custody.

Some say the nighttime attracts more people to the protests.

“The reason it transitions into more people during the night is largely because that's when people are off work,” said Jack Dickinson, a protester who has been protesting since February.

We asked folks about why they think the environment around the ICE facility gets more tense at nighttime.

“I think you get a lot more people that are out of work and that it's a little bit easier to hide yourself and to escalate things when the sun goes down,” Cochran said.

In a video from June, you can see a man standing outside the ICE facility, and then what appears to be federal officers hitting him from behind.

That video is different from what we've seen at the facility during the day.

“What the daytime is largely focused around, especially during the weekdays when they are open for administrative functions, is advocacy. So getting know-your-rights information or legal support connected to people who have to go in for their appointments as part of the process,” said Dickinson.",https://katu.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/986/center/90/21b37e2b-9c56-49ea-bf50-6848095cee33-MONITORICEcaptioned3.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 09:57:28.398888

“The Missouri National Guard is uniquely equipped to provide this essential administrative support, and we are confident their contributions will be invaluable to immigration enforcement efforts,” Kehoe said in a news release.
While all the soldiers taking on the duty are doing so as volunteers, they expected to get paid, Beck said.

Mike Kehoe’s decision to deploy Missouri National Guard soldiers to support immigration enforcement “makes no sense” because they will not get paid until the federal government shutdown is resolved, the state Senate’s Democratic leader said Thursday.

On Tuesday, Kehoe announced that soldiers from the Guard would, on a volunteer basis, be assigned to provide administrative, clerical and logistical support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facilities in the state.

The shutdown started a few hours after Kehoe announced the deployment.

“Everybody knew that was coming, and to me that makes no sense,” Beck said.

Spokeswoman Gabby Picard said that there will be up to 15 soldiers on duty at any particular time until authorization ends on Sept. 30, 2026.

ICE continues to work while most of the government is shut down because the budget bill approved in July funded the agency with $29.9 billion for enforcement and $5 billion for detention through September 2029.

When on federal deployment, members of the Guard are paid on the same schedule as active-duty personnel, with the next pay date being Oct. 15. No active duty military will receive pay until the shutdown is resolved.

The Tuesday news release said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth approved assigning Guard personnel to ICE facilities on July 25, allowing them to be paid from the federal treasury.

“The Missouri National Guard is uniquely equipped to provide this essential administrative support, and we are confident their contributions will be invaluable to immigration enforcement efforts,” Kehoe said in a news release.

While all the soldiers taking on the duty are doing so as volunteers, they expected to get paid, Beck said.

“I’m sure, when they did this, they didn’t know that they’d be doing it possibly for free for a while,” Beck said. “I’m assuming they’ll be made whole at some point, but I’m sure they got bills just like everybody else.”

In response to Beck’s criticism, Picard said the decision to assist ICE wasn’t made hastily.

“Planning for this activation has been ongoing for weeks, and has nothing to do with the unfortunate political games of the Democrats in Washington that have caused a government shutdown,” Picard said.

The deployment has also drawn criticism from labor unions and the ACLU..

Lenny Jones, vice president and state director at the Service Employees International Union-Healthcare, said in a news release that the deployment is part of an increasingly authoritarian government.

“This is just another power grab used to silence and intimidate people who disagree with the administration’s anti-American policies,” Jones said.

The ACLU said the deployment diverts resources from disaster recovery and other needs.

“National Guard troops should be reserved for genuine emergencies, not deployed to suit the president’s political whims,” Naureen Shah, director of policy and government affairs for the ACLU’s Equality Division, said in a news release.

The deployment should be unneeded because ICE has been hiring large numbers of new employees, Beck said.

“You tell me they can’t keep up with the paperwork?” Beck asked.

The standoff in Washington is over the health care subsidies for marketplace health plans that are ending under the budget reconciliation bill passed in July. Democrats are demanding they be restored, while Republicans insist the government must be reopened before they will negotiate.

Beck said he wants Democrats in Congress to hold their position.

“At the end of the day, the Republicans control everything, all three branches of the government,” Beck said. “So the question you have to ask yourself is, why did they let it get to this point?”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_beck1-2048x1229.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 10:57:21.951145

ICE has increasingly used mega-detention centers run by for-profit prison corporations with the capacity to detain large numbers of people.

Vera’s research reveals what ICE is not sharing with the public and the vast scale and human cost of Trump’s immigration agenda.

Recent reports show that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is currently holding more than 59,000 people across the United States—a record and unprecedented high.

To imprison such an enormous group of people, ICE has built a massive, nation-spanning network of detention centers. Beyond the notorious stateand federally-run facilities like the South Florida Detention Facility (cruelly referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz”) and the Camp 57 wing of the Louisiana State Penitentiary (commonly known as Angola), the system also includes private prisons and local jails. Many unexpected places, such as hotels, hospitals, airports, and military bases, are also part of the ICE detention network. People detained in these facilities have reported violence, overcrowding, starvation, and medical neglect.

When ICE moves people into its labyrinthine detention system, it shares only limited, often error-prone statistics with the public. Its failure to regularly release accurate, complete, and accessible data is part of what enables it to operate this multi-billion-dollar network with little oversight or accountability.

But this summer, Vera researchers updated our ICE Detention Trends dashboard with newly-available data, providing the general public with the best glimpse yet into the scale of ICE’s detention system. Analyzing millions of new detention history records provided by the Deportation Data Project, the tool provides an unprecedented level of detail about ICE detention populations every day over a 16-year period ending this past June—including a detailed picture of ICE’s detention operations during the first four months of President Trump’s second term.

Here’s what we found.

1. The number of people detained by ICE has reached unprecedented levels.

Recent public ICE reports reveal that 61,226 people were detained on August 23, 2025. Vera’s dashboard shows that the number of people in detention has never reached this level before, even for a single day, during the 16-year period covered by the data.

2. The number of people in detention has increased dramatically since the start of President Trump’s second term.

Vera’s analysis shows that, in the first four-and-a-half months of the second Trump administration, ICE booked people into detention roughly 119,500 times—a 17 percent increase from the same time period during Trump’s first term, and a 46 percent increase from the same period under President Biden (during the COVID-19 pandemic).

3. In early June 2025, ICE was detaining people in 436 facilities—but acknowledged using just 163 of them on its own website.

Vera’s analysis reveals that ICE was using 149 staging facilities and 55 medical facilities in June 2025—places that ICE largely excludes from the statistics it regularly puts out publicly. Among the litigation ICE is currently facing, one case argues that its practice of detaining people in overcrowded holding rooms for prolonged periods of time under inhumane conditions is unlawful and unconstitutional.

4. In June 2025, ICE detained people in facilities across all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; the Northern Mariana Islands; Guam; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The states with the most facilities in Vera’s analysis were Texas (69), Florida (40), and California (27).

5. Since the start of President Trump’s second term, ICE has increasingly used mega-detention centers run by for-profit prison corporations with the capacity to detain large numbers of people.

In early June, 17 facilities across nine states—all of which are operated by private companies—held more than 1,000 people in detention per day. Two of these facilities—Adams County Correctional Center (Natchez, Mississippi) and Stewart Detention Center (Lumpkin, Georgia)—exceeded 2,000 people detained daily. These private companies have financially gained from the Trump administration’s expansion of detention, despite reports of inhumane conditions, overcrowding, and lack of access to counsel.

The following are the 17 facilities that held more than 1,000 people per day:

Eloy Federal Contract Facility (Eloy, Arizona)

Otay Mesa Detention Center (San Diego, California)

Denver Contract Detention Facility (Aurora, Colorado)

Krome North Service Processing Center (Miami, Florida)

Stewart Detention Center (Lumpkin, Georgia)

La Salle ICE Processing Center (Jena, Louisiana)

Jackson Parish Correctional Center (Jonesboro, Louisiana)

Richwood Correctional Center (Monroe, Louisiana)

Winn Correctional Center (Winnfield, Louisiana)

Adams County Correctional Center (Natchez, Mississippi)

Moshannon Valley Processing Center (Philipsburg, Pennsylvania)

Bluebonnet Detention Facility (Anson, Texas)

Karnes County Residential Center (Karnes City, Texas)

Montgomery Processing Center (Conroe, Texas)

Port Isabel Service Processing Center (Los Fresnos, Texas)

South Texas ICE Processing Center (Pearsall, Texas)

Northwest ICE Processing Center (Tacoma, Washington)

6. Local jails were the most common type of detention facility used by ICE over the 16-year period covered by the data.

In addition to using private and federal detention facilities, ICE has a widespread practice of paying local governments to hold people facing civil immigration charges in jails.

7. The Trump administration has revived—and plans to expand—the practice of detaining families with children.

The Biden administration had phased out family detention because of the harm it inflicts on minors. Yet, ICE resumed holding families at two detention facilities in Texas: on June 10, 2025, the Karnes County Residential Center held 1,187 people, and the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley held 575 people. Two more family detention centers are slated to open by year’s end, giving the administration the added capacity to detain 5,500 more people.

8. Since the start of the second Trump term through early June 2025, ICE has detained people in 605 facilities.

By comparison, ICE detained people in 457 facilities in the last quarter of the Biden administration (October 1, 2024, to January 19, 2025).

9. ICE has detained people in 59 new facilities since the second Trump administration began, including 17 federal facilities (two in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba) and 20 medical facilities.

The following are the 10 largest new facilities:

JTF Camp Six (Guantanamo Bay, Cuba)

Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary (Atlanta, Georgia)

Leavenworth U.S. Penitentiary (Leavenworth, Kansas)

Hopkins County Jail (Madisonville, Kentucky)

Campbell County Detention Center (Newport, Kentucky)

Federal Correctional Institution Berlin (Berlin, New Hampshire)

Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio (Stryker, Ohio)

Cimarron Correctional Facility (Cushing, Oklahoma)

Federal Detention Center Philadelphia (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)

El Paso Soft Sided Facility (El Paso, Texas)

10. ICE reopened 77 facilities that it had not been using in the year prior to President Trump’s second inauguration, including 36 non-dedicated facilities and 17 federal facilities.

The 10 largest of these reopened facilities are:

Etowah County Jail (Gadsden, Alabama)

Miami Federal Detention Center (Miami, Florida)

Glades County Detention Center (Moore Haven, Florida)

Marion County Jail (Indianapolis, Indiana)

Greene County Jail (Springfield, Missouri)

Butler County Jail (Hamilton, Ohio)

Northeast Ohio Correctional Center (Youngstown, Ohio)

Mahoning County Jail (Youngstown, Ohio)

Broome County Jail (Binghamton, New York)

Aguadilla Service Processing Center (Aguadilla, Puerto Rico)

The scale and scope of ICE’s detention network, as revealed by Vera’s research, is just a glimpse at the colossal amount of resources the United States has spent on immigration detention and enforcement. And the Trump administration has plans to dramatically expand its scope, recently allocating an unprecedented $45 billion for detention and $30 billion for additional enforcement.

Immigration detention terrorizes communities with no valid justification. Detention does not deter migration, nor is it necessary to ensure that people appear in court for immigration hearings. Yet, in the almost 30 years since the start of the modern era of civil immigration detention in the United States, millions of people, many seeking refuge and opportunity in this country, have had their lives irrevocably harmed by this cruel system. The scale of the problem may be vast, but that does not absolve us of our duty to address it.

“It will turn Ireland’s asylum system into one that prioritises speed and enforcement over fairness and human rights.
“It normalises the erosion of human rights standards against some of the most vulnerable groups in our society.","The Coalition on the EU Migration Pact, composed of 10 civil society organisations, has published an in-depth analysis of the general scheme of the International Protection Bill 2025, which will replace the International Protection Act 2015 and transpose the Pact texts into Irish law.

The coalition has expressed deep concern about the potential impact on people seeking protection in Ireland, and highlighted critical omissions in the government’s proposal on how it intends to proceed on a number of fundamental issues.

The coalition’s concerns include the lack of clarity on whether applicants will retain their basic right to legal counsel; potential severe limits on freedom of movement or widespread use of detention; whether the new accelerated procedure will ensure a fair and just system that accounts for vulnerabilities; and the removal of in-person appeals apart from a small minority of cases.

Nick Henderson, CEO of the Irish Refugee Council, said: “The Irish government is advancing major legislation that will drastically change and affect the rights of people seeking protection, transposing into Irish law more than 1,000 pages of EU Pact texts.

“We have grave concerns about both the content of the bill and the process behind it.

“The heads of bill contain crucial omissions. It is silent on reception conditions, legal counselling and age assessment and removes in-person appeals — crucial pillars of the protection process.

“The bill also fails to transpose key safeguards contained in the Pact texts, and in several areas takes a more restrictive approach where less restrictive options are available.

“The pre-legislative scrutiny process, due to take place in October, will be deficient if significant parts of the bill only emerge later, it will severely undermine meaningful pre-legislative scrutiny.

“We are urging the Department of Justice to publish an updated heads of bills urgently and to meaningfully engage with civil society and other stakeholders, ensuring sufficient time for consultation and feedback.”

Fiona Hurley, CEO of Nasc, the Migrant and Refugee Rights Centre in Cork, said: “This legislation marks one of the most significant shifts in asylum law in the history of the State.

“It risks dismantling key human rights protections, including fair procedures and meaningful access to asylum.

“It will turn Ireland’s asylum system into one that prioritises speed and enforcement over fairness and human rights.

“It normalises the erosion of human rights standards against some of the most vulnerable groups in our society.

U.S. law has long rendered people living in the U.S. illegally — without any type of legal status — ineligible for most federal benefits, including Medicaid.
While people who are in the U.S. illegally are not covered by federal Medicaid, the program may reimburse hospitals providing emergency care to immigrants who lack legal status.
Democratic leaders have denied that they're seeking to fund health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.
""We are fighting for the health care of the American people.""","One of the main lines of attack the White House and Republican lawmakers have leveled against Democrats amid the government shutdown is the claim that Democratic lawmakers want to give immigrants in the U.S. illegally free health care — which Democrats deny.

""Democrats are holding the American government HOSTAGE so they can give FREE health care to ILLEGAL ALIENS,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said on social media Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of wanting to ""take from the American people in order to give taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal immigrants.""

Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have pointed to a provision in the Democrats' funding proposal that would reverse the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's measures narrowing Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens. The changes sought by Democrats would only extend Medicaid coverage to immigrants with some kind of legal status or government protection.

Before the bill passed earlier this year, U.S. law allowed several classes of immigrants living in the U.S. legally or with the government's permission to apply for and get Medicaid, if they met other requirements.

Those groups included lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders), Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally, people granted a humanitarian benefit known as ""parole"" to enter the country, refugees, immigrants who won asylum and others, including those who were issued deportation reprieves by a judge.

Some people in those groups may have crossed into the U.S. illegally but were later granted legal status, like asylum, or deportation deferrals by immigration judges.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act — passed by lawmakers and signed by President Trump over the summer — significantly restricted noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid coverage, making it only accessible to lawful permanent residents, Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally and noncitizens from several Pacific islands.

The bill excluded those granted parole to enter the U.S., refugees, asylees and the other previously eligible immigrants. Roughly 1.4 million immigrants could lose health insurance coverage under the bill's provisions, according to a KFF analysis of Congressional Budget Office data.

The Democrats' funding proposal would restore noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid to the longstanding pre-2025 rules, reopening access for the classes of immigrants who were carved out earlier this year. All of those immigrants are in the U.S. either legally or with the government's permission.

U.S. law has long rendered people living in the U.S. illegally — without any type of legal status — ineligible for most federal benefits, including Medicaid.

Trump administration officials, however, have argued that some of the lawfully present immigrants previously eligible for Medicaid were illegally let in by the Biden administration. They argue that in the case of those granted parole, the Biden administration waved them in using a ""magic wand,"" in violation of federal immigration law.

The groups of people granted parole under former President Biden — such as Venezuelans and Ukrainians — entered the country with the government's permission and were authorized to work and live in the U.S. The Trump administration has suspended those Biden-era parole programs, and revoked the legal status of many of those who arrived under them.

The legal status of many of the other immigrants eligible for Medicaid before the One Big Beautiful Bill act — like the refugees and asylees — is not disputed. Both refugees and asylees are on a path to permanent legal status and, eventually, U.S. citizenship.

While people who are in the U.S. illegally are not covered by federal Medicaid, the program may reimburse hospitals providing emergency care to immigrants who lack legal status. Emergency funding for noncitizens constitutes less than 1% of total spending for the program, according to an analysis by KFF. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act lowered the amount hospitals can receive for these ER visits, which the Democrats' government funding plan would reverse.

Democratic leaders have denied that they're seeking to fund health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The position of most Democrats is that they will not vote for a short-term funding extension that would allow the government to reopen unless Republicans extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that have helped millions of Americans lower their health insurance costs.

""Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals. And there is nothing in anything that we have proposed that is trying to change that law,"" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. ""We are fighting for the health care of the American people.""

Some Republicans have also argued that if Democrats restore the federal Medicaid funding that was cut in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it would allow Democratic-led states to spend more state funds on health care for immigrants residing in the country unlawfully.

According to an analysis by nonpartisan health care researchers at KFF, more than a dozen states comprehensively cover care for low-income children who lack a legal immigration status using state funds. Some states, including California, provide some form of coverage to adults living in the country without authorization.

Republicans previously attempted to penalize these states in Mr. Trump's budget bill, but that provision did not make it into the final legislation.

Democrats say that’s a lie.

Like most things dealing with policy and politics. It’s complicated.

Claim: Democrats want to provide health care for “illegal” immigrants

One of the Democrats’ asks before they help reopen the government is to roll back the health care section from the One Big Beautiful Bill. Republicans have pointed out that means undoing the “Alien Medicaid Eligibility” and “Expansion FMAP for Emergency Medicaid.”

To be clear, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid, but some lawfully present immigrants do qualify if they meet eligibility requirements. But the keyword there is lawfully.

First, Republicans point to the Alien Medicaid Eligibility section as an example of Democrats wanting to give “illegals” health care. (Alien is how the federal government describes noncitizens.)

What the OBBB did was limit what types of public benefits — like health care — lawfully present qualified alien (defined under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act) could get access to, if they meet certain requirements, like having been in the U.S. for five years. The OBBB kept it for Legal Permanent Residents, certain Cuban and Haitian immigrants and Citizens of the Freely Associated States (COFA) migrants present lawfully in the U.S., but cut it for other lawfully present aliens, such as refugees, aliens granted parole for at least a year, and some victims of abuse or trafficking.

Nowhere in any Democratic proposal have they suggested that they want to extend such coverage to undocumented immigrants.

“All of these folks have to have a lawful immigration status. And a whole lot of people with lawful immigration statuses are already barred from accessing Medicaid,” said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. “It is a false statement to say that people who were undocumented previously enrolled and were eligible for any of these programs that were narrowed and very, very much restricted.”

Where it gets murky is who was granted parole. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday said the Biden Administration abused the parole program when it granted parole status to “millions” who crossed the border illegally. “That was an outrageous violation of the existing federal law and of the principles of good stewardship,” he said at a press conference. There’s a case making its way through the courts now that will decide that question when it comes to some parolees the Trump administration is trying to strip of that lawful status.

Still, if the court decides to revoke parole, the immigrants would be ineligible for the program, which gives benefits like health care to some lawfully present immigrants.

The second issue is emergency Medicaid. This program reimburses hospitals for emergency medical care for people who don’t qualify for full Medicaid, often due to their immigration status. It’s for treatment for possible loss of life, limb or serious impairment of bodily functions. A 1986 federal law, signed by President Ronald Regan, requires emergency rooms to treat patients in an emergency regardless of their ability to pay or, in this case, immigration status.

So yes, in this circumstance, undocumented immigrants receive health care, and hospitals get paid for their treatment.

The OBBB reduced funding for the emergency Medicaid program. According to the Congressional Budget Office, that cut is estimated to save $28 billion over 10 years. KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization, reports that in FY2023, $3.8 billion was spent on emergency Medicaid — that was about 0.4 percent of total Medicaid spending that year.

Claim: By wanting to repeal the health care portion of OBBB, Democrats are getting rid of the Rural Hospital Fund

The Rural Hospital fund, which provides $50 billion over 5 years to states, was created by the OBBB. Half of it must be evenly divided between the states, while the other half is up to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to distribute.

So yes, getting rid of the health care portion of OBBB would get rid of the fund.

But you have to keep in mind, the fund was created to offset the OBBB’s Medicaid cuts, which was expected to hit rural hospitals hard. According to KFF, the fund will cover just under 40 percent of the estimated loss of federal Medicaid funding in rural areas from the OBBB.

“The whole purpose of the fund was to give cover to the fact that [OBBB is] cutting $1 trillion in Medicaid,” said Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist for the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities. “The biggest rural thing was Medicaid.”

Also, the way the fund has been set up, the money will go to states, not to rural hospitals directly.

In the end, it’s unlikely that Republicans will roll back part of their signature bill, especially the portion that helps pay for the tax cuts in the OBBB.

That leads to the Democrats’ other health care ask: extending the pandemic-era enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credit.

Claim: There’s time to act on this ACA subsidy

The ACA enhanced premium tax credits were introduced in 2021 and later extended to the end of the year. It helps people buy health insurance on the state exchanges and more than doubled the amount of people who bought health coverage from 11 million to over 24 million nationwide. In Colorado, about 100,000 more people got their insurance with the help of the credit. The added enrollment also happened because it expanded eligibility to include those with incomes 400 percent above the poverty line. For a family of four, 400 percent above the federal poverty line is nearly $125,000 annually.

Republicans argue that the credit expires at the end of the year, and there is time to negotiate. That is true.

However, open enrollment starts on November 1, and information on the higher amount people will have to pay will soon be released. The increase in prices are expected to cause sticker shock, and Democrats say many people will not be able to afford health coverage on the marketplaces as a result. This is why Democrats argue a fix needs to happen now. Many people will be making decisions on whether they can afford the higher prices soon, not sometime after November 21, the day the Republican's short term funding measure would run through.

Colorado and many other states have enrollment that goes through January 15, 2026. So if there are negotiations on an extension of the credit, people can still get coverage, in theory, with the tax credits intact. But coverage for them would not start until February 1. For people who want coverage to begin on January 1, they need to enroll by December 15.

Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for the tax credit. But again, some noncitizens who are lawfully present, like lawful permanent residents, are eligible. And to get the tax credit, they have to file taxes.

Some Republicans point to a Congressional Budget Office letter on the OBBB, noting that 1.2 million noncitizens would lose coverage as evidence that undocumented immigrants were getting the credit. But that analysis was in relation to the new restrictions on immigrant health coverage in the OBBB, the winnowing of the eligible lawfully present noncitizens (900,000 people losing coverage), and a ban on low-income lawful permanent residents getting ACA marketplace subsidies while in a 5-year Medicaid waiting period (about 300,000 people losing coverage).

Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Darian Maldonado Medina, 28, during a routine check-in at an immigration office in Tampa on Sept. 5. When he entered the U.S. through the Mexican border in June 2021 authorities determined he did not prove a credible fear of returning to Venezuela and issued him an expedited removal order. He was released into the United States under ICE’s supervision and received TPS in 2023. He also had a pending family petition through his U.S. citizen mother, the beginning of the green-card process.

The same day Maldonado Medina was detained, federal judge Edward Chen upheld President Joe Biden’s administration’s extension of TPS for over half-a-million Venezuelans, including Maldonado Medina, after the Supreme Court in May let the Trump administration end the protections while litigation was ongoing.

Maldonado Medina re-registered for TPS as recently as May, meeting the required deadlines. Even with a pending renewal, lawyers emphasized that beneficiaries are protected from deportation in the interim. Still, ICE did not release him following the judge’s ruling and instead deported him to Venezuela just weeks later.

“They said TPS didn’t cover anything, that it didn’t work, and that I should just sign,” Maldonado Medina said from Valencia, Venezuela, during a phone interview with the Miami Herald.

The Department of Homeland Security told the Herald in a statement that “his TPS had ended in April 2025.” DHS did not respond to follow-up questions about why it proceeded with Maldonado Medina’s removal after Chen’s order was issued.

“TPS was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades. Secretary [Kristi] Noem is returning TPS to its original intent—TEMPORARY,” said a Homeland Security spokesperson.

But lawyers told the Herald that the deportation of Maldonado Medina was illegal and that the federal law that created Temporary Protected Status explicitly protects immigrants from being removed while the designation is in effect. They say his case highlights troubling inconsistencies in how the DHS is enforcing TPS protections.

“TPS holders should be, by law, protected from deportation. TPS protects individuals from detention and deportation during the period that the status is valid,” said Emi MacLean, one of the attorneys representing Venezuelans in the lawsuit against the Trump administration decision to terminate TPS. She described the deportation as “egregious” and accused Homeland Security of violating the federal judge’s orders.

“TPS provides protections against detention and deportation. Yet many Venezuelan TPS holders continue to be detained illegally,” MacLean said.

Hundreds of Venezuelan TPS holders remain in detention, particularly in Texas, where more than 50 people are still being held. Oklahoma is another state where individuals have yet to be released, the Herald reported last week after speaking with family members of 30 detainees in ICE facilities across the country.

Recently, dozens of TPS holders have been released after months in custody in states like Florida, Georgia, California, New Jersey, New York, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The releases followed efforts by attorneys from the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law, along with the Venezuelan American Caucus, an advocacy group, which submitted documentation in support of at least 400 cases nationwide. The legal experts are part of the team representing Venezuelan TPS holders in the ongoing lawsuit against the federal government.

‘Extremely disappointed’

Before ICE picked him up, Maldonado Medina had been living for the past four years in Spring Hill in Hernando County. He worked as a roofer and was the primary breadwinner for his partner and son. He told the Herald that during his detention, ICE agents repeatedly pressured him to sign a voluntary deportation order even after he said he had TPS.

Maldonado Medina was scheduled to be deported on Sept. 24, but a series of earthquakes in Venezuela forced the flight to divert to Aruba for several hours before returning to Miami. He was held for 48 hours at Alligator Alcatraz, the state detention site in the Eveglades, which he described as “a birdcage” with no shower, with open toilets and bunk beds.

“They never told me they were going to deport me. I realized I was going to be deported when we were flying,” Maldonado Medinda said. “They just kept stalling me.”

Nearly a week after his deportation, the ICE online locator continues to show him as being held in El Paso. “I’m glad they released me because being in detention was awful. But I’m extremely disappointed in what they did to me,” he told the Herald.

Some lawyers said that the federal government could argue Maldonado Medina’s deportation was legal because Judge Chen’s order did not grant the pending petitions under TPS, and that because he had a pending TPS petition and a removal order, they could deport him since his TPS was not active. However, the law confers deportation protection on TPS beneficiaries with pending renewals, and other lawyers said that having an expedited removal order was not grounds to deport him because he was a TPS beneficiary.

“There are already tons of people who have removal orders with TPS. You can’t be deported. You can’t be removed,“ said Randy McGrorty, director of Miami-Based Catholic Legal Services. “TPS protects you notwithstanding the removal order.”

On Sept. 15, ten days after Maldonado Medina’s arrest, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services updated its website to reflect the federal court’s decision, confirming TPS was extended through Oct. 2, 2026. The notice also affirmed that Employment Authorization Documents were automatically extended through April 3, 2026, pending further litigation.

To receive and maintain TPS, beneficiaries must pass background checks. Public records indicate that Maldonado Medina was listed as having a hold by ICE in Pinellas County, titled as a felony on the same day he was arrested by ICE, but no charges were filed.

When the Herald contacted the Pinellas County Court Clerk’s Office, officials said they found no charges against him and referred the inquiry to the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. That office also found no public records for Maldonado Medina.

A conviction for one felony or two misdemeanors, regardless of the type of offense, automatically disqualifies an individual from being eligible for TPS.

Records show Maldonado Medina did have traffic citations in Pinellas County in 2022 and 2023 for driving without a valid driving license and speeding. A search of Hillsborough County Clerk records, where Tampa is located and where ICE arrested him, shows no felony charges. The only record under his name in Hillsborough is from 2024, a traffic citation for failing to stop at a red light.

No future in the U.S. for now

After being deported, Maldonado Medina is now subject to a five-year bar from the United States. If he were to try to re-enter through the Mexican border sought asylum, he would need to claim persecution in Venezuela and establish a well-founded fear of returning.

The roofer planned to build a life in the United States, to raise his family and work toward stability.

“I wanted to live there forever, but I feel disappointed about what happened to me,” he said. “If I ever have the chance to return legally, without problems, I would absolutely.”

His deportation left his family shattered — a 15-month-old U.S. citizen son and a partner who remain in Florida and are now struggling to get by. He was the family’s sole breadwinner, and now they’re left trying to figure out if, and when, they might be together again.

“I am holding onto the hope that he will come back,” said Valentina Veloz, Maldonado Medina’s partner, who was waiting for him during his check-in at the ICE office in Tampa. The day he was arrested was also their anniversary. The couple has been together for more than eight years and share a son, Ivar Alejandro.

Veloz said they were building a future in the U.S., planning to buy a home next year and create a stable life for their family.

“Our plan was to build a life here, have a baby, find stable jobs, and live peacefully.”",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/f8i6yh/picture312358909/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Daria_Crop.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 08:56:39.359450

He will now be able to appeal the refusal of his human rights claim to the tribunal. This is a Scottish case, Petition of SV for Judicial Review (Court of Session) [2025] CSOH 88.

Background

The petitioner (claimant) is an Indian national who entered the UK as a student and then claimed asylum in December 2023 based on his sexual orientation. On 3 June 2024 his claim was refused both on asylum and human rights grounds. The claims were certified as “clearly unfounded” under section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, meaning that the decision could not be appealed.

The petitioner sought judicial review of the certification decision relating to article 8 only.

The court referred to the relevant authorities including ZT (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] UKHL 6 and SN v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] CSIH 7. The test for a claim being clearly unfounded is that it is bound to fail on appeal. If there is a realistic chance that the appeal may succeed in the tribunal then it is not clearly unfounded. This is a low test given the decision to certify removes a person’s right to appeal to the tribunal.

Given the challenge was on article 8 grounds only, the issue to be decided was whether there would be very significant obstacles to SV’s integration into India if he was returned there. The court referred to the Home Office’s guidance on private life claims which states:

A very significant obstacle may arise where the applicant would be at a real risk of prosecution or significant harassment or discrimination as a result of their sexual or political orientation or faith or gender, or where their rights and freedoms would otherwise be so severely restricted as to affect their fundamental rights, and therefore their ability to establish a private life in that country.

It was submitted on behalf of the petitioner that the fact that he “may be required to hide or minimise his sexual orientation while in India might be considered to represent a very significant obstacle” to his reintegration into India.

The Home Secretary relied on the country guidance case of MD (same-sex oriented males: risk) India CG [2014] UKUT 65 (IAC) and said there was no basis to depart from the country guidance. The court quoted at length from the country guidance case, which says that internal relocation within India would not be unduly harsh and that there are LGBT+ networks in India.

The decision in MD also states that violence and extortion of gay men still happened in India, that being gay is seen as socially unacceptable and that there is discrimination in employment, housing and access to healthcare. This guidance was given in the context of an asylum claim and there was no consideration in that case of obstacles to reintegration, where these factors, while not meeting the threshold for persecution, may still be relevant.

It was noted on behalf of SV that conditions that do not breach article 3 may still breach article 8 and argued that:

The respondent has failed to consider parts of the CPIN and did not consider how discrimination and stigma that he would face might affect his private life or ability to reintegrate. The fact that the petitioner may be required to hide or minimise his sexual orientation while in India might be considered to represent a very significant obstacle to the petitioner’s reintegration into India.

The court agreed, finding:

The decision in MD is to the effect that it cannot be said that the threshold for a protection claim is met. Here, however, the claim made is no longer a protection claim – it is solely that the petitioner’s Article 8 rights would be infringed. I do not consider it is necessary to go behind or disregard what he said in MD to reach a conclusion that a Tribunal in future might reach a conclusion that the petitioner’s sexuality means he would be unable to integrate. Paragraph 174(c) of that decision quoted above indicates a number of forms of treatment which might arise and which, if they did, might present a very significant obstacle to integration. I accept entirely that there are arguments to be made to the contrary, but the dispute between these positions is not for me to resolve in this action. Having regard to the material put before me, I consider that it cannot be said that there is no possibility that a Tribunal would accept that, on return to India, the petitioner would face very significant obstacles to reintegration and decide in his favour. On that basis I conclude that it cannot be said that his claim is “clearly unfounded”

The claim succeeded.

Conclusion

The most recently reported statistics on asylum claims based on sexual orientation (for 2023, published in August 2024) indicate that there have been grants of asylum to Indian nationals as recently as 2021 and 2023, albeit in such small numbers that the exact figure is not reported. The figures also show appeals being allowed in these claims in every year they are reported, although again in very small numbers. In light of this and the country guidance that she sought to rely on, I think it does make the Home Secretary’s arguments in favour of certification, particularly on article 8 grounds as here, difficult.

Success in this case does not of course equal success overall, as SV will now also need to succeed in his immigration appeal if he is to be granted leave to stay in the UK.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/case-law-677940_1280-edited.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 05:57:09.755304

The South African Communist Party (SACP) strongly condemns the recent actions of anti-immigrant vigilante groups, such as Operation Dudula. These groups have targeted migrants and undocumented South Africans mainly in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, denying them access to essential public services and turning them away from government clinics and hospitals. This has often been done by using abusive and violent tactics. These actions, conducted with impunity, are not only inhumane but also unlawful, violating the constitutional and legal rights of all people in South Africa and undermine the principles of justice and equality enshrined in our Constitution.

Section 27(1)(a) of the Constitution of South Africa, 1996, guarantees everyone the right to access healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare. The National Health Act 61 of 2003 further reinforces that no one may be refused emergency medical treatment, regardless of nationality or documentation status. Vigilante groups claiming to distinguish between emergency and non-emergency cases lack the qualifications or authority to make such determinations or to instruct healthcare workers on patient care. Such actions undermine the rule of law and endanger public health by fostering fear, preventing people from seeking treatment, and increasing the risk of untreated communicable diseases in working-class communities.

This campaign of division has now extended beyond healthcare facilities to public schools, where children are being harassed and intimidated, and workplaces, where workers face demands to leave their jobs. These actions deepen the challenges faced by the working class, exacerbating unemployment and restricting access to education and healthcare. They sow division among workers at a time when unity is critical to address systemic inequalities.

The SACP acknowledges the widespread frustration among the working class and poor, who rely on under-resourced and understaffed public health and education systems that fail to meet their needs. This frustration is compounded by rising insecurity, inadequate policing, and poor border management practices, which have led to an increase in undocumented individuals. The failure of the Department of Home Affairs to efficiently process documentation and capture biometrics has fueled insecurity and provided fertile ground for vigilante groups like Operation Dudula and March & March to gain support among communities desperate for solutions.

The SACP 5th Special National Congress adopted a resolution on immigration, recognising the rise of xenophobia and its corrosive impact on working-class solidarity. The resolution commits the SACP to combat xenophobia, challenge misconceptions propagated by reactionary forces, and advocate for policies that address the root causes of migration. As communists, we remain unwavering in our commitment to international worker solidarity and the protection of the human and labour rights of all workers, their families, and communities, irrespective of citizenship or migration status.

We call on the Department of Home Affairs to urgently implement a comprehensive programme to document and capture the biometrics of all undocumented South Africans and non-South Africans, including those whose documentation has expired due to systemic inefficiencies. Populist vigilantism, reminiscent of apartheid-era practices such as public harassment and demands for identity documents, is not a solution. It only deepens division and distracts from the real issues of systemic inequality and poor governance.

The SACP supports the Minister of Health’s clear stance that preventing access to healthcare is unlawful and inhumane. We also stand in solidarity with the positions of progressive organisations like COSAS and education authorities that have condemned disruptions to teaching and learning caused by vigilante actions. The SACP remains committed to upholding the human rights of all, particularly the most vulnerable, in a society where the rule of law prevails for the benefit of everyone.

The justifiable frustrations of the working class must not be manipulated to target vulnerable workers but should instead be directed at policymakers who prioritise the interests of the private sector and the capitalist class. The SACP will mobilise alongside allied working-class organisations of the left and other progressive forces for national mass action, including marches to the Department of Home Affairs, to demand urgent and effective action on documentation and broader systemic failures.

The SACP calls for unity among the working class to confront these challenges collectively, reject vigilantism and xenophobia, and build a society rooted in justice, equality, and solidarity.

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants — regardless of status — have been pulling back.
Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally “Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what’s happening to immigrants,” she said.
A 2001 court case, Aliessa v. Novello, requires the state to offer publicly funded health coverage to all lawfully present residents under the state constitution.","An estimated 1.4 million immigrants who are in the country legally but are not citizens stand to lose their government-subsidized health care coverage under the sweeping tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law this summer, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts federal spending on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. It also places new eligibility restrictions on lawfully present immigrants, including refugees and asylees, who are enrolled in a variety of government-subsidized health programs: Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicare and Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Immigrants who are in the country illegally have long been ineligible for federally funded health coverage.

But seven states — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington — plus the District of Columbia have extended state-funded coverage to some income-eligible noncitizen adults regardless of their immigration status. Fourteen states plus the district provide state-funded coverage to noncitizen children whether they are here legally or not.

The new restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with other Trump policies limiting public benefits for immigrants, put those states in a financial bind. With less federal money to provide health benefits to immigrants who are here legally, states will be hard-pressed to maintain their programs that offer coverage to all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.

Health care would be slashed even for immigrants with legal status under massive Senate bill

“We’re taking a giant step backwards from that public health and preventive health measure by excluding more people and draining federal resources from states that need it,” said Tanya Broder, a senior counsel specializing in immigrant health policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.

“And the result will be that our health — individually, as families and as communities — will be in jeopardy, and the health care infrastructure that serves all of us will also be compromised,” Broder said.

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants — regardless of status — have been pulling back.

To help close a $12 billion deficit, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Current enrollees between the ages of 19 and 59 will have to pay a new $30 monthly premium beginning in 2027. In July 2026, the state will eliminate dental care for noncitizens.

Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64. The state still operates a state-funded plan for residents 65 and older regardless of immigration status, but enrollment has been paused. And Minnesota also plans to exclude adult immigrants who are here illegally from a program that used to provide coverage regardless of immigration status.

New York is in an especially tough spot, since its state constitution prohibits discrimination against lawfully present immigrants in providing public benefits.

“States have had some type of leeway to fund resources for migrant communities if they want to,” said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor and the founding director of the Medical-Legal Partnership Clinic at Penn State Dickinson Law who studies immigrants’ access to health care. “But now this [federal] law makes it difficult for them to do that.”

Making it less attractive to stay

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration policies, said these efforts are part of both Trump’s larger anti-immigration stance and “Congress’ interest in getting rid of any incentive or benefit for people who are in the country illegally.”

“It’s a way of making it less attractive for people to stay here illegally, right?” Vaughan said. “They’re trying to give people reasons to leave rather than reasons to stay.”

As noncitizens who are here legally lose access to federally funded benefits, the demand for state-funded coverage is “likely to increase,” Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research group, told Stateline.

“However, at the same time, states are facing increasing budget pressures, especially with the Medicaid cuts,” Pillai said. “So it’s almost a double whammy, where there will likely be increased demand for state-funded coverage programs, but also states will have fewer resources to cover people.”

Makhlouf said the Trump administration’s policy changes reflect a broader strategy of stripping public benefits from marginalized and poor communities.

‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

“Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what’s happening to immigrants,” she said. “When it becomes normalized to be able to sacrifice certain people’s humanity or their vulnerability, or to minimize their contributions to society, and say, ‘You don’t deserve access to health care,’ then that can be turned on to any group.”

Under Trump’s domestic policy law, California expects to lose at least $28.4 billion in federal Medicaid funding, according to Newsom’s office.

On the California Senate floor June 27, Democratic state Sen. María Elena Durazo expressed her sorrow at the state’s decision to deny coverage to immigrants.

“I can’t express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,” Durazo said. “Today, that joy that I was so happy about, that joy has turned into pain, that joy has turned into shame.”

Democratic Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, however, said the state had little choice.

“We are a state of immigrants, 10.6 million strong. And we will never turn our backs on those who are part of the heart of the largest economy in the United States of America,” McGuire said during the debate. “So we’ve had to make some tough decisions. I know we’re not going to please everyone.”

Obligated in New York

One state, New York, is particularly in a bind, because its constitution requires it to provide coverage to lawfully present noncitizens.

Roxana, 27, has been living in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, since she was 8 years old and is using her first name only out of fear she will be targeted. At the end of 2019, she experienced a range of debilitating symptoms, including pelvic pain and chronic fatigue, and discovered a noncancerous lump on her breast.

“Chronic illness has impacted my career trajectory with a lot of fatigue and chronic pain,” said Roxana, who lives in the Bronx, New York.

Roxana cannot get federally funded Medicaid. But she qualified for state-funded public health coverage in New York. A 2001 court case, Aliessa v. Novello, requires the state to offer publicly funded health coverage to all lawfully present residents under the state constitution. So, she could afford to go to the doctor, where she learned that she had a hormonal condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, and she was able to get the lump removed.

Most refugees and asylees will be denied food stamps under Trump’s new law

New York mostly picked up the tab for immigrants and other lawfully residing immigrants until 2016, when it launched coverage it called the Essential Plan under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Under the ACA, the plan has no deductibles or monthly premiums for patients, and the federal government has picked up almost the entire cost — 90% — of the plan, a huge economic relief for the state.

Now, New York faces an annual loss of $13.5 billion in federal Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funds. Additionally, the phasing out of premium tax credits for noncitizens under Trump’s law would lead to a loss of $7.5 billion in annual funding to the state’s Essential Plan, which covers 1.7 million New Yorkers.

“These are billions of dollars that are being taken away and out of New York’s delivery system,” Amir Bassiri, director of Medicaid at the New York State Department of Health, said at a United Hospital Fund conference on July 30.

It’s unclear whether and how the state will afford to cover people like Roxana, even though it’s required under the state’s constitution. Like other immigrants, she is terrified that in the face of cuts and shrinking safety net access for noncitizens, she will lose continuous health care coverage and that her condition will get worse.

“My PCOS symptoms have just been getting worse over the years. I really want to try my best with the health access that I have to get it under control.”

Most prominently, ICEBlock, a free app with hundreds of thousands of users, was no longer available as of Thursday evening to download on the App Store. ICEBlock allows people to anonymously share the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents within a five-mile radius, and its creators had recommended the App Store as the only safe venue from which to download and use it.

In a statement, Apple said it had taken down ICEBlock, and other similar apps, after being contacted by “law enforcement,” but it did not specify which agency or agencies had contacted it and did not say which other apps it had removed. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump administration officials have issued several legal threats over the use of ICEBlock — or even simply reporting on it. Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, said in July that the Justice Department was investigating whether it could prosecute CNN for reporting on the app’s existence, arguing that it amounted to “actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities.” It is unclear what crime that would amount to.

Pam Bondi, the attorney general, also said the Justice Department was “looking at” Joshua Aaron, the creator of the app, adding that “he better watch out.”

In response to the threats, Mr. Aaron defended ICEBlock in an appearance on MSNBC, saying that the service fell under free speech protections and that there was nothing illegal about creating or using the app. He likened the app to Waze and other navigation apps that allow users to alert others to the presence of the police on the road.

“I think whenever you push back against a regime that is purporting authoritarianism, pushing fascism and subverting the rule of law in our Constitution,” Mr. Aaron said in July, “if you push back against them, you have to know they’re going to come after you in some way.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/multimedia/02dc-ICEBlock-gztq/02dc-ICEBlock-gztq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 06:59:17.341700

(WTVO) — The Department of Homeland Security provided an update to its ongoing “Operation Midway Blitz” on Wednesday, saying over 800 criminal illegal aliens have been arrested despite both the state’s sanctuary policies and violent protests.

According to DHS, “Operation Midway Blitz” was launched in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk driving crash by Julio Cucul-Bol, and specifically targets criminals who flocked to Chicago and Illinois seeking protection from deportation by the sanctuary policies of Gov. JB Pritzker.

“During Operation Midway Blitz, DHS law enforcement has made more than 800 arrests across Illinois. The Trump Administration will not allow violent criminals or repeat offenders to terrorize our neighborhoods or victimize our children and innocent Americans,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “We will not allow sanctuary politicians or violent rioters to stop us from enforcing the law and arresting pedophiles, murderers, gang members, rapists, and domestic abusers from American communities.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Border Patrol provided examples of recent arrests, including:

Cristobal Carias Masin, of El Salvador, convicted of statutory rape, fraud, and aggravated felony.

Stefan Cseve, of Austria, convicted of sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, numerous sexual predator in a public park offenses, child sex offender loitering, in violation of the sex offender registry and currently charged with murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor.

In response to the large-scale ICE operation, protesters have targeted a federal facility in Broadview, chanting “shoot ICE” and confronting agents.

On Friday, agents repeatedly fired chemical agents toward a crowd of over 100 protesters after some of the group attempted to block a car from driving down a street toward the ICE building. Pepper bullets and tear gas canisters went into the crowd, most of them standing away from the fence and not blocking traffic.

CBS News Chicago and the Broadview Police Department have launched an investigation after a reporter’s car was struck by a chemical munition outside the facility.

Illinois effectively banned immigration detention in 2021, when it ended local cooperation agreements between the federal government and county jails. Illinois barred private detention in 2019 following failed attempts to build a new detention facility and there are no federal immigration detention centers in the state.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker countered by saying,“We have received many reports of US citizens being detained for simply stepping onto the public streets,” adding that “sixty percent of the individuals that ICE has taken in Illinois this year have no criminal convictions of any kind.”

In Chicago on Sunday, dozens of armed federal agents, in full tactical gear, walked the streets of some of the city’s most prominent tourist and shopping areas.

Pritzker has maintained that current ICE operations are a provocation, hoping to enflame a violent response so that President Donald Trump can send the military to Chicago, under the pretext of supporting federal agents.

“In any other country, if federal agents fired upon journalists and protesters unprovoked, what would we call it?” Pritzker asked Monday. “If federal agents march down busy streets, harassing civilians and demanding their papers, what would we say? I don’t think we’d have any trouble calling it what it is: authoritarianism.”

Roughly 100 Army Reserve lawyers are expected to participate, with 50 beginning a nearly six-month assignment immediately after their training, according to a Sept. 3 email sent to an Army Reserve attorney and reviewed by The Associated Press.

Training for the first group of Army lawyers begins Monday and training for the second group is expected to start in the spring, several former and current military reserve lawyers said they were told. Roughly 100 Army Reserve lawyers are expected to participate, with 50 beginning a nearly six-month assignment immediately after their training, according to a Sept. 3 email sent to an Army Reserve attorney and reviewed by The Associated Press.

The administration wants to bring in as many as 600 military-trained attorneys to help make decisions about which immigrants can stay in the country. Advocates are alarmed by the move to use military lawyers to bolster staffing in the backlogged immigration courts as President Donald Trump's administration ramps up immigration arrests.

Those courts have yearslong waits for hearings, and the number of pending cases has more than doubled in the past four years to 3.4 million.

Both the Army and National Guard said they hope to fill the assignments with volunteers.

“This assignment provides the opportunity to gain judicial experience in a high tempo, nationally significant setting,” an email sent to members of the Army’s Reserve Legal Command stated, adding that locations and other details will be released later.

A notification seeking volunteers sent Sept. 6 to active-duty and reserve National Guard members said “ideal candidates will possess experience in administrative law, immigration law, service as a military judge” or a related field. Applicants should have sound judgment, impartiality and a “suitable temperament for the role,” it said.

The Trump administration increasingly has turned to the military to support its crackdown on illegal immigration. That has included troops patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, National Guard members being sent into U.S. cities to support immigration enforcement efforts, housing people awaiting deportation on military bases, and using military aircraft to carry out deportations.

Concerns over lack of training

Immigration judges each manage hundreds or thousands of cases, deciding who gets asylum and green cards to stay in the U.S. Their rulings shape both the lives of immigrant families and the success of Trump’s crackdown.

Some immigration and military law experts are concerned the reservists will be put in the job without enough training or experience after more than 100 immigration judges were fired or left.

With only about 600 immigration judges remaining, the Pentagon move would double their ranks. Trump’s sweeping new tax and spending law provided $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including the hiring of 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees, but it caps the number of permanent immigration judges at 800.

“They’re letting a lot of experienced judges go, terminating them with no notice, and yet they claim that there’s a shortage so they need to have these military JAG officers step in and take over,” said Margaret Stock, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and immigration lawyer.

Of particular concern, the administration is not requiring experience as an administrative law judge or in immigration law as in the past, she said. Stock has taught seminars on immigration law at West Point but said military lawyers learn only a minimal amount to be able to help fellow service members with things like visas for spouses or children.

“Immigration law is super technical and complicated,” she said. “It’s worse than tax law, and it’s constantly changing. And it has its own terminology, its own rules that don’t make any sense.”

Immigration judges come from a range of legal backgrounds, including the military, the Justice Department, immigration enforcement agencies, and private practice. The government previously required applicants to have seven years' experience before undergoing a lengthy hiring process, then six weeks of training followed by a two-year probation period.

Until now, temporary judges needed 10 years of legal experience in immigration, and were often retired immigration judges, according to the government's rule laying out the new plan.

The Defense Department did not return an email seeking comment. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the immigration courts, declined to comment. In the rule, the agency wrote that many successful immigration judges had little experience in immigration law before taking the job.

“Immigration law experience is not always a strong predictor of success,” the rule said.

In the military, an attorney is known as a judge advocate general, or JAG. They study at accredited law schools and pass the bar exam before going into a military law program for just over two months. They sometimes work as special assistants to U.S. attorneys and gather evidence to prosecute criminal cases, much like civilian prosecutors do, said Mark Nevitt, a former Navy JAG and associate professor at Emory University School of Law.

“They are some of the greatest lawyers you’ll meet in the national security world,” but this will require they “get up to speed pretty quickly on a complex body of law and then adjudicate matters and claims as a judge,” Nevitt said.

Matt Biggs, president of a federal employee union that represents immigration judges, said tapping lawyers with little or no immigration experience to hear these complex, high-stakes cases will likely do more harm than good.

“It will lead to more appeals of decisions. It will further increase the backlog. It’s going to be an inefficient and costly endeavor,” Biggs said. “It sets a dangerous precedent in this country when it comes to due process protections.”

Gregory Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said the Justice Department is “watering down the qualifications of those it will empower to make life-or-death decisions.”

He also worries the administration will hold too much sway over the temporary hires. The permanent judges are government employees with civil service protections.

Democrats have questioned the plan's legality

Some Democratic senators have warned the Pentagon plan may violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which bans service members from carrying out law enforcement duties, and fear taking away the JAGs could harm the military justice system. They sent a letter to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services, asking where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and what legal analysis the military has conducted.

A Pentagon memo describing the plan said the appointments should be for no longer than six months. The memo also said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring the military lawyers don't violate the Posse Comitatus Act.

If the military lawyers serve entirely under civilian personnel then it could be legal, Nevitt said, but it's unclear.

Some immigrant advocates believe the administration is presuming military lawyers are more likely to deny cases to meet Trump’s deportation goals.

But Greg Rinckey, a former Army lawyer who is now in private practice, said that assumption is wrong.

“They will not rubber stamp because most of us have served as defense counsel,” he said. “We’re not all government hacks.”

A number of his friends who are Army Reserve JAGs have signed up because they are interested in immigration law and want to serve a national need, he said.

“And also it’s a way to put something else on your resume — that you served as a judge.”

The government signed a secretive deal with Nauru in September, guaranteeing the small Micronesian island A$2.5 billion over the next three decades to accommodate the first cohort of deportees.

In both countries, migrants can now be banished to states to which they have no prior connection.

Last year in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour party promised that the previous Conservative government’s plan to deport people to Rwanda was “dead and buried”. Yet, Labour removed close to 35,000 people in 2024, an increase of 25% over the previous year.

Starmer has also proposed establishing “return hubs” in third countries for people with rejected asylum claims.

Meanwhile, the far-right Reform Party has put forward a “mass deportation” plan involving the use of military bases to detain and deport hundreds of thousands of people, if it wins power in the next general election.

Similar policies may soon come to Europe, too. In May, the European Commission published a proposal that would allow EU member states to deport people seeking asylum to third countries where they have no previous connection.

The deportation of populations deemed problematic is not a new practice. For centuries, states have used forms of deportation to forcibly remove people, as Australia’s own history as a British penal colony illustrates.

Today, deportations are a staple of migration governance around the world. However, the recent expansion of detention and deportations reflects an accelerated criminalisation and punishment of non-citizens, tied to a rising authoritarianism across purportedly liberal Western countries.

Criminalising movement

The expansion and outsourcing of deportation is underpinned by long histories of criminalising migration.

Over the past three decades, legal obstacles and securitised borders have increasingly forced those fleeing war, persecution and insecurity to rely on unauthorised routes to seek refuge.

Governments have simultaneously reframed the act of seeking asylum from a human right to a criminal act, brandishing those on the move as “illegal” as a way of justifying onshore and offshore immigration detention.

Racialised people living in the community have also been subject to increased policing, regardless of their migration status.

In the US, UK and Australia, this criminalising language, once the preserve of the right-wing press, is now echoed by politicians across the political spectrum and enshrined in legislation. This has accelerated what migration expert Alison Mountz has termed “the death of asylum”, and normalising deportations.

In Australia, for example, the government lowered the threshold for visa cancellations in 2014, resulting in people with minor offences being detained and scheduled for deportation. Those who could not be returned to their home countries continued to languish in detention until a 2023 high court ruling mandated their release.

Despite having served their sentences, in addition to protracted periods in immigration detention, a media frenzy framed these people as a major threat to the community. The Labor government then legislated to deport them, in addition to thousands of others on precarious visas, to a third country.

Deportations have also been a central facet of US immigration enforcement for many years.

Former President Barack Obama was branded “Deporter in Chief” for achieving a record three million deportations while in office.

While Obama focused on “felons not families”, Trump has equated migration itself with crime and insecurity. His administration has cast a much wider net, rounding up those with and without criminal convictions, including citizens.

Detentions and deportations have also been used to suppress political dissent on issues, such as the genocide in Gaza.

To expedite his pledge to deport one million people in his first year, the Trump administration hastily set up detention centres in former prisons and military bases, including at Guantánamo Bay.

Reports suggest the government has also approached 58 third countries to accept deported non-nationals. Countries that have agreed, or already received people, are shown in the map below.

In many cases, people are then re-detained on arrival in hotels, prisons and camps, with some subject to further deportation.

Rising authoritarianism

These recent developments reveal an explicit authoritarianism in which deportations are achieved through the elimination of procedural fairness. Reducing notice periods, the ability to appeal decisions, and access to legal counsel allows for rushed and opaque procedures.

In June, eight people were deported from the US to South Sudan without the chance to contest their removal. After a failed court intervention, the three liberal US Supreme Court justices stated:

The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone, anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard.

In the UK, the Labour party expanded the “Deport Now Appeal Later” scheme in August, extending the countries to which people can be deported without appeal rights from eight to 23.

And this month in Australia, the Migration Act was amended to expunge the rules of natural justice for people scheduled for deportation.

Across all three countries, the rapid expansion of detention and deportation practices terrorise those targeted, leaving whole communities living in fear. Australian human rights lawyer Alison Battisson described deportation as “a creeping death to the individuals and their families”.

These policies have also legitimised and emboldened far-right, neo-Nazi groups, who have taken to the streets in both the UK and Australia in recent weeks calling for an end to migration. In both countries, the effects of decades of neoliberal policies, such as a lack of affordable housing, jobs, and health care, are redefined as a problem of migration.

How communities are responding

Communities are now organising and making the case for a different sort of politics.

In Los Angeles, for example, grassroots organisations mobilised earlier this year to counter escalating raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Networks also began providing information and support to those targeted by ICE arrests. In July, Detention Watch Network relaunched the Communities Not Cages coalition of grassroots campaigns against detention.

In the UK, far-right rallies at asylum hotels have been met by counter demonstrations, with people insisting on a politics of welcome and unity.

But the challenge remains how to turn local and national opposition into a coalition capable of confronting this rise in authoritarian politics of exclusion and expulsion.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/691521/original/file-20250917-56-xx605z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C372%2C4463%2C2231&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-03 08:56:35.638599

Felony assault of a federal officer is punishable by up to eight years in federal prison.","PORTLAND, Ore.—A Portland woman made her first appearance in federal court yesterday after assaulting a federal officer near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in South Portland.

Katherine Meagan Vogel, 39, has been charged by criminal complaint with the felony offense of assaulting a federal officer.

According to court documents, on the evening of September 30, 2025, federal officers detained Vogel after she applied red paint to the driveway of the ICE facility. Federal officers escorted Vogel to the ICE facility to interview her for conduct related to depredation of government property. While federal officers processed her, Vogel struck one of the federal officers in the jaw with a closed fist. Officers then arrested her for the additional charge of assaulting a federal officer.

“Violence and property damage at the ICE building or any other federal building will not be tolerated. If you assault a federal law enforcement officer or damage federal property, you will be arrested and federally prosecuted,” said Scott E. Bradford, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.

Since June 13, 2025, the United States Attorney’s Office has charged 28 defendants with federal crimes for offenses committed at the ICE building, including assaulting federal officers, failure to comply, and depredation of government property.

Vogel made her first appearance in federal court today before a U.S. Magistrate Judge. She was released on conditions pending further court proceedings.

Felony assault of a federal officer is punishable by up to eight years in federal prison.

“There are a number of ramifications if the public can’t believe what law enforcement is saying; then law enforcement probably can’t depend on the cooperation of citizens to report information to them accurately,” Pence said.
ICE agents alleged that Gonzalez-Romero violently resisted arrest off-camera, too, even attempting to bite an ICE agent.
“My sense is the vast majority of members of the public understand that there is more physical resistance to law enforcement and assaults on law enforcement,” Suthers said.
“And you’re creating a whole generation … U.S. citizens … of young people who don’t trust law enforcement and don’t respect law enforcement.”","In June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials made an eye-popping claim about the dangers faced by officers as they increased detentions and patrols across the United States.

“Our officers are facing a 413 percent increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murders (sic), rapists and gang members,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a news release after a man was charged with punching a Customs and Border Protection officer in Los Angeles. “If you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Then, as cities and states began to question the tactics used by ICE agents to conceal their identities with masks and street clothes while conducting rapid smash-and-grab operations to detain immigrants, the number of assaults ICE claimed were being endured by agents nationwide escalated at an astonishing rate.

A week after the 413 percent increase claim, ICE said assaults on agents had now jumped 500 percent, according to Homeland Security. By July 8, it was up 700 percent. A week later, it was 830 percent.

By early August, the head of ICE said in a television interview that the number of assaults on ICE officers had recently gone up more than “1,000” percent. ICE and Homeland Security officials never made clear what they were comparing it to in the past, and released no data to support the big numbers. Just last week, President Donald Trump said in an executive order that the 1,000 percent increase was as compared to the same period a year ago.

This week, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi relied on the same 1,000 percent claim in a memo ordering the deployment of additional federal agents to Portland, Ore. and Chicago to “defend ICE facilities.”

Once again, no data was provided, but after nudging the claim to 1,000 percent through the summer, ICE stuck with it into October.

“A lot of people don’t truly take the time to understand the law enforcement mission that we do and the significant public safety threats that are out there,” said Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director. “It’s one of the things that’s keeping me up at night … the threats are real.”

There is no question that ICE agents have faced increasingly dangerous work conditions and assaults around the nation, including some that could have turned deadly.

Fifteen people were charged this summer after what authorities called a July 4 plot to lure ICE agents out of a Texas detention center where they were then fired upon. A civilian police officer was wounded. In other cases, criminal affidavits show that Customs and Border Protection officers have been punched on patrol. Another ICE agent in California said he was dragged by a car. In Omaha, an ICE agent was slammed to the ground during an arrest and had to be hospitalized. Last week, a sniper opened fire on an ICE detention center in Texas, killing two detainees, though federal officials believe immigration agents were his target.

But despite repeated requests from CPR News for data underlying the claims of a massive jump in assaults justifying the use of masks, concealed identities and a surge of federal law enforcement in American cities, ICE and Homeland Security representatives have produced nothing but a handful of anecdotes. And while the agency promises that every person who assaults an ICE agent “will face the full extent of the law,” a CPR News examination of federal court records found that the number of federal cases has risen, but at nowhere near the rate claimed by the agencies.

President Trump has readily acknowledged his penchant for exaggeration over the years. As far back as 1987, he called it “truthful hyperbole” in his book, “The Art of the Deal.”

But when law enforcement officers engage in hype or make outright misleading statements, it jeopardizes trust in that system, said former FBI agent and leader Bob Pence.

Pence, who now lives in Littleton, served in various roles in the Bureau from 1962 to 1992, ending his career as Special Agent in Charge of the Rocky Mountain region. He then wrote a book published in 2020, “My Non-Political FBI: From Hoover to a Violent America.”

Pence noted that even something as minor as exaggerating claims of assault on ICE officers has a cost.

“There are a number of ramifications if the public can’t believe what law enforcement is saying; then law enforcement probably can’t depend on the cooperation of citizens to report information to them accurately,” Pence said. “They won’t make calls to law enforcement. If they’re asked, they may rationalize and say, well if they’re not capable of telling the truth, then I don’t need to tell the truth about this anyway.”

National data shows that charges of assault against federal officers have risen 25 percent so far in 2025 through mid-September compared to the same period a year ago, according to the federal courts database.

All of these events coincide with a sharp increase in the number of enforcement actions, as ICE is under pressure to find and remove millions from the country. But those operations are cloaked in secrecy — including who they are detaining, how many they’re detaining, how they are detaining them, and even sometimes where they take them — making it impossible to track their frequency in order to calculate a rate of assaults per federal enforcement action.

In Colorado, in the last decade, there have been five cases filed in federal court for assault on immigration agents, one in 2017 and four since Trump took office this year. One of those has already been dismissed. A second, which was heard in federal court Thursday, could meet the same fate, illustrating the complexities at the intersection of immigration law and criminal law.

In that case, agents detained the immigrant, Alejandro Guereca-Lizarraga, on July 25 at the Falcon Meadows Campground. They allege that he was initially compliant, but began to resist arrest after learning they were immigration officers. An agent said Guereca-Lizarraga kicked him, despite having his hands and feet shackled, and then spat at an agent at the detention facility.

A federal magistrate ruled Thursday there was probable cause for the case to proceed to trial. But the man’s public defender said she expected him to be deported as soon as next week, which would prompt dismissal of the case.

Another Colorado case involved a truck hitting an agent’s vehicle in Denver, while they were in it, according to the agents. Another case includes no details, but allegedly occurred last month.

Nationwide, charges of assault on all federal officers across all agencies didn’t start to rise until recently.

In the last three months, case filings of assaults on all officers nationwide have jumped 74 percent from the previous quarter. Most of that increase can be attributed to unrest in Los Angeles, where ICE has engaged in large-scale enforcement operations since June.

Those incidents have led to protests throughout that city. But those cases, and others nationally, have also provided indications that the public broadly is beginning to question the credibility of some of the federal government’s claims.

A man in Washington, D.C., in August threw a ham sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent and was charged with assaulting a federal officer. But prosecutors, a couple of weeks later, failed to get a grand jury to indict the man. In Los Angeles, federal prosecutors attempted to get felony indictments against at least 38 people involved in those protests and civil unrest or near immigration raids, but were successful in persuading citizens to indict their neighbors just seven times, according to local reporting. Other charges were dismissed, reduced to misdemeanors or resolved by plea deals.

Grand juries need to find only that there is probable cause that a crime was committed for a case to go to trial. Winning convictions by proving a case “beyond a reasonable doubt” is an even higher standard.

But even when including the cases reduced to misdemeanors, the number of actual charges filed across the country is small. For Homeland Security and ICE claims of a 1,000 percent increase in assaults to be true, there would also have to be thousands of other assaults that did not result in criminal charges, despite the government's claim that all assaults on federal agents will be prosecuted.

Scott Mechkowski, a former Deputy Field Office Director for ICE in New York City, said the court filings will never fully reflect the frequency of assaults on immigration agents.

“The way it's presented and prosecuted in federal court is different for us,” he said. “Like we were told — most of the time our guys got bit or they got punched — and we were told (by federal prosecutors) that's part of the job.”

Mechkowski said the only people who truly collect the number of assaults on ICE officers is ICE.

But CPR News' requests for any data kept by that agency were denied, with a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security declining to cite where they got the data or even how they arrived at a 1,000 percent increase when announcing it in August. They did send one email with six links to old press releases, again citing a 1,000 percent increase in assaults without explanation. Later, DHS sent an email with press releases for 12 cases of assault on agents.

A spokesman for ICE in Colorado declined multiple requests for comment on specific cases of assault on agents this year.

Assaults on local police in Colorado have stayed relatively flat from year to year from 2022 to today, though some departments, like Aurora, have experienced an increase.

Officers there are assaulted dozens of times a year. In 2024, there were 130 assaults on Aurora officers — up from 98 in 2023 — a 33 percent increase, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.

“It certainly seems more common today than it was in the past. I don’t disagree with the general notion that the job of a law enforcement officer today is much, much tougher than it has in the past and that’s largely because of a greater willingness for people to resist law enforcement or actively assault them,” said John Suthers, a former state attorney general, U.S. attorney and mayor of Colorado Springs. “I think the notion that law enforcement is trying to convey is correct.""

But unlike local police in Colorado, federal immigration agents don’t wear body cameras, and it’s often their word against an alleged assailant. Mechkowski, the former ICE supervisor, said he wished he had had body cameras when he was working enforcement, because it would exonerate him of any wrongdoing.

“I would win 100 times out of 100 on my arrests. I was never mean to anybody. You know what I mean? I never used force that wasn't necessary.”

Even in cases where video clearly shows an assault — though perhaps not as dramatically as ICE claims — it is no guarantee that the case will result in a conviction.

Take the case of Abraham Gonzalez-Romero.

Gonzalez-Romero’s initial criminal cases were shaky. State prosecutors had charged him with attempted murder with little evidence except that he was in possession of a firearm at a scene where shots were fired. The only witnesses to the case were also in the country without authorization and had credibility problems.

The local charges were eventually dismissed.

On Feb. 28, ICE agents were waiting for him as he left the jail, having been notified of his pending release by the Denver Sheriff after ICE asked about him. They flashed their badges and began walking towards him, he ran and was captured on jail video knocking an immigration agent to the ground.

ICE agents alleged that Gonzalez-Romero violently resisted arrest off-camera, too, even attempting to bite an ICE agent. He was charged under the federal statute for assaulting an officer. If anyone was injured, it was not serious enough to require immediate treatment. Denver Fire records don’t show any calls for service or medical assistance to the Smith Road location at that time.

But that didn’t stop his case from entering the national immigration debate.

Just a week later, House Republicans hosted a panel of big-city mayors, including Denver’s Mike Johnston, to talk about so-called sanctuary policies. Colorado Republican Rep. Jeff Crank told the story about Gonzalez-Romero, but he went a step further than even the ICE agent claimed.

“In Denver, you require that the Denver Police Department release Tren de Aragua gang members into the streets, uncuffed,” Crank said, animated as he addressed Johnston in the House hearing. “Just last week, it resulted in an illegal Tren de Aragua member assaulting and biting — and biting! — an ICE agent … You’re putting police officers at risk to score political points and it’s outrageous.”

But in court, federal prosecutors made no effort to prove Gonzalez-Romero bit, or even attempted to bite, an agent and his attorney said it never happened. Federal public defender Kelly Christl also said in court, “There’s no evidence to support that” he was a Tren de Aragua gang member. The U.S. Attorney didn’t present any evidence for that either.

The public defender for Gonzalez-Romero said that wasn’t the only thing that immigration agents got wrong: she told the court most of the violence an ICE supervisor said her client committed simply never happened.

“He did not kick the inside of the caged vehicle. He did not attempt to escape. He did not attempt to bite an officer. He did not tell officers that he wanted to fight them,” reads a court filing from August from Christl.

The government dropped the charge of assault on an officer as part of a plea deal in which Gonzalez-Romero pleaded guilty to “possession of a firearm by an illegal alien.” The U.S. Attorney said in court documents that the assault charge was dropped because of a lack of resources.

Gonzalez-Romero’s attorney quickly pounced on that.

“The government’s statement that this offer was made ‘due to available resources’ is without merit,” wrote Christl to the court, adding that the U.S. Attorney’s office certainly has the resources to prosecute hundreds of crimes every year.

“Furthermore, Attorney General Pam Bondi’s enforcement memorandum on February 5, 2025, specifically prioritizes prosecuting undocumented immigrants and obstruction of law enforcement. Certainly, if the government believed it could move forward on more serious offenses against Mr. Gonzalez-Romero, it would have, because he would otherwise fit the Attorney General’s enforcement priorities.”

Eve Sparks, a spokeswoman for Rep. Crank, said she wasn’t aware the assault against a federal officer charge was dropped, and she asked for proof. After the court documents were provided, she then didn’t respond to multiple requests for a comment or answer questions about where the congressman got the information about Gonzalez-Romero in the first place.

Gonzalez-Romero was sentenced in federal court to time served on the gun charge. The U.S. Attorney said he would be deported after being released.

The U.S. Attorney’s office would not comment on the decision to drop assault charges.

Other federal jobs more perilous, according to charges filed

While not backing up the enormous increases in assaults claimed by ICE and Homeland Security leaders, the federal data does make one thing clear: In Colorado, it’s far more dangerous to be an employee with the federal prisons or the Bureau of Indian Affairs than an ICE agent.

Between 2015 and June 2025, the majority of assaults on federal officers in Colorado were on Indian Country land and in the state’s federal prisons.

“My sense is the vast majority of members of the public understand that there is more physical resistance to law enforcement and assaults on law enforcement,” Suthers said. “It’s a much, much tougher job today than it was 20, 30 years ago and that is because of the public attitude that it’s OK to assault, resist and abuse officers.”

As for ICE assaults, Mechkowski, the former Deputy Field Office Director for ICE in New York, said federal prosecutors usually don’t pick up or aggressively pursue their cases.

“Most of the time, they’re just blanket denying these cases before they have all the facts. They'll just deny it unless there's serious, serious bodily injury,” Mechkowski said.

The importance of law enforcement credibility

In two of the four cases filed this year in Colorado's federal court against people for assaulting an immigration agent, a federal magistrate determined that the defendant did not pose a threat to the public and released them into the community to await trial.

On July 25, ICE agents said they were assaulted by Alejandro Guereca-Lizarraga while he was in custody on an immigration detainer. According to a criminal complaint filed in federal court, Guereca-Lizarraga kicked an ICE agent and spat on a detention officer at the GEO facility in Aurora.

Federal Magistrate Judge Kathryn Starnella denied the prosecutor’s request to delay a detention hearing and ordered ICE to put him in street clothes for release. Guereca-Lizarraga’s attorney told the court he’s currently being held in immigration detention in Aurora. He pleaded not guilty.

A few weeks later, on Aug. 12, ICE agents claimed they were assaulted by Nelson Monjarrez Mejia. No other details of the encounter are publicly known. A grand jury returned an indictment a month later for Mejia on the assault charge, but Starnella again denied the government’s request for a detention hearing.

Mejia pleaded not guilty, and the judge also released him from jail to await trial.

Denver immigration attorney Christine Hernandez said there is a credibility cost for federal law enforcement in exaggerating facts.

Just this year, she has represented people where judges ask for evidence on links to gang affiliations and other stated facts and the prosecutors can’t furnish it.

“We’ve never seen this before,” Hernandez said. “You don’t know what the government is going to say. A lot of times, they don’t have evidence, they don’t present evidence to back up the charging document. You’re supposed to have your evidence in place. That’s their job. And it’s not happening.”

Hernandez worries about the younger generation of Americans who are witnessing it all.

“We’re creating a whole generation of U.S. citizens who are watching their parents be mistreated in this administration,” she said. “And you’re creating a whole generation … U.S. citizens … of young people who don’t trust law enforcement and don’t respect law enforcement.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/250205-CEDAR-RUN-APARTMENTS-WASH-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 00:57:09.625392

The judge in Baltimore on Wednesday rejected an application to reopen Abrego Garcia’s 2019 asylum case, but that is not the final word. Abrego Garcia has 30 days to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

The Salvadoran national has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the United States illegally as a teenager. In 2019, he was arrested by immigration agents. He requested asylum but was not eligible because he had been in the U.S. for more than a year. But the judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador, where he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family.

He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by President Donald Trump‘s administration in March and was held in a notorious prison, and his case soon became a rallying point for those who oppose the Republican president’s immigration crackdown. Facing a ruling from the Supreme Court, the administration returned him to the U.S. in June, only to immediately charge him with human smuggling.

Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges in Tennessee, based on a 2022 traffic stop. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is also seeking to deport him to a third country, proposing Uganda first and then Eswatini, a small country in southern Africa where the king still holds absolute power. His attorneys have denounced the criminal charges and the deportation efforts, saying they are an attempt to punish him for standing up to the administration.

Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case is a calculated risk. If approved, asylum could provide him with a green card and a path to citizenship. But if he loses, an immigration judge could remove his protection from being returned to his native country. That could place him back in the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. It’s where, he alleges in a lawsuit, he suffered severe beatings, sleep deprivation and psychological torture. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has denied those allegations.

Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Abrego Garcia, repeatedly referring to him as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

His lawyers have filed motions requesting a gag order and say he will not be able to receive a fair trial because of the “highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements” made about him.

While the federal judge in Tennessee can order prosecutors there not to make any prejudicial statements about Abrego Garcia, it is unclear whether the judge’s authority extends to the Department of Homeland Security, which posted about the immigration court ruling on X on Wednesday.

“His lawyers tried to fight his removal from the U.S. but one thing is certain, this Salvadoran man is not going to be able to remain in our country,” according to the post.

For more than two decades, Parliament has systematically overridden High Court decisions protecting individual rights, from migration law to anti-terrorism legislation. The recent legislative response to the case known as the NZYQ decision – which struck down indefinite immigration detention as unconstitutional – represents a dangerous escalation that creates a template for undermining democratic governance worldwide.

This pattern represents more than domestic policy disputes. It reveals a fundamental flaw in Australia’s constitutional architecture that authoritarian leaders could exploit to justify their own attacks on judicial independence.

The Constitutional cat-and-mouse game

Australia’s parliamentary override operates through a sophisticated legal mechanism that circumvents judicial protection without technically violating constitutional principles. When the High Court rules legislation unconstitutional, Parliament doesn’t change the Constitution – it cannot, as constitutional amendments require referendum under Section 128. Instead, Parliament changes the statute itself, creating new legal frameworks that achieve identical practical outcomes while claiming technical compliance with constitutional limits.

This “cat-and-mouse game” works because Australia’s Westminster system fuses executive and legislative power, enabling rapid statutory responses to judicial decisions. The High Court only examines legislation when specifically challenged in court, meaning Parliament can pass substantially similar laws that take months or years to challenge again. During this litigation period, the government achieves practical override of judicial protection.

The 2023–25 immigration detention cycle demonstrates this mechanism. After NZYQ vs Minister for Immigration ruled indefinite detention unconstitutional, Parliament immediately passed harsh monitoring conditions. When the High Court struck those down in YBFZ vs Minister as punitive, Parliament introduced the “Anti-Fairness Bill” that retrospectively validates decisions NZYQ rendered unlawful.

What makes Australia unique

Australia maintains the dubious honour of being the sole liberal democracy without a national bill of rights. This creates vulnerabilities distinguishing Australia from other parliamentary sovereignty systems. While the United Kingdom and New Zealand maintain statutory bills that their parliaments can override, these require compatibility statements and incompatibility declarations, creating political costs. Australia’s protections, by contrast, rest on fragile common law presumptions, five express constitutional rights, and one implied right. These have proven inadequate against retrospective legislation, leaving rights exposed to systematic parliamentary nullification without democratic debate.

While Canada’s “notwithstanding clause” allows similar overrides, it requires explicit political justification and expires automatically after five years. The UK’s Human Rights Act requires compatibility statements before passing potentially incompatible legislation.

Australia’s system operates through stealth – achieving override through technical statutory amendments without transparent democratic debate. This reflects what legal scholar Samuel Naylor identifies as a “deficit of constitutional culture” in Australia’s response to judicial decisions.

The Australian Human Rights Commission has documented this pattern, noting that government “routinely returns to Parliament to amend the law to permit what the Court has determined to be unlawful” across multiple policy areas beyond immigration.

Regional and global implications

Australia’s constitutional vulnerability creates diplomatic contradictions that undermine democratic norms regionally. It is a systemic flaw with foreign policy implications.

The international community must recognise that threats to democracy come not only from obvious authoritarians but from constitutional vulnerabilities in established democracies.

When Australia advocates for judicial independence in ASEAN nations, for example, while maintaining constitutional arrangements at home that permit routine legislative override of court decisions, it creates a fundamental credibility gap.

This matters particularly in contexts where Australia criticises authoritarian practices. Myanmar’s military leadership and Cambodia’s ruling party face international pressure for ignoring court decisions and manipulating legal frameworks. Australia’s systematic override mechanism provides a constitutional template that, while technically democratic, achieves similar practical nullification of judicial protection.

The concern isn’t that authoritarian leaders explicitly cite Australia’s example – it’s that Australia’s constitutional arrangements legitimate the principle that legislative or executive majorities in parliamentary systems can systematically circumvent judicial protection of individual rights.

The migration law laboratory

Immigration law serves as Australia’s constitutional laboratory for testing override mechanisms. Since 2001, Parliament has responded to adverse High Court decisions with increasingly sophisticated statutory workarounds. The Al-Kateb vs Godwin decision normalised indefinite detention until NZYQ reversed it. Parliament’s response cycle – immediate legislative override, court challenge, refined legislative response – has become institutionalised.

The Anti-Fairness Bill represents the most comprehensive override yet attempted, retrospectively validating government decisions made under invalid legal frameworks. This creates precedent for parliamentary nullification of judicial decisions across policy areas, from environmental law to civil liberties.

Policy implications

Australia needs constitutional reform before this template spreads. Three immediate steps could limit the damage.

First, Parliament should adopt procedural safeguards requiring compatibility statements before passing potentially unconstitutional legislation. Second, retrospective validation of invalid government decisions should require supermajority approval. Third, Australia needs serious consideration of legislating a national Human Rights Act providing entrenched protection against parliamentary override.

Internationally, Australia’s democratic partners should recognise this constitutional vulnerability when assessing Australia’s credibility on rule-of-law advocacy. Regional institutions such as the East Asia Summit should develop stronger mechanisms for protecting judicial independence that address both authoritarian attacks and democratic erosion.

The broader threat

Australia’s parliamentary override mechanism represents democratic backsliding through constitutional means. Unlike Hungary’s court-packing or Poland’s judicial purges, Australia’s system operates within established democratic procedures while achieving similar practical nullification of judicial oversight.

This makes Australia’s template particularly dangerous – it provides authoritarian movements worldwide with a constitutionally legitimate method for systematically undermining judicial independence. The international community must recognise that threats to democracy come not only from obvious authoritarians but from constitutional vulnerabilities in established democracies.

Australia’s experiment with parliamentary override threatens to become a global precedent for circumventing judicial protection.

The notice, which was obtained by The Times, offered the administration’s legal rationale for three deadly U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea. In an armed conflict, as defined by international law, a country can lawfully kill enemy fighters even when they pose no threat.

In the notice, the Trump administration told Congress that the cartels that are engaged in smuggling drugs are “nonstate armed groups” whose actions “constitute an armed attack against the United States.”

Geoffrey Corn, a retired judge advocate general lawyer who was formerly the Army’s senior adviser for law-of-war issues, said that the actions of the cartels did not meet the standard for “hostilities.” He described Trump’s move as an “abuse” that crossed a major legal line.

Trump promised cuts to ‘Democrat agencies’

The president described the ongoing government shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to enact sweeping cuts to the federal government. He said today that he would meet with his budget chief to determine which “Democrat agencies” he could try to cut.

The White House press secretary also said that it was “likely” the government could shed workers by the “thousands” if the shutdown continues. Still, Democrats showed little sign of budging from their demand for Republican concessions on health care in exchange for their vote to fund the government.

An attacker killed 2 at a British synagogue on Yom Kippur

A man attacked a synagogue in Manchester, England, today, using a car and a knife to kill two people and injure four others on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The police said they shot and killed the man minutes after he began his assault, which the country’s counterterrorism police formally labeled an act of terrorism.

The police identified the attacker as Jihad al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent. The attack came at a time of rising antisemitism around the world and in Britain. Here’s what we know about what happened.

Now, as his starring performance in “Roofman” arrives in theaters, he told our culture reporter Kyle Buchanan that he finally feels like he can hold his own. “For the very first time in my life,” Tatum said, “I feel like I could sit across from even the most beautifully trained British actor and go toe-to-toe with them and not feel like I’m apologizing as I’m acting with them.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/multimedia/02evening-nl-lede-ktqv/02evening-nl-lede-ktqv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 00:56:56.858620

The funds came from $150 billion Congress funneled to the Federal Emergency Management Agency this year to assist with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration sought federal money to cover the costs of Alligator Alcatraz, which is in the Everglades. The state opened another immigrant-detention center in Baker County last month.

The Everglades facility, which began accepting detainees in July, has sparked legal challenges. One of the lawsuits alleges that state and federal officials failed to comply with a federal law requiring an environmental-impact study before the facility could be constructed.

A key issue in the case has been a contention by DeSantis and federal officials that an environmental-impact study was not necessary because the site was being operated by the state and its contractors.

But Elise Bennett, a lawyer who is the Florida and Caribbean director at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the state’s receipt of the federal money “the smoking gun proving that our lawsuit challenging Alligator Alcatraz is entirely correct.”

Local

The detention center is a “federal project being built with federal funds that’s required by federal law to go through a complete environmental review,” she said Thursday in a statement.

The Florida Division of Emergency Management spent about $218 million to erect the facility, which had a capacity for 2,000 people and could be expanded, according to court records.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued an order telling the state to stop bringing in detainees and to wind down operations at the remote facility.

But a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month put Williams’ order on hold and allowed the state to continue using the detention center.

The Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Everglades and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida contend in the lawsuit that the facility, which is surrounded by Big Cypress National Preserve, threatens the environment and wildlife in the area.

But state and federal officials say the facility is adjacent to a decades-old airstrip known as the Collier-Dade Training and Transition Center.

Speaking to reporters last week, DeSantis said federal officials “could do a very quick impact statement” to show that the site was not having a negative effect on the environment, but that a study was not necessary.",https://media.nbcmiami.com/2025/08/deportation-depot-florida.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-02 23:56:21.975370

In an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Bill Melugin, Cammila Wamsley, director of Portland’s ICE office, said the facility has faced violence for more than 100 consecutive nights, with Portland police largely absent under guidance from the mayor and city council.

""I just, I can’t figure out what’s happening at the FDA. I’m totally baffled by it,"" Wamsley said, describing her frustration at seeing federal staff attacked outside the building while officers inside lack jurisdiction to intervene. ""It’s frustrating for us to watch people be attacked on the street and know that we don’t have the authority to be able to really step in unless there’s some nexus to federal law.""

She said nightly protests have escalated beyond chants and signs, with bottle rockets striking the ICE building, rocks shattering windows, lasers targeting officers’ eyes and barricades blocking vehicles.

ANTI-ICE PORTLAND RIOTERS WITH GUILLOTINE CLASH WITH POLICE IN WAR-LIKE SCENES

Wamsley said protesters have followed ICE staff members home and doxxed at least six employees.

""Later, towards the evening and around dark, there are a lot of folks that come up dressed in all black,"" she explained. ""They are here to wreak havoc. They’ll block our cars, throw paint, damage property and even try to follow our folks home.""

She warned that when crowds swell quickly, the violence becomes more dangerous.

""We’ve seen it before. The folks here can go from a crowd of 50 to a crowd of 1,000 in 30 minutes,"" she explained. ""Sometimes we only have 20 officers here. We would not be able to defend the building with that show of force.""

Wamsley said the Portland Police Department has been slow to respond — and sometimes doesn’t respond at all — because of city policy. She explained that assaults have occurred outside and across the street from the building, but police have either taken too long to arrive or not shown up at all.

""That is not the stance they would take six blocks from here, but it is the stance they take with us because of guidance from the mayor and city council,"" Wamsley said.

PORTLAND MAYOR DOUBLES DOWN ON SANCTUARY STATUS AFTER VIOLENT ANTI-ICE RIOT

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Portland mayor’s office and police department for comment.

Still, Wamsley said ICE staff remain committed to their mission despite the unrest.

""The people that work here are here to serve the American public,"" she said. ""They are here to enforce the same immigration laws we’ve had in place since the 1950s. Nothing has changed in that regard. We come to work every day. We do our job the way we have been doing it, and we’ll continue to do that.""

PORTLAND RAMPS UP PRESSURE ON ICE BUILDING WITH LAND USE VIOLATION NOTICE

Todd Rignel, assistant special agent for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Oregon, said federal agencies are targeting Antifa-linked groups they blame for organizing much of the unrest.

""They’re not just facing HSI. They’re facing the FBI, ATF, DEA, IRS — all of these agencies,"" he said. ""That’s a force to be reckoned with.""

""These individuals have caused damage to ICE facilities in Portland and Eugene, Oregon, and engaged in violent confrontations with law enforcement.""
Both the FBI and DHS acknowledge that ""as immigration enforcement operations continue, DHS and the FBI remain concerned there is an increased risk of [domestic violent extremists] and criminal actors conducting targeted attacks on ICE personnel, facilities, or operations, or law enforcement officials supporting immigration enforcement operations.""","The Department of Homeland Security and FBI have issued a joint intelligence bulletin obtained by CBS News that warns of attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel and facilities, including by ""domestic violent extremists"" claiming to respond to immigration enforcement activities.

The memo — circulated to state and local law enforcement nationwide on Wednesday — assesses that since June, extremists in at least three states have conducted targeted, pre-planned violent attacks against ICE personnel and facilities. It says the attacks represent ""an evolution in tactics and an escalation in violence compared to [domestic violent extremists'] past attacks, which primarily resulted in property damage.""

The Trump administration has warned of a surge in threats against ICE agents and facilities in recent months, as immigration arrests and deportations rise. The administration has floated sending personnel from other agencies to guard ICE facilities, and has weighed military deployments to Chicago and Portland, Oregon — drawing stiff opposition from local officials.

Wednesday's memo points to an attack last week in which a gunman identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn fired from the roof of a building into three ICE transport vehicles and windows of a Dallas ICE facility. The attack wounded three detainees, one of whom died at the scene and another of whom succumbed to his injuries six days later.

According to the bulletin, the gunman ""conducted prior surveillance of the ICE facility, enabling him to identify areas where ICE personnel likely would be located."" Authorities say Jahn died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The bulletin also references a Fourth of July attack on the ICE Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, that saw one alleged domestic violent extremist open fire on a local law enforcement officer from a concealed position. The attack occurred around 11 p.m. on the holiday, outside the sprawling ICE detention facility, which houses between 1,000 and 2,000 immigration detainees.

The bulletin says investigators have found the group of people allegedly responsible for the shooting used an identified encrypted communication platform and a local residence to conduct pre-operational planning. ""As of September 2025, the FBI has arrested 20 individuals involved in the Prairieland Detention Center attack, including the alleged gunman and individuals who helped the gunman evade law enforcement after the attack,"" the memo noted.

The bulletin also cites ""additional unplanned, reactive violent attacks that took advantage of First Amendment-protected activity.""

""Since at least June 2025, small groups of threat actors, some of whom are [domestic violent extremists], have leveraged large, lawful protests in the Los Angeles, California area and in multiple cities in Oregon to engage in violent activity targeting ICE property,"" the report indicated. ""These individuals have caused damage to ICE facilities in Portland and Eugene, Oregon, and engaged in violent confrontations with law enforcement.""

The bulletin advised state and local law enforcement to ""remain vigilant to detect, prevent, or respond to [domestic violent extremist] incidents targeting ICE personnel or facilities in the United States.""

The FBI and DHS define a domestic violent extremist as ""an individual based and operating primarily within the United States or its own territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or other foreign power who seeks to further political or social goals wholly or in part through unlawful acts of force or violence.""

But the federal law enforcement agencies also say the ""mere advocacy of political or social positions, political activism, use of strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics does not constitute extremism and may be constitutionally protected.""

ICE says law enforcement officials within the agency have faced a 1,000% increase in assaults against them since the beginning of the Trump administration, as President Trump looks to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests.

The administration has vowed to crack down on threats against ICE, with Attorney General Pam Bondi directing personnel from the FBI and other Justice Department law enforcement agencies to assist with guarding immigration facilities earlier this week. Mr. Trump has said he will send military personnel to Portland, Oregon, to guard federal facilities, and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday he learned of a similar planned military deployment in his state. State officials decried the plans, with Pritzker accusing Mr. Trump of ""sowing fear and intimidation and division among Americans."" Oregon is challenging the planned deployment in court.

And last week, Mr. Trump directed law enforcement agencies to investigate ""domestic terrorism and organized political violence."" Bondi directed regional Joint Terrorism Task Forces to look into ""repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents.""

The president has blamed some of the threats against ICE on antifa, which he labeled a domestic terrorist organization. Legal experts say that move could face legal impediments since antifa is generally regarded as a loose affiliation of left-wing activists, not a centralized organization, and domestic terrorism isn't a chargeable offense under federal law.

Both the FBI and DHS acknowledge that ""as immigration enforcement operations continue, DHS and the FBI remain concerned there is an increased risk of [domestic violent extremists] and criminal actors conducting targeted attacks on ICE personnel, facilities, or operations, or law enforcement officials supporting immigration enforcement operations."" It notes that extremists will likely ""continue to view ICE enforcement operations as opportune targets for violence in furtherance of their political and social goals.""

""Due to the highly personal nature of radicalization and mobilization to violence, it can be challenging to identify specific indicators of US violent extremists' intent to commit violence,"" the memo concedes.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/25/083ab2bb-4936-48ac-aa52-0f594df779ef/thumbnail/1200x630/ba889e5a6e22745341813ad5d407b2f4/ice2.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 01:56:53.036683

What happens in a U.S. government shutdown?

When Congress doesn’t pass the spending bills needed to fund government operations, many federal agencies are forced to stop or reduce their work. Non-essential programs stop and thousands of federal workers are furloughed (sent home without pay). Essential services such as Social Security, the military, air traffic control and border security continue to operate, but often without pay until federal funding is restored.

How will labor be affected during the shutdown?

During the shutdown, the Department of Labor (DOL) halts its role in employment-based immigration cases. Among other changes, that means:

Please check your email for further instructions.

The Labor Condition Applications (LCAs), prevailing wage determinations and permanent labor certifications (PERM) are not processed.

The Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system goes offline.

Because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) decisions often depend on DOL certifications, many petitions stall even if USCIS remains funded.

Is E-verify also affected?

Yes. E-Verify, the electronic verification system that employers use to check work eligibility is suspended during a shutdown. That means employers in states that require E-Verify must use alternate I-9 document review procedures.

Are immigration courts still operating?

Partly. Generally, detained docket cases continue because they’re considered essential. But non-detained cases (those involving people not in custody) are typically postponed and hearings are rescheduled once funding returns. This means hearings could be delayed for months.

As of the end of August 2025, there was a national backlog of 3,432,519 pending cases before the Immigration Court and 2025, 2,271,857 asylum applicants were awaiting hearings or decisions.

What about border enforcement?

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staff continue to perform essential national security duties, border inspection, and enforcement tasks, meaning that most of their staff and operations are retained and active during a shutdown.

Will visas and passports still be processed?

Because the Department of State and consular operations depend in part on fee revenues from visa and passport services, these offices may continue working, at least in the short term. But if the shutdown lasts for an extended period of time, consulates or domestic passport offices might slow down or limit their services.

In a press release, The Legal Aid Society estimates that most applications submitted to USCIS will be paused. According to the American Immigration Council, since State Department visa processing and consular services are funded mainly by fees, they typically continue to operate during government shutdowns.

How will services like Social Security and SNAP be affected?

The Legal Aid Society states that benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Cash Assistance, SNAP (Food Stamps), FHEPS, CityFHEPS, and Section 8 will remain unaffected through at least October. New Yorkers will continue to receive these benefits without interruption.

How are immigrants in New York affected?

The immigrant population in New York may see immediate impacts of the shut down including postponed court hearings, limited legal aid and travel complications. More specifically, that might take the form of:

Backlog increases in employment-based cases

For immigrants in New York applying for visas or green cards that require a DOL certification (common in H-1B, EB-2, EB-3 categories), the shutdown will put a stop to those services and petitions may linger in limbo. New York employers hiring foreign nationals could also face delays or temporary hiring freezes.

Asylum and court cases stall

Non-detained immigration court hearings in New York could be postponed. Immigrants waiting for hearings may receive new notices months later. The detained docket for people in custody is more likely to proceed.

Strain on legal service providers

In New York, nonprofit legal aid organizations and immigrant rights groups often rely on federal grants or contracts. However, city and state programs may fill some gaps. New York City and New York State provide immigrant legal aid, health services and “Know Your Rights” clinics. These programs may soften the shutdown’s impact but could face increased demand and limited budgets.

New York State allocated $64.2 million for immigration legal services in fiscal year 2026, while New York City programmed more than $74 million for citywide immigrant legal support.

Travel complications

Immigrants in New York who need to travel abroad may also be affected if their return depends on obtaining a new visa stamp, as consulates are operating at reduced capacity.",https://bunny-wp-pullzone-0pcifvcfq2.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/shutterstock_1719774118-jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-02 22:57:34.534686

The Society of Professional Journalists strongly condemns recent attacks by federal agents on journalists reporting on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity and protests around the country.

“These shocking assaults reflect an alarming escalation in efforts by government officials to thwart journalists reporting on highly newsworthy events,” said Emily Bloch, SPJ president. Her comments came as representatives of SPJ’s chapters in New York City and Chicago forcefully denounced ongoing attacks on journalists.

In the past few days alone, ICE agents have subjected multiple journalists to abuse while covering immigration proceedings and demonstrations. Just yesterday, ICE agents got physical with journalists covering immigration hearings at a New York City courthouse, sending Turkish journalist L. Vural Elibol to the hospital for head trauma after they pushed him to the ground.

Journalists in Chicago also reported abuse from the immigration officers over the weekend. On Sept. 29, ICE agents shot journalists covering a demonstration at the facility in Broadview, Illinois, with rubber projectiles and chemical agents. Agents also arrested reporter Steve Held, who was released later that night. The next day, ICE agents shot a chemical weapon at reporter Asal Rezaei’s car while parked outside the Broadview facility on assignment, causing Rezaei to vomit and experience burning sensations.

“After seeing working Chicago journalists detained for hours and hit with tear gas and other chemical agents while doing their jobs covering ongoing protests, we condemn the targeting of journalists by federal agents,” said Jeff Arnold, president of the Chicago Headline Club. “Journalists working to accurately report what is happening in their communities should not fear going to work despite the dangerous rhetoric coming from the Trump administration that is being directed at members of the press for reporting on what they encounter.”

These actions from ICE agents are the latest incidents in the continuing trend of mistreatment and hostility toward journalists from the federal government.

“The efforts by the Trump Administration to police constitutionally guaranteed free speech and the activities of journalists have crossed a red line and entered a danger zone for democracy,” The Deadline Club Board of Governors wrote in a statement on recent attacks on press freedom. “The threats and promised retaliation, even obstruction of the indispensable role our media play in providing free, fair and unchallenged windows on the world must not be allowed to proceed further. As the Framers of the Bill of Rights understood so deeply, freedom of speech and the press are prerequisites for a functioning democracy. The Deadline Club of New York deplores all such actions.”

SPJ stands with Elibol, Held, Rezaei and other reporters doing their jobs.

“Each of these attacks is completely unacceptable and reflects serious infringement of both journalists’ right to engage in protected press activity and the public’s right to be informed about the government’s actions,” said SPJ Press Freedom Strategist Anne Marie Tamburro.

""Apple has claimed they received information from law enforcement that ICEBlock served to harm law enforcement officers.","FIRST ON FOX: Apple dropped ICEBlock, a widely used tracking tool, from its App Store Thursday after the Department of Justice raised concerns with the big tech giant that the app put law enforcement officers at risk.

DOJ officials, at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi, asked Apple to take down ICEBlock, a move that comes as Trump administration officials have claimed the tool, which allows users to anonymously report ICE agents' presence, puts agents in danger and helps shield illegal immigrants.

""We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so,"" Bondi said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed,"" Bondi added. ""This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.""

BONDI DECLARES ‘NEW ERA’ OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AS FEDERAL AGENTS DEPLOY TO ICE FACILITIES NATIONWIDE

Controversy surrounding ICE tracking apps intensified after last month’s deadly shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas, Texas, the latest in a series of attacks that appeared to be targeting immigration enforcement officers.

Authorities said the suspect, Joshua Jahn, searched his phone for tracking apps, including ICEBlock, before opening fire on the facility from a rooftop. Authorities said Jahn killed one detainee and left two critically injured but that the personnel were his intended targets, not the immigrants. One of the injured, a 32-year-old husband and father of four, died this week.

Marcos Charles, an acting director for ICE’s removal operations, said during a press conference that Jahn had intended to murder ICE employees and that attacks on them have skyrocketed.

""The evidence is clear that this was intended as an assault on ICE personnel who come to work everyday to do their job,"" Charles said. ""Violent rhetoric has led to an over 1000% increase in assaults on ICE officers, and it has to stop.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Apple and ICEBlock for comment.

Apple said in a statement it removed ICEBlock and other apps like it.

""We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store,"" Apple said.

Joshua Aaron, ICEBlock's creator, said he was ""incredibly disappointed by Apple's actions today.""

""Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move,"" Aaron said. ""Apple has claimed they received information from law enforcement that ICEBlock served to harm law enforcement officers. This is patently false.""

“If you are here in West Virginia illegally, you’re not welcome here,” said Col. Jim Mitchell, WVSP superintendent, at the state Capitol on Thursday.
At a press conference, Morrisey announced the additional arrest of undocumented immigrants at traffic stops along the West Virginia Turnpike and DUI checkpoints.
Earlier this year, Morrisey issued an executive order directing the West Virginia Department of Home Security, state police and the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation to fully cooperate with ICE.

“If you are here in West Virginia illegally, you’re not welcome here,” said Col. Jim Mitchell, WVSP superintendent, at the state Capitol on Thursday. “We value the dignity of every human being, but we want you here legally.”

Gov. Patrick Morrisey is vigorously supporting President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, partnering with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for its 287(g) program that gives specially-trained police officers and National Guard members the authority to make certain immigration arrests.

At a press conference, Morrisey announced the additional arrest of undocumented immigrants at traffic stops along the West Virginia Turnpike and DUI checkpoints.

“These arrests happened in just 11 days,” Morrisey said. “This is proof that the problem is far more widespread than some want to admit.”

“I do expect more will be coming,” he added. “We’re going to take any legal action necessary to protect the residents of our state from illegal aliens and the drug trade.”

Morrisey said some of the individuals apprehended were previously charged with crimes. Newly-released ICE data showed immigrants with no criminal record were now the largest group in the country’s immigration detention centers.

The state’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation has also been involved in Morrisey’s partnership with ICE, and since the beginning of this year, more than 1,000 immigrant detainees have been booked through the state’s correctional system. They’re usually held in the state’s jails for up to 12 weeks.

Three of the state’s jails are renting beds to ICE for $90 a day for immigrant detainees from around the country. From June 2024 to July of this year, the state billed ICE for a total of $339,615.

Earlier this year, Morrisey issued an executive order directing the West Virginia Department of Home Security, state police and the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation to fully cooperate with ICE.

The governor also announced that state police on Sept. 10 conducted one of the largest fentanyl seizures in state history in Mercer County. It included 54 pounds of suspected fentanyl and 70 pounds of suspected crystal meth. The estimated street value of the fentanyl alone is $825,000, according to Morrisey.

The arrests followed a month-long investigation. The governor clarified that the people arrested in this case were not undocumented immigrants.

“We’re going to keep the drugs off our streets. We want to protect people as much as we can,” Morrisey said. “This is a higher priority for this administration than the state’s ever seen.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47659/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/morrisey-202510021759432872.jpg?h=c9f93661&itok=As8QthoF,N,,2025-10-02 22:57:06.807925

The agency touted 900 arrests in a social media post accompanied by a one-minute video showing federal agents conducting a nighttime raid on a South Shore residential building this week that resulted in 37 arrests of people who are accused of being “involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes and immigration violators,” according to DHS.

But DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have shared few details on the arrests, making it difficult to independently verify some of the alleged crimes. The limited information has spurred immigrant rights activists to create their own public dashboard showing who is being detained by federal authorities.

Since Sept. 8, the federal government rolled out an aggressive deportation campaign called “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs. The National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois are challenging the arrests in federal court, arguing that at least 27 of the arrests were done so without warrants or probable cause and in violation of an existing consent decree. At least three U.S. citizens were among those arrested in recent weeks, according to the civil rights groups.

A top U.S. Border Patrol official who has been leading the arrests told WBEZ the agents were arresting people based on “how they look.”

In South Shore this week, federal agents approached or entered nearly every apartment in a five-story building that was raided, and U.S. citizens were among those detained for hours, residents and witnesses told the Sun-Times.

So far, federal officials have named about 50 people arrested in recent weeks, typically through social media posts and press releases highlighting their criminal backgrounds. The list includes a man convicted of murder and a least three others convicted of sexual assault or domestic battery charges.

But several others arrested have only been accused of entering the country illegally.

About half of the names and alleged charges released by DHS couldn’t be definitively matched to court records.

At least two of the men, and apparently a third, were detained outside of Illinois.

In response to requests for comment and a more detailed breakdown of the arrests showing how many were targeted and how many have criminal records, a DHS spokesperson provided only the news release from Wednesday announcing the more than 800 arrests.

Immigration arrests dashboard unveiled Thursday

The public dashboard of immigration arrests, announced Thursday by The Resurrection Project, will be updated weekly on the organization’s website. It aims to catalog immigrant arrests and deportations that the federal government is no longer sharing.

The dashboard shows that calls to immigrant legal assistance hotlines more than doubled in September, when DHS increased immigrant enforcement in the Chicago area.

The federal government used to share data about who was arrested by ICE, says Eréndira Rendón, vice president of immigrant justice for The Resurrection Project. But those public dashboards were scrubbed from the internet when President Donald Trump took office this year, Rendón said.

“We’re trying to keep record of what’s happening in our communities,” Rendon told reporters Thursday. “These dashboards make it clear: Immigrants, particularly Latinos, are under attack.”

Of the 121 hotline calls taken in the last week of September, the vast majority of calls were for families from Mexico, followed by those from Venezuela. Most referrals came from people living in Chicago, with others coming from Cicero, Aurora, Calumet City and Elgin. The data also shows that immigration officials are arresting more people who have been in the U.S. for 2 to 5 years.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d818e7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3424+0+289/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2Fb2%2F3ada962a49d3a49e11a251dfc6ed%2Ficedetention-060725-16.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 22:57:25.437818

In terms of international law, the U.S. has no binding obligation to shelter Cameroonians through TPS.
Cameroon’s Anglophone regions have endured an armed conflict since 2017; bombings and ambushes are still occurring.
The humanitarian crisis in Cameroon is not over, it is ongoing, even if it has slipped from headlines.
TPS was meant to be that ladder: a temporary refuge that recognizes danger and refuses to push people back into it.","I’m writing as someone who has lived the story we too often file under a tidy word: migration. But there is a difference between choosing to move and being pushed out by violence, state repression, or fear. While both involve a decision about whether to stay or go, one is deliberate and planned; the other is sudden and forced. That difference matters right now because it has been just a month since the United States ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Cameroonians, effective August 4, 2025—a decision published in the Federal Register and confirmed by USCIS notices.

For those who may not know this small country on the Gulf of Guinea and the nearly decade-old socio-political crisis it faces, let me explain. Cameroon’s current turmoil began in late 2016, when lawyers and teachers in the Anglophone regions protested government marginalization. What began as peaceful demonstrations was met with violent crackdowns. By 2017, armed separatist groups had formed, government forces retaliated, and the conflict escalated into what is now known as the Anglophone Crisis. Since then, villages have been burned, schools attacked, and more than one million Cameroonians displaced inside the country, with hundreds of thousands more fleeing across borders.

So why should the United States care? Honestly, it doesn’t have to. In terms of international law, the U.S. has no binding obligation to shelter Cameroonians through TPS. But when Congress created the program in the Immigration Act of 1990, it wasn’t just a bureaucratic tool, it was a commitment. TPS was designed for exactly the kind of instability Cameroonians face today. It is not a loophole, nor a hidden pathway to a green card. It is a humanitarian pause button. It signals a simple principle: we will not force people to return to a country in the middle of a crisis.

The Department of Homeland Security recognized this in 2023, when it extended Cameroon’s TPS designation through June 7, 2025, citing ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary humanitarian need. Yet in June 2025, DHS announced in the Federal Register that it would terminate TPS for Cameroon, effective August 4, giving only a 60-day wind-down. Overnight, thousands of people lost the ability to work lawfully, renew a driver’s license, or live without fear of deportation. If the policy goal is “order,” then ending TPS this way has chosen chaos instead. It pushes people who were visible; working, paying taxes, raising families, back into the shadows, where exploitation is easier and community ties are harder to sustain.

The timing couldn’t have been worse. Cameroon’s Anglophone regions have endured an armed conflict since 2017; bombings and ambushes are still occurring. On September 7, a separatist roadside attack killed seven soldiers in the Southwest. One of many reminders that violence has not ended simply because the calendar has turned. Elections often spike risk, and this year’s presidential vote is set for October 12, 2025. The humanitarian toll is staggering. Cameroon hosts more than 1.5 million people forcibly displaced: over one million internally displaced, plus hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers. It’s worthy to note there is no plan of integration or reintegration by the Cameroonian government. In the North-West and South-West regions alone, OCHA counted hundreds of thousands of IDPs this spring. So why punish those who managed to flee? Why strip protection from Cameroonians in the U.S. while their compatriots remain trapped in humanitarian marginalization, even in the capital city?

Here’s the practical fallout of ending TPS without a bridge:

Legal limbo. People who’ve been working, paying taxes, and building community lose work authorization. Many will not “self-deport” into an active conflict; they will be pushed into the shadows, easier to exploit.

Return risk is real. People are not repatriated to a stable arena; we are funneling them back during an election season that historically invites intimidation and violence, layered onto a long-running insurgency.

De facto statelessness. TPS holders do not lose their Cameroonian nationality on paper. But when you cannot safely return and you are stripped of lawful presence and work here, you are functionally without a state’s protection. That is a policy-made vulnerability, not a natural disaster.

I know someone will say, “But TPS is temporary.” True! The “T” has never been in dispute. The real question is whether ending it now, in the middle of mass displacement, on the eve of an election could inflame tensions, and while armed conflict is still ongoing aligns with U.S. interests or values. If the goal is deterrence, this is a blunt instrument aimed at the wrong target. People fleeing violence don’t run cost-benefit analyses; they run.

So let’s bring back the ladder for people who have been forced to run. The humanitarian crisis in Cameroon is not over, it is ongoing, even if it has slipped from headlines. TPS was meant to be that ladder: a temporary refuge that recognizes danger and refuses to push people back into it. Removing it now doesn’t restore order; it pulls the ladder away while people are still climbing.

If you want to understand what this crisis feels like on the ground, listen directly to those living it. On my website, MukumSteven.com, you can watch interviews with internally displaced women from Cameroon who share the daily pain of being unable to return home.

The text reads:

Regarding the Sept. 22 news article “Bribery probe of border czar was shut down”:

The Trump administration would have you believe border czar Tom Homan didn’t do anything wrong when, according to The Post’s reporting, he was caught on tape accepting $50,000 in cash in exchange for helping “businessmen” land contracts related to immigration enforcement. The businessmen were really undercover FBI agents.

But this would be just the clumsiest example of alleged self-dealing we’ve seen underlying the massive expansion of immigration detention. For years, top leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement have arranged contracts with private prison companies before leaving government to work at those companies, profiting handsomely from the taxpayer dollars.

Recently, the Justice Department reinterpreted long-standing immigration laws to require the detention of millions more people, inflating demand for detention centers. And days after Congress approved a record-breaking $45 billion to expand its deportation and detention dragnet, private prison executives raised their compensation and bonuses.

The federal government is also axing sensible cost savings on immigration enforcement. This year, the Trump administration terminated a cheaper-than-detention program with a 100 percent success rate of guaranteeing appearance in immigration court through referrals to legal and social services.

When approached by ICE law enforcement officers, Rodriguez-Torres voluntarily told them he was from Mexico, tensed up and dropped to the ground. While on the ground, officers observed a sheathed knife hanging from his waist and he was taken into custody. During a subsequent search, officers found a glass pipe typically used to smoke crack cocaine in his pocket.

“A criminal illegal alien—released by the Biden Administration and previously removed four times—armed with a knife in a restricted parking lot outside of an ICE office in Houston,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “These are the types of threats and risks our officers face every single day as they work to remove the worst of the worst.

St. Louis and more than 900 desperate Jewish refugees aboard the ship, sending them back to their fates in Europe. Hundreds of rejected passengers were murdered by the Nazis.

America was not alone in its shame for denying safe harbor to refugees from Nazism and fascism during World War II.

The land of the free is now admitting refugees based on the whimsical political favor of the president, as opposed to the severity of their personal circumstances.

Thus, following the Allied victory and the world’s reckoning with the horrors of the war and the Holocaust, the free nations came together and created an international framework for the treatment of refugees and people seeking asylum from oppressive governments. Here in America, we redeemed the visionary promise Tom Paine had made when he said America would become “an asylum to humanity.”

But now our decades-old program for the admission and resettlement of refugees to America has ground to a halt under President Donald Trump. One of his first orders in office was a 90-day pause on the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program — a three-month pause that is still going strong eight months later.

The results of this interruption have been shocking. Nearly 130,000 people who were found to have a credible fear of persecution in their homelands — and have also met the rigorous vetting requirements of our refugee program — have been left waiting endlessly to be admitted.

After proving to our government that their lives, families and livelihoods would be in danger if they were forced to return to their authoritarian societies — everywhere from Afghanistan to China to Russia to Saudi Arabia to Venezuela — they were given the promise of safety and a new life in America. Only now, that promise has been cruelly snatched away. They hang in limbo because they have been granted refugee status — but given no opportunity to enter the country.

More than 12,000 of the approved refugees already had flights to America booked in the weeks following President Trump’s inauguration but were told by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and the Trump administration that they were no longer welcome, so long as the MAGA “pause” was in effect.

But there is clearly room at the inn. While these fully vetted and approved Americans-in-waiting languish in depressing and often dangerous refugee camps around the world, President Trump has warmly invited planeloads of Afrikaners, white South African farmers, to skip the line entirely and come to America overnight as “refugees” — even as the ban on other lawfully designated and demonstrably imperiled refugees remains in effect.

The land of the free is now admitting refugees based on the whimsical political favor of the president, as opposed to the severity of their personal circumstances.

The administration is also breaking the law to mask these ugly facts. Under the law, by Sept. 30, the administration must consult with Congress about the number and types of refugees it plans to admit during the next year. But Sept. 30 came and went, and no consultation has even been scheduled. All signs suggest that the administration will continue to welcome Afrikaners, upending the essential principles of the refugee program, while keeping tens of thousands of lawfully designated refugees trapped abroad — where they face serious ongoing threats of persecution and violence.

These policies are not only a profound hardship and danger for refugee families. They are a loss for all Americans.

Refugees — people like Albert Einstein, Madeleine Albright, Gloria Estefan, Sergey Brin and Jan Koum — make America stronger, more creative and more prosperous.

This is because D.C. Courts will continue case resolution activities in all divisions and in the Family Court of the Superior Court and appeals in the Court of Appeals.
Additionally, juvenile probation services provided by the Social Services Division will continue during the shutdown.","When the government shuts down, certain limitations are placed on D.C.’s courts. Here’s a list of what to know about court operations:

Litigation

According to a contingency plan posted to the U.S. Department of Justice’s website, criminal litigation will continue without interruption. That’s because criminal litigation is considered an activity essential to the safety of human life and the protection of property.

Alternatively, civil litigation will be postponed “to the extent that this can be done without compromising to a significant degree the safety of human life or the protection of property,” the plan states. Under this rule, litigators must make a request to the courts that active cases be postponed until funding becomes available. The court has the power to deny those requests.

Receipt of summonses, pleadings and motions by mail may also be delayed during the shutdown.

Immigration

Due to President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency citing the threat to the national security and economy of the U.S. caused by illegal immigration, staff with the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review are listed in the DOJ’s contingency plan as excepted from furloughs during the shutdown. According to the DOJ, “EOIR currently has a backlog approaching four million cases which would be greatly exacerbated during a shutdown absent excepted activities.”

Executive Office for Immigration Review court staff include administrative oversight and support staff, who are needed to process immigration cases and appeals involving detained respondents

According to the American Immigration Council, immigrant application interviews, naturalization ceremonies, biometrics processing and similar parts of the legal immigration system should remain unchanged during a shutdown. That’s because U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is almost entirely funded by fees paid by immigrants, U.S. citizens and employers paying for applications.

Marriage

A message on the D.C. Courts website states that the issuing of marriage licenses and performing marriage ceremonies will cease during the lapse, but staff will continue to issue certified copies of vital records, including marriage certificates.

During the last government shutdown, Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the “Let Our Vows Endure Emergency Act of 2019” or the LOVE act, a bill introduced by the D.C. Council that gave the mayor authority to issue marriage licenses and authorize officiants. That act has since expired, but in an email to WTOP, Bowser’s office confirmed she would sign it again if the council passes a similar act during this shutdown.

Jury duty and juvenile probation services

Jury duty is still on! Also, according to the D.C. Courts website, during the government shutdown, all jurors should report to court according to their jurors summons. This is because D.C. Courts will continue case resolution activities in all divisions and in the Family Court of the Superior Court and appeals in the Court of Appeals. Additionally, juvenile probation services provided by the Social Services Division will continue during the shutdown.

Shortly after, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, signaled anew that Mr. Trump is eyeing another round of mass federal layoffs.
The comments from Mr. Trump and his top aides underscored their desire to take advantage of the governmentwide closure, which began at midnight on Wednesday.
Taken together, the administration’s actions laid bare the risks and consequences of a protracted fiscal stalemate under Mr. Trump.
The White House also laid the groundwork to fulfill the president’s threats to oust more government employees.","In its Wednesday announcement, the Energy Department did not specify which projects would see their funding terminated. But according to an agency document reviewed by The New York Times, the list of affected projects include major upgrades to electrical grids in California, Minnesota and Oregon; efforts to reduce methane leaks from oil and gas operations in Colorado; and large hubs to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuels in California and the Pacific Northwest.

The vast majority of the 321 canceled awards would have gone toward projects in those states as well as Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Mexico, New York and Washington, the document showed. Those states all have Democratic governors and senators.

In a news release, the Energy Department said it had determined that the projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The agency said that recipients would have 30 days to appeal any terminations. If those appeals are unsuccessful, the recipients could potentially sue the Energy Department, much as award cancellations by the Environmental Protection Agency have faced legal challenges.

There is no law that allows a federal agency to cancel previously awarded grants during a government shutdown. Companies or universities that receive federal funding typically sign a legally binding agreement and then spend their own money, on the expectation that they will be reimbursed later.

The cancellations appear to have been months in the making. Political appointees at the Energy Department have been reviewing billions of dollars worth of climate and infrastructure spending that was awarded by the Biden administration, claiming that the money was rushed out the door but providing few details about specific problems.

The agency’s announcement met swift condemnation from Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, where one of the projects facing funding cuts was projected to create more than 220,000 jobs. “In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement. “We’ll continue to pursue an all-of-the-above clean-energy strategy that powers our future and cleans the air, no matter what D.C. tries to dictate.”

Before the Energy Department announced the cancellations, Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said in social media posts that they were imminent. “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled,” he wrote on X.

Mr. Vought did not provide details, and the Energy Department did not issue the news release until several hours later. In the meantime, many state officials, members of Congress and energy executives were scrambling on Wednesday to figure out which projects would be affected.

Two of the largest canceled awards would have provided $1.2 billion to projects in California and $1 billion to projects in the Pacific Northwest focused on the production, transportation and storage of clean hydrogen. Hydrogen fuels have the potential to produce steel and fertilizer, or to power trucks, without producing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Congress had authorized roughly $8 billion for so-called hydrogen hubs as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law of 2021. The Biden administration awarded that money to seven hubs across 16 states, although most of the funds had not been spent yet.

None of the hubs in Republican-controlled states such as West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana were affected by the latest round of cancellations.

Greg Keoleian, a professor at the University of Michigan whose research focuses on hydrogen, said the canceled funds would have helped the United States compete with China and Europe, which have more mature hydrogen industries. “We need to be investing in clean energy technologies like hydrogen for global competitiveness,” Dr. Keoleian said.

Chris Green, the president of the Pacific Northwest hydrogen hub, said that “while we are disappointed” in the decision, “our commitment to advancing hydrogen in the Pacific Northwest is unwavering.”

Republican-held states and districts were not entirely spared. The Pacific Northwest hydrogen hub was expected to create jobs in Montana, for instance. Some of the cuts would affect projects in states like Florida, South Carolina and Texas, where a battery factory was being built with help from a $20 million federal grant that is now being canceled.

Financial awards for two dozen projects to upgrade the nation’s electrical grids were also targeted for termination, according to the agency list. That includes $630 million to help upgrade 100 miles of transmission lines in California with advanced conductors that can carry more electrical current, as well as a $250 million grant to strengthen power lines on the Warm Springs Reservation in central Oregon.

Also targeted for cancellation was a $464 million grant awarded to Minnesota to help improve the connections between two large regional electrical grids in the Midwest and Great Plains. That project was aimed at making it easier to add more renewable energy to the grid and reducing the risk of blackouts. Proponents said it would have helped reduce electricity costs across a wide region, including in Republican-led states.

The list of canceled funding also includes $326 million that had been awarded to Colorado State University to reduce leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas, from oil and gas wells. The cancellations would also affect more than $350 million in awards to the Gas Technology Institute in Illinois, which works on reducing emissions from methane, hydrogen and other technologies.

The Energy Department also canceled funding for projects to reduce emissions from cement production and to develop technology that traps and buries carbon dioxide from industrial smokestacks before the gas escapes into the atmosphere and heats the planet. Some of those terminations appear to have been previously announced in May.

Democrats are demanding that Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta, negotiate on those terms before they agree to lend their votes to a bill needed to reopen the government.

Given that Congress failed to enact spending bills for the fiscal year that began on Wednesday, an extension is needed to fund the government. Both parties proposed legislation to do so temporarily to buy more time for a deal, but both bills have repeatedly failed to gain the bipartisan backing necessary to move forward in the Senate.

Here is what to know about the dueling proposals.

Republicans want a simple funding patch.

The Republican bill would fund the government largely at current spending levels through Nov. 21. It is known as a clean continuing resolution, or C.R., meaning that it would continue existing funding without any policy add-ons.

The House passed the measure last month, with all but one Democrat opposed. But in the Senate, it needs 60 votes to advance. It has fallen short of that threshold three times, most recently on Wednesday.

Democrats have denounced the measure as “partisan,” because Republicans did not negotiate with them. But unlike many partisan stopgap measures of the past, it does not contain any conservative policy dictates or spending cuts that are considered poison pills by Democrats.

Still, Democrats argue that asking them to supply the votes for a funding extension that does not address their priorities is unreasonable. They are determined to use their leverage in the spending fight to exact concessions from Mr. Trump and Republicans.

Democrats want health care money and guardrails on Trump.

The Democratic measure is also a continuing resolution, which would fund the government through Oct. 31. But it is far from clean. It would tack on more than $1 trillion for health care programs and tie Mr. Trump’s hands with congressionally approved funding.

The bill would permanently extend Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year, and reverse deep cuts to Medicaid enacted over the summer as part of the president’s tax cut law.

Democrats argue that Congress must act urgently to do both. If the Obamacare tax credits lapse, an estimated four million people could lose coverage starting in 2026, and prices would spike for more than 20 million people.

Some Republicans have indicated that they might support extending the Obamacare subsidies at some level. But Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, has insisted he would not do so as part of a stopgap spending bill. He has called Democrats’ attempt to tie the two together a hostage-taking exercise.

Republicans have balked altogether at rolling back the Medicaid cuts, which helped to pay for the large tax cuts they enacted in July. In doing so, the G.O.P. has used a misleading talking point to accuse Democrats of demanding free health care for unauthorized immigrants in exchange for funding the government.

The Democrats’ temporary spending bill contains no such proposal. But because it repeals the Medicaid provisions in Republicans’ tax law, it would undo a provision that reduced, but did not eliminate, the funding that hospitals receive for emergency services provided to certain immigrants, both documented and undocumentd, in states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

Democrats also included language in their stopgap measure that would limit Mr. Trump’s ability to freeze federal funds already approved by Congress and restore money for public radio and television stations that the White House clawed back over the summer.

Both parties want security funding — but disagree on how much.

The two bills both contain spending increases for security for government officials, including members of Congress. But Democrats want to provide far more than Republicans.

Lawmakers have been increasingly concerned about threats after the recent assassinations of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and Melissa Hortman, a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota, who was killed along with her husband in June.

Republicans included $88 million to fortify security for executive branch officials, Supreme Court justices, other federal judges and congressional lawmakers in response to a rise in threats.

Democrats are asking for more. Their bill contains more than $186 million for lawmaker security on Capitol Hill and in local districts, and $140 million for Supreme Court justices and other federal judges. They did not request additional security funds for the executive branch.

Shortly after, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, signaled anew that Mr. Trump is eyeing another round of mass federal layoffs. She told reporters that it was “likely” the government could shed workers by the “thousands” if the shutdown continues, adding that the president would further refine the plan Thursday.

The comments from Mr. Trump and his top aides underscored their desire to take advantage of the governmentwide closure, which began at midnight on Wednesday. Rather than try to broker a resolution, the president has focused on leveraging the standoff, aiming to carry out his long-sought reconfiguration of Washington while inflicting pain on his political adversaries.

“I don’t think it’s unreasonable for the president to use all the levers,” said Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, during an appearance on CNBC on Thursday. He declined to offer specifics about the layoffs or cuts the president was considering. But Mr. Bessent nonetheless acknowledged that a shutdown could hurt the U.S. economy.

On Capitol Hill, senior Democratic lawmakers responded to Mr. Trump’s ultimatums with outrage. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the chamber’s appropriations panel, faulted the White House for using federal workers as bargaining chips, and questioned the legality of any firings conducted while the government remains closed.

“It is unprecedented and irresponsible for the president of the United States to threaten innocent people rather than coming to work with us to negotiate an agreement to get government open,” Ms. Murray said.

On the first day of the shutdown, Mr. Trump and his top aides halted about $26 billion in previously approved funding for infrastructure and green energy projects, primarily in Democratic-run states. The administration appeared to single out New York, a state whose delegation includes Representative Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leaders in the House and Senate.

Mr. Vought also told Republican lawmakers on a call Wednesday that mass layoffs targeting federal workers were imminent, suggesting that the administration could focus on employees who serve in roles that do not comport with the president’s political agenda. Many federal workers are already furloughed, and others are forced to work during the shutdown without pay, prompting unions to sue to block the firings.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

For the president and Mr. Vought, their tactics marked an escalation in a cost-cutting campaign that began at the start of Mr. Trump’s second term and the early work of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Through more than eight months, they have dismissed droves of civil servants, closed agencies and canceled billions of dollars in spending, sometimes in ways that have tested the law and defied Congress. By December, the federal government is expected to employ 300,000 fewer workers than it did in January, a reflection of the administration’s massed firings and induced resignations.

And Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought have pursued a dramatic retrenchment in government spending, proposing a budget that would slash about $163 billion in the 2026 fiscal year, largely by eliminating a vast set of climate, education, health and housing programs, including some that benefit the poor.

In his social media post, Mr. Trump on Thursday referenced Mr. Vought’s work on Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that similarly called for an overhaul of the federal government. In that document, Mr. Vought opined on the “existential need for aggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch.”

Mr. Trump’s renewed attacks on Democrats appeared to undercut his own deputies, including Vice President JD Vance, who just a day earlier insisted that the president was not seeking to politicize the shutdown.

“We’re not targeting federal agencies based on politics,” he told reporters at a briefing on Wednesday. Mr. Vance instead maintained that layoffs, in particular, would help the government preserve “essential services,” even though agencies have not had to dismiss workers in previous government shutdowns.

“We need to reopen the United States federal government, because people are going without pay,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. “Then we can discuss this very important issue of health care that the president absolutely wants to fix.”

Democrats on Wednesday were also keenly focused on health care, saying they had voted against the Republicans’ budget bill because they were seeking to keep health care costs from ballooning for millions of Americans, including in states that Mr. Trump won last year.

The tug of war over which side cares more about health care speaks to the issue’s political potency. Mr. Trump has made lowering health costs a key part of his agenda, and Democrats appear to see an opening to rein in the White House and preserve a set of subsidies that help millions of Americans pay for coverage.

Republicans have tried to drive their message by repeating the false assertion that Democrats were shutting down the government to fund free health care for unauthorized immigrants. Hours before the shutdown on Tuesday, Mr. Trump held two Oval Office events promoting health policy actions — one announcing a deal the administration made with the drugmaker Pfizer for the company to lower prices it charges to state Medicaid programs, and another on accelerating research into children with cancer.

“If Democrats actually cared about health care, they would applaud the actions taken by President Trump,” Ms. Leavitt said on Wednesday.

Democrats are holding out on voting for the spending bill, hoping to extend Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year, and to reverse cuts to Medicaid and other health programs that were part of legislation Mr. Trump signed into law in July.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said he believed that his party had a winning message.

“We are going to be fighting everywhere on TV stations like yours, in the social media, in picketing, in protesting, in emails, in every way,” he said on Wednesday on “Morning Joe,” the MSNBC show. “And when the average American says, ‘Why the heck did I get a bill that raises my health care costs, doubles them,’ we’re going to be pointing out it’s the Republicans who did it.”

The shutdown comes as both parties attempt to explain why scores of government jobs could be cut, and why critical services could come to a halt.

The White House has launched an aggressive effort to blame Democrats for the shutdown, even using government websites to disparage the party. Officials have also attempted to use another key issue for Mr. Trump’s base — immigration — to bolster their claims that Democrats were prioritizing undocumented immigrants over American citizens.

On Wednesday, it sent out a powerful surrogate to carry its message to the public.

Speaking to reporters from the White House briefing room, Mr. Vance complained that Democrats had positioned themselves as champions of health care, but had not supported Mr. Trump’s efforts.

“Democrats say that they care a lot about lowering health care costs, and yet, when the president took historic action to work with the drug companies to lower prescription drug prices, the Democrats did nothing to help us,” Mr. Vance said.

He added: “What they have done instead is to shut down the government, because we won’t give billions of dollars to health care funding for illegal aliens.”

Mr. Vance said that Democratic leaders had proposed ideas for improving health care access that Mr. Trump would consider, but that it was wrong to force a shutdown until the president agreed to them.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump did not appear publicly and did not directly address the shutdown, except to attack Representative Maxine Waters of California — a frequent Democratic target of his — on social media.

The White House used the press briefing room to play clips of Democrats criticizing previous shutdowns. As the day came to a close, the screens played on loop an A.I.-generated video that Mr. Trump posted on social media earlier this week mocking Mr. Schumer and depicting Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader, who is Black, as a Mexican.

Mr. Jeffries called the video racist, while Mr. Vance on Wednesday defended it as “funny.”

In a series of social media posts, Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said the administration had paused or moved to cancel the delivery of about $26 billion in previously approved funds across a range of programs, describing the money as wasteful or in need of further review.

The timing seemed to be no mere coincidence, nor were Mr. Vought’s choices of location. He said the administration was terminating one tranche of funds, totaling about $8 billion, because it was “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda,” a move that affected projects in 16 states, most of which are led by Democrats.

In a second instance, the Trump administration paused about $18 billion in approved infrastructure funding for two major transportation projects primarily in New York City, whose state delegation includes Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader. The two men have been frequent targets of Mr. Trump’s personal attacks, and the Transportation Department said the money would be held pending further review.

Mr. Vought’s budget maneuvers marked an attempt to formalize Mr. Trump’s threat from a day earlier, when he described a shutdown as a “good” opportunity to cut federal agencies, programs and benefits he disfavors in ways that would harm Democrats. He said at the time that it could include another round of mass layoffs targeting “a lot” of government workers.

By Wednesday, those cuts appeared imminent. Speaking privately with House Republicans, Mr. Vought said the firings, known as a reduction in force, could go into effect in the next day or two, according to a member on the call.

Vice President JD Vance later echoed the need for layoffs in a briefing at the White House, saying the firings would preserve “essential services,” even though such cuts have not been required in past instances when the government had to halt its operations.

Taken together, the administration’s actions laid bare the risks and consequences of a protracted fiscal stalemate under Mr. Trump. With an expansive view of executive power, the president has spared no opportunity in his second term to shutter agencies, slim down the federal work force and reconfigure the budget, with aggressive tactics that have tested the courts and, at times, defied Congress.

The shutdown began at midnight, the start of the new fiscal year, after Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a short-term spending truce. G.O.P. leaders sought to extend existing funding levels into November, but Democrats in the Senate rejected that approach, partly because it did not preserve a set of expiring subsidies that help millions of Americans pay for their health insurance.

As a result, many federal employees are now furloughed, while others, including military service members and airport baggage screeners, are forced to report for work without pay. While those employees will eventually get back pay, there is no clear indication of when that might happen. Scores of critical government services are also halted or reduced significantly.

The longer the standoff continues, the greater the chances of financial harm to American families, businesses and the broader economy, a reality that both parties’ leaders acknowledged on Wednesday. Still, they remained far from a resolution, while Mr. Trump’s top aides unfurled the ways they might leverage the standoff to their own ends.

Hours after Mr. Vought pledged to revoke some climate-related funding, the Energy Department offered scant details about its cuts. The agency said it had terminated 321 awards for more than 223 projects, claiming the investments did not “advance the nation’s energy needs” and were not “economically viable.”

But officials did not detail the full list of affected initiatives, and neither the Energy Department nor the White House responded to requests for more specifics. In a statement, the agency noted that affected recipients could try to file an appeal.

The Transportation Department, which halted the delivery of about $18 billion in infrastructure money that benefited New York, said it would review those grants for compliance with Mr. Trump’s directives on diversity, equity and inclusion.

In doing so, though, it appeared to dispel any illusion about the political implications of its decision. The agency said it had to furlough staff reviewing infrastructure projects “thanks to” Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries, as it blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

“Without a budget, the department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review,” it said in a statement.

In response, Democratic leaders on Wednesday forcefully denounced the White House and its handling of the lapse in federal funding, including its decision to interfere with approved money for cities and states.

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who leads her party on the Appropriations Committee, said the actions showed how Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought were “gleefully using the shutdown they have caused as a pretext to inflict even more pain.”

“The American people deserve so much better than a president and an administration that treat their families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” Ms. Murray said in a statement.

The White House remained unbowed, pressing forward with its strategy to weaponize the closure.

Soon after government funding lapsed, the Trump administration suspended all news broadcasts from Voice of America and furloughed all of its journalists, a break with past practice in funding lapses. The closure came two days after a judge reinstated about 500 of the broadcaster’s employees.

The White House also laid the groundwork to fulfill the president’s threats to oust more government employees. On a call with Republican lawmakers, Mr. Vought said the shutdown offered an opportunity to remove officials who are working on programs that are not aligned with the president’s political agenda, according to the member who attended the phone meeting.

In a sign that the process was well underway, Trump officials on Wednesday instructed employees at the Interior Department to take home their government devices to receive any information on mass firings, according to internal emails reviewed by The New York Times.

It is unclear how many employees could be laid off at the department, which includes the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management. But Mr. Trump’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year calls for a 30 percent cut to the budget for the agency, which has already lost thousands of employees since January.

Overall, the government is already expected to employ 300,000 fewer workers by December than it did in January. The substantial decline reflects a series of firings, layoffs and induced resignations that date back to the start of the president’s term, and the work of the cost-cutting campaign orchestrated by the Department of Government Efficiency.

Fearing widespread reductions in force, a group of unions representing federal workers preemptively sued the Trump administration this week, claiming that it did not have the legal authority to conduct mass layoffs under cover of a shutdown. The case is pending in a federal court in California.

Publicly, though, Mr. Trump’s deputies still insisted that they had not politicized the funding lapse. Speaking at a press briefing on Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, maintained instead that the layoffs, in particular, were necessary because of the realities of the budget.

“There are unfortunate consequences to a government shutdown,” she said.

From an administrative perspective, Morrison-Frichtl added Head Start providers do not have the infrastructure in place to verify immigration status of applicants.
“Head Start Programs are particularly important in Wisconsin’s rural and agricultural areas,” Mauer says, noting that dairy farms are largely staffed by Latino immigrants.
“In many communities, Head Start may be the only early education option available to low income working families.” Limiting eligibility for Head Start could decrease enrollment by 30 percent in Wisconsin.
She adds that the government does not have the authority to impose immigration-based restrictions on Head Start families.","A federal judge in Seattle granted the ACLU’s request to block a directive from the Trump administration that sought to exclude certain immigrant families from Head Start for the first time in the program’s 60-year history.

“Immigrants are threaded through the fabric of our communities and threatening them tears communities apart,” says Clarissa Doutherd, a leader in parent advocacy.

Head Start is a federal program providing free education and development services to families and children from birth to age five who come from low-income families – around 40 million children and families across the country. The Trump administration has banned any activities related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and carried out mass layoffs of staff and closures of offices tasked with supporting Head Start providers. These actions have hindered programs from fulfilling their mission. The ban has allowed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to weaponize its administrative function to enforce compliance with ambiguous and undefined terms.

In July, HHS issued a new directive, which excluded many immigrant families from accessing Head Start by restricting participation based on immigration status for the first time in the program’s history. The new policy excludes undocumented residents and some lawfully residing immigrants. The new ruling prevents the department from implementing the directive and prohibits the government from enforcing it against Head Start agencies, providers, and participants. While the recent ruling ensures that immigrant families will be able to continue accessing critical services while the challenge is pending, the legal block is temporary.

Doutherd, the executive director of Parent Voices Oakland, is part of a coalition of parents and Head Start providers who joined the ACLU in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s coordinated and unlawful efforts to dismantle the Head Start program.

Doutherd heads a nonprofit that organizes, supports, and empowers parents and caregivers to increase access to affordable and high-quality early education and childcare in Oakland. As a mother who has experience navigating the early education and childcare system with a low-income background, Doutherd understands the gap Head Start fills for parents in the California Bay area.

For immigrant parents in particular, Doutherd says they often rely on the culturally and linguistically appropriate resources provided by Head Start programs, such as dual-language curriculum and learning materials, interpretation services, translated materials, and other resources. Participation in Head Start also allows parents and caregivers to go to work and school, get groceries, attend medical appointments, and otherwise care for themselves and their families.

“The sudden loss of access to Head Start’s early childhood education programs would be devastating to their children’s development and well-being,” Doutherd says, adding that a potential disruption would “be even more severe for children who have disabilities, children who are experiencing developmental delays, and children who are experiencing homelessness, housing insecurity, financial instability, or other trauma.”

According to Lauri Morrison-Frichtl, executive director of the Illinois Head Start Association, the program serves more than 28,800 low-income children and their families in the state. Approximately 33 percent of children are dual language learners. Without Head Start, providers in the state anticipate their enrollment could decline by 20 percent or more – including children who are no longer eligible, children most at risk, and eligible children and families who are deterred from participating.

“Our programs already see families living in fear — including refugees, undocumented parents, and those here on student visas,” Morrison-Frichtl says. “Many are paralyzed, unsure if it’s safe to bring their children to Head Start.” Morrison-Frichtl added that the directive sowed fear in the community and concern about losing critical educational opportunities.

From an administrative perspective, Morrison-Frichtl added Head Start providers do not have the infrastructure in place to verify immigration status of applicants. They would have to divert staff away from core activities to train them on the directive. Illinois Head Start could also lose members – and dues funding – forcing the program to reduce staff or shutter altogether.

The temporary block will allow Illinois Head Start to focus on meeting the critical needs of its members and protect families from immigration consequences, Morrison-Frichtl says.

Wisconsin Head Start Executive Director Jennie Mauer says the program faces similar concerns. Wisconsin Head Start serves 15,000 of the state’s most vulnerable children and their families. Like other Head Start programs in rural areas, it offers a migrant and seasonal program for more than 300 children whose families work in Wisconsin’s dairy farms and other agricultural facilities. It also operates Head Start programs in federally recognized Native American tribes in Wisconsin, serving 1,000 children. The program received $168 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

“Head Start Programs are particularly important in Wisconsin’s rural and agricultural areas,” Mauer says, noting that dairy farms are largely staffed by Latino immigrants. “In many communities, Head Start may be the only early education option available to low income working families.”

Limiting eligibility for Head Start could decrease enrollment by 30 percent in Wisconsin. Along with reduced eligibility, she also worries families who are eligible will take their kids out of Head Start for fear of immigration consequences.

“No child and no family should have to fear accessing critical early learning services, and we will continue to defend the families that Head Start aims to serve,” says Jennesa Calvo-Friedman, senior staff attorney in the Women’s Rights Project at the ACLU. She adds that the government does not have the authority to impose immigration-based restrictions on Head Start families.

No parent should have to choose between their child’s education or their family’s safety.

Three of the four California counties empowered to inspect federal immigration detention facilities have not done so, and the fourth has conducted only basic reviews of food this year, records obtained by CalMatters show.

If they were checking, local officials would be providing an additional layer of oversight at a time when the number of people held in detention centers has surged because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on unauthorized immigrants.

Two state laws provide state, county and local officials the authority to review health and safety conditions in privately-run immigration detention facilities.

The first, passed during the first Trump administration, allows the attorney general’s office to inspect for violations of national detention standards and health or safety issues. The AG’s office has used that power to publish annual reports on conditions inside detention centers, including one this year that alleged deficient mental health care.

The second, a 2024 law, empowers counties to inspect privately run detention facilities. In the past, counties have inspected jails and prisons, finding mold, rats, and other health violations. But county health officials have not used that power to inspect federal immigration detention facilities.

In Kern County — where three detention centers operate — the health officer, through an attorney, has said in testimony before a federal judge that he has “no intention” of exercising his new authority to inspect the facilities to ensure they comply with state and local health standards.

The companies that manage the detention centers through contracts with the federal government say they take seriously their responsibility to adhere to federal standards and uphold human rights. One unsuccessfully sued to overturn the new California inspection law, alleging it was unnecessary and an intrusion on the federal government’s authority.

More than 5,700 people are in immigration detention in California, an 84% increase since the spring. On April 16, there were 3,100 people detained in the state, according to the California Attorney General’s latest report.

Advocates for detainees are drawing attention to what they describe as unhealthy conditions, including in the state’s newest detention center. It opened in Kern County without proper permits or a business license as required by state law, according to California City’s mayor.

CoreCivic’s 2,560-bed immigration detention center there sits on 70 acres in the Mohave desert about 80 miles east of Bakersfield.

A detainee who goes by the name of Loba has been locked up in the California City facility since Aug. 28. She said some detainees have not received the medication they need for more than 20 days. She asked CalMatters not to fully identify her because she feared retaliation by CoreCivic guards for speaking with a reporter.

“There’s a lack of interest on the part of CoreCivic to care for individuals with diabetes problems and people who have heart problems or any other health conditions. They’re really not caring for detainees and not giving us the proper medical treatment in detention,” Loba said.

She said she observed five people who needed emergency care because they could not get medication. Another California City detainee described similar conditions in an interview with CalMatters.

Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said the site has robust medical and mental health care on site, including around-the-clock access to those services. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

“There are no delays in individuals getting their prescription medications,” Gustin said.

Counties reviewing inspection law

In the four counties where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detention facilities, only one county health department conducts the kind of inspections allowed under the 2024 law. A San Bernardino County spokesperson said the county has the authority to inspect for disease control and “general health and sanitation,” but he later said the reviews are limited to the facilities’ food processing and service.

Officials from two other counties said they’ll use their new authority to respond to specific concerns, but that they had not yet done any inspections.

The Imperial County health department said it would respond to a complaint “if the facility falls within our legal authority to inspect.” The San Diego County health department said only that it “is exploring how to effectively operationalize this law in its jurisdiction.”

California has seven immigration detention centers: Adelanto ICE Processing Center and Desert View Annex in San Bernardino County; The Golden State Annex, Mesa Verde ICE Processing facility, and the California City detention facility in Kern County; The Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Imperial County; and the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego County.

ICE pays the for-profit prison company GEO Group to operate four of the centers: Adelanto, Desert View Annex, Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center.

MTC manages the detention center in Imperial County, while CoreCivic manages Otay Mesa and California City.

The 2024 law gives local health officials the authority to inspect private detention facilities as they deem necessary, but it does not require them to do so unless requested by local lawmakers or law enforcement. And it does not specify exactly what county health inspectors should check, despite lawmakers and cosponsors of the bill citing “detainees facing challenges in accessing timely medical attention” as one of the reasons the new law was necessary.

As the bill moved forward, lawmakers also cited a May 2020 COVID-19 outbreak at the Otay Mesa Detention Center that resulted in more than 300 staff and detained individuals becoming infected. “Conditions in these facilities not only affect the lives of those detained, but also impact the surrounding communities,” wrote the bill’s author, state Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles.

It passed without any recorded opposition and with unanimous votes in the Legislature.

GEO Group sued to challenge the law, arguing it was unconstitutional because it stepped on the federal government’s authority to manage detention centers. By extension, GEO claimed intergovernmental immunity as a contractor.

“This case involves the latest in a string of attempts by the State of California to ban federal immigration enforcement in the state, or so significantly burden such efforts as to drive federal agencies and contractors involved in that constitutionally-mandated national security function from California,” GEO attorneys argued in the suit, which was filed in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of California.

In federal court this year, Kern County attorney Jeremy McNutt said county health officer Kristopher Lyon doesn’t want to use the new law to inspect the Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex facilities in his county. McNutt said Lyon would inspect the facility if the governor ordered him to, but otherwise, he “has no intention of inspecting the facility whatsoever.”

“If he’s not ordered to do it then he has no intention of doing it, doesn’t really care to have the right to do it or not,” McNutt said of Lyon. “We don’t believe he has a duty to inspect the facility … There is no commitment or desire to inspect.”

A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in May, letting the law stay in place. Lyon did not respond to a request for comment about whether his position has changed in light of an influx of new detainees and the opening of a new detention center.

Adelanto cleared county review

In the only county making use of its powers to access the detention centers, a San Bernardino County inspector spent about an hour on May 29 at the Adelanto center for food and service issues. The facility passed, according to inspection reports.

San Bernardino County inspector Mary Ann Glass made no notes or comments, and she found no deficiencies or violations at the facility, the paperwork shows.

“Yes, our inspections are limited to food processing and service,” confirmed San Bernardino health department spokesperson Francis Delapaz.

Adelanto is where a 39-year-old detainee was being held shortly before his death in September.

Internal emails obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that about two weeks after arriving at Adelanto in August, Ismael Ayala-Uribe reported symptoms including a cough, fever, and severe pain. Staff flagged his condition as potentially life-threatening and last week escorted him to the facility’s medical center in a wheelchair, the newspaper reported. About an hour and a half later, medical staff sent him back to his dormitory. He was not sent to a hospital until three days later, where he died.

Adelanto detainees, who spoke with CalMatters on condition that they not be named because they fear retaliation, said the sites are crowded, and it’s taking a long time to access medications and medical care.

An immigrant who was arrested in an ICE raid in Los Angeles in June and spent more than a month at Adelanto, said it took three days for him to be assigned a bed when he arrived at the facility.

During that time, he wasn’t allowed a shower or a change of clothes and wasn’t permitted to call his family. He said the dorm he ultimately slept in doubled in population, to its full capacity of about 90 people. Staff, he said, asked for volunteers to keep the walkways and windows clean, and detainees waited longer than three days to hear back about medical requests.

“Everyone was getting sick with coughs, the flu, with the air being cold all day,” he said. “Almost 50% of the people were like that.”

A Geo Group spokesperson said the company provides around-the-clock access to medical care.

“Geo strongly rejects these baseless allegations,” spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in an email to CalMatters. “Our contracts also set strict limits on a facility’s capacity. Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.”

California tried to ban for-profit detention

The federal government’s own inspections indicate allegations of abuse and possible lapses in suicide prevention at the Adelanto facility. In 2024, the Office of Detention Oversight found one detainee who alleged an officer inappropriately squeezed his chest and genitals during a pat-down search, and another told inspectors he had thoughts of self-harming because of the poor conditions inside the facility.

State inspectors released a report in April that documented similar issues with conditions across the state. Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, the report stated.

Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged that state and local oversight over detention facilities is limited, particularly after the state in 2019 attempted to ban private for-profit facilities, a bill Bonta authored as a legislator. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found the law unconstitutional.

Legislators “thought the conditions and practices inside these detention centers were so bad that they should be completely prohibited. And unfortunately, that was struck down,” Bonta told CalMatters.

“Because these are federal detention centers, there is a limit on what I can do, what the California legislature can do.

The Constitution protects my ability to do that.”

An Alabama man has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration’s immigration-enforcement policies, claiming that, despite being a U.S. citizen, he has been twice detained in raids.

According to The Guardian, the proposed class-action lawsuit was filed earlier this week on behalf of lead plaintiff Leo Garcia Venegas, a concrete worker. The lawsuit demands an end to what Venegas’s attorneys call “unconstitutional and illegal immigration enforcement tactics.” He is being represented by attorneys from the public-interest law firm Institute for Justice.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has since responded to the lawsuit. In the Trump administration’s characteristically bombast rhetoric, an agency spokesperson said that the claim amounts to little more than “race-baiting opportunism.”

“DHS law enforcement uses ‘reasonable suspicion’ to make arrests,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the US – NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

“ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens,” McLaughlin added. “Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement.”

McLaughlin did not attempt to offer any explanation as to why Venegas, a U.S. citizen, has been detained twice for alleged immigration violations he could not have committed.

Since the beginning of the President Donald Trump’s second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increasingly relied on armed, often-warrantless raids, which resulted in the arrest and temporary detention of citizens and legal residents.

The Department of Homeland Security, the lawsuit alleges, “authorizes these armed raids based on the general assumption that certain groups of people in the [construction] industry, including Latinos, are likely illegal immigrants.”

“Once immigration officers are on a site, they preemptively seize everybody they think looks undocumented,” the lawsuit alleges.

Venegas, for instance, was detained in a May raid. Footage captured by one of his coworkers shows him being wrestled to the ground by immigration agents; throughout the confrontation, Venegas repeatedly insisted that he is a U.S. citizen. Less than a month later, Venegas was detained at another construction site.

“It feels like there is nothing I can do to stop immigration agents from arresting me whenever they want,” Venegas said in a statement issued by his attorneys. “I just want to work in peace. The Constitution protects my ability to do that.”

The Guardian reports that, during both arrests, Venegas showed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents his Alabama-issued REAL ID, a document that is only issued to citizens and legal residents. His identity card was almost dismissed out-of-hand as “fake.”

“Immigration officers are not above the law,” Institute for Justice attorney Jaba Tsitsuashvili said. “Leo is a hard-working American citizen standing up for everyone’s right to work without being detained merely for the way they look or the job that they do.”

Now, as president, Trump has taken a different approach. After failing to reach a bipartisan agreement, he mocked Democrats by posting an expletive-laced video generated by artificial intelligence and set to mariachi music, falsely showing US Representative Hakeem Jeffries wearing a sombrero and US Senator Chuck Schumer saying that “nobody likes Democrats any more”, so the party is seeking favour with “illegal aliens”.

Welcome to the 2025 US government shutdown.

At PolitiFact, we have fact-checked lawmakers’ and pundits’ statements about government shutdowns for more than a decade. When Congress can’t reach a funding agreement, both sides of the political aisle whip up talking points about what a shutdown means for the economy, immigration, worker paycheques, disaster response and services for low-income families. The blame is nearly always placed on the other party.

A reminder: Republicans control the presidency and both chambers of Congress. But passing legislation to extend government funding at current levels would require, under longstanding rules, more than half a dozen Democrats to side with Republicans in order to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance to a vote. This gives Democrats some negotiating leverage, which they are seeking to use in the spending fight.

Social services

Women, Infants, and Children programme will ‘not be funded’

House Speaker Mike Johnson, in September 29 remarks to reporters.

Johnson omits that enrollees will still likely get services, at least initially. But much depends on how long the shutdown lasts.

The Agriculture Department’s shutdown plan said its Women, Infants and Children nutrition programme, which provides food to low-income families, shall continue operations “subject to the availability of funding”. The WIC has 6.9 million participants.

WIC should be able to continue for at least one week, said Alison Hard, National WIC Association policy director. After that, operations will vary by state, depending on their funds.

During a shutdown, state WIC programmes have options to temporarily fill the funding gap, including various USDA sources, state money and requesting early rebate payments from their contracted infant formula manufacturers.

Past shutdowns

‘Back in 2013, Trump said it was the President’s job to negotiate and avoid a shutdown’

Senator Jeff Merkley, in a September 29 X post

That’s an accurate paraphrase of Trump’s remarks.

In an October 7, 2013, interview with then-Fox News host Greta Van Susteren, Trump criticised then-President Barack Obama for not being a dealmaker during the shutdown. In full, he said: “You have to get everybody in a room. You have to be a leader. The president has to lead. He has to get [the Speaker of the House] and everybody else in a room, and they have to make a deal. You have to be nice and be angry and be wild and cajole and do all sorts of things, but you have to get a deal.”

Trump made similar remarks in a September 2013 Fox & Friends phone interview: “Problems start from the top, and they have to get solved from the top, and the president’s the leader, and he’s got to get everybody in a room, and he’s got to lead.”

Healthcare

Republicans are spiking health insurance premiums by 75 percent for everyday Americans if they don’t extend enhanced ACA subsidies

Representative Katherine Clark, in a September 12 X post.

This is mostly true.

If the Republican-controlled Congress does not extend Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies before they expire at the end of this year, enrollees will have to pay more.

A KFF analysis of federal data found that the average increase in out-of-pocket coverage cost for enrollees would be 79 percent, with state-by-state average increases ranging from 49 percent to 195 percent.

This cost increase would come from a combination of insurance premium increases and the disappearance of subsidies, rather than from “spiking health insurance premiums” alone.

More than two weeks after Clark’s statement – and after we published the fact check – KFF produced a revised figure for average increases based on new data: 114 percent.

‘Democrats so-called proposal is a partisan wish list with a $1.5 trillion spending increase tacked onto a four-week funding bill’

House Speaker Mike Johnson, in a September 29 news release.

The Republican talking point misses the context of the Democrats’ proposal.

The September 17 Democratic proposal latches government funding up until October 31, known as a “continuing resolution”, to some Democratic priorities, including healthcare assistance and limiting Trump’s ability to claw back funds previously approved by Congress.

The bill calls for permanently extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that were passed in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic and extended in 2022. Those are set to expire on December 31 this year. The Democratic bill would also reverse cuts to Medicaid and other health programmes that Republicans enacted in their signature tax and spending legislation.

The Democrats’ measure would restore funding for public broadcasting that Republicans nixed in July and includes at least $320m for security for lawmakers, the executive branch and the Supreme Court. (Republicans have proposed $88m in security funding in their resolution bill.)

The bill also contains mandates for how the Trump administration can spend money and would hinder the White House’s recent attempt to cancel almost $5bn in foreign aid.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that’s hawkish on the deficit, said in a September 18 news release that Democrats’ proposal in its entirety would add $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

“The [continuing resolution] itself – the part that funds the government – would not add $1.5 trillion to the debt, but the bill that Democrats have proposed includes other provisions that would,” Chris Towner, the group’s policy director, wrote in an email. “The bill repeals the health spending cuts that were included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would cost about $1.1 trillion over a decade to repeal.”

Towner also said the Democrats’ provision to make the enhanced ACA subsidies permanent would cost about $350bn over a decade.

If enhanced subsidies are not extended, people with insurance through the Affordable Care Act will see their premiums rise ‘twice as much in the rural areas’

Senator Amy Klobuchar, in a September 28 interview on CBS’s Face the Nation

This is mostly true.

There are at least two ways to interpret Klobuchar’s statement: that she was comparing rural enrollees’ costs with people living elsewhere, or comparing their costs with what they paid before.

Klobuchar’s office told PolitiFact that the senator was referring to rural enrollees seeing increases that were double what they had paid before, and that interpretation aligns with what Klobuchar has said in other settings.

An analysis by the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, found that out-of-pocket insurance costs would increase on average in rural counties from $713 to $1,473 – a 107 percent increase, or slightly more than a doubling.

Comparing rural enrollees’ cost increases with people elsewhere, it amounts to a disproportionately large increase for rural areas, but it’s not twice as much.

Enrollees in rural counties would see average out-of-pocket losses of $760 from expiring enhanced subsidies, compared with $624 for all counties and $593 for urban counties. That’s 22 percent more for rural enrollees compared with all others, and 28 percent more compared with urban enrollees.

Government workers

‘If the government shuts down, members of Congress still get paid. The janitors never get paid’

Daniel Koh, on The People’s Cabinet podcast episode, September 29.

This is mostly true.

Members of the House and Senate continue to get paid during a shutdown. Federal law says federal employees get back pay, but the law does not extend to contractors, a group that includes many janitors. Some private employers with federal contracts may find ways to pay their employees, but there is nothing in federal law that requires it.

‘FEMA won’t be funded’ during hurricane season because of the shutdown

House Speaker Mike Johnson, in September 29 remarks to reporters

Johnson was correct that Congress had not agreed on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding, but a Department of Homeland Security shutdown procedures plan estimates that 84 percent of FEMA employees will continue working. (The DHS oversees FEMA.)

“Bottom line: hurricanes don’t care about politics. FEMA will still respond. But recovery will stall if Congress can’t do its job,” said Craig Fugate, who led FEMA during President Barack Obama’s administration after leading Florida’s emergency management under then-Republican Governor Jeb Bush. “This isn’t new – both parties own the blame.”

The agency’s recovery efforts are most at risk, Fugate said, because they depend on how much money remains in the Disaster Relief Fund. “Those dollars aren’t tied to the shutdown, but they usually run low this time of year. Normally, Congress passes a continuing resolution to add money. A shutdown means that doesn’t happen. That slows recovery projects, not the immediate response.”

The fund had about $2.3bn at the end of August, which is considered low.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25274663407781-1759354365.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-02 19:56:46.808044

Meanwhile, Illinois State Police said they are setting up barricades to create zones for people to protest in Broadview.

The area has been overwhelmed at times in recent weeks with people unhappy with the ICE operation. It's led to confrontations with agents and five people were charged following protests last weekend.

State police said they hope the barricades will allow for safer traffic flow and cut down on those confrontations.

Thursday's protest was organized in response to what they call a violent arrest of a 70-year-old Air Force veteran outside the Broadview Detention Center last weekend.

Dana Briggs was seen in video wearing a white hat telling federal agents to go away. At one point, the camera catches him on the ground.

The video shows a fellow protester tried to help him up. Agents then surrounded him, and he was led away.

Veterans from the non-profit ""Common Defense,"" alongside Illinois Vets for Change and the American Civil Liberties Union spoke out against the increasing presence of ICE and use of military force in communities.

Briggs' arrest marks an alarming escalation of state-sanctioned violence, they said.

""So-called patriots are turning a blind eye when they see mass deportation efforts tearing apart our community, turning a blind eye when they see masked ICE agents and National Guard troops flooding our streets and numbing us to the reality that our civil rights, our democracy is being crushed day by day,"" Army veteran Jesse Rojo said.

While the man at the top of the administration has yet to chime in directly, another key government official has addressed the situation.

Via KTLA.com, Department of Homeland Security special adviser Corey Lewandowski took issue on Wednesday with the league’s gesture.

“It’s so shameful that they’ve decided to pick somebody who just seems to hate America so much to represent them at the halftime game,” Lewandowski said on The Benny Show.

Lewandowski’s conclusion that Bad Bunny “hates America” comes not from any anti-American statement he has made, but from his criticism of the current administration. Formally known as Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, Bad Bunny is an American citizen from Puerto Rico. He has avoided U.S. tour dates due to concerns that ICE would be patrolling outside his concerts.

At his Super Bowl concert in Santa Clara, they will be.

“There is nowhere that you can provide safe haven to people in this country illegally. Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else,” Lewandowski said. “We will find you. We will apprehend you. We will put you in a detention facility, and we will deport you. So know that that is a very real situation under this administration, which is completely contrary to how it used to be.”

The NFL’s decision to feature Bad Bunny comes at a time when the NFL and ESPN hope the administration will approve a media merger that would result in the league owning 10 percent of ESPN. Coupled with Disney’s recent act of defiance via the reinstatement of Jimmy Kimmel, both the league and ESPN may have plenty of work to do in order to secure the seal of approval they seek.

The notice was sent to several congressional committees and obtained by The New York Times. It adds new detail to the administration’s thinly articulated legal rationale for why three U.S. military strikes the president ordered on boats in the Caribbean Sea last month, killing all 17 people aboard them, should be seen as lawful rather than murder.

Mr. Trump’s move to formally deem his campaign against drug cartels as an active armed conflict means he is cementing his claim to extraordinary wartime powers, legal specialists said. In an armed conflict, as defined by international law, a country can lawfully kill enemy fighters even when they pose no threat, detain them indefinitely without trials and prosecute them in military courts.

Geoffrey S. Corn, a retired judge advocate general lawyer who was formerly the Army’s senior adviser for law-of-war issues, said drug cartels were not engaged in “hostilities” — the standard for when there is an armed conflict for legal purposes — against the United States because selling a dangerous product is different from an armed attack.

Noting that it is illegal for the military to deliberately target civilians who are not directly participating in hostilities — even suspected criminals — Mr. Corn called the president’s move an “abuse” that crossed a major legal line.

“This is not stretching the envelope,” he said. “This is shredding it. This is tearing it apart.”

Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a email that “the president acted in line with the law of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring deadly poison to our shores, and he is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans.”

They couldn’t get past his double lock, so he went back to bed.

But when he woke up hours later for work, he walked out and found broken doors littering the hallway — and his neighbors missing.

Jones, 27, is among the residents left at 7500 S. South Shore Drive who are trying to piece together what remains after an early morning, high-powered federal immigration raid led to the arrests of dozens of their neighbors at their South Shore apartment building.

Armed federal agents in military fatigues busted down their doors overnight, pulling men, women and children from their apartments, some of them naked, residents and witnesses said. Agents approached or entered nearly every apartment in the five-story building, and U.S. citizens were among those detained for hours.

When he got home from work, Jones said he entered his unit to find all of his electronics and furniture missing, and all of his clothes and shoes thrown on the floor. Jones said he had no idea who took his belongings and hadn’t received answers from Chicago police.

“I’m pissed off,” Jones said. “I feel defeated because the authorities aren’t doing anything.”

On Wednesday, toys, shoes and food were still in piles in the building’s hallways. Property managers were seen throwing mattresses and broken doors into dumpsters.

The Department of Homeland Security said federal agents with Border Patrol, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrested 37 people in the raid. DHS said some of those arrested “are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes and immigration violators.”

The feds also claimed the South Shore neighborhood was “a location known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members and their associates,” but DHS gave no evidence to support the assertion, and authorities did not confirm that any of the people arrested were members of the Venezuelan gang.

Alleged Tren de Aragua members have been charged and detained in the city as recently as August. But the Chicago Sun-Times has found little evidence tying them to violence in Chicago.

Rodrick Johnson, 67, is one of many residents who were detained by federal agents during the South Shore raid. A U.S. citizen, he said agents broke through his door and dragged him out in zip ties.

Johnson said he was left tied up outside the building for nearly three hours before agents finally let him go.

“I asked [agents] why they were holding me if I was an American citizen, and they said I had to wait until they looked me up,” Johnson said. “I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer. They never brought one.”

Video taken near 75th Street and South Shore Drive showed federal agents in large vehicles gathered on the street near the building. Some wore U.S. Border Patrol uniforms. Others had FBI logos.

A spokesperson for Chicago’s FBI field office confirmed the bureau was present to support a “targeted immigration enforcement operation” carried out by Border Patrol.

The raid is one of the largest operations executed since President Donald Trump’s administration announced the launch of “Operation Midway Blitz” on Sept. 8, bringing a flood of federal immigration officers to the Chicago area to conduct raids and arrests.

A similar raid was carried out in suburban Elgin, when agents led by U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem rode in a military vehicle and blew down the front door of a home where they detained six people, including two U.S. citizens.

In the South Shore raid, neighbors said federal agents used flashbang grenades to burst through the building and several drones and helicopters were deployed.

Ebony Sweets Watson, who lives across the street, said it “looked like hundreds” of agents were outside her front door.

Watson said she saw agents dragging residents, including kids, out of the building without any clothes on and into U-Haul vans. Kids were separated from their mothers, she said.

“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Watson. “Even if you’re not a mother, seeing kids coming out buck naked and taken from their mothers, it was horrible.”

Watson said she went into the building to help one of the residents and was shocked by what she saw.

“Stuff was everywhere,” said Watson. “You could see people’s birth certificates, and papers thrown all over. Water was leaking into the hallway. It was wicked crazy.”

Jones, who lives on the fourth floor, said most of his neighbors were Venezuelan and often took turns cleaning the hallway because the property owners did little to maintain it.

“They were cool people,” Jones said as he looked into his next door neighbor’s unit. “They didn’t speak a lick of English, but we used translator apps to talk to each other.”

Jones wondered what would happen to his neighbor’s young children.

Jones and Johnson said they believed the landlord would kick out the remaining residents from the building, which public records show had previously received code violations. Owners of the property could not be reached for comment.

Brandon Lee, a spokesman for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said the group was working to identify those taken in the raid.

“It was a violent show of force in the middle of the night,” Lee said. “Taking families out of an apartment building in a residential neighborhood like that is harmful, is traumatic, and that is not something that people can easily recover from, whether they themselves were taken or whether they witnessed it.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2c2958/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3424+0+289/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F04%2F94aa43a2411db0a6298c0cf1a2cd%2Fsouthshoreraidfolo-100225-15.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 18:57:49.131335

I’m a citizen!” Garcia Vinegas yelled.
An officer finally made a phone call, confirmed his social security number was valid, and Garcia Vinegas was released.
When Garcia Vinegas asked why he was there, the officer responded in Spanish, and Garcia Vinegas told him he was a citizen.
“When he responded that he has ‘papers’ (in other words, immigration status), they replied, ‘No you don’t.","A U.S. citizen detained by federal agents during anti-immigrant raids of construction sites has filed a class action suit against the Trump administration on behalf of “all those who stand in his shoes” — U.S. citizens or those otherwise lawfully present in the United States who are working on construction sites in the Southern District of Alabama.

Leo Garcia Venegas, a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, was born in 1999 in Florida, and moved with his family to Alabama when he was 14. He has worked in construction since he graduated from Alabama’s Robertsdale High School in 2018.

“I got arrested twice for being a Latino working in construction,” he said in a video posted by the Institute for Justice, which is representing Garcia Venegas.

Over the course of three weeks from May to June, federal officers raided two construction sites closed to the public in Baldwin County, Alabama, where Garcia Venegas was working, and detained him. Both times, they entered the property without a warrant, and both times, he told officers he was a citizen and showed them his REAL ID, according to the suit.

The suit says federal agents have conducted at least 17 warrantless raids on private construction sites in Baldwin County since January.

This year, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) eliminated a policy that had been in place for more than 15 years that required Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to identify the person they intended to arrest in advance, including their name, appearance, known addresses and employment, immigration history, and any criminal history. The request then had to be approved by a supervisor.

“Rather than relying on targeted investigations, Border Czar [Tom] Homan and [Department of Homeland] Secretary Kristi Noem have directed immigration officers to go on patrols to search for people who work in certain industries and fit a generalized demographic profile of an undocumented worker in that industry,” the suit says.

According to the complaint, DHS has adopted several unconstitutional policies that authorize immigration officers to raid private construction sites closed to the public, without a warrant, and then detain workers, even after they provide proof of their citizenship or lawful status. The suit asks the court to strike down the policies.

“Once immigration officers are on a site, they preemptively seize everybody they think looks undocumented,” the suit says. “And they detain these workers indefinitely — even those who have a REAL ID — until the officers eventually check the legal status of the people they’ve detained. Sometimes it takes 20 minutes; sometimes it takes days.”

Officers first detained Garcia Vinegas on May 21, when they raided a construction site in Foley, Alabama, according to the suit. The property had a “No Trespassing” sign posted and was enclosed by a black fence around the perimeter.

Garcia Vinegas was working on a concrete crew to lay the foundation for several new homes that were being built. All of the crew members, including Garcia Vinegas, were Latino. Five armed men in camouflage, including three who were masked, jumped over the fence and ran past the “No Trespassing” sign, according to the suit.

“The officers ran right past the white and black workers without detaining them and went straight for the Latino workers,” the suit says.

Garcia Vinegas’s brother, who was also working on the site, asked the officers if they had a warrant. Without answering, they pulled him to the ground. Garcia Vinegas began filming, and a short time later, an officer grabbed him by the arm.

“Don’t touch me! I’m a citizen!” Garcia Vinegas yelled.

The officer forced his arm behind his back and pushed him to the ground.

Garcia Vinegas repeatedly yelled, “I’m a citizen! Stop! I’ll show you my papers now!”

Two more officers then came over and helped restrain him, according to the suit.

“I’m a citizen! I’m a citizen! I’m a citizen!” he yelled from the ground.

A video shows the officers restraining Garcia Vinegas, who can be heard yelling, “I’m a citizen!”

The suit says that while they held Vinegas on the ground, one of the officers reached into his pocket to look for his identification. When they retrieved his REAL ID, the officers told him it was fake, handcuffed him, and took him to an unmarked car.

“They kept ignoring Leo’s pleas that he was a citizen,” the suit says. “The handcuffs were tight and painful, and Leo stood the entire time in the hot Alabama sun.”

He continued to tell the officers he was a citizen and begged them to check his social security number. An officer finally made a phone call, confirmed his social security number was valid, and Garcia Vinegas was released. He was detained for over an hour.

About two weeks later, Garcia Vinegas went through the same ordeal. On June 12, he was working inside a partially constructed home. The construction site was surrounded by a black perimeter fence.

While working in the bedroom, listening to music with his headphones on, he felt the presence of someone else in the room. He turned around and saw a masked, armed agent standing in the doorway, the suit says. When Garcia Vinegas asked why he was there, the officer responded in Spanish, and Garcia Vinegas told him he was a citizen.

Garcia Vinegas complied with the officer’s order to follow him outside. Once outside, the officer told him they had to check his immigration status. He told the officer he was a citizen, again, and showed him his REAL ID. The officers told him it could be fake, and ordered him to come to their vehicle so they could verify his immigration status. He was released about a half hour later. Along with Garcia Vinegas, at least two other workers on the site with lawful status were also detained and then released.

There have been numerous instances of federal agents harassing, abducting, and detaining U.S. citizens and those who have lawful status in the United States. In a lawsuit recently filed against the Trump administration on behalf of several D.C. residents, one of the plaintiffs, José Escobar Molina, was abducted as he was about to get into his truck to start his work day. Escobar Molina has had Temporary Protected Status (TPS) since 2001.

“The agents immediately handcuffed Mr. Escobar Molina, grabbed him by the arms and legs, and called him ‘illegal’ repeatedly,” the suit says. “When he responded that he has ‘papers’ (in other words, immigration status), they replied, ‘No you don’t. You are illegal.’”

He was detained and released the next day.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-2-venegas.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 20:57:58.892100

A coalition represented by Democracy Forward, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, and the Fair Elections Center is asking the court to block the efforts to combine various sets of government data in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services systems.

Some states are using it to check voter rolls in the name of voter fraud, as USCIS itself has announced.

“These dramatic changes far exceed the SAVE system’s limited authorized scope and functionality, which previously did not allow bulk searches or queries of U.S.-born citizens. Nor did it previously pool from SSA data or include any search-by-SSN function,” the filing reads.

The lawsuit filing also alleges that USCIS has created a data lake that combines sensitive information about U.S. citizens and residents across different agencies, including the IRS, SSA and Department of Health and Human Services, “in defiance of multiple laws.”

""This country was founded on the principle that government has no business arbitrarily intruding in our private affairs,"" John Davisson, EPIC's director of litigation, said in a statement.

Lawyers urged a federal appeals court Wednesday not to delay litigation challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to end temporary immigration protections for people from Haiti, Venezuela, and other nations.

They said they would have agreed to pause proceedings, but the government refused to agree not to deport or detain the migrants affected in the interim.

October 2, 2025

Since the beginning of Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and second term as President of the United States, he has reiterated his campaign promise to remove undocumented immigrants. Under the direction of the Trump Administration, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Agency deported 200,000 individuals in seven months (Alvarez, 2025). Additionally, ICE found that nearly 17,500 people have self-deported due to fear of being detained and sent to detention centers (Alvarez, 2025). The deportation of undocumented immigrants has long been a policy initiative for many sitting presidents, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush. For instance, ICE was established during the Bush administration in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks, while Obama earned the nickname ""Deporter in Chief"" due to his record-high deportation rates during his presidency (Chishti, Pierce, and Bolter, 2017 and American Immigration Council, 2017). Presidents from both political parties have implemented policies aimed at monitoring migration and removing undocumented immigrants. However, one of the most staggering changes to U.S. immigration policies is how the Trump Administration has made the deportation process more inhumane by sending immigrants to third countries with which they have no connection.

Trump’s deportation policies have negatively impacted Venezuelan immigrants disproportionately to other groups. More than 30% of immigrants being deported to third countries are Venezuelan, which means that nearly 3,000 Venezuelans have been sent to countries they were neither born in nor have had any connection to in the six months leading up to their deportation (Bio, 2025). Venezuelan immigrants make up the largest share of individuals deported to third countries including Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Spain. Additionally, there have been reports of migrants being sent to non-Spanish-speaking countries, without regard for the language barrier, such as Austria, Italy, Syria, and Vanuatu (Bio, 2025).

The Trump Administration has also outlined new destinations to send migrants. Rwanda agreed to receive 250 deportees after a deal was signed in June (Bio, 2025). This agreement shares similarities with the 2022 UK Conservative Government’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda who entered the UK without legal documentation. It is important to note that there was no legal option for individuals to apply for asylum or obtain a refugee visa from outside the UK (International Rescue Committee, 2022). The plan faced legal challenges, including a UK Supreme Court ruling that deemed Rwanda unsafe due to previous human rights abuses (United Nations Human Rights, 2024) and taxpayers incurred a cost of £700 million for a plan that has now been abandoned by the current Labour Government (Morton, 2024). The failure of this plan in another Western country suggests that it might be a misuse of taxpayer money and a violation of international human rights laws and agreements.

The Trump Administration has continued to rely on other nations to detain deported migrants, with one infamously known location in Tecoluca, El Salvador. CECOT (Terrorism Confinement Center) is a maximum security prison built in late 2022, aimed at cracking down on gang violence in El Salvador (The Associated Press, 2025). Prisoners are not allowed to have visitors or go outside. According to the human rights group, Cristosal, as of March 2024, 110,000 people were being held in CECOT, including those sentenced to prison and individuals awaiting trial (The Associated Press, 2025). Cristosal has also reported at least 261 deaths in the prison and “cited cases of abuse, torture, and lack of medical treatment” (The Associated Press, 2025).

In March 2025, the Trump Administration sent more than 280 Venezuelan men to this maximum security prison after paying the Salvadoran government $6 million in taxpayer funds to house these immigrants(Dunbar, 2025 and National Immigration Law Center, 2025). Their deportation was expedited due to claims by Trump and his senior advisors that these Venezuelan men were affiliated with Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan criminal gang that he alleged was infiltrating the United States. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has only been used three times in U.S history (The Associated Press, 2025). This Act grants the president the power to detain, restrain, and deport individuals from a nation with which the U.S. is either at war or facing invasion.

According to reports from ProPublica and the Texas Tribune, 118 of the Venezuelan men deported to CECOT had legally entered the United States and were in the middle of their migration case (del Valle, Bonilla Suárez and Corona Ramos, 2025). Additionally, at least 166 of them had tattoos, which the “government has relied on as an indicator of ties to the Venezuelan gang, despite Tren de Aragua experts saying tattoos are not reliable indicators of gang affiliation” (del Valle, Bonilla Suárez and Corona Ramos, 2025). Importantly, the Trump Administration has not supplied a list of names or any evidence that the individuals deported were members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the U.S. In fact, it was widely known that the majority of the deported men had never committed a crime in the U.S (The Associated Press, 2025 and del Valle, Bonilla Suárez and Corona Ramos, 2025).

After four months of imprisonment, 252 of the 280 Venezuelan men were released from CECOT and returned to Venezuela following an agreement between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments. A few of these men have spoken out about their ordeal and described their experience in the mega-prison as ""hell"" and like a ""horror movie"" (Dunbar, 2025). Former detainees have described having their wrists and ankles shackled, being physically, verbally, and sexually abused, being forced by prison guards to kneel on the floor for hours at a time, eating poor quality food that made people sick, and being forced to sleep on metal planks (Guan, 2025). These men were also prohibited from contacting their families and denied legal representation (Dunbar, 2025).

While immigration remains a continuously contentious issue in many countries, it is important for nations to develop humane strategies and solutions to manage the increasing number of migrants. The targeting of Central and South American immigrants in the U.S. and the process through which the Trump administration has chosen to detain and deport individuals raises serious concerns in how the government treats migrants. These actions include, masked ICE agents conducting raids in local communities, detaining individuals during migration hearings, the construction of detention centers like the Florida Everglades facility, often referred to as ""Alligator Alcatraz"", along with sending individuals to third countries instead of their home nations. These practices create significant human rights abuses for migrant populations that break international and U.S law, as well as violate the U.S Constitution (United Nations, 2025 and National Immigration Law Center, 2025 ). The Trump Administration’s disregard for fair treatment of undocumented immigrants must be addressed, and the administration should be held accountable. These policies have led our country away from its roots as a nation of immigrants that embraces new cultures, transforming it into a state where authoritarian figures in the U.S government enforce harsh and inhumane practices.

Led by John G. Roberts Jr., the George W. Bush appointee who marked his 20th anniversary as chief justice last Monday, the nation’s highest court with its 6-3 right-wing supermajority has ignored norms and precedents to mostly give a green light to the most lawless president in U.S. history, Donald Trump. Thus enabled, the wannabe authoritarian, who picked three of the justices, often praises their rulings — even as he lambastes and invites threats to the many lower-court judges whose adverse orders the Supreme Court has blocked in its deference to the president. The White House website keeps a running tally of the victories.

“How the Roberts Court became the Trump Court” was the fitting headline last week on an analysis from CNN correspondent and longtime court biographer Joan Biskupic. She quotes Michael Klarman, a professor of American legal history at Harvard Law School, who slammed Roberts for “appeasing the autocrat,” and added, “The basic lesson of the 20th Century is that doesn’t work.”

A quarter through the 21st century, Americans seem doomed to relearn that lesson. The term ahead will further test the Supreme Court as a pumped-up Trump pushes the bounds of presidential power. Many of its decisions have been temporary wins for him, blocking lower-court orders pending further litigation. The coming months will tell whether Trump’s W’s are permanent: Various cases will return for the justices to finally decide on the merits, with fully argued opinions instead of the one-sentence slapdash orders they’ve been putting out.

Yet a Supreme Court that last month, in a Los Angeles case, empowered federal agents to racially profile, stop and detain anyone they suspect of being in the United States illegally — court precedents and the 4th Amendment be damned — is not a court that invites confidence that it would stand up against Trump and for federal law and the Constitution. Which makes all the more frightening the commander in chief’s declaration on Tuesday to about 800 generals and admirals that henceforth Democrat-run U.S. cities will be “training grounds” for troops, to battle “the enemy from within.”

That’s our future, if the justices allow. Just consider how Trump and his administration have already, in under nine months, reshaped legal and constitutional limits in unprecedented ways, thanks to a complicit Supreme Court (and a compliant Republican-controlled Congress).

Trump has slashed spending and gutted federal agencies, not least the Department of Education, that Congress approved by law, making a mockery of Congress’ constitutional power of the purse and legislative prerogatives. He’s imposed, paused and altered tariffs unilaterally. He’s presided over mass firings of federal employees, despite civil service protections going back more than a century, to reinstitute a political spoils system. He has fired leaders at supposedly independent regulatory agencies without cause. (On Wednesday, in the most-watched case of such agencies’ independence, the Supreme Court did block Trump from firing Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, pending a full review of the administration’s case against her in January.)

People suspected of being in the country illegally are daily and often cruelly rounded up by masked, unidentified federal agents and deported without due process, some to dangerous countries to which they have no connection. The Justice Department openly uses Trump’s enemies list as its prosecutorial to-do list. Trump ordered an end to birthright citizenship, despite the plain language of the 14th Amendment, and the Supreme Court in June used his appeal of his lower-court losses not to affirm those courts and uphold the constitutional right — it was silent on that — but instead to rule on a procedural matter and limit lower courts’ power to order national injunctions of presidential actions.

Administration lawyers repeatedly have filed misleading briefs, made false statements in lower courts and slow-walked or disregarded court rulings without admonition or penalty from the Supreme Court. A Washington Post analysis in July found that the administration defied more than a third of lower courts’ substantive rulings against it. Yet the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has just “shoved lower court judges out of the way” when presidential power is at stake, as liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put it in June. Meanwhile, the judges suffer increased threats for their rulings and the chief justice and his colleagues remain mostly mute.

Trump, of course, was emboldened to grab power from day one (and, arguably, to win reelection in the first place) by the Supreme Court’s shocking decision last year giving him and future presidents virtual immunity from criminal prosecution. As liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent last year, the aptly named Trump vs. United States puts presidents “above the law.”

It’s not just what the court has done that is so objectionable. It’s how it’s done its work. Even as lower courts step up to Trump’s challenges to the rule of law, with hearings, trials and well-reasoned rulings, the justices typically trump them (pun intended) with unsigned, one-sentence statements that leave judges and the public confused as to why the Supreme Court ruled as it did and whether its ruling stands as precedent. Extraordinarily, district and appeals court judges appointed by presidents of both parties, including Trump, are going public with their gripes against the justices.

On Tuesday, a Reagan district judge in Boston, William Young, blistered Trump mainly, but the Supreme Court by implication, in a 161-page opinion that he called the most crucial of his half-century career. Young closed: “I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected. Is he correct?”

No, he’s not, insofar as the American people are concerned. But yes, I fear, he is correct when it comes to the Supreme Court.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f82e802/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5454x2863+0+386/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2F85%2F57e6ed3845bd925f6d61321be2e2%2Ftrump-courts-59008.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 17:58:35.007793

Senate Democrats won't approve a Republican government spending plan, demanding the GOP restore Trump cuts that will push 10.9 million people from Medicaid and Obamacare.

WASHINGTON ‒ The federal government shutdown entered Day Two on Thursday, Oct. 2, as President Donald Trump said he would decide which ""Democrat Agencies"" to close and congressional Republicans and Democrats showed no signs of ending their impasse over funding the government.

Trump has already frozen federal transit and green energy funding for Democratic-leaning states and has threatened mass firings of federal workers. ""I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,"" he said on social media.

Senators left town to observe the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday, meaning the first shutdown since 2019 will last one more day at minimum. Yet a drawn-out shutdown is an increasing possibility given the lack of progress toward a compromise.

Hanging over the stalemate is Trump’s threat to cull federal workers. White House officials warned mass firings are “imminent” under a shutdown. Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Republican lawmakers in a private call on Oct. 1 that mass reductions in force will begin in “a day or two.”

The main sticking point remains Democratic demands to restore funding to Medicaid and Obamacare after cuts Trump signed into law this year that the Congressional Budget Office says will leave 10.9 million people without health insurance. House Republicans want to keep the government operating at existing funding levels, but they lack a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate despite their majority.

More Americans blame Trump and GOP for shutdown, poll says

Close to half of Americans blame President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans for the government partially shutting down, according to a new poll.

In a survey conducted by the Washington Post on Oct. 1 – the first day of the shutdown – 47% said they blamed Trump and Republicans in Congress for the ongoing impasse that has left thousands of federal workers without pay and halted various government activities.

Another 30% blame the crisis on congressional Democrats, and 23% said they were ""not sure"" when asked who they think is ""mainly responsible"" for the shutdown.

What's behind White House claims of 'illegal' immigrants on Medicaid?

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified the Trump administration’s opposition to immigrants participating in Medicaid after entering the country temporarily.

Leavitt said the Biden administration allowed in millions of immigrants under humanitarian “parole” or under temporary programs for economic or environmental crises in their home countries.

Administration officials have referred to these immigrants as “illegal,” but they were admitted under formal government programs.

“It was a complete abuse of our immigration system,” Leavitt told reporters Oct. 2 at the White House. “They slapped a Band-Aid. They called it Temporary Protected Status.”

The Biden administration admitted about 3 million immigrants under parole and 1.4 million from 16 countries under Temporary Protected Status, according to House testimony and the Judiciary Committee.

“You know who would like free benefits? Hard-working Americans who work their butts off every day,” Leavitt said. “That is fundamentally unfair and this administration is not going to support it.""

But immigrants admitted under parole of less than a year, those seeking asylum and those under Temporary Protected Status are generally barred from Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.

While undocumented immigrants are barred from receiving federal health benefits, eligible immigrants who are in the country legally make up 6% of the total enrollment in Medicaid and the CHIP child health care program, according to the health policy nonprofit KFF.

Senate Democrats are refusing to fund the government until majority Republicans restore cuts to Medicaid and Obamacare that the Congressional Budget Office says will end health insurance from 10.9 million people.

Trump has power to fire workers, shutter agencies: Speaker Johnson

House Speaker Mike Johnson said President Trump was given “the keys to the kingdom” to lay off federal workers and close agencies during the shutdown.

“This is the way the system works,” Johnson, R-Louisiana, told reporters Oct. 2. “When Congress turns off the funding, and the funding runs out, it’s up to the commander in chief, the president of the United States, will determine how those resources will be spent.”

Johnson was asked if it was appropriate for Trump to target political opponents with spending cuts, after the administration halted $18 billion in funding for two New York City transit projects, a Second Avenue subway and Hudson River tunnel. New York is home of both congressional Democratic leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.

“When they are tasked with determining what the priorities are, obviously they are going to follow their principles and priorities and not the other team,” Johnson said of Trump and the administration. “That’s the results of an election that everyone voted in.”

Shutdown unlikely to end today

The Senate does not have votes scheduled Thursday in observance of Yom Kippur.

It is scheduled to return Friday, when Senate Majority Leader John Thune of North Dakota is expected to make his next attempt at passing the GOP spending bill.

Though the House is also expected to return Friday, the chamber has already passed the GOP bill and all action is expected to be on the Senate side of the Capitol building.

Speaker Johnson urges colleagues to ignore sombreros

GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he urged his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, to ignore social-media memes he called “games” and “sideshows” to help reopen the government.

President Donald Trump had posted a clip of Jeffries at the White House wearing a fake sombrero and mustache, which Jeffries called racist. The White House ran the clip on a loop in the briefing room for hours on Oct. 1.

Johnson said all lawmakers become the butt of internet jokes. Johnson noted that California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted a meme of the speaker as a cartoon Minion.

“To my friend Hakeem: ‘Man, just ignore it,’” Johnson added. “Gavin Newsom was trolling me last night. He painted me like a Minion. He painted me yellow with big glasses and overalls. I thought it was hilarious. You don’t respond to it.”

Prolonged shutdown could have a big impact on child care

Federal dollars and programs support child care facilities across the country, including Head Start and Child Care and Development Block Grants. Head Start programs with grant cycles that begin in October will likely experience disruptions in the short term, according to First Focus on Children, a bipartisan advocacy nonprofit focused on supports for women and children. A prolonged shutdown could mean shuttered classrooms.

Most federal Head Start programs are not likely to be impacted, said Sydney Petersen of the National Women’s Law Center. “But that could change if the shutdown drags on.” There are few Head Start programs – impacting roughly 6,500 children and families – that have funding cycles that began Oct. 1.

First Five Years Fund, another organization building federal support for early childhood learning programs, posted about the shutdown on Oct. 1 saying there is “cause for watchful concern but not for panic.” There’s unlikely to be disrupted child care services in the short term, the analysis reads, but “the longer a shutdown continues, the more likely it is that Head Start programs could see a disruption.”

Working caregivers are especially vulnerable to the effects of a government shutdown, according to research from the Society for Human Resource Management.

What’s open during a government shutdown?

There are some services that still remain open despite the government being shut down.

These include the U.S. postal service, banks, air-traffic control and courts. Federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, DEA and prison staff, will remain operational. The Secret Service and Coast Guard will continue their duties.

All active-duty personnel stay on the job, but nearly half of the Department of War's 741,477 civilian employees could face furloughs.

In general, national parks will remain open “park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,"" according to the Department of Interior's contingency plan.

Some lawmakers request their pay be withheld while shutdown continues

Lawmakers will continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown under Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution, which protects Congress' pay.

But some members have said that they’ve requested that their pay be withheld until the shutdown is over. Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan wrote on X that she did not take a salary during the last government shutdown and won’t take one now.

Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy and Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Chris Deluzio posted images of letters they each wrote addressed to Catherine Szpindor, the chief administrative officer of the House, asking for their pay to be withheld.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted Democratic lawmakers who continue to accept their salary while the shutdown will delay paychecks for 1.3 million active-duty military troops, 150,000 federal law enforcement officers and 13,000 air-traffic controllers until the spending dispute is resolved.

“I saw some Democrat members today saying they are still going to accept their paychecks because they have three kids at home and they have mouths to feed,” Leavitt told reporters Oct. 1. “Well, so do these federal workers who those same Democrats just voted to shut down the government and turn off their pay. We think that’s very unfair.”

Trump looks to cut 'Democrat agencies'

President Donald Trump he would meet with Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought to determine which “Democrat Agencies” to eliminate to save money during the shutdown.

Trump has warned of “irreversible” cuts during the shutdown and “vast” layoffs will be easier to accomplish during the shutdown because there is no congressional spending legislation in place to fund the government. Vought helped draft a Project 2025 report with recommendations and widespread agency cuts.

“I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,” Trump said in a social media post Oct. 2.--Bart Jansen

DOJ asks to delay court cases in shutdown

The Justice Department has begun asking federal courts to delay pending litigation during the shutdown by arguing that lawyers and other staffers are mostly forbidden from working even on a voluntary basis.

But lawyers opposing the government in at least two of the cases opposed the requests. One case involves Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant fighting deportation to Eswatini. The other case involves DC trying to block President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in the federal city.

Until Congress reaches a funding compromise to reopen the government, Justice lawyers and employees of federal defendants “are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis” except in “emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,” according to a filing led by Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate.

But he noted Garcia opposes the request.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland set a hearing Oct. 24 to hear arguments about either blocking the deportation or dismissing the case – unless she grants the government’s request for a delay.

In the DC case, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb set a series of filing deadlines this month Shumate asked to postpone. But DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb said the department’s shutdown guidance allows working on motions to block government actions despite a lapse in appropriations.

“This case is a poor candidate in which to make an exception from that approach,” Schwalb wrote in a filing. “More than 2,300 armed National Guard troops are currently patrolling the District unlawfully. That unprecedented deployment is inflicting irreparable harm to the District’s sovereignty, its economy, and public safety.”

Trump takes back seat on first day of shutdown

Trump made no public appearances on the first day of the shutdown, with the White House instead deploying Vice President JD Vance to address the media. Vance blamed the “Chuck Schumer-AOC wing” of the Democratic Party for what he called a “Democrat shutdown.”

Vance called for Democrats to vote to reopen the government before and then engage later in separate negotiations over health-care policy. But Democrats in Congress continued to demand the reversal of Medicaid cuts that Republicans passed this year and the extension of health care subsidies be included in a funding measure.

“Donald Trump and Republicans shut the federal government down because they don’t want to provide health care to working-class Americans,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.

Trump and Republicans have countered by accusing Democrats of wanting to provide health care for immigrants who are in the country illegally. Democrats have called the claims a lie, noting that undocumented immigrants aren’t eligible for payments from Medicare, Medicaid, or the Affordable Care Act.

What government services are impacted by a shutdown? Is Social Security at risk?

Social Security checks will still be delivered during the shutdown. Medicare and Medicaid benefits also will still be paid, but many other aspects of the federal government have halted during the shutdown.

All federal agencies and services that officials do not deem ""essential"" must stop working during a shutdown.

About 750,000 ""nonessential"" federal employees ranging from workers at national parks to financial regulators could be furloughed each day under a shutdown, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, withholding about $400 million in daily compensation.

Federal workers in essential services such as the Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security services, air-traffic control and the military will continue to work but won't be paid until the government reopens.

White House keeps trolling Jeffries with sombrero video

Trump has no plans to meet with Democratic congressional leaders again following their meeting earlier in the week. And in a sign of the divide, the White House keeps trolling Jeffries with videos portraying the Democratic leader in a fake mustache and sombrero.

Trump posted the AI-generated videos on his social media accounts ahead of the shutdown. By Wednesday afternoon, the White House was playing the controversial ads on loop on televisions in the press briefing room.

Vance brushed off criticism from Jeffries and other Democrats who have called the videos racist. The videos also include made up audio of Schumer making derogatory comments about immigrants, as mariachi music played in the background.

“The president's joking,” Vance said Wednesay when asked about the videos. “And we're having a good time.”

The vice president added: “Hakeem Jeffries said it was racist, and I know that he said that, and I honestly don’t even know what that means. Like, is he a Mexican-American that is offended by having a sombrero meme?”

Mass layoffs of federal workers to begin imminently, White House says

Vought, the White House's budget chief, told House Republicans in a private call Wednesday that mass layoffs of federal workers will begin in ""a day or two,"" according to a lawmaker on the call.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, during a briefing with reporters, did not elaborate on which federal departments could be affected, or how many workers could be fired. But she said layoffs are ""imminent.""

Historically, nonessential federal workers are placed on furloughs during government shutdowns, but they are not part of widespread federal workforce layoffs. Trump has also said he might use a government shutdown to eliminate federal programs he opposes. ""A lot of good can come down from shutdowns,"" Trump said on Sept. 30. ""We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want.""

Trump's threats come after his administration has already fired tens of thousands of federal workers as part of his Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to downsize the federal government.

She went online and watched countless videos of masked, heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents breaking the car windows of immigrants to wrestle them out of their cars, and detaining people at their workplaces, like restaurants, car washes, and agricultural fields. Many of her friends told her about ICE sweeps in heavily Latino apartment complexes near her home.

While Claudia is a naturalized citizen with full legal status to be in the United States, in April, she started carrying her passport in her car in case ICE agents confronted her. Claudia works for herself, cleaning houses and individual apartments, and has never been in trouble with the law. Still, because she “looks” Latina, with darker features than some fair-skinned Latinos, she believes ICE agents would target her for questioning and even detainment if their paths should cross.

“They (ICE agents) are racial profiling,” Claudia tells palabra. “I feel this about people who are in office trying to make this country white. Every week, something happens to good people who are just trying to work. At this point, I don’t feel safe even with my passport. They’ve picked up citizens. ICE agents are acting with a lot of hate. They don’t care if you show them a passport; they don’t want to see it. They’re using violence against people walking on the street or driving in their cars.”

Asked for a response about the fear experienced by many people who are in the country legally, the ICE press office provided this comment via email:

“In the United States, immigration laws mandate that all non-U.S. citizens carry proof of their authorization to be in the United States. This requirement, rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act, emphasizes the importance of having immediate access to documentation that verifies one’s right to be in the U.S. Whether you are a visitor, a student, or a permanent resident, understanding and complying with this law is crucial for navigating daily life in the United States without legal complications. Stating that a fear of law enforcement is the main reason for carrying such documents, which are required by law, is like saying the reason you carry a driver’s license on your person while driving a vehicle is because you are afraid of the police. Bottom line: it's the law. What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

White House Border Czar Tom Homan said in an interview earlier this year that ICE agents don’t need probable cause to detain people briefly, explaining that an individual’s appearance is reason enough for immigration officers to detain someone.

“People need to understand, ICE officers and Border Patrol do not need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them,” Homan said on “Fox and Friends.” “They just go through their observations, get articulable facts, based on their location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions.”

There are countless examples on YouTube, on X (formerly Twitter), and on TikTok of ICE agents aggressively questioning – and sometimes handcuffing and detaining – people who are in the country legally.

ICE agents have detained U.S. citizens as well as permanent legal residents.

Some examples:

In early August, ICE agents conducting a raid at a car wash in Anaheim, Calif., about 26 miles southeast of Los Angeles, tackled and detained U.S. citizen Isaac Domínguez. Domínguez told the local NBC affiliate and KCAL News that he was driving to the car wash when he saw ICE agents and pulled over. “That’s when I got upset because I think to myself, they’re just attacking Hispanic people. They tackled me to the floor and put the cuffs on me, hands behind my back.”

A Department of Homeland Security official released a statement accusing Domínguez of tossing an object at a government law enforcement vehicle and of trying to punch ICE agents who approached him, which he denies. After several hours, authorities released him without any charges.

In June, ICE agents in Los Angeles detained U.S. citizen Andrea Vélez. The woman said her mom and sister dropped her off on a downtown street where masked, plainclothes men were “going after” people. One of them grabbed her, and when she tried to tell him she’s a U.S. citizen, he accused her of impeding him. When she asked for his badge number or identification, he responded that she didn’t need to know any of that, she said in an interview with the Los Angeles NBC affiliate.

Vélez said she told other ICE officers she is a U.S. citizen and showed them her real ID, but they didn’t believe her. A report on the news program Democracy Now! showed video of an ICE agent carrying Vélez, who is 4’11. She spent two days in a detention center and had nothing to drink for 24 hours. In a criminal complaint, federal prosecutors alleged Vélez stepped into an agent’s path and extended an arm in an apparent attempt to prevent an ICE agent from catching a man he was chasing. Authorities released her after 48 hours, and prosecutors dropped the charge against her.

In April, at the request of federal immigration officials, authorities in Florida held Juan Carlos López-Gómez in a local jail in Leon County, which is in the Florida Panhandle region. Local authorities detained him even after his mother presented his birth certificate and Social Security information to a local judge. Florida Highway Patrol officers, who have been deputized by Gov. Ron DeSantis to conduct immigration enforcement, acted on a request by ICE and took the 20-year-old to jail following a routine traffic stop for speeding - he was a passenger in the car and was coming to Florida from Georgia for work. López-Gómez was born in Georgia.

He was released after the case received widespread media coverage.

ICE’s aggressive tactics have even sparked fear among some non-Hispanic, white immigrants who are in the country legally.

For example, Katia, a white South African immigrant who is a naturalized citizen and lives in Fairfax County, Va., says ICE’s approach prompted her in recent months to always carry her U.S. passport inside her bag. (Katia is not her real name; like Claudia, she asked to be identified by a pseudonym because she fears retaliation from ICE). She worries about how an ICE agent would react if they heard her speak and noticed her South African accent.

Katia, who is in her 50s, works in communications for a social justice organization. She came to the U.S. in the early 1990s and became a naturalized citizen in 1994.

She says that the type of tactics ICE is currently using was common in South Africa, which had an apartheid government at the time she emigrated to the U.S. “It was common practice for (South African) authorities to pull people off the street and ship immigrants off to their home countries. I didn’t think I’d ever see that happen in the U.S.”

When she became a U.S. citizen, “Americans were so lovely to me. People I would tell would give me a hug,” she says. “Randos would congratulate me. It seemed they were touched that I would want to become an American citizen. I don’t feel that way anymore.”

The Trump administration’s mass deportation program is not the first time the U.S. government has carried out a campaign to expel immigrants on a mass scale.

In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched “Operation Wetback” to send Mexican immigrants, including some who were American citizens, to their native country. Border Patrol officers carried out the program, which lasted several months. At the time, Border Patrol officers claimed that 1.2 million people of Mexican descent were either arrested or left the U.S. on their own, but some researchers believe that number was exaggerated, and that the true number was in the hundreds of thousands.

The federal government at some point will pay a steep price in court for the overzealous tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol, a civil rights attorney says.

""The U.S. government will face significant financial liability in court for ICE’s aggressive tactics, says Cary J. Hansel, a civil rights attorney in Baltimore. Hansel adds that civil lawsuits on behalf of those unlawfully detained by ICE, alleging ICE is violating the 14th Amendment – which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and provides “equal protection under the law” in addition to prohibiting the government from depriving individuals of due process – will lead to large jury verdicts or settlements.

“There will be a tremendous price to pay for this kind of lazy and unconstitutional conduct. In a democracy that values freedom, people should not have to show their papers to prove they belong. This conduct turns the Constitution on its head.”

Claudia, an immigrant from Chile who lives in suburban Maryland right outside Washington, D.C., watched closely as the Trump administration ramped up its mass deportation campaign during the spring (Claudia, not her real name, asked to be identified by a pseudonym because she is afraid of federal immigration agents).

She went online and watched countless videos of masked, heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents breaking the car windows of immigrants to wrestle them out of their cars, and detaining people at their workplaces, like restaurants, car washes, and agricultural fields. Many of her friends told her about ICE sweeps in heavily Latino apartment complexes near her home.

While Claudia is a naturalized citizen with full legal status to be in the United States, in April, she started carrying her passport in her car in case ICE agents confronted her. Claudia works for herself, cleaning houses and individual apartments, and has never been in trouble with the law. Still, because she “looks” Latina, with darker features than some fair-skinned Latinos, she believes ICE agents would target her for questioning and even detainment if their paths should cross.

“They (ICE agents) are racial profiling,” Claudia tells palabra. “I feel this about people who are in office trying to make this country white. Every week, something happens to good people who are just trying to work. At this point, I don’t feel safe even with my passport. They’ve picked up citizens. ICE agents are acting with a lot of hate. They don’t care if you show them a passport; they don’t want to see it. They’re using violence against people walking on the street or driving in their cars.”

Asked for a response about the fear experienced by many people who are in the country legally, the ICE press office provided this comment via email:

“In the United States, immigration laws mandate that all non-U.S. citizens carry proof of their authorization to be in the United States. This requirement, rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act, emphasizes the importance of having immediate access to documentation that verifies one’s right to be in the U.S. Whether you are a visitor, a student, or a permanent resident, understanding and complying with this law is crucial for navigating daily life in the United States without legal complications. Stating that a fear of law enforcement is the main reason for carrying such documents, which are required by law, is like saying the reason you carry a driver’s license on your person while driving a vehicle is because you are afraid of the police. Bottom line: it's the law. What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

White House Border Czar Tom Homan said in an interview earlier this year that ICE agents don’t need probable cause to detain people briefly, explaining that an individual’s appearance is reason enough for immigration officers to detain someone.

“People need to understand, ICE officers and Border Patrol do not need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them,” Homan said on “Fox and Friends.” “They just go through their observations, get articulable facts, based on their location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions.”

There are countless examples on YouTube, on X (formerly Twitter), and on TikTok of ICE agents aggressively questioning – and sometimes handcuffing and detaining – people who are in the country legally.

ICE agents have detained U.S. citizens as well as permanent legal residents.

Some examples:

In early August, ICE agents conducting a raid at a car wash in Anaheim, Calif., about 26 miles southeast of Los Angeles, tackled and detained U.S. citizen Isaac Domínguez. Domínguez told the local NBC affiliate and KCAL News that he was driving to the car wash when he saw ICE agents and pulled over. “That’s when I got upset because I think to myself, they’re just attacking Hispanic people. They tackled me to the floor and put the cuffs on me, hands behind my back.”

A Department of Homeland Security official released a statement accusing Domínguez of tossing an object at a government law enforcement vehicle and of trying to punch ICE agents who approached him, which he denies. After several hours, authorities released him without any charges.

In June, ICE agents in Los Angeles detained U.S. citizen Andrea Vélez. The woman said her mom and sister dropped her off on a downtown street where masked, plainclothes men were “going after” people. One of them grabbed her, and when she tried to tell him she’s a U.S. citizen, he accused her of impeding him. When she asked for his badge number or identification, he responded that she didn’t need to know any of that, she said in an interview with the Los Angeles NBC affiliate.

Vélez said she told other ICE officers she is a U.S. citizen and showed them her real ID, but they didn’t believe her. A report on the news program Democracy Now! showed video of an ICE agent carrying Vélez, who is 4’11. She spent two days in a detention center and had nothing to drink for 24 hours. In a criminal complaint, federal prosecutors alleged Vélez stepped into an agent’s path and extended an arm in an apparent attempt to prevent an ICE agent from catching a man he was chasing. Authorities released her after 48 hours, and prosecutors dropped the charge against her.

In April, at the request of federal immigration officials, authorities in Florida held Juan Carlos López-Gómez in a local jail in Leon County, which is in the Florida Panhandle region. Local authorities detained him even after his mother presented his birth certificate and Social Security information to a local judge. Florida Highway Patrol officers, who have been deputized by Gov.

The failure to sign the Presidential Determination for Fiscal Year 2026, which began on October 1st, blocks any refugees from being resettled and compounds the harm felt globally by refugees impacted by the administration’s day one Refugee Ban, which remains largely in place.

“The Trump administration must end its refusal to resettle stranded refugees who face grave risks of persecution around the world,” said Eleanor Acer, Senior Director for Global Humanitarian Protection at Human Rights First. “A strong resettlement initiative is a vital lifeline for people at risk of persecution. Resettlement also advances U.S. interests by easing pressures on frontline countries that host the substantial majority of the world’s refugees, helping to promote global cooperation and stability. The Trump administration cannot avoid questions about its exclusion of thousands of at-risk refugees who had already been vetted and approved for U.S. resettlement, and its hijacking of the U.S. refugee admissions program to facilitate the migration of white Afrikaners to the United States.”

Globally, UNHCR has assessed that over 2.5 million refugees are in need of resettlement in 2026. Nearly 70 per cent of refugees find safety in the country next door to their own, and most are hosted by low- and middle-income nations. Refugees often face the threat of further persecution, violence, severe deprivations, or return to persecution while awaiting resettlement.

The Trump administration has declined to defend the federal election law and Democrats have intervened.","The Supreme Court begins a new term Monday that could shape the power of the presidency, determine the role of race and federal control of elections and curtail LGBT rights nationwide — with more cases on the horizon on contentious policy and political issues.

The 6-3 conservative-controlled court has agreed to decide cases on more than half a dozen major issues, including President Donald Trump’s tariffs affecting trillions of dollars in international trade, the use of race in redistricting and whether a ban on so-called “conversion therapy” violates free speech rights.

Aziz Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago who focuses on constitutional law, is among experts who said the justices have set up for themselves a blockbuster term.

“What’s really striking is how aggressively the justices have inserted themselves into not just hot-button issues of the culture wars, but into questions about basic terms, and even the health of American democracy, and particularly through its emergency docket,” Huq said.

By the time the term concludes at the end of June, the Supreme Court also could add to its docket of cases set for oral arguments. Across the nation, states, interest groups and companies have challenged Trump administration moves to reshape the federal government, any of which could end up at the court by the end of this term.

Along the way, the justices are poised to make consequential decisions through its emergency docket, where the justices have made preliminary decisions on issues such as immigration enforcement, the firing of officials at independent agencies and government spending with sweeping consequences for policy.

In the past nine months, the court has issued dozens of those preliminary decisions in favor of the Trump administration, frequently overruling lower courts that found he likely broke the law.

Trump’s power

The justices will hear arguments in November about the legality of Trump’s so-called Liberation Day tariffs on most countries worldwide, as well as additional ones on China, Mexico and Canada.

And they will hear arguments in December over the power of the president to fire federal officials at independent agencies after Trump has cleared out dozens of Democratic appointees to boards ranging from the National Labor Relations Board to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

In the tariffs case, the administration has argued that in emergency situations, such as facing large imports of illegal drugs or massive trade deficits, the president has the power to “regulate” imports, which includes setting tariffs.

Both the U.S. Court of International Trade and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, finding that Congress did not give the president the authority to set tariff rates with the law. The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to keep the tariffs in place as it decides the issue.

While the case hinges on the meaning of the word “regulate” in a 1977 trade law, experts said the case could ripple across presidential power more broadly, redefining how much power presidents can read into a law passed by Congress.

Alan B. Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, said at a recent event that the case will be a key test for the balance of power between the presidency and the justices. He said this same conservative-controlled court has routinely ruled against broad claims of presidential power in recent years, saying Congress must be explicit when answering “major questions” of political and economic policy.

“If that isn’t a major question, I don’t know what is,” Morrison said of the tariff case.

Whether the court sticks to that trend in the tariffs case will be a major test for the current majority, he said.

“If they don’t say no to Trump in this tariffs case, then in terms of regulation of his authority, they’re not going to say no to anything on the firing cases, on the removal of officers, or virtually anything else,” Morrison said. “This seems to be it.”

In the firings case, Democratic Federal Trade Commission appointee Rebecca Slaughter has challenged Trump’s firing of her, arguing that Congress intended to keep the vast powers of the FTC insulated from direct presidential control.

At the core of the case is a 90-year-old decision known as Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, where the court held that presidents could not fire the members of multi-member executive agencies such as the FTC. In several emergency cases over the past few months the justices have preliminarily allowed Trump to remove officials, signaling a possible end to congressionally mandated firing protections.

Huq said that allowing a president such a free hand in who sits on independent agencies could enable more behavior like that of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, who last week threatened the licenses of TV stations that air criticism of the president.

“I think it’s a different thing entirely for an entity to be pursuing, not a substantive policy but punishing critics of a particular president, using its regulatory powers,” Huq said. “There’s just a world of difference between changing policy on how the net be run and engaging in viewpoint discrimination against critics of the president in a fairly straightforward violation of the First Amendment.”

Experts also said that numerous other hot-button issues could end up before the Supreme Court, including the legality of Trump’s effort to curtail birthright citizenship through executive order. The Trump administration has filed an application for the justices to hear the legality of that effort.

Federal elections

The Supreme Court has taken on three major election law cases, including the future of the Voting Rights Act, the legality of limits on political party coordination and what, exactly, constitutes Election Day.

The justices asked to hear arguments about the constitutionality of a second Black opportunity district in Louisiana, which has been tangled in litigation for years. The court fight could result in yet another map for Louisiana and change the rules for redistricting nationwide.

The case involves an apparent conflict between the VRA, which requires states to provide minority communities with an opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice, and the Constitution’s ban on racial discrimination.

The justices have asked the state and two sets of challengers to argue over “Whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.”

Spencer Overton, a law professor at George Washington University, said the Louisiana case is about “nothing less than the survival of Section 2 of the VRA,” which guarantees minority voters the opportunity to vote for candidates of their choice.

About 80 percent of Congressional Black Caucus members come from such districts and depending on how the court rules then those district lines could be subject to court challenge, Overton said.

Such a decision could allow even more slanted political maps, Overton said, after a decision several years ago prohibited federal courts from getting involved with partisan gerrymandering claims.

“After that, Section 2 was one of the few brakes on unbridled gerrymandering here,” Overton said. “That is another reason why so much is at stake.”

The justices also will decide a GOP-led challenge to limitations on party coordinated spending on behalf of political candidates. The Trump administration has declined to defend the federal election law and Democrats have intervened.

Jennifer Nou, a law professor at University of Chicago, said at an event last month that the current Supreme Court had struck down other Federal Election Commission limits and were “in tension” with the older cases upholding the current spending limit.

Nou said a decision against party coordinated spending would allow Trump greater control over federal elections through his role as the head of the Republican party. That “effectively will allow presidential control to be augmented over federal elections when the president can control the party,” she said.

In another case out of Illinois, the court could decide how to handle late-arriving mail ballots, an issue that Republicans have pushed since the 2020 election, when Democrats saw a significant advantage in mail voting.

LGBT rights

The justices will decide two sets of LGBT rights cases: one on the legality of bans on transgender girls participating in girls’ sports and the second on the constitutionality of so-called “conversion therapy” bans.

Although the cases concern state laws in Idaho, West Virginia and Colorado, the justices’ rulings in those cases could reverberate nationwide. Republicans in the House emphasized those stakes, filing a brief on behalf of the chamber in the West Virginia case last week. They emphasized that a ruling in favor of the transgender athletes could “open the floodgates” to children competing in sports nationwide.

“Affirming the decision below would mean that states and local school boards lack the power to separate sports programs based on biological sex and could mean the same for Congress,” the brief said.

The Trump administration has made a major issue of restricting transgender girls’ participation in girls’ sports, including signing an executive order restricting federal funds from going to programs that allow it. The administration has also filed suit against California and Maine over allegedly defying the ban.

Congressional Republicans have gotten involved too, passing a standalone bill to bar federal funds from programs that allow transgender girls to participate in girls’ sports. Additionally, House Republicans advanced an education spending bill to prohibit federal funds from going to programs that allow the same.

The court is also facing a petition to overturn its 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, but it has not decided yet whether to hear the case.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/scotus_BC_022_100724.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 17:57:52.407002

“I worry about the people around me, about staff who are concerned, and I worry about my family,” Larson said.","With one day to go until a crucial fundraising deadline, U.S. Rep. John Larson’s reelection campaign issued a warning in an email blast: The congressman had been added to a “Homeland Security Watchlist” and could use the support in the face of criticism from the Trump administration.

“We must support the members of Congress who have the courage to stand up to Trump and his authoritarian regime. John isn’t backing down, and neither can we,” Monday’s email read, with several links that redirect to a campaign donation page.

Connecticut Democrats in Washington have all been publicly outspoken since President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy has been one of the most visible, with repeated warnings about an eroding democracy, prompting the president himself to directly call him out on some occasions.

But Larson was the only member of Connecticut’s delegation who ended up on a list compiled earlier this month by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It named Democrats and groups whom the agency characterized as having “hateful and violent” rhetoric, specifically in regards to immigration enforcement officials.

In recent weeks, his campaign has drawn a lot of attention to the department’s list in fundraising pleas, and Larson recently called it a “badge of honor.” It could prove to be beneficial — an inadvertent boost by DHS — as the 14-term congressman seeks to confront criticism from Democratic challengers that he and others in Congress need to do more to resist Trump.

Larson said he felt compelled to speak out because of raids carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that were happening in Connecticut’s 1st Congressional District — even as his office has experienced an increase in “threatening calls.”

“Based on what transpired in Newington, Connecticut, in my district, with mothers being snatched from their children, how could you be silenced? How can you not speak out on the behalf of those individuals? If [DHS] is offended with the analogy, where else have you seen in American history those that need to enforce the Constitution do so with black masks and weapons drawn,” Larson said in an interview.

The Department of Homeland Security compiled a list of more than 30 examples of what they characterize as incendiary remarks toward agents and personnel who work for ICE. The department called on those lawmakers and others listed to stop “demonizing” law enforcement. But the release didn’t issue any specific directives or actions beyond that.

Larson is the only person from Connecticut on the Homeland Security list.

“Following the evil act of political violence in the country this week and two brutal assaults on our brave ICE law enforcement last week, we are once again calling on the media and the far left to stop the hateful rhetoric directed at President Trump, those who support him, and our brave DHS law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

“This demonization is inspiring violence across the country,” she continued. “We have to turn down the temperature before someone else is killed. This violence must end.”

DHS singled out Larson’s comments at an August press conference in Connecticut. In it, the visibly frustrated congressman shouted about the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and compared masked ICE agents, who are conducting raids and arrests across the U.S., to the “SS” and “Gestapo.”

“This is not Germany. That is the SS and the Gestapo,” Larson said at the time. “This is the United States of America. Unmask yourselves.”

In response to DHS’ characterization of his remarks, Larson said Wednesday he didn’t see the remarks as hateful and said they were “intended to make a point.”

“If you’re not going to speak out about that, what are you going to speak out about? I wasn’t intimidated and won’t be,” he said. “If you’re offended by [the analogy], well then so be it.”

Larson took particular issue with masked ICE agents arresting multiple workers at separate car washes in Newington and Southington, which are both in his Hartford-based district. The congressman has co-sponsored federal legislation, called the “No Secret Police Act of 2025,” that seeks to bar ICE agents from wearing any kind of face covering and requires them to provide identification.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong has called the DHS report “reckless.” And he called the Trump administration irresponsible for naming political opponents, which he warned could lead to more acts of violence.

Larson, 77, faces his first competitive primary since winning an open seat in 1998.

He has drawn several Democratic challengers, including former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, 46, and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, 43, of West Hartford. They have called for generational change and questioned whether current members of Congress, especially those who have served for a while, are up for the task of standing up to the administration.

Larson’s challengers have called into question, both directly and indirectly, his ability to be an effective communicator and disruptor in this Trump era.

“We can’t bring the change we need by doing the exact same things the exact same way,” Gilchrest said during her August campaign announcement. “I appreciate the work he has done, but I think we need elected officials who can work on multiple issues at the same time and can be out there pushing for change every single day, and I don’t see that happening currently.”

Without explicitly naming Larson, Bronin has also questioned how Congress currently operates and cited several lawmakers around the country, including Murphy, whose communication and messaging style should be replicated.

“They’re just communicating with a relentlessness and an energy that is different, and that’s what we need,” Bronin said during an interview with the Connecticut Mirror in early September. “I think we need to see that from every member of Congress. The job of being a member of Congress is different, and that’s what we need.”

But Larson has brushed off the criticism from his opponents, who, he quipped, were “the ones who nominated me for office” in previous years.

“I think the truth speaks for itself. And when you don’t have much to campaign on, when you say you agree with all the votes I’m taking and how I’ve conducted myself and what we’ve been able to do for the district, I think you gotta ask them,” Larson said.

Larson’s campaign has sent out a few emails in recent weeks with fundraising appeals highlighting the pushback he got for his comments and his promise that he “will not back down” to Trump. The most recent carried the subject line “Stop Trump’s Democratic Watch List,” with buttons to contribute money before the end of the fundraising deadline, which was Tuesday.

One email linked to an article noting the same comments that landed him on the DHS list. The email said Fox News was “attacking me again for holding Donald Trump’s Administration accountable.” Another noted that Larson used to work as a high school history teacher and asked the reader to see if they could tell “if America were sliding toward dictatorship.”

The administration’s list isn’t the first time Larson has drawn national attention for his impassioned remarks about President Trump. He had a breakout moment in March where he complained that then-DOGE leader Elon Musk wouldn’t answer questions from Congress about Social Security and how federal cuts could affect the program.

While the primary is still in the early stages, the upcoming fundraising reports will offer a first snapshot of the financial health of each campaign.

Bronin raised over $800,000 in the two weeks after jumping into the race, according to figures provided by his campaign in August. Larson and the others will similarly need to post big numbers this month. All declared candidates will need to file the next quarterly fundraising numbers by Oct. 15.

The congressman’s most recent filing from July showed he had about $262,000 in his campaign account. (That report covered April through June, before anyone had jumped into the race.) That number is largely on track with quarterly fundraising hauls in recent election cycles, though he didn’t face primary challengers in those races.

Attention from the administration can be a double-edged sword. While it can help rally Democrats’ base and encourage fundraising, that scrutiny can also bring a groundswell of targeted pushback that can range from relatively harmless to credible threats of violence.

Debate over political rhetoric became magnified in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s fatal shooting earlier this month. And so have overall concerns on safety.

Lawmakers and political leaders are becoming increasingly worried about threats of political violence as both parties face more threats. Congress wants to beef up security funding with $30 million for congressional lawmakers and $58 million for the judicial and executive branches. They included that pot of money in short-term funding bills, but it has stalled indefinitely with the federal government in a shutdown.

Staff with Larson’s office said they receive an “uptick” in threats over the phone when the congressman calls out the administration like he has recently. They said they work closely with Capitol Police and local law enforcement to make sure the threat is handled properly.

“I worry about the people around me, about staff who are concerned, and I worry about my family,” Larson said. “But personally, no. Suffice it to say, when confronted with the right thing to do, you do the right thing.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25273738975767-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 13:56:47.290573

Close to half of Americans blame President Trump and Republicans for the current government shutdown, according to a new poll.

In the poll from The Washington Post, 47 percent of respondents said “Trump and Republicans in Congress” are “mainly responsible for the federal government partially shutting down,” while 30 percent pinned the blame on “Democrats in Congress” for the shutdown.

In the survey, 66 percent of respondents said they are either “very” or “somewhat” concerned over the shutdown, while 34 percent said they are “not too” or “not at all” concerned.

The Post poll took place Wednesday, featuring 1,010 people and a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

The federal government formally went into a shutdown at 12:01 a.m. EDT Wednesday in the wake of congressional leaders being unable to come to a deal over a stopgap spending bill, leaving lawmakers struggling over how to move forward.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday evening he had not heard from the White House since a sit-down with Trump and other congressional leaders.

“We haven’t heard from the White House since the White House meeting on Monday. The president has been behaving, you know, somewhat erratically and in [an] unconventional fashion in the context of the government shutting down,” Jeffries told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead.”

“Clearly, they wanted to shut the government down, unfortunately,” he added. “We’re ready to work together to bring it back open, but to do it in a way where we enact a spending agreement that’s bipartisan, that meets the needs of the American people, while at the same time addresses the Republican health care crisis that is devastating everyday Americans all across the country.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told The Hill, “I think there are a lot of Democrat people who are looking for a way out. They want an off-ramp here.

“There’s a good amount of outreach going on and conversations being held. We’ll see where it goes.”

CHICAGO — Cook County Public Defender Sharone Mitchell Jr. joined more than a dozen legal groups and social service organizations in asking for a court order banning warrantless immigration arrests in and around county courthouses.

The petition, which was sent to Chief Judge Timothy Evans Tuesday evening and was co-lead by the MacArthur Justice Center, asks for a general order that would prohibit civil arrests — unless the officer has a warrant signed by a judge — in or near Cook County courthouses. Areas near courthouses would include entryways, driveways, sidewalks, parking areas and nearby public transit stops.

Sharlyn Grace, Cook County’s deputy public defender for policy, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have targeted people on their way to and from court.

“Court information is public, so we have every reason to believe that these immigration enforcement agents are looking at public court records and then targeting people on the day that they know they have to be at a specific place at a specific time,” Grace said.

Grace said that in most courthouse arrests, ICE agents do not even show a warrant. Criminal arrest warrants, which are signed by a judge, would not be affected by the proposed general order.

Evans’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“If we don’t protect people who are following state of Illinois court orders, the court runs the risk of unwittingly facilitating the federal government’s immigration agenda,” Grace said.

The general order would help provide guidance to court employees on what to do when they see immigration enforcement agents, Grace said.

While ICE’s presence at Cook County courthouses began to increase at the start of the year, Grace said it has most notably ramped up over the last month. Since the end of July, the public defender’s office has confirmed about a dozen immigration-related arrests at or near county courthouses. Grace said there have been a few other incidents where ICE agents have been present outside a courthouse but have not made any arrests.

Grace said the general order would not just benefit undocumented court users.

“The presence of unidentified armed agents at courthouse locations impacts everyone who wants to enter a court and needs to feel safe to do so,” Grace said.

Several of the groups petitioning for the general order work with domestic violence survivors. In early September, two people were arrested by ICE agents at Cook County’s Domestic Violence Courthouse.

“Recent ICE presence at courthouses and shelters, spaces where survivors and their families are following the law and desperately seeking a sense of safety, is resulting in survivors retreating further into silence — and danger,” the group Mujeres Latinas en Acción wrote in a recent press release. “Survivors are increasingly afraid to seek orders of protection, appear in court, or call the police when they or their children are at risk.”

A 2021 memo issued by the Department of Homeland Security advised federal officers to limit immigration enforcement in or near courthouses. However, a department memo released in May repealed that guidance.

In 2020, New York passed legislation prohibiting ICE from making civil arrests at courthouses without a judicial warrant.

Grace said ICE’s presence in and around courthouses presents clients “with an impossible choice” between not following a court order and potentially being arrested, or risking being deported.

ICE Sightings In Chicago

Federal agents detained four people outside a homeless shelter in Bronzeville Wednesday morning.

In a social media post, the Northwest Side Rapid Response Team said that federal agents detained four people in Albany Park Wednesday. Two people were arrested at North Lawndale and West Leland avenues around 8:30 a.m., one person was arrested near Pulaski and Lawrence avenues at 8:45 a.m. and one person was detained in front of Roosevelt High School, 3436 W. Wilson Ave., at 8:17 a.m., according to the group.

The Northwest Side Rapid Response Team also posted that one person was detained by federal agents at the Home Depot at North Normandy and West Altgeld avenues, in Belmont Cragin, at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday.

ICE Sightings In The Suburbs

The Berwyn-Cicero Rapid Response Network posted on Facebook that federal agents detained at least five people between 10-11 a.m. Wednesday. Agents made arrests in the parking lots of the Walmart at 3320 S. Cicero Ave., the Home Depot at 2803 S. Cicero Ave. and the Target at 2901 S. Cicero Ave.

However, KGW’s on-the-ground reporting, as well as interviews with residents nearby, suggest the situation was not as described.

In the statement to KGW, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, said, in full:

""DHS’ heroic law enforcement officers continue to hold the line against violent rioters in Portland – even as radical leftist politicians hold their pay hostage. Tuesday night, over 100 rioters stormed an ICE facility in Portland. They assaulted law enforcement—even putting one member of law enforcement into the hospital—trespassed on federal property, attacked law enforcement by blinding them with strobe lights, and blocked the entrance to the facility. 6 rioters were arrested including for charges of assaulting law enforcement.

This violent attacks on law enforcement officers are unacceptable. ICE officers are already facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them. We will not allow Antifa domestic terrorists to deter us in our mission to make America safe, and those who try will be held accountable.""

KGW crews on the scene observed a smaller crowd, with no more than 40 people present.

""It definitely wasn’t 100 people,"" said Adam Marshall, a nearby resident. ""Honestly, for the most part, it was pretty peaceful yesterday and it wasn’t as chaotic as they were saying.""

Regarding the claim of assaults on law enforcement, McLaughlin’s statement noted that one officer had been hospitalized. KGW’s coverage confirmed that an ambulance did enter the facility, but the identity or condition of the injured officer remains unclear.

As for the alleged trespassing and attacks on law enforcement, KGW reporters observed only a few protesters over the course of several days crossing a painted line on the ground and one individual placing a sign on the building. Protesters were also seen using strobe flashlights and loudspeakers, though the situation appeared largely non-violent.

Marshall, who was observing the protest, said, ""I didn’t see anybody rush the gate at all. I think more of the rushing came from the actual agents and stuff when they rolled out in the van and started just tearing down the street towards people.""

In its statement, McLaughlin also claimed that six rioters were arrested, some for assaulting law enforcement. However, KGW was unable to independently verify those arrests Wednesday, as the suspects were not booked into the Multnomah County Jail.

On Thursday, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that one woman was charged with assaulting a federal officer on Tuesday, Oct. 30. Katherine Meagan Vogel, 39, was accused of striking an officer during an arrest after she ""applied red paint to the driveway of the ICE facility,"" according to a press release.

Vogel had her first court appearance Thursday morning and was released pending further proceedings. She could face up to eight years in prison if found guilty.

The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office told KGW that it has only processed one federal custodial booking into its corrections system between 12 a.m. Sept. 26, 2025 and 6 p.m. Oct. 1, 2025.

According to a spokesperson, the United States Marshals Service booked that individual into the Multnomah County Detention Center (MCDC) on federal drug and weapons-related charges, not assaulting a federal officer.

The Office of Management and Budget announced it was putting on hold roughly $18 billion of infrastructure funds for New York's subway extension and Hudson Tunnel projects - in the hometown of the Democratic leaders of the U.S. House and Senate.

Trump has marveled over the handiwork of his budget director.

""He can trim the budget to a level that you couldn't do any other way,"" the Republican president said at the start of the week of OMB Director Russ Vought, who was also a chief architect of the Project 2025 conservative policy book.

""So they're taking a risk by having a shutdown,"" Trump said during an event at the White House.

Thursday is Day 2 of the shutdown, and already the dial is turned high. The aggressive approach coming from the Trump administration is what certain lawmakers and budget observers feared if Congress, which has the responsibility to pass legislation to fund government, failed to do its work and relinquished control to the White House.

Vought, in a private conference call with House GOP lawmakers Wednesday afternoon, told them of layoffs starting in the next day or two. It's an extension of the Department of Government Efficiency work under Elon Musk that slashed through the federal government at the start of the year.

""These are all things that the Trump administration has been doing since January 20th,"" said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, referring to the president's first day in office. ""The cruelty is the point.""

The economic effects

With no easy endgame at hand, the standoff risks dragging deeper into October, when federal workers who remain on the job will begin missing paychecks. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated roughly 750,000 federal workers would be furloughed on any given day during the shutdown, a loss of $400 million daily in wages.

The economic effects could spill over into the broader economy. Past shutdowns saw ""reduced aggregate demand in the private sector for goods and services, pushing down GDP,"" the CBO said.

""Stalled federal spending on goods and services led to a loss of private-sector income that further reduced demand for other goods and services in the economy,"" it said. Overall CBO said there was a ""dampening of economic output,"" but that reversed once people returned to work.

""The longer this goes on, the more pain will be inflicted,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ""because it is inevitable when the government shuts down.""

No meetings scheduled

Trump and the congressional leaders are not expected to meet again soon. Congress has no action scheduled Thursday in observance of the Jewish holy day, with senators due back Friday. The House is set to resume session next week.

The Democrats are holding fast to their demands to preserve health care funding and refusing to back a bill that fails to do so, warning of price spikes for millions of Americans nationwide. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates insurance premiums will more than double for people who buy policies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.

The Republicans have opened a door to negotiating the health care issue, but GOP leaders say it can wait, since the subsidies that help people purchase private insurance don't expire until year's end.

""We're willing to have a conversation about ensuring that Americans continue to have access to health care,"" Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday at the White House.

Reshaping the federal government

With Congress as a standstill, the Trump administration has taken advantage of new levers to determine how to shape the federal government.

The Trump administration can tap into funds to pay workers at the Defense Department and Homeland Security from what's commonly called the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" that was signed into law this summer, according to the CBO.

That would ensure Trump's immigration enforcement and mass deportation agenda is uninterrupted. But employees who remain on the job at many other agencies will have to wait for government to reopen before they get a paycheck.

Already Vought, from the budget office, has challenged the authority of Congress this year by trying to claw back and rescind funds lawmakers had already approved - for Head Start, clean energy infrastructure projects, overseas aid and public radio and television.

The Government Accountability Office has issued a series of rare notices of instance where the administration's actions have violated the law. But the Supreme Court in a ruling late last week allowed the administration's so-called ""pocket rescission"" of nearly $5 billion in foreign aid to stand.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17923329_100225-cc-ap-trump-close-up-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-02 11:57:55.474783

“I don’t think anyone really cares about the fact he’s illegal,” said Gabriel Doyle Scar, 17, who helped organize the protest. “We’re just sad about the fact that an extremely nice man that supported us heavily and really strongly is now taken away from us.”

At a news conference earlier this week, his lawyer, Alfredo Parrish, didn’t discuss those allegations. Through Parrish, Roberts submitted a letter of resignation Tuesday, writing that he didn’t want to be a distraction while he tried to stop his deportation.

But neither his resignation nor the unanswered questions about his case have quelled the protests in Des Moines, the left-leaning capital of a Republican-led state. Instead, Roberts’ arrest has sparked a moment of mass mobilization in a sleepy city where protests are relatively rare.

“It’s very unusual,” Dave Peterson, a political science professor at Iowa State University, said of the daily protests, adding that for many, Roberts’ detainment was the first major moment in which the recent wave of ICE arrests truly hit home.

“This is a moment where people can express support for somebody who they value, somebody who’s an important part of the community, and be protesting against what ICE is doing more broadly,” he said.

Makhani Scearcy, 20, a college student standing with classmates outside the capitol Tuesday, made a similar point. “Definitely people truly love Dr. Roberts,” she said, “but he’s just one puzzle piece of just how insane things have been.”

Republicans in Iowa have called for investigations of the district’s hiring practices. U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, a Republican whose district includes Des Moines, said he is seeking further information from the Department of Homeland Security about the case, and he released a redacted excerpt of the May 2024 removal order for Roberts signed by a judge.

“Many of us in the community knew Dr. Roberts and trusted him, which makes it hurt even more that he spent so long providing us false information,” Nunn said this week on KCCI-TV of Des Moines.

Yet, in interviews with two dozen parents, colleagues and students this week, many expressed strong support for him, even as new questions about his background have trickled out.

“We were told by the current administration that they were going to get rid of people that didn’t belong here; that’s not what they’re doing,” said Justin Peters, a high school baseball coach in the district. “They’re getting rid of high-class people that are part of our community.”

Roberts, a former Olympian from Guyana, worked his way up in leadership for school districts across the country, from Washington, D.C., to California. After Des Moines hired him in 2023, he became a fixture at community events, nearly always dressed in flashy suits with sneakers, and the first person of color to lead the state’s most diverse district. He was arrested hours before he was scheduled to participate in a “fun run” with second graders in his district.

School district staff members at the protests recalled Roberts’ coming to read to children for hours, visiting classrooms, helping students with scavenger hunts and marching in parades with them.

“My kindergartner knows his superintendent,” said Amber Graeber, a Des Moines parent and teacher. “I don’t think very many kids can say that.”

On Friday evening, more than 400 people packed into Corinthians Baptist Church on the edge of downtown Des Moines, spilling into the hallway and the kitchen.

On Sunday, the Rev. Jonathan Whitfield, the church’s senior pastor, addressed the situation during his service, defending Roberts as someone who “left a legacy of goodness” in every education job he had.

Roughly 100 protesters held another demonstration outside the federal building Monday afternoon. It was the day the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked his license and legal authority to serve as superintendent.

ICE said in a statement that Roberts arrived on a student visa in 1999, but according to Coppin State University in Baltimore, he graduated from there in 1998 and competed in NCAA track competitions even earlier. Roberts “was a standout scholar and athlete during his undergraduate studies,” Coppin State President Anthony L. Jenkins said in a statement.

Roberts has said he attended six other universities in some capacity: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Georgetown University, Morgan State University, St. John’s University, Harvard’s Graduate School of Education and Trident University International, an online school. St. John’s confirmed he earned a master’s degree in social studies from the institution in 2000. Morgan State said he attended as a graduate student for five years but didn’t earn a degree from it. And MIT said it had no record of Roberts’ having attended. The others didn’t respond to requests for comment.

According to the school district, Roberts had provided a résumé to the search firm that recruited him falsely stating that he had earned a doctorate from Morgan State, but the firm had him correct it before it submitted it to the Des Moines School Board. The district said it was aware he didn’t finish his doctorate at Morgan State.

""The Des Moines School Board is also a victim of deception by Dr. Roberts, one on a growing list that includes our students and teachers, our parents and community, our elected officials and Iowa’s Board of Educational Examiners, and others,” Jackie Norris, the school board chair, said in a statement Wednesday.

Roberts had indicated on his I-9 form that he was a citizen when he was hired two years ago, and he provided a driver’s license and a Social Security card as proof, district officials said. The district has said it was unaware that Roberts received a final order of removal last year, and it said DHS provided a copy Monday afternoon.

Parrish, Roberts’ attorney, declined to say Tuesday when Roberts first came to the United States and under what status or what his legal clearance to work in the country was when he was hired by Des Moines Public Schools. He couldn’t be reached for further comment.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250929-Ian-Roberts-Iowa-School-Superintendent-ICE-se-1227p-9321e6.jpg",N,,2025-10-02 09:57:41.193669

Four people were arrested by federal agents, shelter officials said.
On Wednesday morning, Bright Star's leaders were alerted by staff members at the shelter that federal agents were on the ground.
In the streets, all over the place — you see chaos,"" said Chris Harris, senior pastor at Bright Star Church Chicago.
Those who run the shelter said they don't know why ICE agents targeted the location but are working to locate the individuals who were detained.","Another ICE raid has targeted the city's South Side — this time in Bronzeville, where federal agents reportedly detained multiple people outside of a homeless shelter on Wednesday morning.

It happened around 9 a.m., according to shelter leaders, who described the situation as an 'ambush.'

Four people were arrested by federal agents, shelter officials said.

What we know:

The shelter, which operates in a publicly undisclosed location for the safety of its residents, is run by the Bright Star Community Development Corporation.

On Wednesday morning, Bright Star's leaders were alerted by staff members at the shelter that federal agents were on the ground.

""There were about 30 to 35 masked agents. In the streets, all over the place — you see chaos,"" said Chris Harris, senior pastor at Bright Star Church Chicago. ""And they just completely caught everybody off guard.""

Bright Star Community Development Corporation Executive Director Caryl West said about seven unmarked SUVs with tinted windows pulled up to the shelter around 9 a.m. when a group of residents were outside. Some were preparing to leave for work, while others were getting fresh air, he said.

""[The agents] jumped out, exited and there were about 20 residents, maybe, outside here, and they immediately gave chase,"" West said. ""They did not present warrants or ask if they could speak to any residents. They just showed up.""

Surveillance video captured the scene.

According to shelter officials, five people were initially detained but one person was later released, leaving four individuals in ICE custody.

Leaders, including West and Harris, responded immediately. Harris took out his cellphone and started to stream what he was witnessing on Facebook Live.

""They showed up at our shelter here in Bronzeville,"" Harris can be heard saying in the video.

Those who run the shelter said they don't know why ICE agents targeted the location but are working to locate the individuals who were detained.

Harris said he tried to communicate with the federal agents who responded.

""They were certainly not rude, but they were absolutely pretty firm about what they were here to do. They didn't want to talk, didn't want to communicate very much, they just came to do what they came to do,"" Harris explained. ""And what was really heartbreaking for me, there was very little compassion. I get that they're here to do a job, but where is the humanity in all this.""

The Bronzeville shelter houses 260 residents — both men and women.

""You cannot even imagine what it makes you feel just watching,"" West said when recalling the raid.

""It's very invasive, intrusive, all the things, anything that you think, it's worse than that,"" said Lakreshia Kindred, executive director of Bright Star Community Outreach. ""We hear a lot about this, and we see it on the news, but when you actually see it in your backyard, and experience it, it's a completely different impact.""

Kindred, alongside Harris and West, are now working to support the residents at the shelter, who are left on-edge.

""Anxious, uncertain, scared, not really sure what to expect. One of the things we focus on here is to try to help them support themselves,"" Kindred said. ""The possibility of all that being ended is very scary to them.""

If they were checking, local officials would be providing an additional layer of oversight at a time when the number of people held in detention centers has surged because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on unauthorized immigrants.

Two state laws provide state, county and local officials the authority to review health and safety conditions in privately-run immigration detention facilities.

The first, passed during the first Trump administration, allows the attorney general’s office to inspect for violations of national detention standards and health or safety issues. The AG’s office has used that power to publish annual reports on conditions inside detention centers, including one this year that alleged deficient mental health care.

The second, a 2024 law, empowers counties to inspect privately run detention facilities. In the past, counties have inspected jails and prisons, finding mold, rats, and other health violations. But county health officials have not used that power to inspect federal immigration detention facilities.

In Kern County — where three detention centers operate — the health officer, through an attorney, has said in testimony before a federal judge that he has “no intention” of exercising his new authority to inspect the facilities to ensure they comply with state and local health standards.

The companies that manage the detention centers through contracts with the federal government say they take seriously their responsibility to adhere to federal standards and uphold human rights. One unsuccessfully sued to overturn the new California inspection law, alleging it was unnecessary and an intrusion on the federal government’s authority.

More than 5,700 people are in immigration detention in California, an 84% increase since the spring. On April 16, there were 3,100 people detained in the state, according to the California Attorney General’s latest report.

Advocates for detainees are drawing attention to what they describe as unhealthy conditions, including in the state’s newest detention center. It opened in Kern County without proper permits or a business license as required by state law, according to California City’s mayor.

CoreCivic’s 2,560-bed immigration detention center there sits on 70 acres in the Mohave desert about 80 miles east of Bakersfield.

A detainee who goes by the name of Loba has been locked up in the California City facility since Aug. 28. She said some detainees have not received the medication they need for more than 20 days. She asked CalMatters not to fully identify her because she feared retaliation by CoreCivic guards for speaking with a reporter.

“There’s a lack of interest on the part of CoreCivic to care for individuals with diabetes problems and people who have heart problems or any other health conditions. They’re really not caring for detainees and not giving us the proper medical treatment in detention,” Loba said.

She said she observed five people who needed emergency care because they could not get medication. Another California City detainee described similar conditions in an interview with CalMatters.

Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said the site has robust medical and mental health care on site, including around-the-clock access to those services. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

“There are no delays in individuals getting their prescription medications,” Gustin said.

Counties reviewing inspection law

In the four counties where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detention facilities, only one county health department conducts the kind of inspections allowed under the 2024 law. A San Bernardino County spokesperson said the county has the authority to inspect for disease control and “general health and sanitation,” but he later said the reviews are limited to the facilities’ food processing and service.

Officials from two other counties said they’ll use their new authority to respond to specific concerns, but that they had not yet done any inspections.

The Imperial County health department said it would respond to a complaint “if the facility falls within our legal authority to inspect.” The San Diego County health department said only that it “is exploring how to effectively operationalize this law in its jurisdiction.”

California has seven immigration detention centers: Adelanto ICE Processing Center and Desert View Annex in San Bernardino County; The Golden State Annex, Mesa Verde ICE Processing facility, and the California City detention facility in Kern County; The Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Imperial County; and the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego County.

ICE pays the for-profit prison company GEO Group to operate four of the centers: Adelanto, Desert View Annex, Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center.

MTC manages the detention center in Imperial County, while CoreCivic manages Otay Mesa and California City.

The 2024 law gives local health officials the authority to inspect private detention facilities as they deem necessary, but it does not require them to do so unless requested by local lawmakers or law enforcement. And it does not specify exactly what county health inspectors should check, despite lawmakers and cosponsors of the bill citing “detainees facing challenges in accessing timely medical attention” as one of the reasons the new law was necessary.

As the bill moved forward, lawmakers also cited a May 2020 COVID-19 outbreak at the Otay Mesa Detention Center that resulted in more than 300 staff and detained individuals becoming infected. “Conditions in these facilities not only affect the lives of those detained, but also impact the surrounding communities,” wrote the bill’s author, state Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles.

It passed without any recorded opposition and with unanimous votes in the Legislature.

GEO Group sued to challenge the law, arguing it was unconstitutional because it stepped on the federal government’s authority to manage detention centers. By extension, GEO claimed intergovernmental immunity as a contractor.

“This case involves the latest in a string of attempts by the State of California to ban federal immigration enforcement in the state, or so significantly burden such efforts as to drive federal agencies and contractors involved in that constitutionally-mandated national security function from California,” GEO attorneys argued in the suit, which was filed in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of California.

In federal court this year, Kern County attorney Jeremy McNutt said county health officer Kristopher Lyon doesn’t want to use the new law to inspect the Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex facilities in his county. McNutt said Lyon would inspect the facility if the governor ordered him to, but otherwise, he “has no intention of inspecting the facility whatsoever.”

“If he’s not ordered to do it then he has no intention of doing it, doesn’t really care to have the right to do it or not,” McNutt said of Lyon. “We don’t believe he has a duty to inspect the facility … There is no commitment or desire to inspect.”

A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in May, letting the law stay in place. Lyon did not respond to a request for comment about whether his position has changed in light of an influx of new detainees and the opening of a new detention center.

Adelanto cleared county review

In the only county making use of its powers to access the detention centers, a San Bernardino County inspector spent about an hour on May 29 at the Adelanto center for food and service issues. The facility passed, according to inspection reports.

San Bernardino County inspector Mary Ann Glass made no notes or comments, and she found no deficiencies or violations at the facility, the paperwork shows.

“Yes, our inspections are limited to food processing and service,” confirmed San Bernardino health department spokesperson Francis Delapaz.

Adelanto is where a 39-year-old detainee was being held shortly before his death in September.

Internal emails obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that about two weeks after arriving at Adelanto in August, Ismael Ayala-Uribe reported symptoms including a cough, fever, and severe pain. Staff flagged his condition as potentially life-threatening and last week escorted him to the facility’s medical center in a wheelchair, the newspaper reported. About an hour and a half later, medical staff sent him back to his dormitory. He was not sent to a hospital until three days later, where he died.

Adelanto detainees, who spoke with CalMatters on condition that they not be named because they fear retaliation, said the sites are crowded, and it’s taking a long time to access medications and medical care.

An immigrant who was arrested in an ICE raid in Los Angeles in June and spent more than a month at Adelanto, said it took three days for him to be assigned a bed when he arrived at the facility.

During that time, he wasn’t allowed a shower or a change of clothes and wasn’t permitted to call his family. He said the dorm he ultimately slept in doubled in population, to its full capacity of about 90 people. Staff, he said, asked for volunteers to keep the walkways and windows clean, and detainees waited longer than three days to hear back about medical requests.

“Everyone was getting sick with coughs, the flu, with the air being cold all day,” he said. “Almost 50% of the people were like that.”

A Geo Group spokesperson said the company provides around-the-clock access to medical care.

“Geo strongly rejects these baseless allegations,” spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in an email to CalMatters. “Our contracts also set strict limits on a facility’s capacity. Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.”

California tried to ban for-profit detention

The federal government’s own inspections indicate allegations of abuse and possible lapses in suicide prevention at the Adelanto facility. In 2024, the Office of Detention Oversight found one detainee who alleged an officer inappropriately squeezed his chest and genitals during a pat-down search, and another told inspectors he had thoughts of self-harming because of the poor conditions inside the facility.

State inspectors released a report in April that documented similar issues with conditions across the state. Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, the report stated.

Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged that state and local oversight over detention facilities is limited, particularly after the state in 2019 attempted to ban private for-profit facilities, a bill Bonta authored as a legislator. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found the law unconstitutional.

Legislators “thought the conditions and practices inside these detention centers were so bad that they should be completely prohibited. And unfortunately, that was struck down,” Bonta told CalMatters.

“Because these are federal detention centers, there is a limit on what I can do, what the California legislature can do. The authority rests more with the federal government, particularly Congress,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092225_CalCity-Detention_MV_CM_16.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-02 11:58:11.051859

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS — GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

On the first day of shutdown, the Trump administration yesterday froze $26 billion for states led by Democrats. The targeted programs include $18 billion for transit projects in New York and $8 billion for climate-related projects in 16 U.S. states including California and New York. The administration has also suspended all news broadcasts from Voice of America and furloughed all of its journalists yesterday. David Morgan, Bo Erickson, Nolan D. McCaskill, and Richard Cowan report for Reuters; Matthew Haag reports for the New York Times; Ismail Shakil and Caitlin Webber report for Reuters. Minho Kim reports for the New York Times.

The United States could lose $15 billion of its GDP each week the shutdown extends, the White House Council of Economic Advisers warned in a memo seen by POLITICO. The memo warned that a month-long shutdown could lead to an additional 43,000 people being unemployed. The council’s estimate does not include the 1.9 million federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay. Megan Messerly reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Defense Department plans to impose strict NDAs and random polygraph ‘lie detector’ testing for employees in its headquarters, according to two sources and documents obtained by the Washington Post. The documents do not identify a limit on who would be subjected to these measures. A Pentagon spokesperson declined to answer questions on the directives but told the Post that their reporting was “untrue and irresponsible.” Alex Horton, Tara Copp, and Ellen Nakashima report.

The Justice Department yesterday fired Michael Ben’Ary, chief national security prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, after a social media post falsely tied him to the case of FBI Director James Comey, two sources said. The post from a pro-Trump activist said, “One can only assume he was a big part of the internal resistance to the Comey indictment.” Ben’Ary was not involved in the Comey case, one of the sources told CNN. Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz report.

FBI Director Kash Patel announced yesterday that he has ended a training and intelligence sharing partnership with the Anti-Defamation League. Patel accused the organization of spying on conservative groups. “James Comey wrote ‘love letters’ to the ADL and embedded FBI agents with them,” Patel wrote on social media. “That era is OVER. This FBI won’t partner with political fronts masquerading as watchdogs.” Aaron Pellish reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration yesterday sent a 10-point memo to U.S. colleges setting out a wide range of terms, including banning the use of race or sex in hiring and admissions; freezing tuition fees for five years and capping international enrollment at 15%. A letter addressed to the universities said those that agree to sign on will receive benefits, including substantial federal grants. Natalie Andrews and Douglas Belkin report for the Wall Street Journal.

The White House yesterday fired a large share of the council members advising the National Endowment for the Humanities. According to a list on the agency’s website, only the four members appointed by Trump were retained. Janay Kingsberry, Kelsey Ables, and Travis M. Andrews report for the Washington Post.

Trump has nominated Travis Hill, the current acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to lead the banking regulator on a long-term basis, according to a source. If confirmed by the Senate, Hill is expected to maintain a lighter enforcement stance and allow greater involvement of banks in crypto-related services. Pete Schroeder and Arasu Kannagi Basil report for Reuters.

Director of the U.S. Office Management and Budget Russ Vought yesterday released $5 million to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Senate Appropriations Committee Chair, Sen. Susan Collins (R- ME) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) earlier this week sent a letter to Vought criticizing the decision to withhold the funds. Hailey Fuchs reports for POLITICO.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

ICE has bought access to a surveillance tool that is updated with billions of pieces of location data from millions of mobile phones every day, according to ICE documents reviewed by 404 Media. The documents show that ICE is planning to use location data remotely harvested from people’s phones. ICE previously stated that it had stopped this practice. Joseph Cox reports.

A U.S. immigration judge yesterday rejected Kilmar Abrego García’s request to reopen his deportation case, dismissing Abrego’s argument that he faced “imminent removal to Uganda.” The judge found “insufficient evidence” to show the Trump administration would deport Abrego to Uganda, according to a copy of the decision seen by the Washington Post. Maria Sacchetti reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump issued an executive order earlier this week to guarantee Qatar’s “security and territorial integrity” if the country were to come under attack. The order states that any attack on Qatar would be treated as “a threat to the peace and security of the United States.” Adam Rasgon reports for the New York Times.

The White House yesterday said it “reject[s] there was inhumane treatment of illegal immigrants in the United States under this administration,” pushing back against Pope Leo XIV’s suggestion earlier this week that people who support the “inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States” may not be “pro-life.” Irie Sentner reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration is planning to block federal funding to organizations that work abroad on issues connected to gender identity and diversity, according to a U.S. official and non-profit groups. The Global Health Council and MSI Reproductive Choices said the policy is expected to apply to all non-military foreign funding to U.S. and foreign entities, including U.N. organizations. The White House has not formally announced this new policy. Carmen Paun and Nahal Toosi report for POLITICO.

The HOPE/HELP trade program, allowing duty-free textile imports from Haiti to the United States, expired yesterday. The expiration of this trade program is expected to deepen poverty and bolster gang recruitment in Haiti, U.S. lawmakers and Haitian businesses said. Kejal Vyas reports for the Wall Street Journal.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Meta said yesterday that it will use people’s conversations with AI chatbots in order to personalise advertising and content across its platforms. The move is a “natural progression of our personalisation efforts,” Meta’s privacy and data policy manager Christy Harris said. Cristina Criddle reports for the Financial Times.

GLOBAL AFFAIRS

An Israeli drone strike yesterday killed one person and injured five others in southern Lebanon. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said that Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 100 civilians in 10 months. There have been no reports of killings in Israel from projectiles fired from Lebanon since the ceasefire last year. Bassem Mroue reports for AP News.

The Rohingya Muslim minority in the Rakhine state in Myanmar are facing an “alarming” hunger crisis due to a “deadly combination of conflict, blockades and funding cuts,” according to the U.N. World Food Programme. Five Rohingya people told Reuters they had been surviving on leaves, roots and grass in Rakhine before escaping to Bangladesh. The United States and the United Kingdom announced on Tuesday that they would provide $96 million to refugee camps in Bangladesh housing over a million Rohingya people. Ruma Paul, Poppy McPherson and Devjyot Ghoshal report.

German authorities earlier this week arrested three individuals suspected of being Hamas members. The three men are suspected of having procured firearms and ammunition to be used in attacks on Israeli and Jewish institutions in Germany. Hamas denied any connection to the men. Alys Davies reports for BBC News.

Internet access was restored across parts of Afghanistan yesterday following a two-day blackout. “I still don’t have the reason for the internet cutoff,” a spokesperson for the Afghan ministry of communications said yesterday evening. By Elian Peltier, Safiullah Padshah, and Francesca Regalado report for the New York Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Israeli forces are “tightening the siege” around Gaza City, and will consider any Palestinians who do not evacuate from the city “terrorists and supporters of terror,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said yesterday. Hospitals in the city reported that Israeli fire killed 45 people in Gaza City yesterday, while the International Committee of the Red Cross medical charity said it had been forced to suspend its operations in the area. David Gritten reports for BBC News.

According to Arab mediators, Hamas has indicated that it is open to accepting Trump’s peace plan for Gaza but asked for more time to review its conditions. Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey have urged Hamas to respond positively to the plan or risk the loss of diplomatic support from them, while Hamas has expressed reservations about some of the terms of the plan, the mediators said. Discussions over those concerns were ongoing late yesterday, the mediators added. Summer Said reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Israeli forces today intercepted a Gaza’bound flotilla of vessels carrying humanitarian aid, detaining dozens of activists. Israel said that the boats were “approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade,” while the Global Sumud Flotilla said that the interception was “unlawful” and that one of the vessels was “deliberately rammed at sea.” Ruth Comerford reports for BBC News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

The creation of the new U.S. plan for a Gaza ceasefire was prompted by Israel’s failed attempt to assassinate Hamas leaders in Qatar, with U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Trump aide Jared Kushner deciding to use the widespread condemnation of Israel as an opportunity to end the war, sources say. According to a U.S. official, “the failed Doha attack changed the regional dynamics.” Barak Ravid and Marc Caputo report for Axios.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — U.S. INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

EU leaders yesterday backed plans to strengthen Europe’s defences against Russian drones at a summit in Copenhagen. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said Europe’s eastern flank would be a priority but that the “drone wall” should be a shield for the entire continent. EU leaders did not agree on the proposed €140 billion (approximately $164 billion) loan to Ukraine based on frozen Russian assets. Belgium refused to lift its opposition while France and Luxembourg raised concerns over the legal implications of the proposal. Andrew Gray, Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Ingrid Melander report for Reuters; Henry Foy reports for the Financial Times.

Trump recently signed off on a plan allowing the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies to assist Ukraine with intelligence for long-range missile strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, according to U.S. officials. The officials said that the Trump administration is asking NATO to provide similar support. Bojan Pancevski, Alexander Ward, and Lara Seligman report for the Wall Street Journal.

French authorities yesterday detained crew members of a Western-sanctioned tanker carrying Russian crude oil known to be part of Russia’s “shadow fleet.” The tanker had passed by Denmark at the time of the drone incursions last week, arousing the suspicion of investigators, a French official said. French President Emmanuel Macron said he would not comment on whether the boat was involved in the drone operations. Matthew Dalton reports for the Wall Street Journal.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been running on emergency power for over a week, with the situation at the plant now critical, according to Ukrainian government officials and energy watchdogs. The outage is the longest since the war began, and the facility is currently running off emergency diesel generators. “It is clearly not a sustainable situation in terms of nuclear safety,” Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi said in a statement. “Neither side would benefit from a nuclear accident.” Lizzy Johnson and Kostiantyn Khudov report for the Washington Post.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Supreme Court yesterday refused to allow Trump to immediately remove Gov. Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board. In a brief order, the court did not provide the reasons for its refusal, indicating only that the administration’s application for a stay of a lower court decision preserving Cook’s status is deferred pending oral argument in January 2026. Ann E. Marimow and Colby Smith report for the New York Times; Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge yesterday granted an order temporarily restraining the federal government from withdrawing $34 million in funding to protect New York’s transportation system from terrorist attacks. The judge ruled that the state of New York is “quite likely” to prove its allegation that the money was being improperly diverted because the Trump administration wanted to “punish” the state for “exercising its responsibilities in a way that does not satisfy the administration in what it calls the largest deportation mission in history.” Michael R. Sisak and Larry Neumeister report for AP News.

Some migrants held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington, have the right to request to be released on bond, a federal judge ruled yesterday. The new Trump administration policy denying bond hearings for detained migrants violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, the judge said. Martha Bellisle reports for AP News.

The Attorneys General from a number of states led by Democrats yesterday filed a joint lawsuit challenging the Justice Department’s attempt to impose new restrictions on the states’ ability to use federal grant funding to provide legal services to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault if the victims entered the United States unlawfully. The lawsuit has been filed by AGs from New York, Colorado, Illinois, Rhode Island, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Shayna Jacobs reports for the Washington Post; Nate Raymond reports for Reuters.

A U.S. citizen, who was detained twice by ICE agents, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday in federal court challenging ICE raids on workplaces with large immigrant workforces. The class-action suit demands an end to “unconstitutional and illegal immigration enforcement tactics.” Tim Sullivan reports for AP News.

The Freedom of the Press Foundation and 404 Media last week filed a lawsuit seeking a court order forcing the Homeland Security Department and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to hand over a copy of the agreement under which the Centers are sharing the personal data of Medicaid patients with ICE. The agencies previously failed to respond to the Freedom of Information requests asking for the disclosure of the agreement, Joseph Cox reported for 404 Media.

“She was scared and did not want to get in more trouble or have more ‘ICE’ agents show up,” a deputy’s report said.
Instead, they drove across a bridge to an apartment complex in Panama City Beach, where the driver said more ICE agents would be waiting.

Social media incidents In several other 2025 cases, ICE agent imitators have been seeking social media clout or making a political point.","The woman in a black jacket and an ICE shirt hid her eyes behind sunglasses and her face behind a mask as she stepped up to the hotel desk clerk.

When she pulled out an ID card that seemed to show she was an immigration agent, she made it clear to the frightened young clerk that she had no choice but to follow her out to a silver sedan.

But this was no immigration raid. It was a kidnapping, police say.

And the woman in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement uniform, authorities say, was no federal agent. She was a jilted ex-lover using the cover of the government’s expanding deportation efforts to commit a serious crime and try to eliminate a romantic rival.

A CNN review of court filings, social media posts and local news stories has found two dozen incidents of people posing as ICE officers in 2025, in cases that range from political agitators seeking to intimidate immigrants to others using the guise of authority to allegedly kidnap, rob, assault or rape victims.

That represents a notable jump -– more incidents than during the prior four presidential terms combined, dating back to President Barack Obama’s first term in office, CNN’s review found.

“I’ve been at this for 38 years, and I’ve never seen cases involving the impersonation of ICE agents before Donald Trump won the second time,” said Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat whose office is prosecuting two impersonator cases from this year.

Some experts and public officials have tied this rise in imposters to the Trump administration’s aggressive use of ICE agents – in particular the use of masks by agents, who often wear plain clothes during raids that have been widely captured on social media. When agents wear masks, it sows confusion about how to identify real agents, opening the door for imitators, critics argue.

“It’s very easy for somebody to just play dress up and go out acting like these agents,” said Mike German, a former FBI agent. “And because these agents have been so aggressive in public without identifying themselves, it creates fear and that fear is an opportunity for a criminal.”

ICE says masks are needed to protect agents from doxxing as mass street protests have erupted in cities like Los Angeles, and as violent threats have targeted the agency. FBI officials say anti-ICE sentiment drove the shooting that killed two detainees at an ICE facility in Dallas last week. The agency also said in a statement to CNN that agents “always have credentials visible and clearly announce who they are.”

“ICE strongly condemns the impersonation of its law enforcement officers or agents. This action is not only dangerous but illegal. Imposters can be charged with various criminal offenses at the state/local level and federally,” the agency said in a statement.

The rash of impersonator incidents comes as Democratic lawmakers push back against the masking practice. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill on September 20 making his state the first to ban federal agents from wearing masks during operations – a law driven in part by concern about imitators.

“The increase in masked law enforcement operations has already spurred dangerous copycat activity,” state Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguín said in a statement in June.

The White House has declared the California law unconstitutional and said ICE will not abide.

“This stunt comes as our ICE officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them, including vehicles being used as weapons towards them, and doxing campaigns targeting federal officers and their families,” said the Department of Homeland Security in a press release.

Among the two dozen incidents identified by CNN, criminal charges have been filed in 10. Only one case has resulted in federal charges for imitating an officer – another break from the past four administrations, when roughly half of the ICE-imposter cases were charged under federal statutes.

The Department of Justice did not provide a comment for this story.

That lack of federal action could be leaving the door open for more bad actors to take advantage of the political moment to target immigrants, some lawmakers warn.

“I expect it will continue to grow exponentially because those individuals have seen that the federal government is not willing to hold them accountable,” said Miguel Arias, a city council member in Fresno, California, where two ICE imitators have been arrested but have not faced federal charges.

Arias added, “That sends a very clear message to these individuals that the general public is fair game and that they can continue impersonating law enforcement officers and violating our constitutional rights and our feeling of safety in our own neighborhoods.”

A rise in imitators

Because immigrants are a vulnerable population in danger of being victimized, ICE impersonators have long been a problem.

But in years past, many cases reviewed by CNN involved scam artists who sought to shake down immigrants for cash under threat of deportation.

Starting in 2009, for instance, Ruben Alvarado of New Jersey met with undocumented immigrants wearing an ICE badge and what appeared to be a holstered gun and collected fees in return for the promise of citizenship. But he was an imposter. He pleaded guilty in 2013 and was sentenced to 33 months in prison, according to the US Department of Justice.

All told, CNN found at least seven cases of ICE agent imitators during President Obama’s tenure – most involving financial scams like the Alvarado case. There were at least 11 cases during Trump’s first four-year term, and four cases during President Joe Biden’s time in the White House. Federal prosecutors filed charges in about half of those cases prior to Trump’s second term, between 2009 and early 2025.

Since Trump took office again in January, however, the nearly two dozen incidents found by CNN have deviated from the previous pattern of mostly financial scams. They began in late January, soon after Trump’s inauguration, and then surged in February, which saw 10 instances.

Another surge happened in June, shortly after news reports revealed that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller had imposed a quota calling for ICE agents to arrest at least 3,000 people a day.

As ICE began swarming into US cities including Boston and Los Angeles this summer, bystanders captured hundreds of social media videos of agents without visible ICE logos and with their faces covered by masks detaining people off the street.

It’s unclear whether ICE ever issued a formal policy allowing the masks or to not wear identifying uniforms during operations. Todd Lyons, ICE’s acting director, said in a July interview with CBS News that while he isn’t a proponent of the masks, he would continue to allow it, calling it a “tool” used by agents to keep themselves and their families safe.

But critics have argued the practice makes it easier for anyone to pose as an ICE agent and violently act out against immigrants. Arturo Flores, the mayor of Huntington Park, California, said the opaqueness of ICE’s current masking policy adds a dangerous layer of uncertainty.

“When you see a fake cop, you know that’s a fake cop,” said Flores, whose city in Los Angeles County had a possible ICE impersonation case in June. “With ICE agents you can’t make that determination because of the operational tactics and operational protocol that they’ve adopted.”

As ICE’s mass operations increased around the US, criminals also continued imitating agents – and in at least four incidents found by CNN, wore masks like federal agents.

A daring escape

When the 26-year-old hotel desk clerk got into the back seat of the car in Panama City, Florida, on April 10, she thought she was complying with an ICE officer’s demand, authorities said.

“She was scared and did not want to get in more trouble or have more ‘ICE’ agents show up,” a deputy’s report said.

The woman wearing the ICE gear told the clerk that she was taking her to a sheriff’s station, according to the report. And on the drive, she appeared to be speaking with someone on a handheld radio – further convincing the clerk she was really an ICE agent.

But things soon took an ominous turn.

When the clerk, Merika Senior, tried to call her attorney, the woman in the ICE shirt driving the car reached back and snatched the phone from her hand, according to the report.

The victim told deputies she grew more suspicious when the car blew past a turn that would have led to the nearest sheriff’s station. Instead, they drove across a bridge to an apartment complex in Panama City Beach, where the driver said more ICE agents would be waiting.

When the supposed ICE agent went up to a room in the complex, Senior seized an opportunity to escape. She flagged down a man in a parked car who allowed her to use his phone to call 911 while she hid.

Bay County Sheriff’s deputies later identified the woman in the ICE gear as an imposter – then-52-year-old Latrance Battle, who was on felony probation for aggravated assault and who had formerly dated the victim’s husband. She was arrested and charged with several offenses including kidnapping and impersonation of an officer. She has pleaded not guilty. Battle’s attorney declined CNN’s request for comment; her next trial date is on October 28.

The case is one of at least eight this year CNN found that involved people allegedly posing as ICE agents to commit violent acts.

Among those is the only ICE imitation crime that federal prosecutors have taken on in 2025.

Authorities say 54-year-old Robert Rosado walked into an auto-repair shop in Philadelphia on June 8 wearing a tactical vest, badge and a holstered gun and announced he was an ICE agent. After most of the employees scattered, police say, Rosado zip-tied the last remaining employee’s wrists together and took about $1,000 from the till of the business, according to court records and media reports.

The owner of the store declined to comment.

Rosado faces federal charges of impersonating an officer and robbery. His attorney in that case did not return an email from CNN seeking comment. Rosado’s jury trial is scheduled to begin on October 21.

Another violent case happened later in June in Delaware, after police say a vehicle with flashing police lights pulled over another car in the historic shipbuilding town of Milton.

Two masked men wearing vests bearing the word “ICE” got out and robbed the driver at gun- and knife- point before punching him, according to media reports. They are still at large.

That’s not the only bogus ICE traffic stop police have responded to. In South Carolina in late January, a video that went viral on social media showed a man sticking his head in the open window of a parked car, snatching the keys out of the ignition and telling the Hispanic men inside, “You from Mexico? You’re going back!”

Sean-Michael Johnson, then 33, was charged with kidnapping and impersonating a police officer.

Two other cases involved men who allegedly tried to use their fake ICE status as a cover for committing rape.

In North Carolina, a man allegedly showed a badge and threatened to deport a woman in January if she didn’t have sex with him at a motel. Police arrested 37-year-old Carl Bennett, who faces charges including second-degree rape.

In Brooklyn, police say 43-year-old Leon Howell ordered a 51-year-old Hispanic woman into a basement stairwell in February after he told her he was an ICE agent. Howell punched and raped her before making off with her necklace, cellphone and purse, police said. The woman was left with lacerations and bruises to her face, head, legs and arms, according to court documents.

Howell has been charged with rape, burglary and assault; he has pleaded not guilty and his next court appearance is on October 3.

Attorneys for Howell, Johnson and Bennett did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.

In August, a masked man walked into a grocery store in Colorado Springs to pick up a to-go order with a semi-automatic gun in a holster on his hip. When an employee told the man that firearms were not allowed in the business, he flashed a fake ICE badge, according to court records and media reports.

Police came to a house later that week to arrest the suspect, who barricaded himself inside with two young children and aimed a gun at officers, police said.

Officers de-escalated the situation and arrested 22-year-old Antonio Mellon. He faces several charges, including impersonating an officer, unlawful possession of a firearm and child abuse. The Colorado public defender’s office, which is representing Mellon, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. His next court appearance is October 28.

Social media incidents

In several other 2025 cases, ICE agent imitators have been seeking social media clout or making a political point.

In March, a man driving a decommissioned police SUV adorned with what appeared to be an ICE emblem drove erratically through the parking lot of a Ukrainian grocery store near Tacoma, Washington, before taking up two spots near the exit.

Olena Ray, the store’s manager and – like many customers – a Ukrainian immigrant, said customers and staff were unsettled. Many feared that ICE was about to raid the store.

“It is very cruel, you know, to scare people, to play on their weaknesses, it’s terrible,” she told CNN. “It’s mean and it’s disrespectful.”

An employee told police that the vehicle’s “strange behavior,” such as honking and blocking the entrance to the parking lot, “made me feel unsafe at my own workplace.”

In fact, police later found the ICE emblem was a fake – slapped on the side of the SUV by Ilya Kukhar, now 27, who told police he was also Ukrainian, and that he had filmed the video as a skit for YouTube that “got blown out of proportion.”

He was charged with second-degree criminal impersonation, a gross misdemeanor.

Kukhar and prosecutors recently agreed that the charge against him will be dismissed in two years if he doesn’t violate any criminal laws, and apologizes to Emish Market.

“This began as a joke and we’re working to resolve the case,” Kukhar’s attorney, Steve Karimi, told CNN. “He’s a good kid, a young kid, who did something very politically charged.”

Other incidents posted to social media and reviewed by CNN did not result in criminal charges, but clearly depicted people pretending to be immigration officers.

At an anti-Trump rally in June in Miami, a pair of men in tactical vests showed up – including one in an ICE ballcap.

But the pair weren’t agents on the scene – they were a father-son duo there to disrupt the protest and to post about it on social media, according to their own posts on Instagram and elsewhere.

“It was fun being an ice agent for one day,” posted the older man on a social media account.

In another post, one of the men displayed a cache of what appear to be assault rifles, along with a message referencing the anti-ICE unrest in Los Angeles that flared up this summer: “Bring the LA Chaos down here. I volunteer my self.”

Their commentary earned the ire of local activists who reposted the videos, demanding action from local authorities. Neither man in the social media posts has been charged with a crime, and they did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.

At the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year in Maryland, another young man dressed in an ICE jacket admitted in a viral video that he was not actually an agent and had purchased the gear online.

“It’s $29.99 on Amazon,” the man says in the video. “If you want some entertainment, wear this and go to a Home Depot in a sanctuary city like where I live right now, Washington, D.C., and you’ll see all the illegals. Not all of them, but you can maybe see a lot of them start to run away, and you feel like a group fitness instructor. It’s really good.”

Clashes over masked agents

Democrats in Congress and in multiple states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois, have proposed legislation to bar ICE agents from wearing masks.

California passed a bill, which takes effect in January. But Trump administration officials have said they would not follow the state law, arguing it cannot compel federal agents to comply.

Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, called it “despicable and a flagrant attempt to endanger our officers.”

This week, a federal judge sharply rebuked the agency’s use of masks. In a sweeping judgment against the Trump administration’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian student protesters, US District Judge William Young in Boston called ICE’s justification for masks “disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable.”

“ICE goes masked for a single reason – to terrorize Americans into quiescence,” Young wrote in the opinion. “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.”

Some lawmakers have also called on DOJ to take a more active role in prosecuting criminals who pretend to be ICE agents. The low count of federal prosecutions to date sends a message, said Arias, the Fresno city council member.

“My fear is that this could get worse before it gets better given the lack of accountability by federal law enforcement officials to hold these individuals accountable,” he said.

German said that other steps by ICE, including clearly identifying individual agents and notifying local police ahead of their operations, would make it easier to swiftly spot impersonators. “All of that could be very helpful,” the former FBI agent said.

In the meantime, cases continue working their way through local courts – including one in Florida where a man in a truck allegedly chased and cornered a minivan occupied by a group of men heading to work on an April morning before dawn.

The suspect got out and told the men he was an ICE officer and asked to see the driver’s ID, the driver told deputies with the Martin County Sheriff’s Office.

“I mean, he scared me,” the driver told a deputy that night, according to bodycam footage obtained by CNN. “Not only did he scare me, he scared my guys because he was, like, really close – he was just following me.”

The suspect, 25-year-old Jose Juan Lopez, admitted to a deputy that he told the men they were going to get deported “because they look like a bunch of people that they ain’t got papers.” Deputies arrested Lopez and charged him with impersonating an officer. Lopez’s attorney did not return a request for comment, and his next trial date is scheduled for early November.

On June 7 of this year, police helped federal agents clear the driveway of the ICE facility after protesters blocked it.

The next day, police said some people began spray painting the building, and officers made two arrests.

Between June 11-12, police arrested 13 people outside the ICE facility. On both nights, police stated that some of the protesters started fires near the building. Two protesters were charged with assault.

On June 14, after tens of thousands of people peacefully marched earlier in the day, the protests turned violent at night.

Between June 15-18, eight more people were arrested on charges ranging from attempted assault and criminal mischief to criminal trespass.

Portland Police took a step back after that, and no more arrests were announced by police until Sept. 28, when officers arrested two people after a fight broke out between protesters and counter-protesters.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN: LIVE UPDATES FROM CONGRESS AMID FUNDING STALEMATE However, some courts continued work on Trump policy-related suits after the government shutdown on Wednesday.","Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a two-page standing order on Wednesday granting blanket deadline extensions for most civil cases involving the federal government. The goal, Boasberg said, is to preserve the court’s “scarce judicial resources” and preempt a flood of case-specific motions to delay proceedings.

“The Court has a need to minimize expenditures of scarce judicial resources on large volumes of case-specific motions to stay or extend pending deadlines,” Boasberg wrote, adding that the lapse in appropriations constitutes “good cause” for extending timelines.

While the judiciary itself remains open, the administrative arm of the federal courts wrote in a memorandum Wednesday that current funding reserves will only sustain paid operations through Oct. 17. Courts rely on fee balances and prior-year appropriations during shutdowns, but recent budget stagnation has tightened margins.

The judiciary’s memo, signed by U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad, assured employees they will receive pay on Oct. 10 and 24. However, if funding runs out after that, essential personnel, including law clerks, probation officers, and court reporters, may be forced to work without pay under the Anti-Deficiency Act. Judges and Supreme Court justices will continue to be paid under constitutional guarantees.

Additionally, the threat of furloughs for judiciary personnel is slim so long as the shutdown does not persist for weeks. The judiciary was last forced to furlough employees during the shutdown that lasted 21 days between 1995 and 1996 under then-President Bill Clinton, according to the Brookings Institution.

Chief Judge John McConnell, an Obama appointee in Rhode Island, said if the situation persists, his courthouse will reduce operations to a four-day workweek and close one day weekly.

“It is so burdensome trying to figure out how we operate a co-equal branch of government that has constitutional responsibilities without appropriated funds,” McConnell said, according to Reuters.

Trump DOJ reverses course on immigration courts precedent

Breaking with precedent, the Trump administration said it will continue non-detained immigration court hearings during the shutdown. In its fiscal 2026 contingency plan published Monday, the DOJ cited the “national emergency” declared by President Donald Trump over illegal immigration and emphasized the backlog of more than 4 million pending immigration cases.

Immigration courts are separate from the federal judiciary and are operated by the DOJ.

Still, it marks a departure from prior shutdown responses, where non-detained immigration hearings were routinely suspended. Detained cases will continue consistent with statutory speedy trial requirements and public safety priorities.

Civil suits paused, but criminal cases move forward

Under the DOJ’s contingency plan, 89% of employees are exempt from furlough in the first five days of a shutdown. Prosecutors are expected to remain focused on criminal cases, but civil enforcement will largely be paused, especially lawsuits against Trump’s policy decisions.

Several new cases were already subject to stay motions by the government this week, including lawsuits over voter registration data requests and funding cuts for social programs. DOJ attorneys in multiple filings expressed “regret” for the disruption caused by the funding lapse.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN: LIVE UPDATES FROM CONGRESS AMID FUNDING STALEMATE

However, some courts continued work on Trump policy-related suits after the government shutdown on Wednesday. In an order from U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York, the judge blocked the Trump administration’s efforts to revoke and reallocate $34 million in public transport counterterrorism funds in response to the state’s immigration sanctuary policies. Kaplan, a Clinton appointee, placed a restraining order on reallocating those funds until Oct. 15.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dc-federal-courthouse-2014.webp?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-02 12:57:49.605720

Ocner",,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article312342495.html,"The Nakamoto Group is not a named defendant in the case.
It is unclear whether the state directly contracted the Nakamoto Group or if it is a subcontractor.
The inspections conducted by the Nakamoto Group are pre-announced and sometimes occur at different times from those of the OIG inspectors, which are not announced in advance.
These factors could have contributed to the discrepancies between what OIG inspectors found and the Nakamoto Group.
Court documents indicate that the group reached a settlement with the Nakamoto Group in 2022 and the case was dismissed.","To ensure detainees at its immigration detention camp in the Everglades can communicate with their attorneys, the state of Florida is relying on a contractor that has been repeatedly accused of rubber-stamping inspections at federal facilities.

A sealed court document filed in a lawsuit alleging Alligator Alcatraz detainees are being detained without proper access to legal services shows the DeSantis administration has entrusted those crucial provisions to the Nakamoto Group, a Maryland company with a history of complaints from detainees, federal inspectors and Congress about its inspections of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers.

The lawsuit was filed against the federal and state governments, which have operational oversight of the facility. The Nakamoto Group is not a named defendant in the case.

One 2018 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found that the Nakamoto Group’s inspection reports misrepresented the work done for their evaluations, and that the facilities’ conditions did not match what government inspectors observed during their own visits. In the report, ICE officials described the Nakamoto Group’s audits to OIG inspectors as “useless” and “very, very, very difficult to fail.”

The findings raise questions about the DeSantis administration’s vetting of vendors at Alligator Alcatraz, a hastily erected complex open once again after an appeals court overturned a judge’s order shutting the site down. They also provide some context for the legal-access issues being brought by lawyers

Mark Saunders, a Nakamoto Group vice president, stated in a now-sealed August brief supporting the state that the contractor manages in-person and video meetings between attorneys and detainees, which he reported are proceeding smoothly. However, lawyers continue to claim in a September amended complaint that immigrants held at the state facility by ICE are being kept without adequate access to their lawyers and the courts, in violation of their constitutional rights.

“Access to counsel at Alligator Alcatraz is dramatically more restrictive than at other immigration facilities and runs afoul of the requirements that” ICE has in place at other detention centers, the lawyers said in the amended complaint.

Saunders told the Miami Herald in an email that the Inspector General allegations against the company, as well as a 2021 American Civil Liberties Union report alleging widespread problems with the company’s work, had already been “rebutted and proven false.”

“The fact that anyone references them at all shows significant bias,” he wrote. “Due to that fact, don’t contact me or the company again. You will not be responded to.”

To learn more about the company’s history, the Herald reviewed congressional hearings, federal agency reports, court documents and dozens of emails from lawyers trying to meet their clients at Alligator Alcatraz. The Herald also spoke with lawyers who together have represented more than 20 clients detained at Alligator Alcatraz since the first detainees arrived at the site on July 2.

It is unclear whether the state directly contracted the Nakamoto Group or if it is a subcontractor.

The Florida Division of Emergency Management did not respond to requests for comment.

Questions about Nakamoto’s work

Following the 2018 inspector general report, Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, sent a letter to the Nakamoto Group requesting that the company explain its contract with ICE and address the issues identified by the OIG report. The Nakamoto Group disputed the findings of the report, labeling them a “misrepresentation” and “erroneous.”

During a House Homeland Security Committee hearing in September 2019, which evaluated whether DHS was properly overseeing ICE detention facilities, Jennifer Nakamoto, the founder and president of the Nakamoto Group, said that her grandparents were detained in a Japanese internment camp in Arizona. Nakamoto stated the company operated with fewer than 15 full-time employees and 45 part-time employees. In her opening statement to the committee, she said that she had been personally targeted due to her involvement with DHS and “for the purpose of discrediting ICE”.

“Nevertheless, some have chosen to ignore the facts and continue to reference disproven allegations for their political purposes and to further their agenda against ICE,” Nakamoto stated.

The inspections conducted by the Nakamoto Group are pre-announced and sometimes occur at different times from those of the OIG inspectors, which are not announced in advance. These factors could have contributed to the discrepancies between what OIG inspectors found and the Nakamoto Group. At one facility cited by the OIG, the Nakamoto Group inspection occurred five months after federal inspectors had visited the site.

The federal inspectors stood by their report and findings in a 2019 letter to Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren.

In September 2020, the House Homeland Security Committee, which had a Democratic majority at the time, released a report assessing conditions at ICE detention facilities. The report found the Nakamoto Group to be “ill-equipped to conduct inspections on behalf of ICE.”

The committee, in the report, also questioned ICE’s judgment in continuing to contract with the Nakamoto Group.

“Evidence suggests that Nakamoto does a poor job of conducting inspections and fails to operate in a manner that would best identify deficiencies,” the House committee report stated.

The company has also been named as a defendant in six lawsuits from inmates in other federal correctional facilities accusing the Nakamoto Group of negligence and failing to conduct thorough Prison Rape Elimination Act audits as part of its contracts with the Bureau of Prisons.

In one of those lawsuits, a group of female inmates detained at the Florida Correctional Institution in Tallahassee accused the facility’s physician assistant in 2021 of sexually assaulting numerous female prisoners during pelvic, anal, and breast exams.

“Systemic deficiencies in Nakamoto’s inspections of FCI Tallahassee in failing to identify and address clear signs of endemic sexual abuse at the facility was a proximate cause of injuries suffered by Plaintiffs,” the lawsuit alleged.

Court documents indicate that the group reached a settlement with the Nakamoto Group in 2022 and the case was dismissed. The court documents do not reveal the details of the settlement.

An ACLU analysis, which reviewed 88 inspection reports by the Nakamoto Group in 2021, found that the contractor continued to face similar inspection challenges due to issues such as insufficient staffing, failing to conduct proper detainee interviews and pre-announcing inspections. The ACLU is also a party in the lawsuit brought against the state and federal governments regarding legal access at Alligator Alcatraz.

Lawyers still battling for access at Alligator Alcatraz

Attorneys told the Herald that there was almost no way for them to communicate with any of their clients who were detained at the site when it opened in July on the airstrip of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Big Cypress National Preserve.

Their clients often did not appear in an online ICE database that helps families and attorneys find where detainees are being held. And ICE field office officials were unable to confirm if their client was detained at Alligator Alcatraz. The only way attorneys knew their client was detained at the site was because a family member informed them following a phone call from one of the phones located inside cells at the facility.

The August declaration and attached emails, which range from July through Aug. 4, submitted by Saunders from the Nakamoto Group as evidence that lawyers could meet with their clients, offer a behind-the-scenes look at some of the confusion lawyers faced.

Saunders said the inbox that attorneys use to schedule visits became operational on July 10 and received no emails during that period since opening. The lawyers the Herald spoke with said that was because it was not known what the process was, nor was it known that the inbox even existed.

For a lawyer to meet with their client at the facility, they must email the inbox, which Saunders said is monitored by three staff members. Lawyers can only visit during their scheduled time period and must submit documents in advance, verifying that they are representing their clients.

This process of attorney access differs from that of standard ICE detention centers, such as the Krome North Service Processing Center and the Broward Transitional Center. Lawyers told the Herald at Krome that they do not need to schedule an appointment to visit a detainee; they can simply show up during visitation hours and present their bar number and identification.

Saunders stated in the legal brief that these restrictions at Alligator Alcatraz were implemented for the safety of the facility staff and its detainees.

Attorneys were initially barred from visiting the site in person, but they could request a video conference instead. The first video conference meeting was held on July 15, according to Saunders.

The emails also highlight a limitation in the process set up by the state. In some instances, after initially setting an appointment, lawyers received emails stating that their client had already been moved from the site before their scheduled visit.

“This email is to inform you that the detainee [redacted personal information] was released to ICE and is no longer at Florida Soft Sided Facility (AA). This Zoom appointment has been cancelled on our end,” said an August email sent from a facility staffer to an attorney.

These obstacles are part of what is being argued in court in the case against the state and federal governments, filed by civil rights lawyers who are alleging that, since the site opened, the First Amendment rights of the detainees have been violated.

The lawyers are now asking Judge Sheri Polster Chappell of the Middle District of Florida to grant a preliminary injunction that would allow lawyers to meet with their clients without scheduled appointments, provide detainees at the facility with information about attorney-client meeting guidelines in English, Spanish, and Creole, and request that ICE update its online locator system within 24 hours of a detainees’ arrival at the facility.

In a status update on Friday, the civil rights lawyers highlighted a ruling in a similar case in the Southern District of New York, where detainees held at ICE’s 26 Federal Plaza Facility accused the government of violating their First Amendment rights. The federal judge in that case agreed with the detainees and ordered the government to allow lawyers to have phone calls with their clients within six hours of a request, permit free outgoing calls to lawyers within 24 hours of detention, and ensure that the ICE locator system accurately reflects the detainee’s location.

The state and federal governments have maintained that access by attorneys has improved at Alligator Alcatraz. They stated that the issues highlighted occurred because it took time to build the necessary infrastructure for these meetings. However, now, attorneys can access their clients both in person and via video conferencing.

Magdalena Cuprys, a lawyer at the Serving Immigrant law firm who has had multiple clients at the facility since its opening, said that at the start, when she tried to meet a client, the appointment inbox was not functioning, there was a long response time and she was not allowed in.

Cuprys stated that since then, access to attorneys remains a problem, especially for detainees who need to speak with pro bono lawyers. Lawyers cannot simply show up at any time during visitation hours to see their clients and must provide proof that they are authorized to represent the client.

However, she added that she has seen improvements at the site in terms of holding confidential in-person meetings with her clients. During her last visit on Sept. 1, she stated that she was able to meet with her client in a separate tent equipped with a security camera, located away from another tent she described as a waiting area.

“I felt like it was significantly improved,” Cuprys emphasized. “And you know, if I compare it to, let’s say, BTC or Krome, I feel like it was very similar.”",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/vg2lo3/picture311812301/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_Alligator_Alcatraz_MJO_9.JPG,N,,2025-10-02 11:58:34.975061

Judge Gabriel A. Fuentes ordered Wednesday Oct. 1 that Ivery be granted pretrial release without the house arrest restrictions federal prosecutors had requested.
Roughly two dozen friends, family members and Oak Park neighbors attended the hearing at Downtown Chicago’s Dirksen U.S.
In their letter, the student wrote that Ivery’s arrest made them “feel very scared for our Oak Park community.
Scaman’s letter included personal commendations for Ivery from Oak Park Police Chief Shatonya Johnson, OPRF School Resource Officer Sgt.","A federal judge ruled Wednesday to grant pretrial release to the Oak Park man with an intellectual disability who was arrested at a Broadview ICE facility protest over the weekend, choosing to impose few of the restrictions sought by federal prosecutors.

Paul Ivery, 26, was arrested by federal agents at the protest at 6:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 27. He was charged with felony assault of a federal officer after allegedly threatening to kill a Border Patrol agent and pulling down the officer’s helmet during his arrest, according to federal investigators.

Ivery, described by those who know him as having a deep appreciation for local law enforcement, told federal investigators he was at the protest to express “his disappointment that ICE agents were disrespectful towards the Broadview Police Department and veterans,” according to the criminal complaint filed against him.

Judge Gabriel A. Fuentes ordered Wednesday Oct. 1 that Ivery be granted pretrial release without the house arrest restrictions federal prosecutors had requested. Fuentes said that federal pretrial release office who evaluated Ivery’s case determined he was “among the lowest risks it had ever seen.”

Ivery will appear before Fuentes again later this month. He is set to be released from custody at the Metropolitain Correctional Center at 6 p.m. Wednesday.

Roughly two dozen friends, family members and Oak Park neighbors attended the hearing at Downtown Chicago’s Dirksen U.S. Courthouse to support Ivery. Oak Park Village President Vicki Scaman and Cook County Commissioner Tara Stamps were among the well-wishers.

“It was a win for law and humanity and for our families in Oak Park,” Stamps said

Scott Sakiyama, an Oak Park attorney who is helping support Ivery’s family but is not representing him in court, said that while the Judge’s pretrial release ruling was cause for some celebration, the case against Ivery needs to be dropped.

“These charges are ridiculous and they should be dropped,” Sakiyama said. “Hopefully, the government will take some time to reconsider what they’re doing here. I think the judge subtly asked them to do that during the hearing, but hopefully it will be over soon.”

During the hearing, Fuentes read two letters of support for Ivery into the record during the morning’s proceedings — one from Scaman and one from a junior student at Oak Park and River Forest High School, where Ivery has worked as a hall monitor and cafeteria worker for the last four years.

In their letter, the student wrote that Ivery’s arrest made them “feel very scared for our Oak Park community.

“He is not a criminal, he is a kind person,” the student said in the letter. “He is always attentive and hard working.”

Fuentes reading from the student’s letter brought Ivery to tears at the front of the courtroom.

Scaman’s letter included personal commendations for Ivery from Oak Park Police Chief Shatonya Johnson, OPRF School Resource Officer Sgt. Manuel Ruiz and OPPD Sgt. Samantha Deuchler.

“Our officers know him as the kid who stops and salutes when he sees them on the street,” Scaman wrote in her letter. “Paul contributes to all that makes Oak Park special, he’s a beloved member of our community.”

Fuentes said the letters made an impact on his ruling.

“People think that they may write to the judiciary and write to the government and they will not be heard,” he said. “Well, they’re heard.”

Scaman told Wednesday Journal after the hearing that she had never been inside a federal courthouse before, but that she was driven to stand up for a resident who was exercising his constitutional rights.

“This has been an extremely traumatic moment for Paul, so I’m grateful for the ruling,” Scaman said. “I know that our community is going to embrace Paul so that this is a moment that he will able to move forward from in a healthy way.”

Ivery’s attorney Johnathon Brooks argued against every restriction the state sought.

“He is in this situation because of the oppression of the United States government,” Brooks said.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Caitlin Walgamuth argued that Ivery’s release should come with orders that he be held on strict house arrest, placed under the custodianship of a neighbor and barred from interacting with minors while working at OPRF.

“The government’s position is that this is dangerous, erratic behavior,” Walgamuth said. “We would recommend that he not be in a role of authority for minors.”

She said that the government was alright with Ivery continuing to work at OPRF so long as he kept to the back of the cafeteria and away from students. She also suggested that Ivery’s intellectual disability served as grounds for a mandated custodianship. Fuentes rejected both of those arguments from the prosecution, saying that the suggestion that Ivery’s disability made more restrictions necessary was “ableist at worst.”

He said allowing Ivery to continue his normal work at OPRF was in all parties’ best interest.

“There is no way in the world I would tell him not to interact with minors,” he said. “My reaction to that was kind of visceral.”

Congressional Democrats proposed a monthlong continuing resolution that would keep the government open through Oct. 31, extend the health insurance premium subsidies, boost funding for security for public officials, and reverse the roughly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other federal health programs enacted in Trump’s July budget law.

Trump and the Republican majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate have refused to negotiate an extension, insisting on a seven-week stopgap law that would not address the health insurance price spikes.

A federal government shutdown can create ripple effects across immigration processes, but the impact varies depending on the agency.

Since USCIS is fee-funded, most operations — like processing petitions and applications — continue as usual.

However, programs that depend on annual appropriations may be suspended. These include E-Verify, certain religious worker categories, and the Conrad 30 J-1 waiver program. If E-Verify is temporarily unavailable, USCIS has confirmed employers may continue using the new alternate I-9 document review process for remote hires. During the previous government shutdown, USCIS suspended the “three-day rule” for completion of E-Verify and provided follow-up guidance once E-Verify came back online.

Similarly, for the duration of any shutdown, employees will be unable to resolve Tentative Non-Confirmations. During a previous shutdown, USCIS specifically indicated that the time period for resolving Tentative Non-Confirmations will be extended and days the federal government was closed would not count toward the eight federal government workdays the employee has to go to the Social Security Administration or contact the Department of Homeland Security. Employers are advised that they may not take any adverse action against an employee because of an E-Verify interim case status, including while the employee’s case is in an extended interim case status due to a federal government shutdown.

Employers that intend to sign up for E-Verify will be unable to do so during the shutdown. Federal contractors that are required to use E-Verify should contact counsel or their contracting official to determine how best to proceed during this period.

At the Department of State, visa and passport services generally continue since they are also fee-funded, although consular operations may be scaled back if fee revenue is insufficient. Customs and Border Protection inspection personnel are “essential,” so ports of entry remain open, but application processing at the border could slow.

Based on experience during past shutdowns, the Department of Labor (DOL) Office of Foreign Labor Certification likely will not accept or process applications or responses it receives, including Labor Condition Applications, Applications for Prevailing Wage Determinations, Applications for Temporary Certification, or Applications for Permanent Employment Certification. Web-based resources, including the Foreign Labor Access Gateway Portal (FLAG), likely also will be unavailable during shutdown.

State and federal wage and hour requirements aside, H-1B, H-2B, and E-3 employees who are placed on non-productive status or reduced work schedules nevertheless must continue to be paid at the full rate specified on their visa documentation.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Rhode Island, challenges a rule barring states from using Victims of Crime Act (VOCA), Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (Byrne JAG), and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grant funds to provide services to undocumented immigrants, or other individuals who cannot prove their status. Attorney General Ellison and the coalition argue that the new policy is unconstitutional and are asking the court to stop the rule from taking effect in their states.

""The Trump Administration's attempts to force Minnesota to screen for immigration status before we can help crime victims is wrong, both legally and morally, so we are taking them to court"" said Attorney General Ellison. ""Crime victims, especially survivors of domestic violence or human trafficking, may not have access to the documents they need to verify their immigration status. In fact, denying victims access to important legal documentation is often a tactic used by criminals to continue their abuse. I will not allow the Trump Administration to take vital resources away from crime victims, especially during some of the most difficult moments in their lives.""

For decades, the VOCA and VAWA grant programs have enabled states to support survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other violent crimes. The grants fund services such as legal representation in family court, relocation and housing assistance, compensation for medical bills and funeral costs, and other civil legal services. Byrne JAG grants provide additional resources to state and local governments for criminal justice initiatives, including – in some states – support for public defenders. In their lawsuit, the attorneys general emphasize that all three programs have long been available to all eligible individuals, regardless of immigration status.

In the past four years, Minnesota was awarded over $87 million in victim assistance and compensation grants and funding under VOCA. In fiscal year 2024, VOCA funds in Minnesota were used to serve roughly 64,000 individuals, all of whom were either crime victims or witnesses, or family members. The services provided to these individuals are important to their safety and recovery after a crime. Through these funds, survivors are provided services including safety planning, crisis intervention, emergency shelter, assistance applying for protective orders, safe housing, transportation, help accessing financial assistance, court-related support, accompaniment to hearings and appointments, support groups, and more.

Last month, DOJ informed states that they could no longer use VOCA, VAWA, or Byrne JAG funds to provide legal services to undocumented immigrants. The new “Legal Services Condition” applies not only to future funding but also to grants already awarded, and is scheduled to take effect on October 31, 2025.

Attorney General Ellison and the coalition warn that the new restrictions will upend victim services programs, cut off critical resources, and discourage survivors from seeking help. If service providers have to screen victims’ or witnesses’ immigration status, they could be forced to deny protection to families in crisis – a policy that would ultimately silence survivors and erode trust between communities and law enforcement. The attorneys general also highlight the fact that many service providers do not have the capacity or resources necessary to enact such screening processes.

In today’s lawsuit, Attorney General Ellison and the coalition argue that DOJ’s new restrictions violate the Constitution’s Spending Clause by attaching retroactive and ambiguous conditions to grants that were already awarded, in some cases years ago. The attorneys general also assert that DOJ acted in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to justify its reversal of decades-long policy and by ignoring the harm the rule will cause to survivors and service providers.

Outside the courtroom, shifting narratives can change the way people think about issues and act toward one another. The Center for Inclusion and Belonging works at the intersection of narrative and behavior change, and our identity refresh reflects that unique role.

The American Immigration Council is a leader in protecting due process, challenging unjust policies, and defending rights for immigrants that ultimately benefit us all. But laws and policies don’t exist in a vacuum, they are shaped by how people feel and their relationship to each other.

The reality is that immigration is lived and experienced through everyday interactions. From the parent cheering on the same sports team at your kid’s school, to the neighbor who opens a small business down the street, immigrants are a core part of thriving communities, and it is these interactions that become opportunities for connection and unity.

The Center for Inclusion and Belonging was created to reshape our understanding of who belongs in the places we all call home. After six years of working across a range of settings with diverse partners — from pluralism and bridge-building to narrative change and immigration — we recognized the need for a visual identity that could embody the values and spaces in which we operate.

The butterfly at the heart of our new logo is more than a symbol, it’s a reminder of what we’re building together. While each wing is distinct, together they create movement. And that word matters. Movement is so deeply ingrained in the natural world: in the wings of a butterfly and in the flow of rivers and seasons. It is just as intrinsic to people. The freedom to move or stay, to build a life rooted in safety and opportunity, shapes what it means to be human.

Immigration agents told him the ID card was fake, before eventually releasing him.","An Alabama construction worker and U.S. citizen who says he was detained twice by immigration agents within just a few weeks has filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding an end to Trump administration workplace raids targeting industries with large immigrant workforces.

The class-action lawsuit, filed Tuesday by concrete worker Leo Garcia Venegas with the public interest law firm Institute for Justice, demands an end to what the firm calls ""unconstitutional and illegal immigration enforcement tactics.""

Venegas, who was born in the U.S., lives and works in Baldwin County, Alabama, a Gulf Coast area between the cities of Mobile and Pensacola, Florida, that has seen immense population growth in the last 15 years, and which offers plenty of construction work.

The lawsuit comes just weeks after the Supreme Court lifted a judge's restraining order that had barred immigration agents in Los Angeles from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The court has repeatedly allowed some of the Trump administrations harshest immigration policies, while also leaving open that legal outcomes could shift as cases play out.

The new lawsuit describes repeated raids on workplaces despite agents having no warrants nor suspicion that specific workers were in the U.S. illegally, and a string of U.S. citizens — many with Latino-sounding names — who were detained.

The Department of Homeland Security ""authorizes these armed raids based on the general assumption that certain groups of people in the industry, including Latinos, are likely illegal immigrants,"" the suit argues.

In a May raid that swept up Venegas, video shot by a coworker shows him being forced to the ground by immigration agents as he repeatedly insisted he was a U.S. citizen. The lawsuit says the agents targeted workers at the building site who looked Latino, while leaving alone the other workers. Venegas was released after more than an hour, according to the law firm.

Venegas was detained again at another construction site less than a month later.

""It feels like there is nothing I can do to stop immigration agents from arresting me whenever they want,"" Leo said in a statement released by the law firm. ""I just want to work in peace. The Constitution protects my ability to do that.""

Venegas, who specializes in laying concrete foundations, says he was detained both times despite showing his Alabama-issued REAL ID driver's license — a higher-security identity card available only to U.S. citizens and legal residents.

Immigration agents told him the ID card was fake, before eventually releasing him. He was released after about 20-30 minutes.

""Immigration officers are not above the law,"" Institute for Justice attorney Jaba Tsitsuashvili said in a statement. ""Leo is a hardworking American citizen standing up for everyone's right to work without being detained merely for the way they look or the job that they do.""

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol, working with ICE agents, arrested 120 illegal immigrants during an operation at a port of entry near the Texas border.

The plan, dubbed Operation Guardian, was a comprehensive deportation effort launched by Gov. Kevin Stitt in coordination with Oklahoma’s Department of Public Safety.

The sting took place along Interstate 40, where officials found most offenders with unverifiable licenses behind the wheels of 80,000-pound 18-wheelers.

During the operation, troopers encountered more than 500 people and turned 120 over to ICE, according to officials.

'COMMON SENSE': RED STATE GOVERNOR MAKES CRUCIAL MOVE TO BOOST TRUMP'S DEPORTATION PUSH

Department of Public Safety Commissioner Tim Tipton said the findings were alarming, highlighting a serious safety risk. Many of the licenses were either expired by nearly a decade or listed under a single name, making identification impossible.

""You don’t have a minor collision with a commercial vehicle,"" Tipton said. ""An 80,000-pound truck at 70 miles an hour isn’t going to be a minor crash.""

Oklahoma’s Operation Guardian plan states that the state currently houses about 525 undocumented offenders in its prisons, costing $36,000 per day.

The plan alleges that 30% of those crimes are violent offenses against children, 20% violent assaults, 14% homicides or other violent deaths, and 7% sex crimes. It notes that most offenders are from Mexico (72%), followed by Guatemala, Honduras, and Vietnam.

MASSIVE ICE OPERATION NETS GANG MEMBERS, MURDERERS, CHILD PREDATORS: 'WREAKED HAVOC'

Stitt said the operation is designed to move undocumented offenders directly from state and county custody into federal deportation proceedings, ending what he calls years of federal neglect.

""Former President Biden’s weak border policies allowed our country to become a safe haven for criminal illegal migrants — that ends in Oklahoma with Operation Guardian,"" Stitt said. ""These dangerous illegal aliens should not be walking our streets, and they soon won’t be. Oklahoma will continue to stand for law and order.""

The plan expands ICE agreements so some state and local officers can detain and transfer offenders. It also allows parole boards to send noncitizen inmates straight to federal custody if deportation orders are already in place.

It will implement a Rapid REPAT program as well, allowing eligible inmates to skip appeals and move directly into deportation.

Tipton emphasized the operation was about more than immigration policy — it was about protecting families on Oklahoma’s roads and in its communities.

""This plan ensures Oklahoma leads the nation in cracking down on illegal aliens who’ve committed crimes against our communities,"" Tipton said.

Asylum and Temporary Protected Status Asylum is another way to seek protected status and enter the country.
The vast majority of these international students are graduate students.
“We have had FSU students applying for all these different kinds of statuses,” Aguilar said.
We can’t take on every case, but we can help by providing referrals.” International students contribute to research, innovation and creativity at FSU.","The implementation of new immigration policies by the Trump Administration has left many students at Florida State University (FSU) scrambling to figure out what to make of them.

Program Manager for the Center for the Advancement of Human Rights (CAHR), Vania Aguilar, is one of the many individuals helping students directly impacted by these rule changes navigate the complexities of immigration.

Aguilar works directly with clients on their cases, whether they’re FSU students or in the greater Tallahassee area. She explained that the changes make it harder for those who could qualify for legal status to achieve it.

“With so many changes in the administration through executive orders, people that have qualified over the years for all of those protections are not as protected anymore,” Aguilar said to the FSView.

U-Visas: protection for victims of violent crime

One of these protected statuses is the U-Visa, which is reserved for victims of violent crime. The government first introduced U-Visas in October 2000 with a cap of 10,000 petitioner visas per year. The visa is valid for four years with extensions available under specific circumstances.

Aguilar says that a person who is applying for this visa can wait anywhere from fifteen to twenty years before their visa is approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

“I’ve had clients that have submitted applications in 2016 and 2017 and those clients are still waiting and all they have at this point is a letter that says USCIS has determined their application approvable,” Aguilar said.

Anyone who doesn’t have final approval for U-Visas will be at risk of detainment. A recent Board of Immigration Appeals decision stated that anyone who has entered the U.S. without inspection can be detained without bond.

“If it is taking fifteen to twenty years for a U-Visa to be approved, a person who hasn’t really committed any crimes, who has been contributing to our communities, many of them with businesses, they don’t really want to be in a detention center for that long until they actually get their visas approved,” Aguilar said.

Clients who have been waiting for years to have their applications accepted are still waiting, holding only a document that prevents them from being removed from the country.

Asylum and Temporary Protected Status

Asylum is another way to seek protected status and enter the country. For someone to qualify for asylum in the U.S., they must meet the criteria of experiencing persecution for at least one of five categories: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership of a particular social group.

“When we take these cases, we have to do a lot of screening to make sure that the person does meet the requirements,” Aguilar said. “We also need to do a lot of research, looking at country conditions, looking at any documents that support their claim, to make sure that everything is well documented.”

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a third option. The U.S. can evaluate the conditions of a country at any given time. If a country gets hit with a natural disaster, for example, people from that country can qualify for TPS.

This status is only valid for eighteen months, as long as the U.S. government continues to classify that country as one that qualifies for TPS. After those eighteen months, individuals who still meet the requirements can reapply for this status.

However, following recent changes implemented through the use of Executive Orders, statuses such as Deferred Action — which delays deportation for a specific period — and TPS have been altered or completely terminated.

An additional layer of pressure comes from agreements that cities and universities, such as Tallahassee and FSU, have been reportedly making with ICE.

Aguilar states that immigration law is much more complex than some make it out to be and law enforcement officers are not prepared for the additional task of immigration control.

“We are really focusing our local resources in efforts that are not helping the communities,” Aguilar said. “If they’re taking away from protecting our communities to focus on this other role that they have been assigned, which they’re really not prepared to do anyway, it’s not impacting just the immigrant or refugee communities, it’s impacting everyone.”

Students find community despite challenges

FSU alone is home to around 2,500 international students who, as of the fall 2023 semester, represented 130 different countries of citizenship. The vast majority of these international students are graduate students. Many more FSU students immigrated to the U.S. prior to starting college and may still call another country “home.”

If a student finds themselves in a situation where their immigration status is threatened, Aguilar believes they should have an action plan and not wait until the situation is dire to figure out what they want to do to protect themselves.

“We have had FSU students applying for all these different kinds of statuses,” Aguilar said. “We’re happy to provide consultations. We can’t take on every case, but we can help by providing referrals.”

International students contribute to research, innovation and creativity at FSU. To the general student body, they contribute geographic diversity and perspectives shaped by their unique backgrounds. They tackle not only immigration processes and assimilation to a new country, but also student-specific issues such as acquiring student visas and adjusting to the unique culture of American universities.

FSU Presidential Scholar Isabella Moraes hails from Caraguatatuba, a city in southeast Brazil. She moved with her family to south Florida years before beginning college and is now a U.S. citizen.

“I miss my culture and country a lot and not in the way that it is 'better' than the U.S., but in the way that I feel closer to [Brazilian culture] than the American culture,” Moraes said. “My family moved to the U.S. from Brazil because of the rise in violence in my home country.”

The subculture of an American college depends on an institution's resources, athletics, traditions and location. To both domestic and international students, college can provide its own unique kind of culture shock.

At FSU, the Center for Global Engagement (CGE) offers another form of support for immigrant students: helping them find a sense of community. Beloved traditions like International Coffee Hour encourage communion through food, welcoming all students to the Globe on Friday afternoons to celebrate the food and drink of a different culture.

These spaces on campus may foster a sense of community that they have left behind in more familiar places.

Just as vital to the legal support offered by the CAHR is helping immigrant students feel supported in the collegiate environment, whether that’s connecting with other students with similar backgrounds, directly engaging with their heritage in Tallahassee, or simply finding a space that feels close to home.","https://www.fsunews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/02/USAT/84450795007-usatsi-26333334-168410238-lowres.jpg?crop=2433,1367,x0,y0&width=2433&height=1367&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-02 03:56:43.311332

Last Thursday, in response to increased immigration enforcement in Washington, D.C., several residents and the open-borders organization CASA filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The lawsuit alleges that federal authorities are violating immigration law by arresting aliens without warrants or probable cause.

The Trump administration’s law enforcement surge in the District of Columbia has resulted in a sharp decrease in overall crime, but has also had implications for immigration enforcement. On August 11, President Donald Trump issued two executive orders that federalized the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and deployed the D.C. National Guard (DCNG) to support law enforcement operations in D.C. The actions were taken consistent with Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act, which allows the President to exercise control over the Metropolitan Police for “federal purposes.” In an August 15 order, Attorney General Pam Bondi noted the role of the DC’s sanctuary policies in contributing to violent crime and directed D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to increase cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Following declines in violent crime, the Trump administration is now facing a lawsuit. The complaint in the case, Escobar Molina v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, alleges that federal agents are arresting D.C. residents without warrants or probable cause. The plaintiffs, including several foreign nationals with pending asylum claims, are seeking both class certification and to stop federal agents from continuing to make arrests in D.C. According to the complaint, “Defendants’ policy and practice of making immigration arrests without a warrant and without probable cause have sown terror in Latino and other communities across the District and violate unequivocal statutory restrictions on warrantless arrests.”

Federal law, namely 8 U.S.C. 1357, authorizes immigration officers to interrogate and arrest aliens suspected to be in the country illegally. That statute states:

Any officer or employee of the Service authorized under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General shall have power without warrant [emphasis added] —

(1) to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States;

(2) to arrest any alien who in his presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens, or to arrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of any such law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest, but the alien arrested shall be taken without unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the Service having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the United States;

This statute was also at issue in Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, in which the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California blocked federal authorities from relying solely on certain factors as the basis of a reasonable suspicion, including “(i) presence at particular locations such as bus stops, car washes, day laborer pickup sites, agricultural sites, and the like; (ii) the type of work one does; (iii) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; and (iv) apparent race or ethnicity.” On September 8, the Supreme Court stayed the District Court’s order, allowing enforcement operations to proceed. In making that decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh was emphatic: “The interests of individuals who are illegally in the country in avoiding being stopped by law enforcement for questioning is ultimately an interest in evading the law. That is not an especially weighty legal interest.”

DHS was quick to respond to the latest lawsuit. DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin called the allegations “disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE.” She continued to state that, “What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity. DHS law enforcement uses ‘reasonable suspicion’ to make arrests. There are no ‘indiscriminate stops’ being made.”

By law, Mexico offers robust rights and some protections to migrants and refugees: temporary residency, job security, education, and health care.
But the injustices committed against Jaime Alanís, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, and countless other migrants demand that the Mexican state do far more to stand up for migrants beyond its borders.","On July 10, 2025, immigration officers conducted a violent raid at a cannabis greenhouse in Camarillo, California. Workers fled in horror. Outside, behind rows of police officers, families and community members fought to reach workers amidst clouds of tear gas and flashbang bursts. By nightfall, immigration agents had detained over 200 laborers, and Jaime Alanís, a 57-year-old migrant from Huajúmbaro, Michoacán, lay in an intensive care unit. During the raid, he fell thirty feet from the greenhouse ceiling while trying to flee. He died a day later, leaving behind his community, wife, and daughter.

Days after his death, on July 16, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced her administration would consider legal action over Alanís’s death. Her words, and a pending legal response, raise a key question: As the United States government expands its assault on immigrants—many of them Mexican—what role should the Mexican state play in defending their dignity?

Recent raids have upended communities by removing people who were long anchored in them. Through mid-July, over half of the Mexicans detained in this year’s raids in Los Angeles had been living in the city for over a decade. More than one-third had lived in the United States for over twenty years. Family members and neighbors—torn away and warehoused in deplorable conditions. The Mexican state can help repair these wounds by fortifying its consular efforts, supporting the work of advocacy organizations, and modeling a politics of migrant dignity.

While navigating tariff threats and pressures over narco-trafficking and violence, the Mexican government can still do more to push a politics of migrant dignity, in the United States and at home. It has before. Indeed, the Mexican state can play an essential role in hemispheric immigration politics because it has for over 100 years.

Shifting Migration Policy

From the 1900s through the early 1970s, Mexico’s government opposed long-term Mexican migration. Seeing it as detrimental to the country’s economic development, Mexico aided efforts to stifle and reverse migration. In the early 1930s, the U.S. government repatriated and deported between 350,000 and 2 million ethnic Mexicans—both citizens and non-citizens—who were blamed for “taking jobs” during the Great Depression. The Mexican government aided removals by transporting migrants from the border deep into the country’s interior, hindering migrants’ attempts to re-cross. Similarly, in the 1950s, during “Operation Wetback”—the mass deportation campaign Donald Trump promises to emulate—the Mexican government transported deportees far into the country’s territory to solidify their removal from U.S. soil.

Yet, while the Mexican government opposed the emigration of its citizens through the early 1970s, it also recognized the importance of giving asylum to political refugees and other migrants from across the globe. In the late 1930s, the Lázaro Cárdenas administration opened Mexico’s doors to thousands of refugees of the Spanish Civil War, despite some Mexicans’ objections. Later, during the Cold War, Mexico gave asylum to thousands of political refugees from Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua—even while the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party waged its own campaign against Mexican social movements.

As Mexico faced a series of economic downturns starting in the 1970s, it shifted its posture on its citizens migrating to the United States. Historical inflation peaked in the mid-1970s, debt rose in the 1980s, and a recession and peso devaluation took hold in the mid-1990s. These crises pushed the state to view migration as a potential solution to poverty. While it largely abandoned these communities—mostly in underserved rural regions—the Mexican state built up its support for immigrants in the United States.

In 1990, the Foreign Relations Secretariat established the Program for Mexican Communities Abroad (PMCE), which aimed to protect Mexican migrants and build ties with organizations such as the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) and the National Council of La Raza. Then, in 2003, as the North American Free Trade Agreement—better known as NAFTA—displaced millions of rural Mexicans, the Mexican state institutionalized its migrant advocacy. Consolidating the PMCE and the Presidential Office for Mexicans Abroad into the Institute for Mexicans Abroad, it enshrined the protection of Mexican immigrants in the United States in its foreign relations agenda.

Migration under Morena

Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) and Claudia Sheinbaum, the former and current presidents of Mexico’s ruling left-wing party, known as Morena, have made symbolic and material gestures in support of Mexican immigrants. In his final Independence Day ceremony, AMLO voiced his embrace of Mexican migrants. “Long live our migrant siblings!” he shouted from the central balcony of the National Palace during the famous Grito—the annual commemoration of the Cry of Dolores, which marked the start of the Mexican War of Independence. In this year’s Grito, Sheinbaum made a similar call: “Long live our migrant sisters and brothers!”

Mexico’s relationship with the United States has shifted since AMLO left office. Much of Sheinbaum’s early presidency has been defined by the Trump administration’s hostility—expressed in tariff threats and a politics of xenophobia and mass deportation. Though she has been praised for her handling of the tariff threat, her response to the assault on migrant communities has been limited, reflecting Mexico’s uneven political and economic relationship with the United States.

Rather than voicing outright objection, the current Morena administration has responded to U.S. deportation campaigns by promising modest stipends, benefits, and jobs for deported Mexicans. As in the past, the broader Mexican state has also provided support by monitoring migrants’ work conditions and immigration enforcement through its consular and foreign relations programs. In addition to voicing condemnation over the death of Jaime Alanís, Sheinbaum criticized the conditions for migrants at the Florida detention center known as “Alligator Alcatraz”. However, her position has not been that migrants detained in the facility must be returned to their communities in the United States, but rather “for them to return to [Mexico] immediately and not be detained in this manner.”

Both AMLO and Sheinbaum’s approaches to the broader issue of immigration have been contradictory. For much of the twentieth century, Mexico’s government opposed Mexican migration but embraced some immigration into the country. Now, it embraces Mexican immigrants abroad but complicates life for countless migrants within its borders.

When threatened with tariffs in 2019, AMLO’s administration cooperated with the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP)—also known as “Remain in Mexico”—a policy created under Trump and momentarily continued by Biden. MPP turned asylum seekers away from the United States and forced them to remain on the Mexican side of the border while they awaited entry. This policy put countless Central American, South American, and Caribbean migrants in peril in Mexican border towns, exposing them to abuse, extortion, and violence. Mexican armed forces, in many instances, contributed to the brutalization of these migrants. AMLO’s cooperation with this policy—and more broadly with U.S. immigration enforcement—reflects Mexico’s long history as an immigrant buffer zone for the United States. However, it also reveals how Morena administrations have restricted migration in Mexico to curry political and economic favor with the United States.

Earlier this year, President Sheinbaum faced a similar predicament. Calling tariff threats “nothing new,” she evaded their enactment in February by expanding Mexican cooperation with U.S. immigration enforcement. She has stationed 10,000 National Guard officers to patrol Mexico’s northern border. Although this deployment is primarily connected to concerns over drug trafficking, it is also linked to preventing the smuggling of immigrants. Sheinbaum has additionally accepted over 6,000 third-country immigrants deported from the United States, directly aiding Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

Much like in the past, Mexico’s participation in today’s immigration politics is rife with contradictions born from its unbalanced relationship to the United States. Mexico’s government supports Mexican migrants in certain circumstances, but it extends far less grace to most immigrants in its own territory.

Transforming the Politics of Migration

The Mexican state should build upon its monitoring of immigration enforcement in the United States. Through the work of the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles, local advocates have accessed crucial information regarding the number of undocumented immigrants detained in 2025 raids. Statistics and official observations are critical for better understanding the magnitude and severity of deportation campaigns. They are also essential as migrants and their families seek justice, in a backdrop of increasingly unjust immigration policy by the Trump administration.

The Mexican state can also fortify its relationship with advocacy organizations to challenge the power of private detention centers, a key element in Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Though difficult for the Mexican government to litigate against private companies in the United States—as evidenced by its failed efforts to sue U.S. gun manufacturers—its own investigations through consular agents can aid organizations like MALDEF and the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles in their efforts to dismantle detention centers run by companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic.

In 2020, Mexican consuls used legal pressure against the Irwin Detention Center in Georgia for subjecting four Mexican women to medical malpractice. By doing so, it prevented the deportations of three of the four women. As this year shapes up to be one of the deadliest for migrants in the custody of U.S. immigration agencies, legal pressure is crucial. For it to be successful, coordinated—rather than disjointed—efforts by the Mexican government and immigrant advocacy organizations will be critical.

In the past several months, migrants from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia, Cuba, and several other countries have died in detention and immigration raids. Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a man who migrated from Mexico as a child and spent most of his life in the United States, died after detention officers rejected his pleas for medical help. As more migrants with diverse origins face Ayala-Uribe’s fate, Mexico must aid the legal work of advocacy organizations and extend this model to similarly affected nations.

In the long term, the Mexican state can—and must—espouse a politics of migrant dignity. By law, Mexico offers robust rights and some protections to migrants and refugees: temporary residency, job security, education, and health care. In practice, however, these promises go largely unmet because of institutional bottlenecks, pushing immigrants into perilous situations that force them to attempt migrations farther north. By meeting these guarantees, the Mexican state can reify the politics of migrant dignity already written in its law and give concrete terms to a political framework that should be emulated beyond borders—including in the United States.

By acting now, the Mexican state can transform the politics of migration. The country’s ability to make these changes is constrained by tariff threats, pressures over narco-violence, and its uneven relationship with the United States. But the injustices committed against Jaime Alanís, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, and countless other migrants demand that the Mexican state do far more to stand up for migrants beyond its borders.",https://nacla.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sheinbaum54607508729_229f82e8b7_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 23:57:14.295521

""Someone who says I'm against abortion but is in favor of the death penalty is not really pro-life,"" Pope Leo said. ""And someone who says I'm against abortion but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don't know if that's pro-life.""

The remarks represent the first American pope's first foray as pontiff into his native country's pitched debates over abortion, immigration and the Catholic Church's role in civil society.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the Pope's comments on Wednesday.

""I would reject there is inhumane treatment of illegal immigrants in the United States under this administration,"" Leavitt told reporters at the White House. ""There was, however, significant, inhumane treatment of illegal immigrants in the previous administration as they were being trafficked and raped and beaten, in many cases killed over our United States southern border.""

Before he was elected Pope on May 8, Leo — then known as Cardinal Robert Prevost — shared articles on social media that were critical of the Trump administration's rhetoric and policies on immigration.

A papal press gaggle

The Pope's brief remarks came in response to questions from reporters who gathered outside of his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo on Tuesday evening.

One reporter asked the Chicago-born pontiff about the controversy over plans to honor Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin with a lifetime achievement award by a Catholic institution — despite the Illinois lawmaker's support for abortion rights.

Leo said he wasn't ""very familiar with the case,"" but he said the award was a recognition of Durbin's ""overall work"" during more than 40 years of service in Congress.

""I understand the difficulty and the tensions. But I think as I myself have spoken in the past, it's important to consider many issues related to the teaching of the Church,"" said Leo.

The pope urged people involved in the U.S. — and his native state of Illinois — to ""have respect for one another"" while reminding faithful that the teaching of the Catholic Church on these issues is ""very clear.""

On Sept. 22, Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich announced he would be presenting Durbin with the award at the upcoming Keep Hope Alive gala in acknowledgment of Durbin's support for migrants.

Critics, including Bishop Thomas Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois, where Durbin lives, condemned the award because of the senator's past support for abortion rights. Paprocki has denied Communion for Durbin since 2004.

Durbin, whose fifth term in the Senate ends in January of 2027, has said that he will not seek re-election.

Shortly after the pope's remarks, Cupich issued a statement announcing Durbin has declined to receive the award.

""While I am saddened by this news, I respect his decision,"" wrote the cardinal, who stressed that the award was in recognition of ""his unwavering support of immigrants, which is so needed in our day.""

Cupich also lamented the growing partisan divide within the U.S., which he said leaves Catholics ""politically homeless."" While church teaching bars honoring politicians who support policies contrary to Catholic doctrine, he said no leader consistently embodies Catholic social teaching.

Between June 24 and July 28, ICE authorities at Broadview held 21 people longer than three days, with a few longer than five days.
Gladis Yolanda Chavez spent four days in Broadview in June after she was arrested on an immigration charge.
Many of the 122 ICE detention facilities in 36 states and territories contract for services, but Broadview appears to be staffed exclusively by federal employees.
“There’s a lot of secrecy with regards to what’s going on in Broadview,” said Franzblau of the National Immigrant Justice Center.","Here’s how Yushell Alejandro Yin Del Toro sums up the three miserable days he recently spent at the federal facility in suburban Broadview, where federal officers hold immigrants after arresting them:

For sleeping, crowded cold floors or scant plastic chairs for dozens of men. For eating, sandwiches and water. For bathroom needs, a toilet out in the open, no soap or toothpaste.

“The cell is gross, extremely dirty, I never lay down on the floor, it was so filthy,” Yushell, 38, said from Mexico City, days after he was grabbed by immigration officers in Mount Prospect on Sept. 24 on his way to work from an exercise class. “Still, sleeping while sitting on the floor was impossible.

“We told the guards that the place was at full capacity, but they kept bringing people inside,” Yushell said. “They treated us like animals, or worse than animals, because no one treats their pets like that.”

Broadview was never designed to be a detention facility, but the administration of President Donald Trump is now using it as a de facto one. As a “service processing center” it’s intended to hold people picked up by immigration authorities, with capacity for 236 adults for up to 12 hours each, before they are released, deported or transferred to a detention facility. A 2023 report clocks an average hold time of five hours there.

And yet, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement held 143 people for two or more days at Broadview during the first seven months of 2025, according to a Chicago Sun-Times and WBEZ analysis of ICE data made available by the Deportation Data Project through July 28.

In a June 24 memo, ICE quietly expanded the maximum number of hours to 72, or three days, that an immigrant could be held in a processing center like Broadview. That came as Trump appointees tripled ICE immigration arrest quotas to 3,000 per day, and detention centers filled up.

Between June 24 and July 28, ICE authorities at Broadview held 21 people longer than three days, with a few longer than five days. That’s even before greater numbers of immigrants became targets of immigration enforcement in the city and suburbs beginning on Sept. 8, when ICE and Customs and Border Protection were dispatched here to ratchet up the federal government’s deportation campaign.

“The stories we’re hearing are pretty horrific in terms of the human rights violations and the due process violations that people are reporting,” said Olivia Abrecht, a senior attorney with the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not answer questions about the number of immigrants currently being held at Broadview or why some are being held for longer than ICE-determined time limits for processing centers.

In an emailed statement, the department said that “ICE operates hold rooms and holding facilities in strict accordance with its National Detention Standards to ensure the safety, security, and humane treatment of individuals in custody.”

The rest of the statement refers to conditions at “detention centers.”

ICE detention centers hold immigrants for longer stays, unlike processing centers which are designed only for quick intake. That means they come with clear rules, detailed in a 76-page handbook in 19 languages provided to detainees. They post visiting hours and procedures online, and they’re subject to regular inspections to stay in line with detailed detention standards, all of which are posted on the Department of Homeland Security website.

But Broadview isn’t named among them. In fact, little appears on ICE’s website about Broadview, where 5,200 people were processed and held for as little as an hour and as long as seven days from January through July 28. That is more than three times the number of people jailed during the same period a year earlier, according to the Sun-Times/WBEZ analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.

‘Not equipped to be an overnight facility’

Inside the ICE processing building at 1930 Beach Street, there’s no medical staff or services. No food preparation. No beds. That’s all by design because the facility was created for very short-term holds.

A 2023 audit required by Congress, for example, described a single shower in the building that was out of commission at the time and used for storage.

Detainees have no private way to speak with their lawyers, attorneys say. Illinois Congressional members seeking to assess the facility also have been denied entry.

Even a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged last week that Broadview is “not equipped to be an overnight facility.” He told this to U.S. District Judge John Blakey during a hearing about a federal lawsuit filed by a man picked up in Little Village in September.

As an immigration attorney, Abrecht has represented people processed through Broadview for three years. She has heard increasing complaints from clients confined there about mistreatment.

Gladis Yolanda Chavez spent four days in Broadview in June after she was arrested on an immigration charge. The women were kept in two rooms with glass windows, the men in two other larger rooms. The toilet on each side wasn’t private. The phone in the women’s cell didn’t always work.

She was in a room with about 30 women, “stacked one next to the other one.” The floor, where they slept, “was extremely cold. We couldn’t lay on the floor for too long.”

“We couldn’t change our clothes, we couldn’t do our personal hygiene,” she told WBEZ in Spanish from Honduras, where ICE deported her. To use the toilet, “We had to come together, three or four women, to block the view so that others couldn’t see through the glass window” of the cell.

Menstruating women were given a little toilet paper and a pad, she said. There was only so much cleanup they could manage using the sink.

As for food, “We were only given cold bread — all day. Sometimes we were given small water bottles; sometimes they didn’t give us water,” Chavez said. “It was a terrible experience. We looked out the window and saw that more people were coming, and we would be more crowded.”

Immigrants say cells are crowded, meals are Subway sandwiches

Arrests are believed to have ramped up since Trump launched his “blitz” in Chicago on Sept. 8, though ICE has yet to release detailed data.

But little has improved since June, based on reports from several immigrants, including Salam, who spent two days in Broadview last week before being deported to Belize. Toilets still out in the open, cells still crowded.

“Everybody is like, ‘It’s like a pile of fish in there,’” said Salam who asked not to disclose his full name to protect his privacy.

He said the sandwiches served for breakfast, lunch and dinner now come wrapped in Subway paper, bread with ham and cheese. But they’re hardly as good as the sandwiches he’s bought.

“Conditions at Broadview are exacerbated by the pace of ICE arrests, which choke ICE’s processing capacity at Broadview and its detention capacity,” said Fred Tsao, a senior attorney with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

By law, Illinois bans overnight detention of immigrants. But the Illinois Way Forward Act in 2021 only prohibits local and state governments from contracting with federal officials to house immigrants overnight. The law doesn’t govern ICE-operated facilities like Broadview, Tsao said.

“ICE is trying to define this facility in some way that basically gets them out … of the regular inspections process,” said Jesse Franzblau who heads policy initiatives at the National Immigrant Justice Center.

If, as ICE says, it’s operating Broadview according to national detention standards, “then there should be regular inspections, which should be made public in accordance with congressional reporting requirements, and ICE should be allowing members of Congress to conduct oversight in the facility. From the testimony of people held there, it is clear that ICE is not adhering to the most basic standards of care,” Franzblau said.

Many of the 122 ICE detention facilities in 36 states and territories contract for services, but Broadview appears to be staffed exclusively by federal employees. Elsewhere, the federal government leases space in county jails and prisons, or they hire a for-profit company to operate detention centers on their behalf.

That offers more access points to understanding what’s happening inside beyond what ICE may or may not share.

This lack of transparency prompted several local Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation — Danny Davis, Jesús “Chuy” García, Delia Ramirez and Jonathan Jackson — to show up to Broadview for a tour. So far they’ve been denied entry, despite their protests that Congress is entitled access to facilities it funds. A meeting they and other Illinois Democratic representatives set with ICE’s Chicago field office director has been postponed to an “unconfirmed date in October,” according to ICE.

Letters that delegation members have sent to the ICE field office director and to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ask basic questions about the detention standards that govern Broadview; the data of the last facility inspection; the medical care available to the detainees.

“There’s a lot of secrecy with regards to what’s going on in Broadview,” said Franzblau of the National Immigrant Justice Center. “It’s incredibly hard to even talk to people about their legal rights in Broadview, because of the nature under which people are being detained, because ICE is essentially trying to hold them in this type of limbo.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed3aaf1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7150x4082+0+526/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2Fbf%2Fb3df318c4ce19ce18ce42b9c5f52%2Fbroadviewfacts-10xx25-05.JPG,N,,2025-10-02 01:56:22.193977

U.S. law has long rendered people living in the U.S. illegally — without any type of legal status — ineligible for most federal benefits, including Medicaid.
While people who are in the U.S. illegally are not covered by federal Medicaid, the program may reimburse hospitals providing emergency care to immigrants who lack legal status.
Democratic leaders have denied that they're seeking to fund healthcare for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.","One of the main lines of attack the White House and Republican lawmakers have leveled against Democrats amid the government shutdown is the claim that Democratic lawmakers want to give immigrants in the U.S. illegally free healthcare — which Democrats deny.

""Democrats are holding the American government HOSTAGE so they can give FREE health care to ILLEGAL ALIENS,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said on social media Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of wanting to ""take from the American people in order to give taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal immigrants.""

Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have pointed to a provision in the Democrats' funding proposal that would reverse the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's measures narrowing Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens. The changes sought by Democrats would only extend Medicaid coverage to immigrants with some kind of legal status or government protection.

Before the bill passed earlier this year, U.S. law allowed several classes of immigrants living in the U.S. legally or with the government's permission to apply for and get Medicaid, if they met other requirements.

Those groups included lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders), Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally, people granted a humanitarian benefit known as ""parole"" to enter the country, refugees, immigrants who won asylum and others, including those who were issued deportation reprieves by a judge.

Some people in those groups may have crossed into the U.S. illegally but were later granted legal status, like asylum, or deportation deferrals by immigration judges.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act — passed by lawmakers and signed by President Trump over the summer — significantly restricted noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid coverage, making it only accessible to lawful permanent residents, Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally and noncitizens from several Pacific islands.

The bill excluded those granted parole to enter the U.S., refugees, asylees and the other previously eligible immigrants. Roughly 1.4 million immigrants could lose health insurance coverage under the bill's provisions, according to a KFF analysis of Congressional Budget Office data.

The Democrats' funding proposal would restore noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid to the longstanding pre-2025 rules, reopening access for the classes of immigrants who were carved out earlier this year. All of those immigrants are in the U.S. either legally or with the government's permission.

U.S. law has long rendered people living in the U.S. illegally — without any type of legal status — ineligible for most federal benefits, including Medicaid.

Trump administration officials, however, have argued that some of the lawfully present immigrants previously eligible for Medicaid were illegally let in by the Biden administration. They argue that in the case of those granted parole, the Biden administration waved them in using a ""magic wand,"" in violation of federal immigration law.

The groups of people granted parole under former President Biden — such as Venezuelans and Ukrainians — entered the country with the government's permission and were authorized to work and live in the U.S. The Trump administration has suspended those Biden-era parole programs, and revoked the legal status of many of those who arrived under them.

The legal status of many of the other immigrants eligible for Medicaid before the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" — like the refugees and asylees — is not disputed. Both refugees and asylees are on a path to permanent legal status and eventually, U.S. citizenship.

While people who are in the U.S. illegally are not covered by federal Medicaid, the program may reimburse hospitals providing emergency care to immigrants who lack legal status. Emergency funding for noncitizens constitutes less than 1% of total spending for the program, according to an analysis by KFF. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act lowered the amount hospitals can receive for these ER visits, which the Democrats' government funding plan would reverse.

Democratic leaders have denied that they're seeking to fund healthcare for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Most Democrats' position is that they will not vote for a short-term funding extension that would allow the government to reopen unless Republicans extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that have helped millions of Americans lower their health insurance costs.

""Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals. And there is nothing in anything that we have proposed that is trying to change that law,"" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. ""We are fighting for the healthcare of the American people.""

Some Republicans have also argued that if Democrats restore the federal Medicaid funding that was cut in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" it would allow Democratic-led states to spend more state funds on health care for immigrants residing in the country unlawfully.

According to analysis by non-partisan health care researchers at KFF, more than a dozen states comprehensively cover care for low-income children who lack a legal immigration status using state funds. Some states, including California, provide some form of coverage to adults living in the country without authorization.

Republicans previously attempted to penalize these states in Mr. Trump's budget bill, but that provision did not make it into the final legislation.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/02/6fa4d2cb-8435-42ba-880b-f7f793b2831b/thumbnail/1200x630/d3c352c0fb30621c26a43b23e4efc2dc/untitled-design.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 23:57:26.030518

Keir Starmer wants to rip up international law to make the lives of asylum seekers harder—and it easier to deport them.

He wants to reform the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to appease the right.

It came after Starmer blamed Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for refugees crossing the Channel in small boats, labelling them “Farage boats” due to the increasing number since Brexit.

Starmer told GB News, “I would gently point out to Farage and others that before we left the EU, we had a returns agreement with every country in the EU and he told the country it would make no difference if we left.

“He was wrong about that. These are ‘Farage boats’ coming across the Channel.”

And speaking after the Labour Party conference, the Labour leader said he was unhappy about how judges are interpreting conventions of human rights in their rulings on deportations.

He wants to stop asylum seekers blocking their deportation on the basis that they could be sent to worse prisons or healthcare systems.

Starmer cited Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR—which ban torture and protect the right to private and family life.

He also pointed to the United Nation’s Refugee Convention, Torture Convention and Convention on the Rights of the Child as potential barriers.

It is just another sign that Labour is following far right Reform UK, tailing its scapegoating of migrants.

Reform UK shifts further to the right, and Labour follows. The far right party pledged last week to scrap indefinite leave to remain, denying hundreds of thousands of migrants the right to settle in Britain with rights.

And Labour home secretary Shabana Mahmood followed suit with plans to make it harder for migrants to apply for indefinite leave to remain.

And the impact of tougher laws on migrants is real. Safe and legal routes are shut down, forcing migrants to take dangerous ones. Just last week two women died while trying to cross the Channel in a makeshift boat that had 100 people crammed into it.

Sonya Sceats, chief executive of the charity Freedom from Torture, said, “Chipping away at Article 3 of the ECHR risks setting in train the destruction of the absolute ban on torture—the most appalling form of abuse—which Britain helped forge and champion over centuries.

“This isn’t who we are as a country.” She continued, “Caring people across Britain are horrified to see political parties scapegoating refugees as a pretext for rolling back rights that keep everyone safe from abuse.”",https://socialistworker.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/54068826099_328d8eefb8_o_760x507.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 06:56:22.998387

WASHINGTON – Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcment (ICE) and U.S. Border Patrol officers have arrested more than 800 illegal aliens—including the ‘worst of the worst’ during Operation Midway Blitz.

On September 8, the Department of Homeland Security started Operation Midway Blitz in honor of Katie Abraham who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run car wreck caused by criminal illegal alien Julio Cucul-Bol in Illinois. The operation targets criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois seeking protection under the sanctuary policies of Governor Pritzker.

Despite recent violence against ICE officers, including a terrorist attack against a Dallas ICE facility and violent rioters protesting outside the Broadview, Illinois ICE facility, DHS and ICE remain undeterred in delivering on President Trump’s promise to secure our homeland from criminal illegal aliens.

“During Operation Midway Blitz, DHS law enforcement has made more than 800 arrests across Illinois. The Trump Administration will not allow violent criminals or repeat offenders to terrorize our neighborhoods or victimize our children and innocent Americans,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “We will not allow sanctuary politicians or violent rioters to stop us from enforcing the law and arresting pedophiles, murderers, gang members, rapists, and domestic abusers from American communities.”

Recent worst of the worst criminal illegal alien arrests include:

Cristobal Carias Masin, a criminal illegal alien from El Salvador, convicted of statutory rape, fraud, and aggravated felony, and with pending charges of assault and failure to register as a sex offender.

Stefan Cseve, a criminal illegal alien from Austria, previously convicted of sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, numerous sexual predator in a public park offenses, child sex offender loitering, in violation of the sex offender registry and currently charged with murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor.

Do 'illegal' immigrants get free health care?
Undocumented immigrants are largely ineligible for federal health benefits, said Leo Cuello, research professor at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.
Democrats want to reverse many of the health care-related provisions included in the new act to keep more Americans, and some lawful immigrants, eligible for Medicaid.
They say the shutdown is over preserving healthcare access, and there is no proposal to provide free health care to people living in the country illegally.","Republicans are claiming Democrats shut down the government ""to demand free health care for illegals.""

But is it true?

The United States government ground to a halt at 12:01 a.m. Oct. 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to fund the federal budget.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told CNBC on the morning of the Oct. 1 shutdown that Democrats ""want to restore taxpayer funded benefits, American taxpayer funded benefits to illegal aliens.""

""We're not doing that,"" he added.

But that's not what Democrats are demanding at all.

Democrats say they're fighting to restore Medicaid benefits that were cut in President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful"" tax and budget bill, which he signed into law in July.

The morning of after the shutdown began, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told MSNBC that Republicans are not in any way asking for health care for people in the country without legal status.

""It's a total, absolute [expletive] lie,"" he said.

Do 'illegal' immigrants get free health care?

Undocumented immigrants are largely ineligible for federal health benefits, said Leo Cuello, research professor at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.

They don't qualify for comprehensive Medicaid coverage, Medicare or the Children's Health Insurance Program. And they can't purchase federally subsidized health plans on exchanges backed by the Affordable Care Act.

There are immigrants on Medicaid in the United States. So-called ""noncitizen enrollees"" in Medicaid accounted for 6% of the total, according to KFF, a nonprofit that conducts research and polling on health policy.

Not being a citizen isn't the same as residing in the United States illegally; there are many ways to live here as a legal resident, without full U.S. citizenship. This is where the political argument gets messy.

Medicaid is a joint federal-state program. The new GOP tax and spending law tightens up access to Medicaid benefits in several ways including by prohibiting an individual from being enrolled in multiple state plans; ensuring deceased individuals don't remain enrolled; and by instituting quarterly eligibility screening.

It also rolls back a Medicaid expansion that could leave 10 million Americans uninsured, Cuello said. An additional 4 million people may no longer be able to afford insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges when tax credits expire at the end of the year.

But the law also quietly excluded from Medicaid eligibility certain classes of lawful immigrants who previously might have qualified for benefits.

Who is considered a legal immigrant?

The Trump administration and many Republicans have taken the view this year that certain immigrants once considered ""legal"" should no longer be.

For example, the Department of Homeland Security this year canceled humanitarian parole under the Biden-era Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans program, or CHNV. DHS also revoked the Temporary Protected Status of some Venezuelans, Haitians and others, though the revocations are tied up in federal court.

In March, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service's list of so-called ""qualified aliens"" who were eligible for Medicaid coverage included only lawful immigrants: legal permanent residents, refugees, people granted asylum, people granted humanitarian parole including Ukrainians and Afghans, certain Cubans and Haitians and certain victims of human trafficking and domestic violence, among others.

Even among the ""qualified aliens,"" several groups were required to wait five to seven years after their arrival in the United States before they could become eligible, according to an April 2025 report by Congressional Research Service.

The new law restricts eligibility only to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, i.e. green card holders and certain Cuban and Haitian immigrants.

""Refugees, victims of trafficking, victims of domestic violence, people here for humanitarian reasons and people granted political asylum are all groups who today are in Medicaid and tomorrow will not be,"" Cuello said.

The law also restricts payments to states for medical assistance – including emergency care – furnished to anyone who isn't a citizen or lawful permanent resident. In 1986, Congress passed a law requiring that anyone in need of emergency care receive it, regardless of who they are or their ability to pay.

""Currently the federal government pays a share of those costs,"" Cuello said. ""This law says the federal government will reduce how much money it is paying.""

Democrats want to reverse many of the health care-related provisions included in the new act to keep more Americans, and some lawful immigrants, eligible for Medicaid. They say the shutdown is over preserving healthcare access, and there is no proposal to provide free health care to people living in the country illegally.

In the lawsuit, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition argue that this new condition violates the Spending Clause, is arbitrary and capricious, and is contrary to law, and as such, should be declared unlawful and set aside.

Many of the organizations that receive these funds provide critical wraparound services to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, human trafficking, and elder abuse — services that could be described as “legal” under U.S. DOJ’s vague definition — irrespective of an individual’s immigration status. This new condition, which also requires state agencies to certify to their subgrantees compliance, puts at risk at least $94 million in current funding to California and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in future funding. In the lawsuit, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition argue that this new condition violates the Spending Clause, is arbitrary and capricious, and is contrary to law, and as such, should be declared unlawful and set aside.

“The Trump Administration continues to push forward policies that make our communities less safe,” said Attorney General Bonta. “U.S. DOJ’s vague new condition would force organizations to upend their services knowing they still could very well fail to meet U.S. DOJ’s impossible demands and end up in the Trump Administration’s crosshairs. I wish President Trump would stop creating problems where there are none — and focus his energy on policies that actually reduce crime and protect public safety. I’m grateful to the dozens of organizations and program across California that use this funding to provide legal services and support to victims of crime, and in doing so, also help bring the perpetrators of those crimes to justice.”

In July 2025, the Office for Victims of Crime, an agency housed within U.S. DOJ and charged with administering Victims of Crimes Act (VOCA) grants, declared that states would be unable to access VOCA funds unless they agree to broadly support and assist the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s federal immigration enforcement activities. These grants are unrelated to federal civil immigration enforcement and are used by states to protect public safety and provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime, including victims of domestic violence. The next month, Attorney General Bonta joined a multistate coalition in challenging the Trump Administration’s attempt to unlawfully impose these immigration enforcement requirements.

After the multistate coalition filed that lawsuit, U.S. DOJ announced that it was imposing an “Unallowable Costs” restriction across multiple grants, including VOCA and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) funding, stating that award funds could not be used to support or provide legal services to any “removable alien or any alien otherwise unlawfully present in the United States,” with some limited exceptions.

In 2024, California subgrantees used victim assistance funds to serve nearly 1 million Californians, including supporting more than 100,000 victims and families on various civil legal matters. Among other things, this funding supports crisis intervention, counseling and advocacy, emergency shelter, and transitional housing assistance. It also supports law enforcement initiatives such as training officers on trauma-informed and victim-centered responses; developing specialized domestic violence or sexual assault units; and improving evidence collection in sexual assault and domestic violence cases.

The “legal” support provided by VOCA and VAWA funding includes helping individuals file police reports and protective orders; applying for victim compensation and assisting with divorce or other parental visitation issues; asserting employment rights, providing debt relief, and addressing identity theft; accompanying victims to emergency medical care, forensic exams, and law enforcement interviews; and providing advice on obtaining housing, counseling, and emergency financial assistance.

In the lawsuit filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition assert that the “Unallowable Costs” condition:

Violates the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution: The condition applies to existing grants, meaning the states had no opportunity to consider the condition before accepting their award. Moreover, the condition ambiguously restricts “legal services” without specifying the types of services that are subject to its restriction, leaving the state and their subgrantees to guess at which services are covered and will require them to implement onerous processes for verifying the immigration statuses of all clients before services can be offered.

Is “Arbitrary and Capricious” in Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act: The Trump Administration has offered no explanation for the new condition — let alone a reasonable and well-reasoned one.

Is “Contrary to Law” in Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act: The condition is in direct conflict with governing regulations providing that eligibility for services “is not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”

After being nearly shut down with no new transfers due to a lawsuit, the facility was reopened following an appeals court ruling that stayed the original decision as the legal case continues in the courts.

“Alligator Alcatraz” is just the latest experiment within a much larger system. This system is as cruel as it is unnecessary, one that prolongs and profits off the suffering of immigrants and people seeking safety. And the experiment of states partnering with ICE, like in the case of “Alligator Alcatraz,” is a new dangerous direction.

Backing up: No one should be locked up in immigration detention centers in the first place. Migration is not a crime. Under U.S. law, being undocumented is a civil issue, not a criminal act. Mass immigration detention for the simple purpose of immigration processing is arbitrary and violates international law. Yet every day, people are being torn from their families and communities, locked behind bars, and denied their rights. These individuals are not strangers. They are our neighbors. Our coworkers. Our loved ones. They are parents, children, aunts and uncles. They are essential and wonderful parts of our communities. Instead of being able to live with freedom, dignity, and safety, it is despicable that our government is tearing immigrants from their families and communities and putting them in cages.

A cruel system, supercharged

Immigration detention has long been a stain on the U.S. human rights record. But under the Trump administration, this cruelty has been taken to new extremes.

In August alone, an unprecedented 60,000 people were held in immigration detention on any given day. These are people who have lived in the U.S. for decades, may have arrived in recent years to exercise their right to seek safety, and everywhere in between. They are our friends, our neighbors, and people who believed in the promise of safety, security, and a new life.

The Trump administration is doubling down on terrorizing immigrants in their communities and forcing them to live in fear. This increase in people locked up in immigrant detention centers is part of a broader, calculated campaign to expand mass detention and dehumanize immigrant communities.

“Alligator Alcatraz” is just the tip of the iceberg

“Alligator Alcatraz” is part of this dangerous new anti-immigrant campaign: Florida diverted state disaster preparedness funds to build and operate this federal immigration prison, with hopes to be reimbursed by the federal government later. That’s right—money meant to help communities prepare for and respond to hurricanes is used to lock people up. Using disaster relief money for incarceration isn’t just wrong, it’s reckless and puts entire communities at risk.

This facility is one piece of a much larger anti-immigrant agenda: ICE raids, deputizing local law enforcement agencies as immigration officials, racial profiling, attacks on asylum seekers, deportations to third countries, and the public targeting of immigrant organizers and protestors.

None of it is about making anyone safer. It’s about making people afraid. It’s about control.

This is cruelty by design.

A dangerous precedent: states as ICE’s partners

“Alligator Alcatraz” is an example of the administration’s tactic of enlisting state governments, and state taxpayer dollars, to do ICE’s work. Other states, including Indiana and Nebraska, are looking to replicate this deeply flawed and cruel approach.

States partnering with ICE to operate immigration prisons is a deeply troubling precedent. It blurs the lines of accountability and gives ICE even more unchecked power. People inside these state facilities often have no access to family, lawyers, or even an immigration court to fight for their freedom. They are detained for the sake of cruelty. That’s it.

Let’s be clear: no state should be in the business of detaining immigrants. Period.

State leaders must reject this role. State and local governments should not be ICE’s enforcers. Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, and one that is already riddled with abuse. Handing it off to states and local governments opens the door to even less oversight, less accountability, and even more systemic harm.

This is cruelty, not a punchline

The Trump administration’s cruelty is not limited to policies, it’s in the rhetoric, too.

Giving detention centers names like “Alligator Alcatraz,” “Speedway Slammer,” “Cornhuskers Clink,” or “Deportation Depot” is cruel and dehumanizing.

Making jokes out of human suffering and human rights violations normalizes abuse and denies people’s humanity. These names, and the memes we’ve seen, don’t reflect the seriousness of what’s happening. A human rights crisis must never be made light of or turned into a punchline.

Rampant abuse, well-documented

Human rights abuses in immigration detention centers are well-known and well-documented, including by Amnesty International. Earlier this year at an ICE facility in El Paso, we found violations ranging from physical abuse by guards and the denial of medical care to obstruction of legal access.

Immigrant detention facilities, like “Alligator Alcatraz,” are plagued by numerous issues, sometimes including:

Inhumane conditions: filthy and unsanitary environments, nonworking toilets, limited access to showers, maggots in food, and severe overcrowding.

Lack of medical care: people are routinely denied necessary medical treatment, or their ailments are ignored.

Barriers to legal help: many are cut off from lawyers, limiting their ability to challenge their confinement or make progress in their immigration cases. Lawyers representing people detained at “Alligator Alcatraz” are arguing that both state and federal officials are not allowing adequate legal access, blocking them from being able to effectively represent their clients.

Other abuse: from verbal and physical abuse by guards, sexual and medical abuse, to overuse of solitary confinement, abuse in immigration detention has been normalized and unchecked.

Psychological harm: the trauma of being isolated, dehumanized, and neglected leaves deep and lasting wounds.

Furthermore, the lack of accountability is unacceptable. The Miami Herald opens in a new tab has reported that the “whereabouts of two-thirds of more than 1,800 men detained at Alligator Alcatraz during the month of July could not be determined.”

Racist, arbitrary, and illegal

Mass immigration detention in the U.S. is unjustifiable. It is rooted in racism, built on false narratives, and maintained through fear.

Detaining people solely based on immigration status is arbitrary and violates international human rights law. The system disproportionately targets Black and brown immigrants and perpetuates white supremacist ideologies masked as policy.

No matter what you hear from the Trump administration, this is not about public safety.

We need a different path

We are at a crossroads. The U.S. government can either continue down a path of cruelty, fear, and systemic abuse, or choose a future rooted in dignity, compassion, and justice.

We all want to live in safe, strong communities. But detention and deportation tear families apart, traumatize communities, and waste billions in taxpayer money.

We must invest in systems that support people, not harm them – affordable housing, education, healthcare, and public infrastructure.

Mass detention is not the answer. It never was.

U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy in Rhode Island, a Trump appointee, issued the temporary restraining order.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state faced a one-third cut — from about $165 million to $110 million.

“Arbitrary cuts put lives at risk, no other way to say it,” Bonta said during a Monday virtual press conference. “They undermine law enforcement, our emergency responders and public safety planning. And California won’t stand by while critical resources are redirected for political reasons.”

The lawsuit, joined by the District of Columbia and 11 states including Washington, Massachusetts and New York, argues the cuts violate federal law by basing funding on immigration politics — particularly sanctuary policies — rather than the risk-based criteria Congress established.

All of them have been designated a “sanctuary jurisdiction” by the U.S. Department of Justice in the past, but Delaware, which is part of the lawsuit, was removed from that list earlier this year. States with sanctuary policies limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities.

Bonta said California relies on the federal funds to prepare for terrorism, natural disasters and other emergencies.

“These cuts violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution by unfairly treating states like California differently based on policies Congress never intended to be a factor,” he added.

Rose Cuison Villazor, a law professor at Rutgers Law School and director of the Center for Immigrant Justice, agrees with Bonta. She said the act requires any rule changes — including around funding — to go through a process that gives either the public or states an opportunity to offer feedback.

“Under the [Administrative Procedure Act], it would be considered arbitrary and capricious because the process for making those changes was not followed,” she said. “[States] found out about the change or the reduction in the support on a Saturday morning, and with no real explanation as to what was happening.”

Villazor noted that courts have repeatedly rejected the Trump administration’s attempts to use the “power of the purse” to punish sanctuary states. She added that withholding funds this way would also violate the Constitution’s spending clause.

“Under the spending clause, they cannot use the support that’s given by the federal government to states as a way to essentially conscript them,” she stressed. “If the conditions are coercive with the goal essentially to force states to comply with these enforcement mechanisms by the federal government, then under the law those would be considered in violation of the spending clause.”

Shiu-Ming Cheer, deputy director of immigrant and racial justice for the California Immigrant Policy Center, said the cuts were clearly political.

“It clearly shows that the Trump administration is more concerned about trying to enact its mass deportation agenda than actually assisting states like California from recovering from disasters and major catastrophes, which should be something that’s actually in our national interest,” she said.

Cheer called the move part of a broader pattern of federal overreach, saying, “We’ve seen other threats — like deploying federal troops or the National Guard to different locations.” To her, this is just “another bullying tactic to pressure states to comply.”

She added that withholding funds contradicts the administration’s own rhetoric that these states are crime-ridden, implying a need for more funds.

“The federal government claims that it’s trying to support states in a particular way, but actually taking steps that make it more challenging for states to address the issues of their constituents and communities,” she continued.

Cheer said her organization and others are working to compile a list of successful court cases that have found sanctuary states and cities are well within their power to pass those policies. They’re also engaging with residents to explain that while these laws do restrict the use of state and local resources to enforce immigration law, they do not bar federal agents from operating in California.",https://www.capradio.org/media/12279315/100125bontalawsuit-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 19:56:36.576968

Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans have forced a government shutdown because they refuse to protect Americans’ health care. Democrats’ message is clear: we want to keep government open, lower costs for working families and end Republicans’ sabotage of affordable care. Funding for the federal government expired at midnight on October 1, 2025. To better help you plan for any impacts of a federal government shutdown, my office has prepared answers to these frequently asked questions. As always, you can contact me here: LINK.

Please note: This information is based on what is currently available from federal agencies and will be updated to reflect changes.

Will I continue to receive my Social Security and SSI checks?

Recipients will continue to receive their Social Security and SSI checks. The Social Security Administration (SSA) will continue providing limited services like issuing Social Security cards and holding appointments for benefit applications. However, SSA will stop some activities like benefit verifications and processing overpayments and the public will likely experience increased wait times for customer service.

Will Medicare and Medicaid benefits be affected?

Medicare, Medicaid and disability insurance will be largely unaffected by a shutdown lasting less than three months. Current beneficiaries will continue to receive their benefits.

Will I still be able to enroll in health care or will that be impacted by a government shutdown?

The federal insurance marketplace open enrollment will continue. Open Enrollment will proceed as normal from November 1 through January 15. Enrollment stays open, though you might experience slower service.

What is the impact on VA and services for Veterans?

VA health care will not be affected by a government shutdown and VA’s medical facilities, clinics and vet centers will remain fully operational. VA will continue to process and deliver Veterans’ benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing benefits. Suicide prevention-- including the Veterans Crisis Line, homelessness and caregiver programs will continue. Burials will still occur at VA national cemeteries and applications for headstones, markers and burial benefits will be processed. Lastly, the Board of Veterans Appeals also will continue to work on decisions for Veterans' cases.

VA benefit regional offices - including in Oakland - will be closed and unable to fulfill in-person appointments. VA will not be able to permanently place headstones at VA national cemeteries or maintain the cemetery grounds during a shutdown and will halt processing applications for pre-need burials.

While several call centers will remain operational— including 800-MyVA411, there will be limited hours for the VA Benefit Hotline (800-827-1000) from 8am to 9pm (eastern standard time) and the National Cemetery Applicant Assistance and GI Bill Hotlines would be closed during a government shutdown.

Will military and federal retiree benefits be suspended?

Military and federal retirees will continue to receive their retirement benefits. Processing new applications or other requested changes will be delayed.

Which federal employees keep working during a government shutdown?

When the government shuts down, federal agencies are required to classify their employees whose salaries have lapsed as either ""excepted"" or ""not excepted."" The employees classified as ""excepted"" work without pay during the shutdown. The employees classified as ""not excepted"" are put on unpaid furlough. Under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, all federal employees are retroactively paid for the duration of the shutdown upon its conclusion. Donald Trump has threatened to needlessly fire thousands of federal workers during a shutdown, as he has been trying to do all year.

What is the impact on U.S. military personnel and federal law enforcement?

All active-duty and Guard and Reservists on active-duty orders are excepted and therefore are required to work. On-base non-acute health care may cease, but off-base care provided through Tricare is not affected. On-base child care is open on a case-by-case basis. Federal law enforcement was also required to work. Both military personnel and federal law enforcement will not be paid until after the shutdown is over.

Will my mail still arrive?

Yes. The U.S. Postal Service is not affected by a shutdown.

I have a hearing or matters with a federal court. Are they open in a shutdown?

Federal courts will continue to operate during a shutdown. Courts will continue to hear cases and discharge their constitutional duty even once their funding, including court fees and reserve funds, have lapsed.

Will commercial air travel be affected?

Air traffic controllers, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents will remain on the job. However, like all federal employees, they will not be paid until the shutdown is over.

What is the impact on small businesses?

The Small Business Administration (SBA) will stop processing new business loans, such as through the 7(a) and 504 programs. However, SBA’s Disaster Loan Program will continue regular operations.

What is the impact on federal housing loans?

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will stop insuring some new mortgages and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will stop processing some new loans. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) will also stop new loan and loan guarantee activity. The VA will continue to guarantee home loans.

What is the impact on disaster relief efforts?

FEMA staff will still respond to emergencies. In prior shutdowns, long-term projects were delayed due to a lack of funding in the Disaster Relief Fund.

What is the impact on food safety activities?

Some Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food safety activities — such as routine inspections of facilities — will be delayed.

Will I continue to receive my unemployment insurance and compensation in a shutdown?

You can still file claims for unemployment insurance (UI) during a federal shutdown, including furloughed federal employees. Current recipients should continue to receive their compensation, but must continue to certify their weekly claims online or by phone.

Will I still receive my food assistance, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (“WIC”)?

Yes, SNAP beneficiaries should still receive their October benefits even if a government shutdown occurs. However, benefits in November could be delayed or interrupted if the government shutdown lasts for several weeks, depending if and how the Administration uses remaining and available funding at USDA. WIC has very limited resources and assistance will be available for a short time, but it is not certain in an extended government shutdown that benefits will continue.

What happens to my federal student loans and student loan assistance tools?

Free Applications for Student Aid (FAFSA), Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans continue to be dispersed in a government shutdown, but for a limited time. In the case of a prolonged shutdown, beyond October, K-12 school districts, colleges, and universities may begin to experience funding shortages due to the shutdown.

Will immigration applications still be processed?

Visa and passport operations are not impacted by a government shutdown. Immigration court cases on the detained docket still proceed during a government shutdown, while non-detained docket cases will be rescheduled to a later date once the government reopens. Further, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are largely still operational during a shutdown, though processing times and inquiry response times may be impacted by reductions in staff. Department of State and USCIS can process congressional casework inquiries from my office, but CBP will not be able to process or respond to the inquiries until the government reopens. If you need further assistance, please contact me here:LINK.

I am visiting DC in October. Are tours still available?

Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo, are temporarily open during the government shutdown. It is expected that the 17 museums in the Washington, DC area will operate through Monday, October 6.

Tours of the U.S. Capitol, FBI headquarters, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, and the U.S. Botanic Garden are closed to the general public during a government shutdown.

Immigrant rights groups hosted a news conference in downtown Fresno Wednesday morning, sounding the alarm on how immigrants are being arrested outside courtrooms in both Fresno and Madera. They reminded the public of available resources and called on community members to get involved and volunteer with the Valley Watch Network run by Faith in the Valley.

Local immigrant rights advocates are sounding the alarm on immigration authorities arresting undocumented people outside courtrooms in Fresno and Madera.

Just last week, an undocumented person was arrested by immigration authorities after reporting to a court hearing in Fresno, said Sarait Martinez, the executive director of Centro Binacional para el Desarrollo Indígena Oxaqueño.

The same happened last week outside a courtroom in Madera, Martinez added.

“At this point, we’re dealing with a government that is not following the law,” Martinez said during a Wednesday news conference in downtown Fresno. “We want people to know what to do in case they encounter ICE, and how do they prepare their families in case they don’t come back.”

A coalition of immigrant rights groups called a news conference Wednesday morning in front of the Robert E. Coyle federal courthouse in downtown Fresno to explain to the public the crisis facing immigrants today. They also gathered to remind the community of resources available for immigrants and called on local community members to support the work of immigrant rights groups.

Lourdes Medina, an organizer with Services, Immigrant Rights and Education Network (SIREN), emphasized that any member of the community can contact the volunteer-run Valley Watch Network to report the presence of immigration authorities.

The Valley Watch Network hotline can be contacted at (559) 206 – 0151.

“Our human rights, our constitutional rights and our community rights are being violated by anti-immigrant sentiments, fear-mongering and abuse of power at the hands of the federal government through the Department of Homeland Security and ICE,” Medina said at the Wednesday news conference.

An ICE spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

Back in July, a federal judge found that the Department of Homeland Security violated the constitutional rights of the people arrested in Southern California. One big issue was that federal immigration authorities were illegally racially profiling the people they arrested.

However, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that decision in early September, temporarily allowing immigration authorities to resume their methods of identifying immigrants for deportation. Legal experts have warned that the Supreme Court ruling “effectively legalized racial profiling and by extension racial discrimination.”

President Donald Trump ran on a campaign promise to go after “the worst of the worst” — referencing “dangerous criminals” who illegally snuck into the country. However, government data shows immigration authorities have mostly apprehended undocumented immigrants who haven’t committed any crimes. Being in the U.S. illegally is a civil offense, not a criminal one.

Additionally, just this week, the same Customs and Border Protection force that created chaos for immigrants in California went up to Chicago to continue Trump’s deportation campaign. U.S. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino told Chicago media that the arrests of immigrants are partly based on how they look compared to white people.

In June, Fresnoland published firsthand video of masked immigration authorities in plainclothes arresting two men outside a mandated ICE check-in appointment in downtown Fresno. Additionally, a restaurant manager who works at Pismo’s Coastal Grill in Fresno was arrested by immigration authorities this summer, and is currently stuck in a Bakersfield detention facility.

How community members can support immigrant rights groups

Community members in Fresno and Madera can contact the Valley Watch Network to support immigrants and get involved with immigrant rights groups. There are at least three ways volunteers can help:

Legal Observer: Provide firsthand verification of reported ICE activity in the community

Accompaniment: Support undocumented people who need to report to an ICE check-in or court appearance by accompanying them to their appointment

Mutual Aid: Assist in connecting families and people facing deportation to different resources

Brenda Ordaz Garcia, the community education and outreach coordinator at the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), said at the news conference that it’s vital for families to create an emergency plan in the event they encounter immigration authorities.

That includes gathering passports, IDs, birth certificates, social security cards, immigration documents, marriage certificates, school documents, medication lists and doctors’ information, Garcia said. It’s also important to memorize emergency contacts, she added.

She also reminded community members to contact the Valley Watch Network’s hotline if they have any questions or need any help.

Garcia emphasized that anyone detained, including undocumented people, have rights under the U.S. Constitution. Everyone has the right to remain silent, speak to an attorney and refuse unlawful, unwarranted search and seizure by immigration authorities.

“Make sure that you uphold these rights,” Garcia said at the news conference. “Vocalize these rights to ICE agents and let them know that you are exercising your right to remain silent.”",https://fresnoland.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7949-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 18:57:22.170214

On Tuesday evening, as it became clear the government was barreling toward a shutdown, Mr. Trump posted another video of Mr. Jeffries with a fake mustache and sombrero.
Mr. Trump eventually backed down from his border wall demands, and the government reopened in January 2019.","In a series of social media posts, Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said the administration had paused or moved to cancel the delivery of about $26 billion in previously approved funds across a range of programs, describing the money as wasteful or in need of further review.

The timing seemed to be no mere coincidence, nor were Mr. Vought’s choices of location. The administration said it was terminating one tranche of funds, totaling about $8 billion, because it was “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda,” a move that affected projects in 16 states, most of which are led by Democrats.

In a second instance, the Trump administration paused about $18 billion in approved infrastructure funding for two major transportation projects primarily in New York City, whose state delegation includes Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader. The two men have been frequent targets of Mr. Trump’s personal attacks, and the Transportation Department said the money would be held pending further review.

Mr. Vought’s budget maneuvers marked an attempt to formalize Mr. Trump’s threat from a day earlier, when he described a shutdown as a “good” opportunity to cut federal agencies, programs and benefits he disfavors in ways that would harm Democrats. He said at the time that it could include another round of mass layoffs targeting “a lot” of government workers.

By Wednesday, those cuts appeared imminent. Speaking privately with House Republicans, Mr. Vought said the firings, known as a reduction in force, could go into effect in the next day or two, according to a member on the call.

Vice President JD Vance later echoed the need for layoffs in a briefing at the White House, saying the firings would preserve “essential services,” even though such cuts have not been required in past instances when the government had to halt its operations.

Taken together, the administration’s actions laid bare the risks and consequences of a protracted fiscal stalemate under Mr. Trump. With an expansive view of executive power, the president has spared no opportunity in his second term to shutter agencies, slim down the federal work force and reconfigure the budget, with aggressive tactics that have tested the courts and, at times, defied Congress.

The shutdown began at midnight, the start of the new fiscal year, after Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a short-term spending truce. G.O.P. leaders sought to extend existing funding levels into November, but Democrats in the Senate rejected that approach, partly because it did not preserve a set of expiring subsidies that help millions of Americans pay for their health insurance.

As a result, many federal employees are now furloughed, while others, including military service members and airport baggage screeners, are forced to report for work without pay. While those employees will eventually get back pay, there is no clear indication of when that might happen. Scores of critical government services are also halted or reduced significantly.

The longer the standoff continues, the greater the chances of financial harm to American families, businesses and the broader economy. Both parties’ leaders acknowledged that reality on Wednesday, even if they remained far from a resolution. Instead, they traded recriminations, while Mr. Trump’s top aides unfurled the ways they might leverage the standoff to their own ends.

On Wednesday, Mr. Vought offered no further details about the roughly $8 billion in newly canceled green energy funds. The White House budget office declined to comment, and the Energy Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Transportation Department, which halted the delivery of about $18 billion in infrastructure money that benefited New York, said it would review those grants for compliance with Mr. Trump’s directives on diversity, equity and inclusion.

In doing so, though, it appeared to dispel any illusion about the political implications of its decision. The agency said it had to furlough staff reviewing infrastructure projects “thanks to” Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries, as it blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

“Without a budget, the department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review,” it said in a statement.

In response, Democratic leaders on Wednesday forcefully denounced the White House and its handling of the lapse in federal funding, including its decision to interfere with approved money for cities and states.

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who leads her party on the Appropriations Committee, said the actions showed how Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought were “gleefully using the shutdown they have caused as a pretext to inflict even more pain.”

“The American people deserve so much better than a president and an administration that treat their families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” Ms. Murray said in a statement.

The White House remained unbowed, pressing forward with its strategy to weaponize the closure.

Soon after government funding lapsed, the Trump administration suspended all news broadcasts from Voice of America and furloughed all of its journalists, a break with past practice in funding lapses. The closure came two days after a judge reinstated about 500 of the broadcaster’s employees.

The White House also laid the groundwork to fulfill the president’s threats to oust more government employees. On a call with Republican lawmakers, Mr. Vought said the shutdown offered an opportunity to remove officials who are working on programs that are not aligned with the president’s political agenda, according to the member who attended the phone meeting.

In a sign that the process was well underway, Trump officials on Wednesday instructed employees at the Interior Department to take home their government devices to receive any information on mass firings, according to internal emails reviewed by The New York Times.

It is unclear how many employees could be laid off at the department, which includes the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management. But Mr. Trump’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year calls for a 30 percent cut to the budget for the agency, which has already lost thousands of employees since January.

Overall, the government is already expected to employ 300,000 fewer workers by December than it did in January. The substantial decline reflects a series of firings, layoffs and induced resignations that date back to the start of the president’s term, and the work of the cost-cutting campaign orchestrated by the Department of Government Efficiency.

Fearing widespread reductions in force, a group of unions representing federal workers preemptively sued the Trump administration this week, claiming that it did not have the legal authority to conduct mass layoffs under cover of a shutdown. The case is pending in a federal court in California.

Publicly, though, Mr. Trump’s deputies still insisted that they had not politicized the funding lapse. Speaking at a press briefing on Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, maintained instead that the layoffs, in particular, were necessary because of the realities of the budget.

“There are unfortunate consequences to a government shutdown,” she said.

Annie Karni , Minho Kim and Maxine Joselow contributed reporting.

Speaking at a White House press briefing, Mr. Vance characterized the post as making light of lawmakers’ policy differences. The video, which was posted on Monday and falsely accuses Democrats of trying to give free health care to undocumented immigrants, depicts Mr. Jeffries, who is Black, as Mexican, with mariachi music playing in the background.

“Oh, I think it’s funny,” Mr. Vance said. “The president’s joking, and we’re having a good time.”

“You can negotiate in good faith while also poking a little bit of fun at some of the absurdities of the Democrats’ positions, and even poking some fun at the absurdity of the Democrats themselves,” Mr. Vance added.

He asserted that Americans understood that Mr. Jeffries did not actually come to the White House wearing a sombrero and a “black curly animation mustache.”

“We’re all trying to do a very important job for the American people,” Mr. Vance said. “The president of the United States likes to have a little bit of fun when he’s doing it. And I think that’s OK.”

The day after Mr. Trump posted the video, Mr. Jeffries condemned it as racist and challenged Mr. Trump to insult him in person the next time the leaders met face to face.

“Mr. President, the next time you have something to say about me, don’t cop out through a racist and fake A.I. video,” Mr. Jeffries said on Tuesday during remarks at the Capitol. “When I’m back in the Oval Office, say it to my face.”

The White House tweeted the clip of his remarks, with the comment “Oh no! Hakeem is BIG MAD!” and laughing emojis.

Mr. Trump, who has often hurled racist attacks against his political opponents, has taunted Mr. Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, as they negotiated to avert a government shutdown. He posted several photos of them in his office with a red “Trump 2028” hat on his desk.

On Tuesday evening, as it became clear the government was barreling toward a shutdown, Mr. Trump posted another video of Mr. Jeffries with a fake mustache and sombrero.

That video featured a television interview of Mr. Jeffries during which he condemned the original meme as “disgusting.” As Mr. Jeffries went on to assert that “bigotry will get you nowhere,” an A.I.-generated mariachi band, all of whose members had Mr. Trump’s face, appeared and played music over his words.

Mr. Vance joked that there was one way to make the memes stop.

“I mean, I’ll tell Hakeem Jeffries right now, I make this solemn promise to you that if you help us reopen the government, the sombrero memes will stop,” Mr. Vance said. “And I’ve talked to the president of the United States about that.”

“Voice of America broadcasts have been suspended due to a funding cut from the United States government, which has led to a government shutdown,” reads a recent notice posted on the website for the news network’s Persian-language service. Similar notices appeared on the network’s websites for other language services, including Mandarin, Dari and Pashto.

But a shutdown preparation document published last year by the news group’s oversight agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, listed about 650 Voice of America employees and journalists as essential to “perform activities expressly authorized by law.”

A similar document published last month, however, does not designate Voice of America as essential, although it mentions the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, another federal agency that provides news coverage to Cubans in Spanish, as “foreign relations activities essential to the national security.”

Kari Lake, a fierce Trump ally and the acting chief executive at the oversight agency, said her agency was “following all applicable law and related guidance” from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.

But she did not say what had prompted her agency to make such drastic changes to the number of employees deemed essential to national security, or why broadcasting to Cuba was treated differently than to other U.S. adversaries.

President Trump has threatened to leverage the shutdown to fire or lay off more federal workers and slash programs that he disfavors. On Tuesday, he threatened to fire “a lot” of federal workers during the shutdown, despite legal challenges from workers’ unions to the president’s authority to do so.

The decision to pause broadcasting and furlough all journalists arrived two days after a Reagan-appointed federal judge mandated that the government rescind layoff notices sent to more than 500 Voice of America employees. On Wednesday, the agency furloughed those and about 80 more people.

On Monday, that judge, Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, threatened to hold Trump officials in contempt for failing to restore the volume of news programming at Voice of America to roughly what it had been before March, as he had ordered.

Voice of America had been airing news broadcasts to 360 million people in 49 languages every week until mid-March, when Mr. Trump effectively ordered the agency’s dismantling. Since then, it provided about an hourlong news service every day in each of four languages: Persian, spoken in Iran and neighboring countries; Mandarin; and the two main languages spoken in Afghanistan, Dari and Pashto.

Judge Lamberth had for weeks tried to obtain adequate information that would demonstrate the Trump administration’s compliance with his ruling from April, when he ordered a restoration of Voice of America’s news coverage so that it could “serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news.”

“The defendants’ obfuscation of this court’s requests for information,” he wrote on Monday, “has wasted precious judicial time and resources and readily support contempt proceedings.”

The three plaintiffs representing Voice of America employees in a lawsuit against the Trump administration, Kate Neeper, Jessica Jerreat and Patsy Widakuswara, said in a joint statement that the shuttering of the news group was “heartbreaking.”

“We’ve always served our audiences and continued performing our vital national security role while explaining U.S. policy during past shutdowns,” they said. “What V.O.A. once was is now further diminished.”

And in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, one of the judiciary’s most prominent trial courts, Chief Judge James E. Boasberg issued on Wednesday a new standing order extending deadlines through the duration of the shutdown for the government to meet filing and discovery deadlines. The purpose of the order, he wrote, was to “minimize expenditures of scarce judicial resources” on individual requests for extensions.

The extension order in the District of Columbia has some significant loopholes. It applies to civil, not criminal matters. And regular deadlines will still be enforced for litigation around temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, which means most of the high-stakes lawsuits seeking to block President Trump’s second-term agenda will not be affected.

The court slowdown does not pose an immediate emergency, said David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University. But he said that if the shutdown drags, some litigants, including organizations dependent on federal funding, may feel pressure to settle so as to resolve their cases by certain deadlines.

“The federal courts are heavily overloaded as it is, so the judges are not going to have any difficulty finding other things to do with their time,” Mr. Super said. “But at some point, having issues tied up in litigation indefinitely is going to slow everything down.”

On the same day as Judge Boasberg’s order, the Justice Department asked to pause a major antitrust case against Google in Washington. In the Central District of California, it asked to pause a lawsuit that seeks to force the state government to turn over its voter registration rolls. The government has filed similar motions in Minnesota in a case contesting state education funding for undocumented immigrants, and in Rhode Island, in a case brought by nonprofits over funding for victims of domestic violence.

In another case in the District of South Carolina, contesting the administration’s termination of environmental grants, Judge Richard Mark Gergel found that the government had shown “good cause,” and granted a stay through the shutdown.

A memo dated Oct. 1, sent by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, said that all court employees would receive their paychecks on Oct. 10 and Oct. 24 as planned, but that there would be cutbacks if the shutdown continued through Oct. 17. “We are hopeful that this lapse in appropriations is quickly resolved,” wrote the office’s director, Judge Robert J. Conrad Jr.

A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court said that the court would rely on permanent funds not subject to annual approval by Congress and would be unaffected during a short-term shutdown.

A spokeswoman for Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said that the agency was operating under its shutdown plan. That plan, however, calls for only 1,734 employees — about 11 percent of the staff — to continue working.

Federal agencies do have balances of appropriated funds that carry over from the previous funding period. Those funds could be used to stay operational for a short time — typically a week or two — after a government shutdown. But Trump administration officials have not acknowledged whether the E.P.A. is being kept open from those funds or from other unspent money from laws passed during the Biden administration.

Several E.P.A. employees said they and their department colleagues did not expect to be paid until after the shutdown ended, but Brigit Hirsch, a spokeswoman for the agency, disputed their contention, saying in an email that “No EPA employee is working without pay.” She pointed to guidelines issued by the White House Office of Personnel Management that said exempted employees working during a shutdown “will generally continue to be governed by the normal pay, leave, and other civil service rules.”

Ms. Hirsch declined to say how many employees have been exempted, or how long the exemptions would last.

“Continue to work on initiatives as directed by your leadership,” Aaron Szabo, who leads E.P.A.’s air office, said in a memo to his staff on Wednesday reviewed by The New York Times. He advised that employees would be “notified if there is any change in status.”

The lack of transparency, union leaders said, has fed the chaos surrounding the Trump administration’s plans for federal workers amid the impasse between Republicans and Democrats over spending.

“Workers at the E.P.A. are highly confused by the behavior of this administration, where they have published shutdown plans that call for furloughs and layoffs but then send out messaging to staff that they are exempted from the shutdown while funds are available,” said Justin Chen, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents many E.P.A. employees, in a statement. He added: “This administration should stop playing games with federal workers.”

Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, the top Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee overseeing the E.P.A., said in a statement that the agency’s lack of clarity was “deeply unfair to public servants who deserve straight answers about their jobs.”

An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the status of E.P.A. workers under the agency’s shutdown plan. Some employees said they were being asked to continue working, but were not expecting to be paid. After publication of this article, a spokeswoman for the agency said that no E.P.A. employee was working without pay.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said Republicans had sold out their constituents by refusing to negotiate with Democrats who wanted to extend expiring health care subsidies in exchange for keeping the government running.

“I want to be clear — this shutdown is a choice,” Ms. Hochul said. “In putting Donald Trump first, they put New Yorkers last.”

Officials say the effects are already beginning to be felt across the state: Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration employees are working without pay, while hospitals wait in vain for federal reimbursements.

The longer the shutdown lasts, they say, the more people will be affected, including Social Security recipients and mothers, infants and children receiving assistance through federal programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and Head Start.

Ms. Hochul also suggested that the state would not pay to keep the Statue of Liberty open to the public during the shutdown. The site, which is operated by the National Park Service, is expected to close next week once its federal funding runs out.

The statue’s torch “could literally go dark, not because of an act of God or a horrific storm or a flood or hurricane, but literally because Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington forced a government shutdown,” Ms. Hochul said.

Emma Wallner, a spokeswoman for Ms. Hochul, confirmed that the state would not pay to keep the Statue of Liberty open once the National Park Service shuttered the site. But she said the National Park Service had not informed New York officials when it would cease operations.

Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the majority leader in the State Senate, denounced what she described as “a dysfunctional government led by a president who basically believes that if he inflicts pain on people, that it will only hurt Democrats.”

Republicans saw it differently. In a statement, Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican from the North Country who is weighing challenging Ms. Hochul next year, blamed Democrats for the shutdown, casting the push to extend health care subsidies as a cynical political gambit.

“Once again, New York Democrats, cheered on by Kathy Hochul, are putting hardworking New Yorkers and Americans LAST because they are forcing a government shutdown by concocting an unrelated policy issue,” Ms. Stefanik said.

The shutdown comes days after the Trump administration slashed an additional $100 million from New York’s counterterrorism programs and roughly $20 million more from subway safety programs. On Wednesday, news broke that roughly $18 billion in previously allocated infrastructure funding would be frozen, casting doubt on the future of at least two major projects in the New York City area.

New York has long been one of the largest contributors to the federal government through its tax revenue. But it also receives considerable federal funding that makes it vulnerable to the whims of Washington: This year state officials said they had expected to receive $93 billion — more than a third of the state’s budget. It is not yet clear how much of that will come through.

The uncertainty has left policymakers and advocates scrambling. Christine C. Quinn, the president and chief executive of WIN, which provides housing and supportive services to homeless families in New York City, warned that the pain of the shutdown was only foreshadowing what might be to come.

“As devastating as a government shutdown is, let us be absolutely clear: The consequences of the Trump administration’s proposed budget would do irreparable harm to millions of New York families and would plunge our state, and states across the nation, into a fiscal and humanitarian disaster,” Ms. Quinn said in a statement.

Democrats are hoping that voters feel the impact of Republican cuts to the social safety net and other key agencies ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Indeed, Ms. Hochul suggested, some pain might be instructive.

“People need to see that there’s consequences right now to what Republicans have done,” she told reporters. “Go to the polls next year, 2026, and start getting this country back on track.”

Maxine Joselow contributed reporting.

The G.O.P. plan, which would extend funding through Nov. 21, failed again on a 55-to-45 vote, short of the 60 votes needed for passage.

The Democratic plan, which ties a short-term government funding bill to extending expiring health care subsidies and restoring Medicaid cuts enacted over the summer as part of President Trump’s marquee tax cut and domestic policy law, failed on a 47-to-53 vote.

The “Groundhog Day” nature of the votes reflected just how dug in both Republicans and Democrats are in the current funding dispute. No senators changed their votes from the night before.

Two Democrats — Senators John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada — voted with Republicans to approve the House-passed stopgap bill. So did Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was the lone Republican to oppose his party’s bill.

By Wednesday morning, it was clear that the White House was prepared to play hardball against Democrats in efforts to maximize its leverage in the shutdown stalemate.

Russell T. Vought, the director of the White House budget office, announced that the administration had halted about $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City — represented by the two Democratic leaders, Senator Charles Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries.

Mr. Vought said on social media that the projects had been “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles” and cited the Hudson River tunnel project and the Second Avenue Subway.

At the Capitol, Republicans indicated that they would try to ratchet up pressure on Democrats to back their spending bill. Senators were set to take off Thursday for Yom Kippur, but G.O.P. leaders said to expect a series of votes over the weekend.

Speaking outside the Capitol on Wednesday morning, Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, reiterated that he was not interested in pairing negotiations on health care policy with government funding.

“Everybody’s now asking the question, ‘How does this end?’” Mr. Thune said. “It ends when Senate Democrats pick this bill up, passed by the House of Representatives, and vote for it.”

Around the same time, Mr. Schumer declared that he was sticking to his demand that Republicans negotiate with his party on health care.

“When Democrats say we want to work with Republicans to lower premiums and to strengthen health care, all we are doing is reflecting what the American people already want,” Mr. Schumer said. “Nothing more. Nothing less. They want us to sit down and negotiate something real that takes this huge burden off their shoulders.”

That appeared to be a remote prospect.

In an afternoon conference call with House Republicans, Mr. Vought told members that the reduction-in-force plans he had threatened last week, to lay off federal workers during a shutdown, would go into effect in the next day or two, according to a member on the call.

He also discussed with them the possibility of passing a bill to get the troops paid, and he framed the shutdown as an opportunity for the administration to clean out excess bureaucrats, the member said, especially when it came to programs that do not align with President Trump’s agenda.

Shortly after the call, Mr. Vought announced that he was also canceling $8 billion in “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” in more than a dozen states, all of which are governed by Democrats.

“I’m sure that Russ Vought is heartbroken about the fact that he’s unable to give certain things to certain constituencies,” Vice President JD Vance said archly at a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday afternoon.

Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said the announcement was proof that the White House was “clearly salivating at the opportunity to hurt people and using the shutdown they caused as the pretext to do it.”

“These mafioso tactics will not work,” she said.

Annie Karni contributed reporting.

The most recent government shutdown, which occurred during Mr. Trump’s first term, lasted more than a month and affected hundreds of thousands of Americans. Middle-class families relied on food pantries, travel delays and cancellations snarled airports and the day-to-day mechanics of American life were upended.

With little indication of an imminent political compromise in the partisan standoff over spending, many Americans were bracing for what could be a long, destabilizing slog of mass layoffs, funding cuts and a reordering of life.

Government shutdowns have their roots in 1974, when the U.S. government’s budget process was reorganized to transfer much of the approval power to Congress. Before that, the executive branch retained broad powers to fund the government and, in some cases, could approve continued funding without congressional approval.

In 1977, legislators jostled over whether Medicaid could be used to pay for abortions. The standoff led to three separate lapses in federal funding, when the government could not support the Labor Department or what were then called the Health, Education and Welfare Departments. In total, those agencies were without funds for 28 days that year.

The next year, President Jimmy Carter took issue with a costly public works bill and military spending, causing a shutdown that lasted 17 days.

The effects of those early shutdowns tended to be limited to certain agencies. Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti issued two legal opinions, in 1980 and 1981, that made shutdowns more severe and wide reaching.

Until that point, most government agencies could continue to operate even if funding bills had not been passed, with the understanding that money would eventually be approved. But Mr. Civiletti argued that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional appropriations save for a few exceptions, including for work by federal employees that protected life and property.

In the years since, government shutdowns have had wider reaching effects and caused significant disruptions for much of the federal work force.

Shutdowns under the Clinton administration closed the government down for a total of 26 days. A shutdown under the Obama administration lasted 16 days.

The longest government shutdown began in December 2018 during Mr. Trump’s first term, when the closure lasted for more than a month over Mr. Trump’s insistence that Congress approve funding to build a wall along the southern border. That shutdown, which dwarfed previous instances, rattled the country and its infrastructure. Mr. Trump eventually backed down from his border wall demands, and the government reopened in January 2019.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/01/multimedia/01trump-news-promo7p-clvg/01trump-news-promo7p-clvg-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 18:57:45.461852

House Bill 278, brought by Rep. Nelly Nicol, R-Billings, expands law enforcement’s purview during stops, enabling officers to “make a reasonable attempt, upon reasonable suspicion and when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person.”

The law took effect Wednesday.

In the lawsuit filed Tuesday by Valley Neighbors of the Flathead in Lewis and Clark County District Court, Upper Seven Law, a nonprofit law firm based in Helena, argued that the law violates the Montana Constitution.

The lawsuit maintains that prolonging a stop to investigate a person’s immigration status is illegal in Montana. While federal law allows officers to use “reasonable suspicion” to investigate potential crimes unrelated to the reason for a stop, Montana’s Constitution requires “particularized suspicion,” a higher standard.

Andres Halady, an attorney at Upper Seven Law, also argued that the new law effectively enables police to detain individuals for unlawful presence in the United States, which is a civil offense, not a crime.

“No standard, whether it’s ‘reasonable suspicion’ or ‘particularized suspicion,’ should allow that,” Haladay said in an interview Wednesday with Montana Free Press. “But certainly the Montana Constitution does not tolerate that.”

The lawsuit also alleges the law violates Montana’s explicit right to privacy and allows the discrimination of individuals based on race and national origin.

During the 2025 legislative session, Nicol dismissed allegations that the bill would lead to racial profiling, arguing the legislation only allows officers to investigate immigration status, but doesn’t require it. Nicol framed the initiative as an opportunity for the Montana Highway Patrol to prevent human trafficking.

Nicol did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit Wednesday.

The bill passed the Legislature generally along party lines. Speaker of the House Rep. Brandon Ler, R-Savage, Wednesday called the lawsuit “disappointing but not surprising.”

“Opponents are once again turning to the courts to block the work of the Legislature and the will of Montanans,” Ler said in a statement to MTFP. “We will not back down from enabling law enforcement to do their jobs keeping our communities safe.”

Recent Montana immigration arrests stemming from traffic stops include Christopher Martinez Marvin in Helena and eight individuals in Whitefish.

“What they’ve done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles — they’re very unsafe places, and we’re going to straighten them out one-by-one,” Trump said in an address to top brass in Quantico, Va. “That’s a war too. It’s a war from within.”

Commanders should use American cities as “training grounds,” the president said.

Trump’s words provoked instant pushback. Oregon has already filed a legal challenge, and experts expressed concern that what the president described is against the law.

“He is suggesting that they learn how to become warriors in American cities,” said Daniel C. Schwartz, former general counsel at the National Security Agency, who heads the legal team at National Security Leaders for America. “That should scare everybody. It’s also boldly illegal.”

The use of soldiers to assist with federal immigration raids and crowd control at protests and otherwise enforce civilian laws has been a point of contention with big city mayors and blue state governors for months, beginning with the deployment of thousands of federalized National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines to Los Angeles in early June.

That deployment was illegal, a federal judge ruled last month. In a scorching 52-page decision, U.S. District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer barred soldiers under Trump’s command from carrying out law enforcement duties across California, warning of a “national police force with the President as its chief.”

Yet hundreds of troops remained on the streets of Los Angeles while the matter was under litigation. With the case still moving through the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, hundreds more are now set to arrive in Portland, Ore., with another hundred reportedly enroute to Chicago — all over the objections of state and local leaders.

“Isolated threats to federal property should not be enough to warrant this kind of response,” said Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law. “The threat has to be really serious, and I don’t think the Trump administration has made that case.”

Others agreed.

“I’m tremendously worried,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law. “Using the military for domestic law enforcement is something that’s characteristic of authoritarian regimes.”

Oregon’s attorney general filed a lawsuit Monday alleging the president had applied a “baseless, wildly hyperbolic pretext” to send in the troops. Officials in Illinois, where the Trump administration has made Chicago a focal point of immigration enforcement, are also poised to file a challenge.

Although the facts on the ground are different legally, the Oregon suit is a near copy-paste of the California battle making its way through the courts, experts said.

“That’s exactly the model that they’re following,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.

Unlike the controversial decision to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., in August, the Los Angeles and Portland deployments have relied on an esoteric subsection of the law, which allows the president to federalize troops over the objection of state governments in certain limited cases.

California’s challenge to those justifications has so far floundered in court, with the 9th Circuit finding in June that judges must be “highly deferential” to the president’s interpretation of facts on the ground. That case is under review by a larger panel of judges.

In a memo filed Monday, California Deputy Solicitor General Christopher D. Hu warned that the decision had emboldened the administration to deploy troops elsewhere, citing Portland as an example.

“Defendants apparently believe that the June 7 memorandum — issued in response to events in Los Angeles — indefinitely authorizes the deployment of National Guard troops anywhere in the country, for virtually any reason,” Hu wrote. “It is time to end this unprecedented experiment in militarized law enforcement and conscription of state National Guard troops outside the narrow conditions allowed by Congress.”

Experts warn the obscure 19th century law at the heart of the debate is vague and “full of loopholes,” worrying some who see repeated deployment as a slippery slope to widespread, long-term military occupations.

“That has not been our experience at least since the Civil War,” Schwartz said. “If we become accustomed to seeing armed uniformed service personnel in our cities, we risk not objecting to it, and when we stop objecting to it, it becomes a norm.”

The joint address to military leaders in Virginia on Tuesday further stoked those fears.

“We’re under invasion from within,” the president admonished generals and admirals gathered in the auditorium. “No different from a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don’t wear uniforms.”

He touted the move in August to create a “quick reaction force” to “quell civil disturbances” — a decree folded into his executive order expanding the D.C. troop deployment.

“George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Grover Cleveland, George Bush and others all used the armed forces to keep domestic order and peace,” Trump said. “Now they like to say, oh, you’re not allowed to use the military.”

Those historic cases have some important differences with 2025, experts say.

When President Cleveland sent troops to break up a railroad strike and tamp down mob violence against Chinese immigrants, he invoked the Insurrection Act. So did 15 other presidents, including Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and George H.W. Bush.

Experts stress that Trump has pointedly not used the act, despite name-checking it often in his first term.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday largely avoided the theme of “enemies within,” instead extolling the “warrior ethos” at the heart of his military reform project. He railed against what he saw as the corrupted culture of the modern military — as well as its aesthetic shortcomings.

“It’s tiring to look out at combat formations and see fat troops,” Hegseth said. “It’s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon. It’s a bad look.”

As deployments multiply across the country, experts said they were watching what the appellate division and ultimately the Supreme Court will decide.

“It will be a test for the Supreme Court,” Schwartz said. “Whether they are willing to continue to allow this president to do whatever he wants to do in clear violation of constitutional principles, or whether they will restrain him.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/597ed71/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa0%2F80%2F079ad553471b8ae6630d89f3484d%2F1512823-me-4th-immig-rally-ces-3094.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 18:57:52.358587

One key to the strategy: ICE’s close partnership with both the Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Park Police, according to a New York Times review of dozens of videos filmed by witnesses in Washington. At other times, the agency operated alone, with masked officers detaining people in sometimes aggressive encounters that drew angry protests from neighbors.

Last week, an immigrants rights organization sued the Department of Homeland Security, accusing the agency of targeting people for their ethnicity, making arrests without probable cause and sowing “terror in Latino and other communities across the District.”

The department called allegations that it had engaged in racial profiling “disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE.”

As the administration works to deepen police cooperation on immigrant enforcement throughout the country, the effort in Washington shows how migrants stopped by local law enforcement for low-level infractions can swiftly be detained by ICE — a boost for an agency struggling to meet the White House’s demands for higher arrest numbers.

Since January, ICE has signed more than 520 agreements in 35 states that allow local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials on immigration enforcement during routine patrols.

However, the administration has faced resistance to such arrangements from liberal cities with so-called sanctuary policies, which ban the police from assisting immigration agents.

To get around that in Washington, the Trump administration exploited the city’s tenuous status as a federal district, compelling the police to cooperate with ICE by declaring a “crime emergency.” Previously, under Washington’s sanctuary city law, local police officers had not been permitted to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement authorities.

It also took advantage of the array of federal law enforcement already operating in the region, including the U.S. Park Police, which also has officers in New York and San Francisco. During the surge, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum deputized immigration officers to patrol with Park Police officers and granted the Park Police authority to pursue fleeing offenders.

Tricia McLaughlin, a homeland security spokeswoman, said in a statement that immigration officials in Washington had “arrested gang members, kidnappers, drug traffickers and other violent thugs.” She highlighted the department’s collaboration with the local police, the Park Police and other law enforcement agencies, adding, “Criminal aliens are a public safety threat, and there should be no place for sanctuary policies that place crime over the community.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about how many of the 1,200 people detained for immigration violations in Washington had also been accused of committing other crimes.

While Mayor Muriel Bowser has said that local police officers would stop assisting immigration enforcement when Mr. Trump’s emergency order expired on Sept. 10, the federal deployment has opened the door to more cooperation.

The Metropolitan Police Department has left in place a policy change allowing officers to share information with federal immigration authorities about people not in custody, such as during traffic stops, according to Daniel Gleick, a spokesman for the mayor’s office. And the police department continues to work with a federal task force focused on Washington that includes officers from homeland security, the mayor acknowledged on Wednesday.

“We never wanted M.P.D. to patrol with homeland security agencies, but they are part of the task force, and that should change,” she told reporters.

Mr. Trump has also threatened to once again take over the city’s police department if the mayor does not cooperate on immigration enforcement.

And ICE officials, who continue to work with other federal agencies in Washington, said they did not plan to let up. “We’re going to continue our operations in the D.C. metro area,” Marcos Charles, who leads ICE’s enforcement and removal operations, said in an interview.

Seizing On Traffic Violations

One of the first visible signs of ICE’s presence in Washington came at “safety compliance” checkpoints set up on major streets at rush hour, after dark outside popular restaurants and during the day in residential zones. Videos show officers working alongside local police officers as drivers were told to pull over their cars or scooters for minor infractions.

The primary role of the Park Police, a division of the National Park Service, is protecting national parklands, federal buildings and monuments in Washington, New York and San Francisco. But under the current administration, the agency has stepped up its role in immigration enforcement, a shift from its traditional focus, according to former officers.

Videos collected and verified by The Times show members of the Park Police, trailed by homeland security agents, initiating traffic stops of landscaping, construction and food delivery vehicles around the city.

On Aug. 20, Park Police officers pulled over a truck that bore the logo of a Maryland landscaping business as it drove through Rock Creek Park, a national park that bisects the District of Columbia.

The officers said the vehicle was pulled over because its tags were obscured, and asked to see the identification of those inside the truck, according to the driver, a U.S. citizen who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

When one member of the landscaping crew failed to provide a valid ID, he was pulled from the passenger seat, according to the driver, who filmed the arrest on his phone.

“This is an illegal detention,” he can be heard shouting in the video.

Ms. McLaughlin, the homeland security spokeswoman, said officers discovered during the stop that the man was a Honduran immigrant who had entered the United States illegally, adding that he had resisted arrest.

The next day, the landscaping company sent its clients an email saying that it would be forced to pause work in Washington “until we can determine how to ensure the safety of our team.”

Rock Creek Park, a forested greenway typically frequented by cyclists and joggers, has been a major area of focus of the joint immigration operations.

In late August, a junk removal truck driving through the park was pulled over by Park Police officers working with agents from Homeland Security Investigations. The alleged violation: driving a commercial vehicle through a federal park.

The two men inside the truck, one from Nicaragua and the other from Egypt, were placed in custody pending deportation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

A few days later, a Park Police officer pulled over Erminio Guevara, a native of El Salvador, for driving a landscaping truck through the same park. A local resident filmed Mr. Guevara as he was being arrested and loaded into an unmarked S.U.V. She asked the officers why he was being detained and whether they had racially profiled him. They did not respond.

The Park Police’s partnership with ICE has drawn the agency into the administration’s aggressive public campaign against undocumented immigrants.

In August, the two agencies worked together to detain Laith Husam Farah Zaza, a Jordanian man accused of overstaying his visa, as he worked in a food truck near the National Mall. Afterward, immigration officials posted his photo on social media, highlighting the role of the Park Police in “targeting unlawful food truck and cart vendors.”

Mr. Farah Zaza’s wife, Fatima Marroquin-Pineda, who is a U.S. citizen, said her husband had been working extra hours as a line cook to help pay the fees required to obtain legal status through their marriage.

She said she was shocked to see the government celebrate his arrest on social media. “He was not a criminal, and it’s not a crime to work on a food truck,” she said.

Aubrie Spady, an Interior Department spokeswoman, said in a statement: “U.S. Park Police are responsible for conducting common, legitimate traffic stops. If immigration violations are found, the U.S. Park Police allow the Department of Homeland Security to take it from there.”

Questions About Due Process

ICE has also worked on its own in Washington, targeting people in their cars and stopping others on the sidewalk for minor infractions.

Videos show some officers wearing masks while carrying out arrests — a practice that is now banned in California — creating confusion and alarm among local residents.

ICE officials have said the face coverings are necessary to protect the safety of their officers, noting they have been threatened and attacked. “The brave men and women of ICE choose to wear masks for safety, not secrecy,” the agency said in a statement.

On Sept. 2, Allison Price, 49, was walking her dog with her husband in D.C.’s Chevy Chase neighborhood when she saw two armed, masked agents in a beat-up minivan pull over a utility vehicle. In less than five minutes, the vehicle’s driver and passenger were in handcuffs and whisked away.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/01/arts/dc-ice-tactics-horiz-grid-6/dc-ice-tactics-horiz-grid-6-facebookJumbo.png,N,,2025-10-01 18:57:28.873283

Gavin Newsom noted that California CDL holders had a crash rate nearly 40% lower than the national average.","As issues regarding the integrity of non-domiciled CDLs have taken center stage nationally, Oklahoma recently partnered with ICE for a three-day enforcement effort.

According to a news release from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently arrested 130 commercial truck drivers for various violations at the Beckham County Port of Entry.

“Oklahomans deserve safe highways,” Corporation Commission Chair Kim David said. “We appreciate the opportunity to assist ICE and DPS Troop S by removing non-compliant and dangerous drivers from our roads. By working together as law enforcement partners, we’re reducing risks for every driver.”

The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said the enforcement focused on CDL holders licensed and registered in the state of California.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt also issued a news release about “Operation Guardian,” saying the Oklahoma Highway Patrol partnered with ICE on the raid. Stitt said the operation resulted in the apprehension of more than 125 illegal immigrants from such countries as India, Uzbekistan, China, Russia, Georgia, Turkey, Tajikstan, Ukraine and Mauritania. In the release, Still included a photo of a CDL from New York that included “No Name Given.”

“If New York wants to hand out CDLs to illegal immigrants with ‘No Name Given,’ that’s on them,” Stitt said. “I want to thank our troopers and ICE officials for their hard work. This is about keeping Oklahomans safe.”

In response to an email from Land Line, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission declined to provide any additional comment.

The announcement comes days after the U.S. Department of Transportation said it was going to drastically reduce the number of people who could receive non-domiciled CDLs.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the current process is allowing unqualified and illegal drivers to operate commercial motor vehicles across the nation.

“The process for issuing these licenses is absolutely 100% broken,” Duffy said during a news conference on Friday, Sept. 26. “It has become a threat to public safety, and it is a national emergency that requires action right now.”

The new system will make non-citizens ineligible for a non-domiciled CDL unless they meet stricter requirements, including an employment-based visa and a federal immigration status check.

Findings from a recent audit called out such states as California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Washington and Texas for “systemic non-compliance.”

Duffy also announced direct enforcement against California. The state must immediately pause the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs and identify all non-domiciled CDLs that fail to comply with regulations. The state also must revoke and reissue all noncompliant non-domiciled CDLs if they comply with the new federal requirements.

The DOT said that a review of California’s non-domiciled CDLs revealed that more than 25% of its non-domiciled CDLs were improperly issued. Duffy said California had 30 days to come into compliance or that FMCSA would withhold $160 million in federal highway funds for the first year.

Marina Galindo, a Maywood resident who was demonstrating outside of the facility Tuesday, said federal agents in recent days made those gathered feel like they were getting attacked.
Federal prosecutors claimed they were among a large group that descended on the facility’s entrance Saturday evening and allegedly “made criminal physical contact” against federal agents working outside of the facility.
Following those arrests, the Trump administration is now planning to deploy around 100 military troops in Illinois in order to protect ICE agents, Gov.
“We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,” Trump said.","The mayor of suburban Broadview said her constituents are “begging for relief” from federal immigration agents who have placed residents and first responders in danger by their use of tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets against protesters.

Mayor Katrina Thompson on Tuesday accused Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials of waging a “disinformation campaign” amid their continued use of chemical and less-lethal munitions directed at crowds outside the agency’s Broadview processing center.

“It all has to stop,” she said during a press conference alongside other Broadview leaders. “ICE has to stop putting our residents, our police officers, our first responders and American citizens in harm’s way.”

Thompson on Tuesday morning stood beside village leaders as well as former Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot and the mayors of Oak Park and Forest Park, who have loaned their officers to assist in Broadview.

Broadview officials claimed the ICE facility and its personnel have put a tremendous strain on the village community.

Thompson last week called on ICE to stop “making war on my community” and on Tuesday said the village police department has launched three separate criminal investigations into ICE activity. That includes an incident in which CBS Chicago reporter Asal Rezaei claimed an agent fired a “direct shot” of chemical munitions at her car over the weekend when no protesters were present.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, denied that incident occurred and claimed protesters have themselves thrown rocks, slashed tires and tossed tear gas cans outside the facility.

In response to her statements last week, Thompson said ICE agents promised a “shitshow” in the village over the weekend, though they acknowledged the agency has denied any such statements were made.

Marina Galindo, a Maywood resident who was demonstrating outside of the facility Tuesday, said federal agents in recent days made those gathered feel like they were getting attacked.

“People were protesting, we were just standing there, they would come out and just start pushing people, they were pushing people,” Galindo said. “They weren’t giving people the chance to move back. They were like, ‘Get back,’ but not everyone can walk backwards.”

Village officials have claimed Broadview police officers have been forced out of action while they recover from their exposure to ICE’s tear gas, while firefighters, first responders and other ambulance personnel have also been exposed.

Police Chief Thomas Mills said his officers — many of whom are working their first ever job in law enforcement — have been “shell shocked” by the confrontations. He said he’s been on calls with officers as they were “literally choking” from the gas as they attempted to explain what was going on.

“It’s very hard on my officers,” he said. “This is unprecedented times when we’re actually having to try and do our job against the federal law enforcement who’s doing their job.”

Mills and Thompson also pushed back against claims by ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, who’ve claimed Broadview police have refused to answer calls for service made by federal agents.

They claimed officers have responded to the few calls they’ve gotten, while Thompson claimed DHS is “running a disinformation campaign that would even make Russia blush.”

Acting Fire Chief Matt Martin said fencing erected by ICE around the processing facility was constructed illegally and is blocking the Broadview Fire Department from accessing businesses in that area in the event of an emergency.

Though the village has called on ICE to take that down, Martin said they have received no response.

“Each day this fence remains, the risk of tragedy increases,” he said. “That is the law of probability and it applies to everyone, including the federal government.”

Five people were arrested during protests outside the processing center over the weekend, including two who allegedly had firearms in their possession.

Federal prosecutors claimed they were among a large group that descended on the facility’s entrance Saturday evening and allegedly “made criminal physical contact” against federal agents working outside of the facility.

Four of those five face felony assault charges after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo instructing Chicago’s federal prosecutors to seek “the highest provable offense” against protesters who are arrested.

Following those arrests, the Trump administration is now planning to deploy around 100 military troops in Illinois in order to protect ICE agents, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday, though it remains to be seen when or where those soldiers could be sent out.

On Tuesday, Pritzker said he’s been in “constant and consistent communication with Broadview” police and officials, and is offering whatever assistance available to them.

“We want to keep the people of Broadview, especially, safe,” he said at an unrelated news conference. “Not just protesters, we’re talking about people who are just walking their kids to school, living their lives in Broadview. They deserve peace. That is why ICE needs to back off and that is why the President of the United States should not send troops to the state of Illinois.”

President Donald Trump on Tuesday proposed using American cities as training grounds for the armed forces, with U.S. military might being deployed against what he described as the “invasion from within.”

Addressing an audience of military brass abruptly summoned to Virginia, Trump outlined a muscular and at times norm-shattering view of the military’s role in domestic affairs. He was joined by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who declared an end to “woke” culture and announced new directives for troops that include “gender-neutral” or “male-level” standards for physical fitness.

The dual messages underscored the Trump administration’s efforts not only to reshape contemporary Pentagon culture but enlist military resources for the president’s priorities and in everyday American civic life, including by quelling unrest and violent crime on city streets.

“We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,” Trump said. He noted at another point: “We’re under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy but more difficult in many ways because they don’t wear uniforms.”

Pritzker called it “appalling” that Trump “would even suggest such a thing,” saying it’s offensive that the president is using cities as a playground for his “militarized obsession.” Pritzker claimed Trump is “copying tactics of Vladimir Putin” by sending troops into cities, ""thinking that that’s some sort of proving ground for war.”

“We don’t want them here,” Thompson said when asked about the possibility of a military deployment in Broadview. ‘That’s how I feel.”

Conditions at Port Isobel are similar to the Broadview center, Jose told Bejarano.","SOUTH CHICAGO — A Chicago family is reeling after federal agents detained their father while he was on a work trip in September.

Now, they’re asking for help in their fight to bring him home while trying to keep a roof over their heads. A GoFundMe to support them has raised about $4,000 of its $6,500 goal.

Stephanie and Jose — whose names have been changed to protect their identities — have been together for 20 years, said family friend Emily Bejarano, who started the GoFundMe to help the family. Jose, a woodworker, started working with a food delivery service as soon as they arrived in Chicago over a year ago.

The family came to Chicago after fleeing Ecuador, where they were targeted by a drug cartel, Bejarano said.

“Jose is a hardworking gentleman, a good father,” Bejarano said. “He is working to support his oldest son in Ecuador, who’s currently at a university over there. And they send money, so he’s not only supporting his wife and his son here, he’s also sending money to his family back home.”

On Sept. 22, Stephanie’s husband, Jose, texted her that he and a coworker had been stopped by police and “la migra” — Spanish slang for immigration authorities — while driving on the Chicago Skyway en route to Michigan to deliver furniture.

Several minutes later, Jose sent another text: a video clip of a person wearing a police vest stationed outside of the company truck.

Stephanie said a silent prayer as she tried to keep calm, she told Block Club.

“If something happens, he’ll let me know,” she thought.

Two hours passed before Stephanie received another text, this time from Jose’s boss asking her to call him. He told her Jose and his coworker were being detained by immigration authorities after a traffic stop, and that the sheriff’s office instructed him to pick up the vehicle they’d had to leave behind.

The next few days would be hell, Bejarano said.

‘We Can Take Anybody We Want’

After getting permission to leave work early, Stephanie called Bejarano for help. As the two picked up Stephanie’s son from school, Jose texted her again, this time telling her to find a lawyer.

“He said he was being detained in Broadview. He told me to take care of ourselves and not to leave the house. ‘They’re picking up everybody. They’ve got 17-year-old kids here,’ he said,” Stephanie said.

Jose also asked Stephanie to bring documents they received from immigration officials when they crossed the border last year. She, Jose and their son had legal status and a pending asylum application.

Worried that they’d attempt to detain Stephanie, too, Bejarano volunteered to go in her stead. She drove to a hotel in the middle of the night to make copies of the documents before heading to the ICE processing facility in Broadview, not knowing what to expect, she said.

What started off as a civil interaction with an agent posted near the entrance went left after Bejarano asked if Jose would be released once she gave Jose’s documents to the officials. The agent’s tone shifted from pleasant to confrontational, immediately putting Bejarano on the defensive, she said. That, coupled with the sight of armed agents patrolling the roof, made it difficult for Bejarano to maintain her composure, she said.

The agent told her they couldn’t take the documents at that time and suggested she “grab a coffee” and return later.

While she waited, Bejarano reached out to a neighbor, who connected her to Cook County Commissioner Frank Gutierrez, she said.

After a beat, Bejarano approached the door again. This time, the agent who answered ordered her to bring the papers inside, Bejarano said.

“There’s two men standing at the door, covered from head to toe with rifles. And you think I’m gonna go in by myself? No, no. I’m standing in a doorway, and he’s like, ‘I’m gonna give you three seconds to come in, otherwise you gotta go,’” she said.

Bejarano told the agents Gutierrez was with her, and an agent asked what she needed him for before ordering her to come inside again.

“When I didn’t, he shoved me out of the door and closed it,” Bejarano said,

Days later, after consulting with an attorney recommended by Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th), Bejarano returned to Broadview, this time with her husband and their young daughter. They stayed in the car as she made her way to the facility, walking past a large group of detainees being loaded into buses and vans.

Bejarano found the same agent she spoke with days earlier. He refused to take the documents, telling Bejarano they already had the paperwork. When she pressed for answers about Jose’s release, the agent told her, “We have a new government now. We can take anybody we want,” Bejarano said.

A chill went down her spine, Bejarano said.

Defeated, Bejarano returned to her car. When she got in, her daughter was coughing and her husband told her he was having trouble breathing. Federal agents had deployed tear gas on protesters outside the facility, and it had gotten inside the car, Bejarano said.

“I knew his wife would want answers. I couldn’t get any,” Bejarano said.

‘They’re Sleeping On The Floor’

Communication between Jose and the family has been sporadic since agents took him. Every phone call to the outside is a $52 charge.

“Every time he calls, he wants to know what time it is,” Bejarano said. “They’re sleeping on the floor. There’s more than 200 people in there, and there are no windows.”

When Jose called home again last Wednesday, he told Stephanie that he’d been transferred to the Port Isobel Detention Center in Texas. Families can pay for detained people to have access to a tablet that allows them to text and video call. Setting it up has been a pain, as he has to go through a series of third-party vendors to make it work and officers at the center have been little help, Bejarano said.

Conditions at Port Isobel are similar to the Broadview center, Jose told Bejarano. He was treated for a fever over the weekend. Though he’s feeling better, the young father is still scared, Bejarano said.

Sigcho-Lopez told Block Club he’s been dealing with “several dozen cases” like Jose’s since the beginning of Operation Midway Blitz, President Donald Trump’s mass immigration enforcement effort. The Ecuadorian consulate has tried to intervene without success, Sigcho-Lopez said.

Immigration officials are making it even harder for detainees to get help or legal counsel, he said.

“It’s hard to even confirm that they are in the location. Sometimes [immigration officers] answer, sometimes they don’t answer,” Sigcho-Lopez said. “And it’s taking over 72 hours just to confirm that someone is in a certain location. By then they may already be in another location without due process, without an attorney and at the risk of receiving a deportation order.”

The alderman has also been working with organizations like the National Lawyers Guild and the Coalition of United Families to help secure legal representation for detained people who typically lack the resources to fight back.

Sigcho-Lopez said more can be done to stop ICE, pointing to the executive order signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom banning them from wearing face masks. He’s also calling on Gov. JB Pritzker to demand accountability and push for an investigation into Department of Homeland Security head Tom Homan, who was recently linked to a bribery scandal.

“What they are doing is illegal. It violates our state constitution, our international laws. We must stop complying,” Sigcho-Lopez said. “You cannot operate and you cannot comply with a federal government that is not respecting the Constitution. They have no consciousness. They have no morality. They are corrupt.”

CBS2 reported that nearly 550 people have been arrested since the government’s immigration enforcement began in early September. While the acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations said that a little over half of those arrested committed a crime, the rest, like Jose, have no criminal record.

Stephanie and Bejarano fear Jose will be detained indefinitely and lost to the system. They worry he’ll face a similar fate to those who were held at “Alligator Alcatraz,” the Florida facility where 1,800 people are unaccounted for after the center was closed in August.

Hope is the fuel that keeps them going, they said. Once they get him back, Jose can work toward his dream of opening his own woodworking business, something he’s wanted to do for years, Stephanie said.

He was happy with his job, even if it was very tiring. He had many dreams, she said.

It abruptly terminated nearly all U.S. foreign aid, which had supported human rights defenders and provided lifesaving humanitarian assistance around the world.
Cuts to grants by the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and offices on refugees, women and global justice further downgraded America’s commitment to human rights.
Our organizations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have worked closely with these groups for decades and, consistent with our longstanding and independent mandates to speak out in protecting human rights, we can attest that their work is indispensable to the human rights community not only in the region but internationally.
When Israel designated leading Palestinian human rights groups including Addameer and Al Haq as “terrorist organizations” in 2021, nine European Union member states rejected the allegations as unsubstantiated.","When the world emerged from the horrors of World War II and vowed “never again,” nations laid the foundation for the system of international justice that now exists to address the planet’s worst crimes. Today, the United States is actively trying to dismantle it.

The Trump administration on Sept. 4 imposed sanctions on three leading Palestinian human rights organizations: Al Haq, founded in 1979 and a pioneer in documenting violations in occupied Gaza and the West Bank; Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, which for more than two decades has meticulously chronicled laws of war violations in Gaza; and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, which has long provided legal aid to victims, particularly from Gaza.

In June, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on another leading Palestinian rights group, Addameer, under a different set of measures.

This is part of a broader Trump administration effort aimed at those who support justice for Palestinians. The stated reason for the September sanctions was that the three groups had helped the International Criminal Court in its investigation of Israel “without Israel’s consent.” But the U.S. government has also gone after officials of the court, which has taken on an investigation that covers allegations of grave crimes by Israeli forces in Gaza; it has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The administration has placed sanctions on the I.C.C. prosecutor, deputy prosecutors and six of the court’s judges, as well as Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Gaza and the West Bank.

Beyond what has been done to the Palestinians, the Trump administration has undermined the rule of law, protection of human rights and international justice, which all lie at the heart of a rules-based global order. The administration has slashed funding to the United Nations and threatened more cuts while disengaging from the U.N. Human Rights Council. It abruptly terminated nearly all U.S. foreign aid, which had supported human rights defenders and provided lifesaving humanitarian assistance around the world. Cuts to grants by the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and offices on refugees, women and global justice further downgraded America’s commitment to human rights.

Al Haq, Al Mezan and the Palestinian Center are award-winning organizations that in extraordinarily difficult circumstances have exposed violations of human rights and environmental law by Israeli and Palestinian authorities, armed groups and businesses. They are the voice of Palestinian victims, amplifying stories of injustice that would otherwise remain unheard.

The groups have continued their courageous work in Gaza over nearly two years. Al Mezan and the Palestinian Center are based in Gaza, and Al Haq, based in Ramallah in the West Bank, has staff there as well. They have faced bombardment that has resulted in the killings or wounding of staff members and hundreds of their relatives as well as starvation and forced displacement. On Sept. 7, Israeli bombings flattened the high-rise building that housed the Palestinian Center’s headquarters. The offices of Al Mezan across Gaza were damaged and destroyed in 2024.

The U.S. sanctions will not only disrupt the critical work that they are still able to do but also send a chilling signal to human rights defenders whose work implicates powerful actors or their allies. The Palestinian groups have been vocal in their support of the I.C.C.’s investigation into Israeli conduct and have made submissions to the court’s prosecutor.

Our organizations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have worked closely with these groups for decades and, consistent with our longstanding and independent mandates to speak out in protecting human rights, we can attest that their work is indispensable to the human rights community not only in the region but internationally.

This work is part of a broad global movement advancing justice for victims and survivors of the human rights abuses. A credible system of international justice that addresses genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity is an essential element of building respect for human rights.

The International Criminal Court is a central pillar of this system. Created through a treaty in 1998, the court is a forum of last resort. Governments intended to deliver on the post-World War II promise of “never again” by establishing such a permanent institution. The system is not perfect, but its capacity to seek to hold accountable even those in the highest positions of power can help end cycles of abuses. This power of the law is now at risk.

Further sanctions or other actions by the United States, including extending sanctions to the court as a whole, would jeopardize the rights of victims across the globe. Governments should rise to the occasion to protect the system they created.

When Israel designated leading Palestinian human rights groups including Addameer and Al Haq as “terrorist organizations” in 2021, nine European Union member states rejected the allegations as unsubstantiated. That pushback was likely a major reason Israel did not go further.

So far, other governments have carefully balanced their reactions to the U.S. sanctions for fear of provoking the Trump administration. This is a flawed strategy and out of step with the urgency the situation demands.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/01/opinion/01callamard/01callamard-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 17:57:30.890183

USCIS visited 1,000 homes across Minneapolis and St. Paul in the last two weeks and found “nearly 50%” of inhabitants were engaged in some form of immigration fraud.
“Our officers found indications of fraud, non-compliance or public safety and national security concerns,” Edlow said.
The Twin Cities were chosen because the “data” showed it as a hotspot for “manipulation and misuse of the immigration system,” officials said, with cases of marriage fraud found to be a particular problem.
“I want the American people to know that we are declaring war on immigration fraud,” Edlow said.","Nearly half of all immigrants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Twin Cities were found to have committed some form of immigration fraud during a recent sweep by authorities with the Department of Homeland Security, officials revealed Tuesday.

“Officers encountered blatant marriage fraud, visa overstay, people claiming to work as businesses that can’t be found, forged documents, abuse of the H1B visa system, abuse of the F1 visa, and many other discrepancies,” US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Joseph B. Edlow told reporters Tuesday.

Officials didn’t point to a specific group, but the Twin Cities has seen a massive uptick in Somali refugees and immigrants in recent years — with more than 82,000 from the East African country living in Minnesota.

USCIS visited 1,000 homes across Minneapolis and St. Paul in the last two weeks and found “nearly 50%” of inhabitants were engaged in some form of immigration fraud.

“Our officers found indications of fraud, non-compliance or public safety and national security concerns,” Edlow said. “What they found should shock all of America.”

The operation – dubbed Twin Shield, and carried out with the help of ICE – began on Sept. 13 and concluded this week, with Edlow calling it a “success” that could soon be repeated in cities across the country.

“This is the first of many,” Edlow said. “Any city should be prepared to be the site for an operation of this magnitude.”

Questions about the influx of migrants to the Twin Cities — particularly Somali migrants — have been in the national spotlight since claims emerged that liberal firebrand Rep. Ilhan Omar — a naturalized US citizen from Somalia — married her own brother to get him US citizenship.

Omar has denied the reports, which originated in conservative blogs as she was running for state office in 2016, calling them “false and ridiculous.”

It remains unclear how many people were detained in the recent federal operation — officials would only disclose that “multiple” had been taken into custody, explaining that it was too early to give an accurate number.

The Twin Cities were chosen because the “data” showed it as a hotspot for “manipulation and misuse of the immigration system,” officials said, with cases of marriage fraud found to be a particular problem.

In one incident, investigators encountered a Kenyan immigrant who paid just $100 for a fake death certificate in his wife’s name so he could marry his way into the US. The trouble is, his wife was alive and well, and found with their five kids in Minneapolis.

“Incidentally, he has another wife living in Sweden with whom has an additional three children,” Edlow said.

Another migrant found living in the Twin Cities was the son of a “known or suspected terrorist on the no-fly list,” and had made numerous attempts to commit marriage fraud before being caught in the operation, according to officials. He is now in custody for deportation.

A third person conned an elderly American woman into marriage – and while the bogus couple have since divorced, officials said she “lives in fear” of retaliation from the conman.

“I want the American people to know that we are declaring war on immigration fraud,” Edlow said. “We have a responsibility to keep this system legitimate.”

“What has been uncovered by these diligent officers over the past two weeks, that’s only the tip of the iceberg.”

Minnesota has sizable immigrant populations from countries like India, Vietnam, and Mexico, but its Somali residents have been a flashpoint for years.

The first refugees from Horn of Africa started arriving in the 1990s as Somalia descended into a violent civil war and famine.

While most are law-abiding asylum seekers – former Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek previously told Fox News “95%” are “good people” who want “to raise their families” – a minority have caused an outsized negative impact with rampant crime and gang activity.

The Office of Management and Budget has signaled there could be mass layoffs of federal workers in a shutdown.","Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Wednesday the government shutdown could “ultimately could be a benefit” to taxpayers if the Trump administration uses the opportunity to shrink the federal government in ways Republicans “never had the votes in the Senate to do.”

His comments came in an appearance on the “Moon Griffon Show,” a local radio show in Johnson’s home state of Louisiana, just after a press conference in which Republican congressional leaders urged Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) to vote for a GOP seven-week funding stopgap and reopen the government.

Griffon referenced slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk saying in January 2019 that a government shutdown should be used as a chance to shrink government permanently.

Johnson said “there are some good things that could come out of a shutdown, but there’s pros and cons,” the cons being the thousands of federal workers — and service members — having to work without pay, as well as the threat of food assistance programs coming to a halt and flood insurance programs lapsing.

“The pro side is is what Charlie was referring to and what I talked to the president about in the Oval Office 48 hours ago. It does give an opportunity to the power in charge, the president in charge, to make unilateral decisions that don’t need a vote of Congress about which programs in the government are essential and which are not,” Johnson said.

“Chuck Schumer — very stupidly, Moon — just walked right into that trap. He’s handed President Trump the keys to the kingdom,” Johnson said.

The Speaker said the Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has the power to make those decisions on which programs can continue or not.

“Charlie was right those years ago. It does give an opportunity to eliminate bloated, unnecessary federal programs that we would like to vote down, but we never had the votes in the Senate to do. Now we have the moment. So, very real harm to real Americans, but ultimately could be a benefit to the country for taxpayers if in this process we can get rid of some of the government fat,” Johnson said.

Vought is set to speak to House Republicans on a conference call at 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday.

The Office of Management and Budget has signaled there could be mass layoffs of federal workers in a shutdown. Vought sent a memo last week to agencies directing them, in the event of a government shutdown, to “use this opportunity to consider reduction in force (RIF) notices for all employees in programs, projects, or activities.”

Non-essential employees are typically furloughed or told to work without pay in a shutdown, and get back pay when they eventually return to work, but the memo suggests there could be permanent layoffs of nonessential employees.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/AP25272751697449-e1759180498913.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-01 19:56:42.374249

That message, from a new ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee, has been echoed by GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration in recent days.

Vice President JD Vance claimed on Fox News that the GOP's “big beautiful bill” turned off health funding for “illegal aliens.”

“Democrats want to turn it back on,” he said. “It’s not something that we made up. It’s not a talking point. It is in the text of the bill that they initially gave to us to reopen the government.”

U.S. law already prohibits unauthorized immigrants from gaining any federally subsidized health care coverage — through Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, the Children’s Health Insurance Program or otherwise. A 1996 statute established that.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Republicans are “lying” about the Democratic bill out of weakness.

“Nowhere have Democrats suggested that we're interested in changing federal law,” he said one day before the shutdown. “The question for the president is whether he's interested in protecting the health care of the American people.”

The facts

The Republican claim is highly misleading.

The Democratic bill would not change existing law barring people who are in the U.S. illegally from getting federal health care coverage.

The dispute centers around immigrants whom the federal government has decreed as “lawfully present,” but who haven't formally been given legal status that is enforceable in court.

There are an estimated 1.4 million people considered “lawfully present” in the United States — including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program beneficiaries, who came to the U.S. illegally as children; people who have Temporary Protected Status; and refugees and people seeking asylum who are still going through the legal process. Republicans are seeking to prohibit Medicaid or ACA eligibility for those groups.

They are not “undocumented” or “illegal” immigrants. The government knows who they are, and many are going through the process of seeking official legal status or green cards. Among other things, they are not unlawful border-crossers who have been flagged for deportation.

The GOP law prohibited those “lawfully present” immigrants from accessing federal health care programs. The Democratic bill would restore that access — but not for undocumented people who lack protected status — while also restoring the $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, a core goal for Democrats.

The White House defended its claim by pointing to one portion of the “big beautiful bill” that Democrats are seeking to repeal, a section called “Alien Medicaid eligibility.” That section establishes the new limitations on health care access for lawfully present immigrants (“alien” is the federal term used to describe a noncitizen).

The White House also says the Biden administration abused the immigration parole program to grant temporary entry to the U.S. for people who shouldn't have received it. But if the Trump administration revoked that parole status, those individuals would lose their eligibility for any health care coverage under the Democratic proposal.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-trump-gk-0883e4.jpg",N,,2025-10-01 15:56:40.514553

The vast majority of DHS employees will continue working under its “Procedures Relating to a Lapse in Appropriations” plan. But some key gaps could emerge under an extended shutdown, particularly at DHS’s lead cyber agency.

DHS’s plan, which was updated Sept. 30, shows 249,065 employees – more than 91% of the department’s total staff – would be retained during a shutdown, while 22,862 staff would be furloughed.

At large DHS components, most employees would either be excepted or exempted. They include Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

At FEMA, for instance, 20,975 employees out of a total 24,925 staff would be retained under a shutdown.

Many DHS component activities are deemed “necessary to protect life and property,” and therefore continue through a shutdown. Others don’t rely on annual appropriations, such as USCIS, which is mostly funded by immigration processing fees.

While most DHS frontline staff will be retained, back-office activities like planning, auditing, and other policy functions are likely to face furloughs under DHS’s plan.

DHS’s management directorate, for instance, will see significant staffing reductions. Out of the management directorate’s 3,691 onboard employees, about 1,560 would be excepted or exempted under a shutdown.

CISA to retain third of staff

Meanwhile, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will only retain about one-third of its staff during a shutdown.

DHS’s plan shows that out of 2,540 on-board staff at CISA as of May 31, 889 employees would be retained during a lapse in appropriations.

The ratio of CISA staff expected to continue working is similar to the plan published by the Biden administration last year. But since the spring, CISA has lost nearly 1,000 employees due to layoffs, deferred resignations and early retirements.

Deepak Kumar, founder and chief executive of cybersecurity firm Adaptiva, said the timing is “particularly ironic” given CISA’s “cybersecurity awareness month” starts Oct. 1.

“This year’s theme concentrates on protecting critical infrastructure, yet right as federal agencies deal with this massive change, sophisticated state actors stand ready to exploit the vast array of endpoints that make up our nation’s digital infrastructure,” Kumar noted. “Ultimately, it may be difficult to demonstrate cybersecurity awareness if our own digital security agency furloughs over half of its staff.”

CISA is also facing down the expiration of information sharing authorities under the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. The law provides liability and privacy protections to encourage industry to share cyber threat data with the government, but it expires Sept. 30.

The DHS inspector general, in a new report, said the future of CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing program is uncertain given the law’s imminent expiration.

“Without finalized plans for future AIS use, CISA may not have an automated process for sharing cyber threat information among its partners, including federal agencies and those responsible for the nation’s critical infrastructure,” the IG wrote.

The second way in which judges have reduced the impact of human rights law has been to hamper the progressive potential of the Human Rights Act.
The Human Rights Act may still be law but it is the government’s judgment of the public interest that is decisive.
This is the result of the interaction between the European convention, the Strasbourg case law, the Human Rights Act and the case law underpinning it.
But they are doing everything short of that to make human rights as much of a domestic legal irrelevance as possible.","It is extraordinary​ that the UK Supreme Court’s recent decision on the rights of trans people in For Women Scotland v. The Scottish Ministers completely ignores the impact of human rights law. The privacy rights of those who identify as having a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth have been jettisoned as a result of the court’s determination that the gender they thought they had left behind should be reimposed by legal diktat. There are reams of cases concerning trans people’s rights, both at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and domestically. The incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law through the Human Rights Act of 1998 means that the relevant legislation – the Equality Act 2010 – should have been read to assure compatibility with the convention if at all possible. But this wasn’t even attempted. Instead, the court concluded that ‘sex’ in the Equality Act means ‘biological sex’. Two trans people applied to intervene (Professor Stephen Whittle and Victoria McCloud, a former judge), hoping to give a sense of what the case might mean for individuals in their situation, but only Amnesty International was given the opportunity to make the human rights argument, and its perspective was dismissed in a single paragraph of the 268-paragraph judgment. (McCloud is taking the UK to the European Court of Human Rights over the court’s failure to allow the transgender voice to be heard.) Similarly, in Fearn v. Tate Galleries from early 2023 – where local residents managed to close down a viewing platform at Tate Modern that overlooked their block of flats because they found it intrusive – human rights law was ignored in favour of the antiquated judge-made law of nuisance. Reliance on the residents’ privacy rights was ‘an unnecessary complication and distraction’, according to Lord Leggatt, the lead judge in the majority.

The Supreme Court is quietly editing the Human Rights Act out of existence. In cases where human rights cannot be ignored entirely, such as For Women Scotland and Fearn, new modes of reasoning are being used to ensure that the law under scrutiny cannot be found in breach of human rights. This trend has gathered pace since I wrote about it in the LRB of 27 January 2022. I concentrated there on the court’s powerful president, Lord Reed, and he remains by far the most important influence, but other justices have joined in: Reed led in neither of the cases just mentioned. None of this is being done in secret – the judgments are public – but the changes have barely registered. Judges, whether serving or retired, tend not to speak out. Barristers know on which side their bread is buttered. Few legal scholars have discussed these very recent developments. In a speech at Inner Temple in June this year, Reed suggested that ‘responsible criticism’ of judicial decisions should not be dismissed. Maybe the court is right to withdraw the judges from considering human rights. Maybe it is wrong. But it should at least be noticed.

Three main devices are being deployed to reduce human rights law’s impact in cases where the judges believe it has to be directly addressed. The first is a legal concept, known as the ‘margin of appreciation’, which the European Court of Human Rights uses to measure compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights in cases brought by claimants against member states. It is intended to give states some latitude in the way they give effect to convention rights, often to the point of making these rights practically unsustainable. After the Human Rights Act came into force in 2000, the generally accepted view was that the ‘margin of appreciation’ had no direct application in domestic law: British judges should focus instead on whether whatever it was they were being asked to do was within their remit, the sort of thing that judges (as opposed to civil servants or elected representatives) should be doing. In a case in 2004 arising from the war on terror, A (FC) and Others (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Lord Bingham, the senior judge on the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (the forerunner to today’s Supreme Court), wrote that judges’ actions should be guided by the ‘relative institutional competence’ of the courts as compared to the other two branches of state. The ‘appropriate respect’ owed by the courts to the executive and legislature was another favourite formula. Lady Hale wrote in 2008 that ‘the doctrine of the “margin of appreciation” as applied in Strasbourg has no application in domestic law.’ One of her colleagues, Lord Mance, saw it as merely a ‘principle which distributes responsibility between the international and national levels’.

Now reconceptualised by Reed and his colleagues as a domestic principle of judicial deference, the ‘margin of appreciation’ is being used to insulate governments and legislatures from scrutiny of their human rights’ compliance. There is still a show of judicial oversight, an assertion that serious abuse by Parliament or the executive will be rolled back. But litigants have to show something special to exclude themselves from the deference the courts now show the other branches of state. And if they are challenging welfare, benefit or pension decisions (which could affect their family or property rights or their right not to be discriminated against), the chances of victory are vanishingly small. These are ‘complex issues and choices of social strategy’, the judges now like to say, and to establish that your rights have been infringed you have to show that the policy affecting you adversely is ‘manifestly without reasonable foundation’.

A case from Northern Ireland, decided by the Supreme Court early this year, shows the extent of the changes that have taken place. In the matter of an application for Judicial Review by JR 123 concerns the 1978 Rehabilitation of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order. The appellant in this case was released from prison in 1982 and had not reoffended, but still had to disclose his conviction because of the length of his sentence. UK human rights cases used to focus, as this appellant’s lawyers did, on the impact of mechanisms like this order on the privacy rights of individuals under Article 8, which provides that ‘everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life.’ Should offenders be rehabilitated – their convictions treated as ‘spent’ and no longer needing to be declared – or at least given the chance to argue that their names be removed? A decision by the Supreme Court in 2010 had held that a scheme which kept people indefinitely on the sex abuse register with no chance of having their names deleted was a breach of their convention rights. In that case the individuals had gone before the court and told their stories. Change resulted.

In JR 123 the Supreme Court focused not on the appellant’s history but on an analysis of the rules, and used the ‘margin of appreciation’ to protect the 1978 rehabilitation order from scrutiny by the court: there was, the judgment stated, ‘a wide margin of appreciation for the legislator in the present context’. Hiding an individual’s past raised ‘difficult and sensitive questions’ that called for ‘judgments to be made about social policy, involving questions of moral and political judgment’ that were ‘very much the province of the legislature’. This case shows that the concept of judicial deference is now being applied in cases beyond those dealing with tax, pensions and the like. It is glossed as being merely a new way of describing well-established principles of domestic law. But it is a very particular version of British constitutional law, which ignores the more activist aspects of the case law from the years before the Human Rights Act. The judicial restraint of earlier eras – stretching back to the 1930s and continuing through to the mid-1960s – has been made part of human rights law under cover of a contentious reading of a concept that was until very recently thought to have no role in domestic law.

The second way in which judges have reduced the impact of human rights law has been to hamper the progressive potential of the Human Rights Act. The drafters of the Act intended it to be a bill of rights for Britain, with convention rights becoming the basis for the growth of a British tradition of rights protection. The White Paper said the measure would mean that ‘our judges will be able to contribute to [the] dynamic and evolving interpretation of the convention.’ During debates on the legislation the then home secretary, Jack Straw, and the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, made clear that, as Hale put it in an early case reflecting this orthodoxy, ‘the courts must be free to develop human rights jurisprudence and to move out in new directions.’ In an important case from 2008, re P, Mance wrote that ‘the interpretation and impact’ of the domestic rights set out in the Human Rights Act depend on the 1998 Act as they are now undoubtedly ‘part of this country’s laws’. Bingham declared in another early case that ‘it is of course open to member states to provide for rights more generous than those guaranteed by the convention.’ A question flowing from this was whether domestic courts could break fresh ground in areas left open to them by Strasbourg’s cautious use of the ‘margin of appreciation’ in specific areas, and the answer from the early cases was that this was entirely possible, indeed part of the Act’s design.

Reed’s court has now taken a sledgehammer to this position, ignoring the clear intention of the promoters of the legislation and refusing to follow the Supreme Court’s earlier guidance on the matter. The point was initially addressed in R (on the application of SC, CB and Eight Children) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, a case concerning the two-child limit on child benefits, heard early in the Reed presidency, in which the court refused to develop domestic rights in a way that could encompass a fuller understanding of children’s rights. In the judgment R (AB) v. Secretary of State for Justice handed down on the same day as SC, also unanimous, also a single judgment written by Reed, the point was hammered home: ‘It is not the function of our domestic courts to establish new principles of convention law.’ A later case (also Reed; also unanimous), R (Elan-Cane) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, saw off re P and the earlier authorities in brutal fashion. There was nothing authoritative, this judgment says, about the earlier cases’ commitment to developing convention rights domestically. The comments in re P supporting this were, ‘it was reasonably clear,’ no more than obiter – not key to the decision the judges had to make, and thus not required to be followed. In any case, the judges’ position had been based on a misunderstanding: ‘The courts’ role in lawmaking is confined to the development of the common law.’

Third, a recent group of cases prevents litigants from being able to challenge in advance general rules that will clearly infringe the rights of many people, even if they have not yet done so. The importance of being able to challenge a law with a manifestly debilitating rights impact is obvious if you see human rights as a framework that should shape executive and legislative action and not merely as a lever employed to address past harms: if a rule likely to infringe human rights is in the offing, why wait until the worst happens? Though the issue was never definitively settled, judges in the first years after the passing of the Human Rights Act generally thought it should be possible to mount a successful challenge if the legislation could be shown to have negative human rights implications in a ‘legally significant number of cases’. An alternative test held that a breach would have to be likely in ‘all or nearly all’ cases, which would effectively insulate rules from abstract challenge. Litigants would have to wait until the rule was deployed against them, and often, particularly where immigration is concerned, they would be unlikely to have the funds to contrive the decision against them – by, for example, forking out to apply for the visa they are bound to be denied.

The ‘all or nearly all’ test has now been firmly embedded in the law as a result of two recent and unanimous Supreme Court judgments, Reference by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland – Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Northern Ireland) Bill and JR 123. The first of these concerned a measure passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly that criminalised certain kinds of behaviour in designated zones around abortion clinics. A Supreme Court composed of seven members (the number used in significant cases) found that the proposed law did not breach the convention. The single judgment in the case was yet again written by Reed. The proposed legislation, involving important issues related to protest and safety, was found perfectly capable of surviving scrutiny if it could be shown that it would not infringe convention rights in ‘all or nearly all’ of the situations to which it was applied. This was an outcome made all the more likely when the margin of appreciation was taken into account. The alternative test – a breach in ‘a legally significant number of cases’ – should not be used, Reed said, claiming that Hale’s assessment in an earlier case ‘did not state the test accurately’.

JR 123 was, as I have mentioned already, a case involving the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order, which organises its clemency according to the crime committed and the seriousness of the sentence. The scale is a sliding one, but for some offences and any sentences longer than thirty months there is no provision for rehabilitation. General measures, the court found, ‘served to promote legal certainty and to avoid the problems of arbitrariness and inconsistency inherent in weighing, on a case by case basis’ every individual application for exemption that might be launched. The rehabilitation of offenders was ‘obviously a context in which it [was] legitimate for a state to enact a regime in the form of a general measure, announcing in advance clear, generally applicable rules to cover all cases’. It was ‘desirable that society as a whole and offenders themselves should be able to understand clearly how the rehabilitation regime operates and that the scope for arbitrariness in its application should be minimised’. Even the European Court of Human Rights had stated that the ‘more convincing the general justifications for the general measure are, the less importance the court will attach to its impact in the particular case’. The Human Rights Act may still be law but it is the government’s judgment of the public interest that is decisive.

There​ are further indications that the Supreme Court’s approach to human rights has changed. Restrictive rules on standing – sufficient involvement to have the legal right to challenge a decision – inhibit public interest groups from using the Act. Interventions by people not directly involved in a case are increasingly unlikely to be allowed, as Whittle and McCloud found to their cost in For Women Scotland. A decision reached in 2021, DPP v. Ziegler, in which Reed did not participate and which appeared to offer political protesters the chance to argue that their ostensibly criminal actions were not ‘unreasonable’, as the judge in the magistrates’ court put it, was the subject of a ferocious attack by Reed in the Safe Access Zones case the following year (Ziegler concerned protesters who had blocked an entrance to an arms fair). In its judgment in DPP v. Cuciurean in 2022 the High Court had already rowed back on the decision in Ziegler that protesters could argue that a criminal conviction would be disproportionate if the offence was one where it is a defence to have a ‘lawful excuse’. It is only a matter of time before the decision is pared back or discarded.

Dissenting judgments have become vanishingly rare in the field of human rights law. Even separate judgments, stating a difference of opinion on some aspect of a case while agreeing with the overall outcome, are now highly unusual. One of the last dissents was by Reed himself during Hale’s presidency of the Supreme Court. It concerned the court’s refusal to follow Strasbourg authority in R v. Hallam (2019), a case concerning compensation for victims of miscarriages of justice. It may seem surprising that Reed dissented in a case in which the Supreme Court was trying to sidestep Strasbourg authority. In fact, that judgment – and another decided early this year – are key to understanding his motivation. In R v. Hallam (2019) Reed subjected the Strasbourg case law to an intense examination on an important but technical part of criminal justice law, leading to a conclusion which was at odds with the one reached by the majority of his colleagues, but so exceptional is Reed’s analytical prowess that it had an air of inevitability about it. He did the same in the SC child benefits case in 2021, contriving an outcome unwelcome to the claimants out of the Strasbourg precedents on which they had relied. Although he is Scottish, Reed is a champion of the English common law, a believer in precedent and the stability it delivers. This loyalty to authority extends to the Strasbourg court, which despite the merely directive language of Section 2 of the Human Rights Act, is in Reed’s view to be followed except in the rarest of cases.

In Abbasi v. Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Haastrup v. King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, decided just before For Women Scotland, the central issue was how much control there should be over information released about legal proceedings involving end-of-life decisions related to young children, a matter which had already generated great division and litigation in the lower courts. The issue was resolved in a subtle way by a (once again) unanimous court with Reed (once again) giving the main judgment, on this occasion jointly with Lord Briggs. The resolution of a side-issue gives further clues about Reed’s approach to litigation in general and human rights litigation in particular. What should be the position of clinicians in a hospital when applications are made to set aside restrictions on public information after the death of the child concerned? Reed and Briggs shared a concern that if these doctors’ names were revealed they would receive a torrent of abuse from distraught family members and others. (A rare concurring judgment, from Lord Sales, focused on the need to show special solicitude to clinicians.) But, allowing for the occasional exceptional case, the court was clear that the doctors should launch their own legal actions. They should become proper parties and not piggyback on the interest their hospital had once had. Litigation is about those with a direct interest in a case fighting it out, one-on-one, unassisted by intervening parties, even when, as in this case, they are large organisations with deeper pockets and greater institutional clout than the litigant.

In Abbasi the court acknowledged the reception into the common law of a new tort rooted in the misuse of private information, possibly amounting to the invasion of privacy. This would once have been seen for what it was, a change to UK law achieved by the convention – specifically, by the privacy right under Article 8 – but in the Abbasi judgment it is presented as a piece of domestic creativity, albeit driven by the convention. In recent times, according to Reed and Briggs,

the courts have been willing to develop the common law when necessary in order to meet the requirements of the convention, and have deprecated the tendency in some earlier cases to see the law solely in terms of the convention itself … In particular, the common law has evolved to provide a cause of action protecting rights relating to privacy.

The​ current members of the Supreme Court, ten men and two women, all of them white, seem to regard the Human Rights Act as an unwelcome remnant of a past era. One of the clearest intentions of the drafters of the Human Rights Act and the legislators who enacted the measure was that it should include private bodies exercising public functions – Section 6 of the Act was explicit about this, and an early conservative reading by the courts was greatly narrowed by legislative amendment. But a recent decision by the High Court, Sammut v. Next Steps Mental Healthcare Ltd, has sought to resurrect that early reading to protect for-profit businesses operating in the public sector from exposure to human rights accountability. The case (in which I was counsel on the losing side) involved the protection of a private commercial entity from human rights scrutiny concerning its treatment of a young man who was in its care under various statutory provisions and whose costs were being met by the local authority. My client died, and the company was held to be negligent. But it escaped scrutiny on a host of wider matters as a result of being effectively accorded judicial immunity from accountability on human rights issues.

The current Supreme Court may even be tempted to dispose of the sacred cow at the heart of human rights litigation, the power under Section 3 of the Act, supported by many cases from the pre-Reed court, to reconstruct legislation in order to ensure its compatibility with convention rights. There is a legitimate point here about the uncertainty created by radical judicial changes to legislation which do not appear on the statutory record, and Reed and his colleagues might well make much of this if the opportunity arises. But their approach means that at the moment there are no apparent breaches of human rights to consider.

In his Inner Temple speech, Reed said that the courts have been ‘more attentive to the separation of powers’ than in the past but that earlier ‘more ambitious decisions and dicta … have not been forgotten.’ Will this defanging protect human rights law from hostile attention from its political opponents? The answer is almost certainly not: Reed and his colleagues can prevent new controversies but they cannot undo what the convention and its application in domestic law have already achieved. This is the result of the interaction between the European convention, the Strasbourg case law, the Human Rights Act and the case law underpinning it. You cannot throw foreigners out of the country if they face a serious risk of a breach of their right to life or their right not to be tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in the place you plan to send them. You have to take account of someone’s family life when you consider removing them, especially if they have children who have been born and brought up here. If you plan on doing any of this, it can be stopped by interim order of either the Strasbourg or local courts. To get rid of such obstacles, it would be necessary to repeal the Human Rights Act, and also – to ensure that you won’t be liable at the international level – to leave the Council of Europe, joining Belarus and Russia in their denial of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights. You would then need to pass special laws allowing people to be sent to near certain death, after being treated with a harshness that is explicitly inhuman or degrading.

That truly would be taking back control. It is where domestic politics may end up. If Keir Starmer’s government were to repeal the Human Rights Act we would be back to the endless quarrelling with Strasbourg that was a feature of the pre-Blair years, with Thatcher berating foreign judges for getting it wrong. It was the nonsense of the ECHR hearing argument on issues on which British courts could not volunteer an opinion that led judges like Bingham to favour incorporation of the convention; this was the reason Blair in opposition labelled his plan ‘Bringing Rights Home’. Domestic judges cannot undo the case law of the Strasbourg court that so irritates a section of the political class and its journalist outriders. But they are doing everything short of that to make human rights as much of a domestic legal irrelevance as possible.",https://www.lrb.co.uk/storage/social_image_on_bg/images/2/5/4/7/30827452-1-eng-GB/3fae20fda61b-lrb-4718-cover.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 20:58:10.935722

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is shutting down rumors about changes to the country’s immigration and border policies amid the government shutdown.

The shutdown has left many Americans wondering what government services would be suspended. ICE worked to quash speculation that the funding dispute would prevent its agents from carrying out their duties.

""Rumors that a U.S. government shutdown will allow illegal immigrants to enter the United States are FALSE,"" ICE wrote in a post on X. ""U.S. immigration laws and enforcement efforts remain unchanged. Border security and enforcement efforts remain strict, and crossing the border without authorization remains a crime.""

The post also included a graphic that reads, ""During a government shutdown, the U.S. will defend its borders.""

GOVERNMENT SHUTS DOWN AFTER CONGRESS DEADLOCKS ON SPENDING DEAL

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also wrote on social media confirming that law enforcement officers in her department would continue to work during the shutdown.

""Our [Department of Homeland Security] law enforcement officers will continue to work throughout the Democrats’ Shutdown to make sure our homeland is safe and secure. More than 200,000 of these patriots will go without pay,"" Noem said on Tuesday.

""The Democrats will be forcing over 150,000 officers and nearly 50,000 members of the military—our frontline of defense—to continue protecting our nation without pay,"" she added.

While law enforcement officials will go without pay during the shutdown, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires all essential and furloughed employees to receive retroactive pay once it ends.

DEMS IN HOT SEAT AFTER DHS WARNS THEIR FRONTLINE WORKERS WILL GO WITHOUT PAY IF SHUTDOWN HITS

After lawmakers failed to reach an agreement by the midnight funding deadline, the government entered a shutdown on Wednesday.

Senate Republicans attempted to pass a short-term extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 government funding levels, which was sunk by Democrats who were furious about being sidelined in shutdown negotiations. The bill would have given Congress until Nov. 21 to set FY 2026 funding priorities. The Senate is expected to vote again on Wednesday, with more votes to come until either a deal is struck or Democrats relent.

In its overhauled form, over 1,200 agencies can find the citizenship or immigration status of an individual by searching their Social Security number.
“States such as Virginia, Louisiana and Texas are doing exactly that, imperiling the right to vote of naturalized citizens and others for whom SSA maintains outdated and inaccurate citizenship data,” the coalition says.","WASHINGTON (CN) — A coalition of voting rights groups filed a class action against the Trump administration Tuesday over its creation of a searchable national citizenship database, likening it to the dossiers the fictional Oceania kept on citizens in George Orwell’s “1984.”

The League of Women Voters — joined by chapters in Virginia and Louisiana as well as the Electronic Privacy Information Center — argue in the suit that the expansion of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements tool into a national data pool violates the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Constitution.

The coalition is urging a federal judge to declare the government’s actions unlawful, block administration officials from continuing to operate the database, order the erasure of all misappropriated data and publish notices in the Federal Register disclosing details of the illegal data collection.

According to the plaintiffs in their 66-page lawsuit, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Government Efficiency have engaged in a months-long process to “access, collect and consolidate” troves of personal data on millions of U.S. citizens and residents.

Such data was held by agencies like USCIS, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, the IRS, the Department of Labor and several states’ election databases.

DOGE’s efforts to access the data troves were quickly challenged in court early in the Trump administration, and while several federal judges expressed concern regarding the data’s potential use, they ultimately denied requests to block DOGE’s access.

“Defendants’ goal is to create a web of linked data systems that allow centralized queries and analyses of millions of Americans’ most sensitive information,” the coalition wrote. “Defendants seek to unify data across the government to advance Trump administration priorities, including making it harder to vote, and ensuring that every contact between immigrants (regardless of their legal status) and government databases can be leveraged to support the administration’s agenda.”

The USCIS tool, also known as SAVE, was created in 1986 to allow federal, state, local or tribal governments to search an individual’s immigration and nationality status to determine their eligibility for a public benefit, a license or grant, a government credential, or to assist in a background check.

The coalition says that the administration transformed the SAVE tool by drawing on the Social Security Administration’s system of records and DHS systems of records the SAVE tool had previously accessed. In its overhauled form, over 1,200 agencies can find the citizenship or immigration status of an individual by searching their Social Security number.

Another concern is the fact that the Social Security Administration has admitted that its citizenship data — particularly for naturalized citizens and U.S.-born citizens born before 1981 — is incomplete, unreliable and not “definitive.”

The coalition argues that the Trump administration has encouraged states to use the unreliable data to begin purging voter rolls before the looming midterm elections this November, and to open criminal investigations of purported noncitizen voting.

“States such as Virginia, Louisiana and Texas are doing exactly that, imperiling the right to vote of naturalized citizens and others for whom SSA maintains outdated and inaccurate citizenship data,” the coalition says.

In addition to the SAVE tool, the Trump administration created another “Interagency Data System” that consolidates other governmental data sources that may have information concerning immigrants into a centralized “data lake” at USCIS, which includes millions of Americans’ Social Security numbers, biometric data, tax information, employment and medical records, among others.

Beyond potentially violating Americans’ privacy rights, the coalition argues, the data pools also create significant cybersecurity risks by “draw[ing] a bullseye for hackers” to target individuals’ previously protected sensitive information.

The lawsuit includes five pseudonymous plaintiffs who have been incorporated into the databases — including J. Doe 1, a university professor in Texas and a naturalized citizen, has had their Social Security information incorporated into the SAVE system despite inaccurately stating they are not a U.S. citizen.

The coalition is seeking a wider class of millions of citizens and permanent residents whose records have been “unlawfully pooled into new or revised centralized records systems at DHS,” as well as organizations whose members have had their data collected.

Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters slammed the data collection as an effort to illegally abuse historically disenfranchised communities in a statement announcing the suit.

“The federal government’s secretive and unlawful collection and consolidation of Americans’ personal data is a clear example of the constitutional crisis we are living through,” Stewart said. “Our federal government is abusing its power to access American’s personal information, and several states are using that private data to harm voters and our individual right to privacy.”

Some homebuyers could experience delays in closing, analyst says

Roberto Schmidt | AFP | Getty Images

Homebuyers who need specific mortgages through the Federal Housing Administration, Veteran Affairs, and U.S. Department of Agriculture loans could experience delays during the shutdown, said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.

However, buyers applying for government-backed mortgages via Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should not be affected by the shutdown, Rossman said.

Those who need flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program can also ""expect delays in closing,"" said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage.

The NFIP's authority to issue new policies has lapsed, complicating about 1,400 property transactions each day and leaving buyers in high-risk areas without flood insurance coverage, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Existing flood insurance policies will remain active, including a 30-day grace period, and can be transferred to new owners, according to the NAR.

NFIP claims will continue to be paid, but for how long will depend on the shutdown's duration, NAR said.

During shutdown, mortgage rates may fall, flood insurance claim payouts will continue

Mario Tama | Getty Images

The biggest immediate housing impact from the government shutdown will be on mortgage rates.

Mortgage rates loosely follow the 10-year treasury, which dropped today, so rates could come down. That would be a change from recent mortgage rates, which were just at a three-week high.

The National Flood Insurance Program will also be affected. The program will continue to pay out claims for existing policyholders, but it won't write new policies or renew existing policies. A lapse would affect about 1,300 property sales per day, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Despite the delay, the home sales are expected to eventually close when the shutdown lifts.

The Federal Housing Administration's mortgage program, which provides low-down-payment loans to borrowers with lower credit scores, will still operate to endorse new single-family mortgages, but likely at reduced capacity, slowing the process for borrowers. It'll be the same for mortgage loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

The exception will be for products such as home equity conversion mortgages and Title I loans. Critical FHA operations such as claim payments, mortgage servicing, loss mitigation, and REO property management will continue. Activities requiring direct staff input, such as some condo project approvals, are suspended, according to the National Association of Realtors.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans, and any scheduled direct‑loan closings will be postponed. Pending conditional commitments for guaranteed loans are still being reviewed, but closings for guaranteed loans that do not yet have a guarantee will proceed only at the lender's risk. Disbursements on existing construction loans may continue, but only when doing so is necessary to protect USDA's property interests, according to the National Association of Realtors.

What's open, closed and otherwise affected by the shutdown

Joe Raedle | Getty Images

The federal government's shutdown prompted agencies to temporarily stop or limit some services, leaving Americans wondering what's being affected.

Here's a list detailing immediate shutdown impact:

Mail services: The U.S. Postal Service said its services would not be interrupted by a shutdown. All post offices will remain open, the USPS said.

Nutritional programs: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — also referred to as SNAP or food stamps — will continue running, according to the Department of Agriculture. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, will also keep going. Notably, the department said the programs' continuation is ""subject to the availability of funding.""

Public health care: Medicare will continue to perform its full services, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency also said that it expects to have ""sufficient funding"" for Medicaid for the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year.

Courts: The U.S. court website said the judiciary will remain open with paid operations through Oct. 17. Most proceedings and deadlines are expected to take place as scheduled.

Banks: Private banks should be unaffected by the shutdown.

Economic data: The Labor Department said economic data will not be collected or published during the shutdown. That means previously expected releases, such as Friday's nonfarm payroll report, will not come out as scheduled.

National parks and monuments: National parks will be partially open, according to the Interior Department. Open-air sites and memorials would be available to visit, but buildings that need staffing will shutter.

Student loans: Federal student loans still need to be paid. However, applications for loan forgiveness to the Department of Education are expected to see further delays as a result of the shutdown. The department said it would furlough around 95% of its non-Federal Student Aid staff for the first week of the shutdown.

Social Security: Social Security and Supplemental Security Income payments will continue as expected, according to the Social Security Administration. Local offices will remain open but offer reduced services.

Schools and libraries: Schools and colleges tend to see little impact on day-to-day operations during short-term government shutdowns. However, the Library of Congress said all buildings will be closed and public events canceled.

Military: Most military operations and veterans benefits will continue, though worker pay is delayed during a shutdown, according to the Department of Defense. No new orders can be issued outside of extenuating circumstances.

Air travel: Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers will keep working, but without pay. The Department of Transportation will stop hiring for a variety of roles related to aviation safety.

Rail travel: Amtrak told CNBC it will continue ""normal operation"" of its passenger rail network.

Vance: 'We are going to have to lay some people off if the shutdown continues'

Kevin Lamarque | Reuters

""We are going to have to lay some people off if the shutdown continues,"" Vice President JD Vance said.

""We don't like that,"" Vance said at a White House press briefing. ""We don't necessarily want to do it, but we're going to do what we have to keep the American people's essential services continuing to run.""

Asked why the Trump administration is forecasting layoffs when prior shutdowns have not led to that outcome, Vance said, ""We haven't made any final decisions.""

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought told House Republicans during a conference call that the Trump administration will carry out reductions in force among federal workers in one or two days, according to a person familiar with the matter.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed during the briefing that she expected layoffs to begin ""very soon,"" possibly within ""two days.""

Vought also said that the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program will run out of funding by next week if the government remains shut.

White House ratchets up pressure on Democrats over health care demands

Kevin Lamarque | Reuters

The White House ratcheted up the pressure — and the blame — on Democrats during a press briefing more than 13 hours into the shutdown, urging them to abandon key demands.

Vice President JD Vance said in a White House press briefing that policy disagreements should not ""serve as the basis for a government shutdown.""

He and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt zeroed in on the standoff over health care, doubling down on their claims that Democrats want to give health care to ""illegal immigrants.""

Federal law prohibits funding health care for undocumented immigrants, and Democrats are not advocating for such a move.

Democrats say they want to restore health care coverage options that were available to some immigrants before Trump's ""One Big Beautiful"" tax bill earlier this year.

This has been a key sticking point in the impasse.

""I think it's important to bracket the health care policy conversation, because it's separate from the government shutdown,"" Vance said.

""We think that we can open the government and then have the conversation about what best health care policy to fit the needs of the American people.""

Shutdown shouldn't affect long-term rating, Fitch says

Fitch Ratings said Wednesday that the shutdown should not affect U.S. credit ratings.

""The U.S. government shutdown does not have near-term implications for the 'AA+'/Stable U.S. sovereign rating,"" the U.S. credit ratings firm said in a press release.

However, Fitch said the shutdown ""highlights long-standing policymaking weaknesses and political brinkmanship around budgetary issues.""

Fitch downgraded the U.S. long-term credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2023, citing expectations for ""fiscal deterioration"" and instances of ""political standoffs.""

SEC has 'very limited' staff during shutdown

Andrew Kelly | Reuters

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has ""very limited"" staff available to respond to emergency situations, according to a message on its website.

The agency's electronic data-gathering system, known as EDGAR, will continue to operate, the message said.

That program, which stands for the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system, is the SEC's free public database of filings from publicly traded companies, mutual funds, ETFs and other entities that report to the SEC.

The SEC's website message noted that the agency ""has staff available to respond to emergency situations with a focus on the market integrity and investor protection components of our mission.""

Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, in a statement said that the SEC ""has furloughed 91 percent of its staff, leaving financial markets and investors at great risk at a time when strong oversight is needed most.""

Banks and their regulators are operating normally in shutdown, but SBA loans grind to halt

Kena Betancur | Corbis News | Getty Images

Banks and most credit unions are open and operating normally during the government shutdown, as are their main regulators, people with knowledge of the situation told CNBC.

Banks are private companies, and their regulators, including the Federal Reserve and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, aren't subject to the annual appropriations process, said these people, who declined to be identified speaking about the shutdown.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is funded by member banks, so the industry's deposit insurance shouldn't be disrupted, either.

JPMorgan Chase , the nation's largest bank, is ""continuing normal operations,"" a company spokesman said.

While the National Credit Union Administration, which insures credit union deposits, said it remains open, it did warn of possible ""service interruptions"" to credit union offices that are located on federal property.

That warning was echoed by the main credit union trade group: ""Credit unions that have branches in government buildings or on federal property may experience service interruptions.""

That could compound issues faced by federal employees and servicemembers who are no longer being paid during the shutdown, the trade group said.

Another area of possible disruption: Small business owners seeking federally backed loans might not be able to apply for them.

The Small Business Administration, which partners with banks to offer the guaranteed loans, said that the shutdown is ""stopping an estimated 320 small businesses from accessing $170 million in SBA-guaranteed funding"" every day.

Senate again rejects House GOP funding bill

The Senate again rejected House Republicans' stopgap funding bill, prolonging the shutdown with no end in sight.

It was the second time in less than 24 hours that lawmakers in the Senate voted on the continuing resolution, which would fund the government through Nov. 21.

The measure did not advance in a 55-45 vote, the same outcome as Tuesday night. It needed 60 votes to advance.

The vote largely fell along party lines, but as was the case on Tuesday, Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine, voted with Republicans in support of the measure.

Federal student loan borrowers' application backlogs to worsen during shutdown

Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty Images

Federal student loan borrowers have already struggled with accessing repayment plans and debt forgiveness under the Trump administration. The shutdown will likely make things worse.

More than a million borrowers are in a backlog to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, or IDR, the Trump administration revealed in court records last month.

Meanwhile, 74,510 people are waiting for a determination from the U.S. Department of Education on their Public Service Loan Forgiveness status, the court records show.

During the shutdown, Federal Student Aid staff ""will not be able to perform regular operations, including working on the IDR backlog,"" a spokesperson for the Education Department told CNBC.

However, an Education Department memo notes, ""borrowers are expected to continue repayment throughout a shutdown.""

Lawmakers continue to get paid during government shutdown

Nathan Howard | Reuters

Members of Congress will still get paid during the shutdown. Their staffers may not be so lucky.

Their salaries are protected under Article I of the Constitution, which states, ""The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.""

The people who work for them, however, do not have those protections. Lawmakers can decide for themselves which of their staff members are essential and can continue to work.

The Capitol Visitors Center is closed, and there are no tours. Janitor service is discontinued.

The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 guarantees back pay for all federal employees, regardless of their work status during the shutdown.

Most members of Congress receive an annual salary of $174,000.

Schumer: Republicans tried to 'bully' Democrats into voting for legislation to avert shutdown

Jonathan Ernst | Reuters

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans ""tried to bully"" Democrats into voting for the short-term resolution to fund the government.

""And it's clear they can't, they don't have the votes,"" he said from the Senate floor, hours after the shutdown took effect.

""Donald Trump and Republicans have barreled us into a shutdown because they refuse to protect Americans' health care,"" he said.

Schumer and his Democratic colleagues have remained dug in on demands that any legislation to fund the government includes health care provisions, specifically codifying an extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits, currently due to expire at the end of the year.

Republicans, however, insist that such discussions should not happen during the current funding negotiations.

ACA health premiums will spike if enhanced tax credits expire, study says

Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty Images

A new analysis found that average premiums for health insurance purchased through the Affordable Care Act marketplace will more than double in 2026, if the enhanced tax credits that make such health plans cheaper are allowed to expire at year's end.

If those subsidies lapse, recipients would see their premiums increase to $1,906 from $888, on average — a 114% increase, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.

Democrats are demanding that any deal to end the shutdown include an extension of the ACA subsidies, known as ""premium tax credits.""

Democrats enhanced the credits as part of a 2021 pandemic relief law and did so again in 2022 on a temporary basis. The enhanced subsidies made health premiums cheaper and expanded the number of households eligible for them.

About 22 million Americans receive the enhanced subsidies.

College-bound students and their families can still apply for financial aid during the shutdown through the government's Free Application for Federal Student Aid form.

But the Department of Education warned that information on its website ""may not be maintained, and inquiries may not receive a response"" while the government remains unfunded.

The 2026 FAFSA filing season officially opened last week. Many families heavily rely on financial aid to help cover the cost of college, and experts often recommend filing for aid as early as possible.

What could push politicians to end the shutdown?

Al Drago | Getty Images

To predict what factors might ultimately push politicians to bring the current shutdown to an end, Wall Street analysts are looking to the past.

Citi's Daniel Tobon wrote in a client note that the last shutdown, which began in late 2018 during Trump's first term, was resolved partly due to frustration over increasing delays at airports.

Raymond James analyst Ed Mills specifically pointed to the temporary shutdown of operations at New York's LaGuardia Airport in 2019 as a crisis that forced politicians' hands.

Furloughed federal workers going without a second paycheck during that shutdown also added to pressure, Tobon said.

This time around, partial funding lapses for Defense Department staff are generating concerns around military pay, Mills noted.

Evercore ISI strategist Sarah Bianchi said federal worker layoffs could push Democrats to acquiesce.

""During the shutdown, the press will be writing on a whole array of local shutdown-related disruptions, from longer-than-usual TSA lines at airports to towns that depend economically on nearby national parks being open,"" Bianchi wrote to clients Tuesday.

""If any of these stories go viral, it could shape the national narrative and push both sides to compromise sooner.""

Senate GOP leaders say Democrats 'wanted' shutdown as partisan blame game deepens

watch now

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he hopes that Senate Democrats ""come to their senses soon"" and vote for the GOP's continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government.

""The longer this goes on, the more pain will be inflicted,"" he said during a news conference Wednesday morning alongside other Republican leaders.

""Every single bit of this was entirely avoidable,"" Johnson said.

Johnson and other GOP leaders repeatedly put the onus on Democrats for the shutdown.

""Democrats want to play the emotional games with the lives and the likelihood of Americans,"" Johnson said.

""Unfortunately, we are here this morning, in a government shutdown that Democrats wanted,"" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said at the presser.

""This could have been avoided,"" Thune added.

Both parties have blamed each other for the shutdown, underscoring the partisan gridlock that has stalled negotiations.

U.S. health agency employees face mass furloughs

Kayla Bartkowski | Getty Images

The Department of Health and Human Services said in its contingency plan that it expects more than 32,000 of its almost 80,000 staff to be furloughed during the shutdown.

The agency oversees the federal health agencies responsible for tracking disease outbreaks, approving new drugs and funding scientific research, among other efforts critical to public health. That includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.

HHS said some activities will continue, such as the ability to respond to pandemics, flu and hurricanes and to monitor disease outbreaks. The NIH will also continue research and clinical services necessary to protect human life and government property.

But HHS said research contracts and grants to external organizations, such as universities, will freeze during the shutdown. The NIH will not admit new patients to its research hospital unless medically necessary, while the CDC will be ""hampered"" in its ability to provide the public with health-related information, HHS said.

The FDA will not process new drug applications and medical device submissions, or support staff that work to protect patients from unsafe or ineffective drugs, unless it is an imminent threat. The FDA also won't be able to monitor the use of new ingredients in animal food, preventing the agency from ensuring that meat, milk and eggs of livestock are safe for the public to eat.

What CNBC’s No. 1 financial advisor is telling clients about the shutdown

John Mullen, president and CEO of Parsons Capital Management — which ranked No. 1 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 for 2025, a list of the top 100 financial advisors in the U.S. — said he has viewed previous government shutdowns mostly as ""short-term blips.""

""Very rarely does it have some sort of lasting impact,"" Mullen told CNBC in an interview Wednesday morning.

He said the firm's investment approach reflects a longer-term view. ""In general, we don't think this is going to disrupt the major trends that we've identified and are enthusiastic about,"" he said.

Those trends include artificial intelligence, quantum computing and the companies poised to benefit from a broader deregulation push, he said.

Still, this shutdown could be riskier because of the Trump administration's threat to make some federal government furloughs permanent.

""If the government does follow through on plans to fire workers, that does change the calculus,"" Mullen said. Massive job losses ""could have a true lasting negative impact,"" particularly at a time when ""our economy is not roaring along,"" he said.

Certain Social Security services may not be available during shutdown

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty Images

The federal government shutdown won't stop Social Security checks from being sent out — but it may affect certain services that beneficiaries rely on.

Trump said on the eve of the shutdown that the federal funding lapse may lead to ""irreversible"" actions, such as cutting benefits for social programs. Trump did not elaborate on exactly which programs could be affected. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for further information.

""We're still telling people that checks are going out,"" said Maria Freese, senior legislative representative at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

In a Sept. 24 contingency plan, the Social Security Administration outlined the services that would and would not be available in the event of a government shutdown.

Out of more than 51,000 employees, around 6,000 will be furloughed, the agency said.

Among the services that will continue are applications for benefits, requests for appeals and issuance of original and replacement Social Security cards, the agency said.

Services slated to be discontinued include benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, replacement Medicare cards and overpayments processing, it said.

Senate rejects last-ditch funding bill

Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty Images

The Senate rejected a last-ditch measure on Tuesday evening to keep the government funded through Nov. 20.

The final vote was 55-45, falling short of the 60-vote threshold that would have passed the measure in the upper chamber.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted with Democrats to oppose the measure, while Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine, voted with Republicans in support.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., presides over a razor-thin majority, so he needs at least seven Democrats to vote with his party to get any legislation passed.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., however, is trying to keep his Democratic colleagues on board with his effort to stand firm on his party's health care demands.

Schumer has faced pressure from the progressive wing of his party to oppose any government funding legislation unless it includes key health-care concessions.

With all eyes on the impending government shutdown, the White House confirmed late Tuesday that it withdrew the nomination of E.J. Antoni, Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Trump nominated Antoni, an economist with the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, after he fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in response to her agency releasing a weak monthly jobs report.

Antoni ""is a brilliant economist and an American patriot that will continue to do good work on behalf of our great country,"" a White House official told CNBC in a statement Tuesday night.

""President Trump is committed to fixing the longstanding failures at the BLS that have undermined the public's trust in critical economic data. The President plans to announce a new nominee very soon.""

Antoni's nomination wasn't the only one yanked late Tuesday: The White House also withdrew Brian Quintenz's nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Politico reported.

CNN first reported Antoni's withdrawal.

ADP's private payrolls report misses expectations as shutdown commences

Joe Raedle | Getty Images

The ADP's private payroll report came in surprisingly weak on Wednesday, offering a negative reading of the labor market with other big job data releases in limbo.

Private payrolls lost 32,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis in September, marking the biggest decrease since 2023. Economists polled by Dow Jones had been expecting payrolls to add 45,000 roles in the month.

This report comes hours into the government shutdown, which would inhibit releases on nonfarm payrolls and jobless claims previously expected for later this week if a resolution isn't reached. In such a situation, the ADP's data could take on more significance than it typically does for economic policymakers and investors looking to assess the labor market's health.

After closing that window, the same message appears in a bright-red banner at the top of the site.

FAA air traffic controller training to continue in shutdown

Eduardo Munoz | Reuters

Air traffic controller training will continue at the U.S. academy in Oklahoma as well as in the field, according to a Department of Transportation shutdown contingency plan.

The U.S. has ramped up hiring of new air traffic controllers, though training takes months. Thinly staffed facilities, such as those serving airports in the New York City area, have disrupted flights in recent years, angering travelers and airline executives alike.

In the shutdown, 13,294 air traffic controllers will continue to work, though without pay, according to the DOT. More than 11,000 FAA employees are subject to furlough, the agency said.

A more than one-month government shutdown ended in January 2019 after a shortage of air traffic controllers sparked disruptions at New York City airports.

Shutdown could affect U.S. travel industry

Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images

Air travel will continue during a government shutdown, meaning passengers can still board flights and go through security as usual.

But Airlines for America — a trade group that represents major carriers like Delta Air Lines , United Airlines , American Airlines , Southwest Airlines and others — warned that the aviation system ""may need to slow down, reducing efficiency"" during a shutdown.

Government workers who are considered ""essential,"" like TSA officers and air traffic controllers, are required to continue working.

The shutdown could cost the U.S. travel industry $1 billion per week, according to estimates from the U.S. Travel Association, which represents major hotel groups and others.

""The longer a shutdown drags on, the more likely we are to see longer TSA lines, flight delays and cancellations, national parks in disrepair and unnecessary delays in modernizing travel infrastructure,"" Geoff Freeman, the group's president, said in a statement.

When the government shut down under the first Trump administration in late 2018 and early 2019, callouts from a few air traffic controllers along the U.S. East Coast snarled air traffic, putting pressure on lawmakers to reach a deal.

How the shutdown will affect major economic reports

Bill Clark | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images

A shutdown could delay the release of key economic reports that the government regularly publishes, which are closely watched by financial markets.

In a contingency plan released Friday, the Labor Department said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that produces the government reports on the economy, will ""suspend all operations"" in the event of a shutdown.

""Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released,"" the plan said.

The next BLS employment report was set to be released Friday. The BLS's Consumer Price Index reading for September is scheduled to be released on Oct. 15.

Wells Fargo economist Michael Pugliese noted last week that after the last full government shutdown in 2013, the monthly jobs and consumer price index reports ""were delayed by about two weeks.""

""Collection, processing and publication delays stretched into the following month as well,"" Pugliese noted.

In the partial shutdown that began in late 2018, Pugliese noted, ""the first look at"" gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter of that year ""was delayed about a month, as was December 2018 data on retail sales and personal income & spending.""

How Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for the shutdown

Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images

Republicans, who hold the White House and slim majorities in both chambers of Congress, wanted to pass a stopgap bill to maintain funding at current levels until late November. They needed at least seven Democrats to help them in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to overcome the filibuster.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and a group of Democrats had previously joined Republicans in March to pass a six-month extension of government funding.

But this time around, Democrats have united around several demands, including that any short-term funding bill include an extension of enhanced Obamacare tax credits, which are due to lapse at year's end. The enhanced subsidies reduce the costs of health insurance premiums for a wider swath of Affordable Care Act enrollees.

Republicans balked, accusing Democrats of holding the government hostage by standing in the way of continued federal funding unless their health-care demands are met.

GOP leaders have also argued that their ""clean"" continuing resolution is nonpartisan, and that policy negotiations can continue without shutting down the government.

Democrats countered that the GOP proposal actually is partisan, since Republicans are seeking to extend funding following the passage of a controversial spending bill that narrowly passed in July over the objections of all congressional Democrats.

Democrats have also slammed Republicans for refusing to negotiate, and for leaving Washington, D.C., as the shutdown deadline approached.

Trump and other Republicans have also accused Democrats of seeking to give health-care benefits to undocumented immigrants — a claim that Democrats reject as a lie, noting that federal law prohibits it.

How many workers could be furloughed?

The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty Images

During the last full government shutdown in 2013, about 850,000 federal employees were furloughed, meaning they were required to take unpaid leave, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated Tuesday that the current shutdown would lead to about 750,000 employees being furloughed.

""The total daily cost of their compensation would be roughly $400 million,"" the CBO told Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, in response to her request for information on the impact of a shutdown.

The agency's estimate noted that the number of furloughed employees could vary from day to day ""because some agencies might furlough more employees the longer a shutdown persists and others might recall some initially furloughed employees.""

Furloughed workers will get back pay upon their return.

But Trump's Office of Management and Budget has threatened to make some of those job cuts permanent, by warning federal agencies in a recent memo to prepare for mass firings in the event of a shutdown.

Government shutdown history: The longest was under Trump

Nathan Howard | Reuters

The full shutdown began at midnight Wednesday after Democratic and Republican leaders failed to agree on even a short-term deal to keep the government fully funded past the current fiscal year.

It is unclear just how long the shutdown will last, or how widespread its impacts will be.

The federal government has either shut down or experienced funding gaps 14 times since 1980.

The longest shutdown on record started in late 2018, when the government partially shuttered for about five weeks amid disputes over funding Trump's proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.

The lawsuit challenges a new rule barring states from using Victims of Crime Act (VOCA), Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (Byrne JAG), and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grant funds to provide legal services to undocumented immigrants, or other individuals who cannot prove their status. Attorney General Nick Brown and the coalition argue that the new policy is unconstitutional and are asking the court to stop the rule from taking effect in their states.

“The president wants to turn legal service providers who help victims of crimes into an extension of ICE,” Brown said. “This is illegal and against the will of Congress. I’m confident the court will see through his administration’s attempt to once again hold funding hostage for political reasons.”

For decades, the VOCA and VAWA grant programs have enabled states to support survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other violent crimes. The grants fund services such as legal representation in family court, relocation and housing assistance, compensation for medical bills and funeral costs, and other civil legal services. Byrne JAG grants provide additional resources to state and local governments for criminal justice initiatives. In their lawsuit, the attorneys general emphasize that all three programs have long been available to all eligible individuals, regardless of immigration status.

Last month, DOJ informed states that they could no longer use VOCA, VAWA, or Byrne JAG funds to provide legal services to undocumented immigrants. The new “Legal Services Condition” applies not only to future funding but also to grants already awarded and is scheduled to take effect on Oct. 31, 2025.

In Washington, that move by DOJ jeopardizes potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in previously authorized Byrne JAG funds that had not yet been spent. The Washington State Department of Commerce directs those funds to subgrantees that provide a broad range of services, including legal assistance to survivors of domestic and sexual violence. An estimated 550 survivors in King, Clark, and Pierce counties are expected to receive legal services funded through Washington’s Byrne JAG award this year.

The coalition warns that the new restrictions will upend victim services programs, cut off critical resources, and discourage survivors from seeking help. If service providers have to screen victims’ or witnesses’ immigration status, they could be forced to deny legal services to families in crisis — a policy that would ultimately silence survivors. The attorneys general also highlight the fact that many service providers do not have the capacity or resources necessary to enact such screening processes.

In today’s lawsuit, Brown and the coalition argue that DOJ’s new restrictions violate the Constitution’s Spending Clause by attaching retroactive and ambiguous conditions to grants that were already awarded, in some cases years ago. The attorneys general also assert that DOJ acted in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to justify its reversal of decades-long policy and by ignoring the harm the rule will cause to survivors and service providers.

In effect, they say this rule change requires states to review survivors’ immigration status prior to giving them aid, straining state resources and leaving behind thousands of domestic violence and sexual assault victims.
“Sexual assault and domestic violence survivors turn to our courts for safety and protection,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety.
The states are seeking injunctive relief to block the rule change from taking effect.","(CN) — A coalition of states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday over a rule change requiring survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence to immediately prove their citizenship status in order to receive certain federal aid.

In their lawsuit, filed in Rhode Island’s federal court, the states scrutinize new guidance from the Justice Department that they say recently raised the bar to access federal programs under the Violence Against Women Act and the Victims of Crime Act.

In effect, they say this rule change requires states to review survivors’ immigration status prior to giving them aid, straining state resources and leaving behind thousands of domestic violence and sexual assault victims.

This could even discourage even lawful residents and U.S. citizens from using federal aid if they cannot immediately produce the required documentation in the aftermath of their abuse, the states argue. They note that many abusers have been known to restrict a victim’s access to their legal documents to retain control over them.

“Imposing what may essentially be an affirmative requirement that victims demonstrate that they are not ‘removable’ or ‘otherwise unlawfully present’ in order to be eligible for VOCA- or VAWA-funded legal services would also foreseeably impact many victims, including citizens, for whom the reality of recent proximity to crime may make it dangerous, or even impossible, to gather and present legal documentation of status before acutely needing services,” the states say in their 50-page complaint.

The new guidelines are ambiguous too, the states claim, because the Justice Department doesn’t explicitly state which legal services are now restricted, which subset of immigrants are cut off from them and how states are meant to make that distinction.

“As a result, plaintiff states and their subgrantees are left to guess which services are covered for whom, and to guess which new processes may be required to comply with the condition,” they argue. “If the condition is construed to require verification of the immigration statuses of all clients before legal services can be offered, it is equally ambiguous as to how plaintiff states would effectively enact compliance with this condition and monitor subgrantee compliance as well.”

Grant funding from the Violence Against Women Act and the Victims of Crime Act enables states to support victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking and other violent crimes by providing them with services like family court legal representation, child support, relocation and housing assistance, and other services designed to help survivors escape and recover from abuse.

Rape crisis centers are also funded by the Violence Against Women Act.

In New York alone, the pair of programs provided services to more than 1 million residents, according to the state attorney general’s office.

“Sexual assault and domestic violence survivors turn to our courts for safety and protection,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “They should never be turned away because of who they are or where they come from. With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence. We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”

James is leading the coalition, composed of 20 states and the District of Columbia. Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin are the other suing parties.

The states are seeking injunctive relief to block the rule change from taking effect.

The lawsuit comes just weeks after the Supreme Court lifted a judge’s restraining order that had barred immigration agents in Los Angeles from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.
Venegas was released after more than an hour, according to the law firm.
“It feels like there is nothing I can do to stop immigration agents from arresting me whenever they want,” Leo said in a statement released by the law firm.
Immigration agents told him the ID card was fake, before eventually releasing him.","An Alabama construction worker and U.S. citizen who says he was detained twice by immigration agents within just a few weeks has filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding an end to Trump administration workplace raids targeting industries with large immigrant workforces.

The class-action lawsuit, filed Tuesday by concrete worker Leo Garcia Venegas with the public interest law firm Institute for Justice, demands an end to what the firm calls “unconstitutional and illegal immigration enforcement tactics.”

Venegas, who was born in the U.S., lives and works in Baldwin County, Alabama, a Gulf Coast area between the cities of Mobile and Pensacola, Florida, that has seen immense population growth in the last 15 years, and which offers plenty of construction work.

The lawsuit comes just weeks after the Supreme Court lifted a judge’s restraining order that had barred immigration agents in Los Angeles from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The court has repeatedly allowed some of the Trump administrations harshest immigration policies, while also leaving open that legal outcomes could shift as cases play out.

The new lawsuit describes repeated raids on workplaces despite agents having no warrants nor suspicion that specific workers were in the U.S. illegally, and a string of U.S. citizens — many with Latino-sounding names — who were detained.

The Department of Homeland Security “authorizes these armed raids based on the general assumption that certain groups of people in the industry, including Latinos, are likely illegal immigrants,” the suit argues.

In a May raid that swept up Venegas, video shot by a coworker shows him being forced to the ground by immigration agents as he repeatedly insisted he was a U.S. citizen. The lawsuit says the agents targeted workers at the building site who looked Latino, while leaving alone the other workers. Venegas was released after more than an hour, according to the law firm.

Venegas was detained again at another construction site less than a month later.

“It feels like there is nothing I can do to stop immigration agents from arresting me whenever they want,” Leo said in a statement released by the law firm. “I just want to work in peace. The Constitution protects my ability to do that.”

Venegas, who specializes in laying concrete foundations, says he was detained both times despite showing his Alabama-issued REAL ID driver’s license — a higher-security identity card available only to U.S. citizens and legal residents.

Immigration agents told him the ID card was fake, before eventually releasing him. He was released after about 20-30 minutes.

“Immigration officers are not above the law,” Institute for Justice attorney Jaba Tsitsuashvili said in a statement. “Leo is a hardworking American citizen standing up for everyone’s right to work without being detained merely for the way they look or the job that they do.”

Siemietkowski’s immigration courtroom at 26 Federal Plaza, an Ecuadorian mother logged on for her immigration hearing.

The court was well prepared for remote work. Lawyers waited patiently in their Webex boxes to unmute themselves and talk. The judge periodically toggled a device to point the camera toward others in the low-ceilinged, windowless room. He led the virtual participants in a round of applause to thank a translator appearing from North Carolina.

Except the mother did not get the same flexibility. The judge told her she had to come in person.

In fear of being arrested by the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in the courthouse hallway, now happening commonly in New York, many immigrants have begged to do their hearings online from home. Yet even that temporary protection from deportation is now under threat. Interviews with court personnel and attorneys indicate a top-down pressure from the Trump administration toward in-person hearings, with fateful results. It’s the latest battlefront in the city’s immigration courts, which have become “the capital of immigration courthouse arrests.”

“We’ve had many clients who we’ve consulted with whose Webex motions were denied,” says Katherine Buckel, clinic supervisor for the immigration-law unit at The Legal Aid Society. “And then some were detained at the courthouses.”

One such case involved a Venezuelan family, whose request for a virtual hearing was turned down, according to Buckel. The husband was taken away when he showed up at court, leaving behind a pregnant wife and child.

Buckel runs a clinic trying to help people switch to virtual appearances for exactly this reason, but it’s not easy: Advocacy and legal groups including Legal Aid have gathered information on 39 immigration judges in the city and found that only 19 will consider allowing lawyerless people to appear online. Different judges have different policies, and in some courtrooms, lawyers may appear remotely even while their own clients are stranded in the room.

This leaves immigrants with a “horrible decision,” says Gillian Rowland-Kain of Immigrant Advocates Response Collaborative, which is made up of legal-service providers. If they show up as usual in lower Manhattan for their required hearings to adjudicate their ability to remain in the country, they risk arrest, like the man in last week’s viral video who was violently dragged away from his frantic wife and child inside 26 Federal Plaza. Skip the hearing, and they’ll typically be ordered removed in absentia, which means they “end up on ICE’s list and can be picked up at anytime,” she says.

Virtual teleconferences once seemed primed to become an unpoliticized boon for all involved, helping to expedite cases and expand access to counsel. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, a part of the Justice Department that conducts immigration-court proceedings, described video teleconferencing for hearings as a “proven success” as early as 2007. The immigration-court practice manual says that judges “are authorized by statute to hold hearings by video conference and telephone conference.” Concerns about how immigrants on-camera might be perceived by judges were dampened as the world adjusted to the pandemic.

“What we get is this very rapid adaptation to virtual hearings on the part of the immigration courts, and a big push for remote hearing altogether,” says Carmen Maria Rey Caldas, a former immigration judge. “The administration is actually quite comfortable with the entirety of a hearing being held remotely.”

This was on prime display in virtual and physical visits to 26 Federal Plaza courtrooms last week. There were the usual Zoom-style hiccups and people being informed that they were on mute. During one pause for technical difficulties, a judge made chitchat about an upcoming Balkans vacation. But most participants were clearly accustomed to remote hearings and saw their benefits. Distant translators trained in everything from Farsi to Spanish hopped on and off as needed. Judge Siemietkowski praised one lawyer for his inventive virtual background, which included a picture of a courtroom and a banner with his client’s information. Lawyers eyed their stacked calendars and asked if future hearings could be remote, smoothing their schedules, and Siemietkowski readily agreed. “As long as I’m here and unless the rules change, remote is fine,” he said.

Asked about current policy regarding virtual hearings, EOIR spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly says that “respondents who do not have a representative of record will always have a default hearing medium of in person.” Some court regulars see an even broader push from the administration away from virtual hearings.

Rey Caldas, who was one of multiple judges controversially pushed out by the administration this summer, says that the ICE attorneys who function like prosecutors in immigration cases were ordered back to physical court this year. Judges who already leaned toward in-person appearances now had a reason to bring in other warm bodies. Rey Caldas also heard ICE starting to object on the record when immigrants appeared virtually to initial hearings, asking judges to order “all future appearances be in person” or for the individual to be simply ordered removed — a deportation sentence.

“I believe a lot of judges feel like there’s a push for in-person hearings,” she says.

Like some legal professionals with a background in defense, Rey Caldas personally prefers in person as physical proximity can heighten the sense that someone is understanding what she says. It can be procedurally easier to introduce immigrants to the process they’re entering if they’re in front of her. But in the current environment of courthouse arrests, a significant departure from past precedent, she and some other judges granted virtual requests “liberally, because we understood that it is more important for the advancement of justice to be able to have this person appear and proceed with their case.”

Rey Caldas is now gone, and there are other ways that new court customs are closing the virtual window for immigrants. One immigration attorney, who requested anonymity, had a case apparently switched to in person and was later told it was a mistake. This attorney also says the court-database system previously told respondents if their hearings were in person or internet-based. Recently, that info had disappeared, something other attorneys have corroborated. (EOIR says the info was provided “for convenience only” and court documents are the only official determinations.) Lawyers can check another system that still has the information. Immigrants without representation, however, may have little choice but to risk showing up in person just in case — or they try to log on and get chided for doing so.

That happened multiple times in Judge James Loprest’s Webex courtroom on Thursday. “We generally don’t take people through the video who lack lawyers,” Loprest said. The immigrants were told to come back in December.

For the Ecuadorean mother under a different judge’s purview, her physical return to 26 Federal Plaza came much sooner — that same day. At 1:40 p.m., 20 minutes before Judge Siemietkowski asked for their presence, she, her partner, and 3-year-old son showed up at his courtroom door.

“I thank you and I respect you” for coming in, the judge said, offering the 3-year-old some drawing material and promising to look at the child’s creation after the hearing. Then, for an hour and a half, he dealt with lawyers representing clients on his Webex screen, explaining that the attorneys might be due in court elsewhere and would be handled first. The boy climbed on a bench between his quietly attentive parents, whispering “Mama, Mama” and rolling a red toy truck over their bodies. At one point, the judge asked the parents to take their son outside so he could concentrate. When the mother’s turn came, the boy sat still and quiet.

It was an anti-climactic event. The judge set a date for her asylum hearing. Given his backlog of thousands of cases, that date was in 2029.

“A lot can happen, a lot can change” between now and then, Siemietkowski said. “God willing I’m still the judge.” He also added that “you know better than I do there have been a lot of changes the last few months, right?”

It was a nod to the arrests that have started happening steps from his dais. Earlier that morning, two Hispanic men coming out of the next courtroom in the hallway had been seized by federal agents. The Ecuadorean family walked slowly out of the courtroom, carrying backpacks and a packet of legal papers, and seemed relieved to see the empty hallway.

The father, carrying the boy, explained the obvious: “We were afraid of ICE.”",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f7b/429/f74d8b0b414e524e10a49ee00bb84dcf61-26-federal-plaza-lede.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 17:57:49.763908

Critics, meanwhile, contend that the science does not support claims that transgender girls have an unfair advantage, that this is a non-issue given how few transgender athletes there are, and argue that transgender athletes have the right to compete alongside their peers.","Sept. 30 (UPI) -- The Trump administration on Tuesday declared that Minnesota's policies allowing transgender athletes to play on teams that match with their gender identity violated federal law, marking the latest escalation in a feud between the federal government and the Democratic-led state.

The ruling from the civil rights offices of the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services gives Minnesota 10 days to adopt a slew of actions, including abandoning its transgender-inclusive athletic policies, or risk federal funding cuts.

""Minnesota permits male athletes to compete in sports designated for females, which denies females equal opportunities under Title IX that they deserve in athletic competition,"" HHS' OCR Director Paula Stannard said in a statement.

""Minnesota fails to recognize the fundamental biological differences between males and females -- differences that justify single-sex teams and are essential to ensuring fair and safe competition for girls and women.""

Minnesota, led by Trump rival Gov. Tim Walz, has been a target of the Trump administration, and has been subjected to numerous federal actions over its so-called left-leaning policies, including its inclusive hiring practices and providing higher education tuition benefits to some undocumented immigrants.

On Tuesday, Trump's Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Minnesota's so-called sanctuary immigration policies.

The civil rights investigation into Minnesota was launched in February, about a week after Trump issued an executive order to ban transgender athletes from competing in women's and girls' sports, calling it ""demeaning, unfair and dangerous to women and girls.""

In June, following reports of a transgender teenage athlete who competed in the girls' Minnesota State High School League, the federal government elevated its civil rights investigation into the state.

In its joint report Tuesday, the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services said that they found that over the course of several years the Minnesota Department of Education and the Minnesota State High School League had allowed transgender female athletes to compete on girls' Alpine ski, Nordic skiing, lacrosse, track and field, volleyball and fast-pitch softball teams.

The departments said this was in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which is federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education programs that receive federal funding.

""For too many years, Minnesota's political leadership has found itself on the wrong side of justice, common sense and the American people,"" Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights at the Department of Education, said in a statement.

""Now, the Minnesota Department of Education and the Minnesota State High School League find themselves on the wrong side of Title IX by allowing males to compete in women's sports.""

UPI has contacted the Minnesota Department of Education for comment.

Transgender athletes competing in sports that align with their gender identity have been a target of conservatives and Republicans for years, an effort that gained a supporter in the White House following the election of President Donald Trump, who ran an anti-transgender campaign.

Proponents of the ban argue that allowing transgender females in girls' and women's sports gives them an unfair advantage while being discriminatory to athletes who were born female. Critics, meanwhile, contend that the science does not support claims that transgender girls have an unfair advantage, that this is a non-issue given how few transgender athletes there are, and argue that transgender athletes have the right to compete alongside their peers.",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/7251759287390/2025/1/dc33411b79ac1d3c277835a94513e216/v1.5/Trump-admin-Minnesota-violated-Title-IX-over-transgender-athletes.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 19:56:46.060977

And his friend and fellow right-on human rights lawyer, Richard Hermer, the attorney general?","Keir Starmer literally wrote the textbook on human rights law. His European Human Rights Law: The Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights was published in 1999.

Twenty-six years later, he is rewriting his own book as prime minister. Two weeks after taking office last year, he told fellow European leaders: “We will never withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.” He said that his new government approached the issue of migration “with humanity, and with a profound respect for international law”.

But something happens to prime ministers after they have been in office for a bit longer than two weeks.

Tony Blair, for example, was responsible for the Human Rights Act that was the subject of Starmer’s book. He went along with the civil liberties hoopla about “bringing rights home” and was briefly proud of Labour’s achievement in making it easier for citizens to gain access to their ECHR rights in British courts.

It was not long, though, before he was chafing at the restrictions that this imposed on his government’s ability to deport people convicted of serious offences because they faced the danger of torture in their home country. And Blair ended his decade as prime minister being defeated in the House of Commons for the first time on a bill to allow terrorist suspects to be detained without charge for 90 days.

Now Starmer seems to be going through a similar trajectory, although in a shorter time.

In one of his post-conference interviews, with the BBC, he said, “We need to look again at the interpretation” of articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR – the right to protection from torture, and the right to private and family life.

He insisted that he did not want to “tear down” those provisions of the ECHR, but that they had to be “applied in the circumstances as they are now”, because countries are experiencing “mass migration in a way that we have not seen in previous years”.

So far, so tentative. Yvette Cooper, as home secretary, had already announced a review of the way the ECHR is interpreted by British courts, and Shabana Mahmood, her successor, is not going to be shy about bringing in legislation to amend the Human Rights Act and tell judges what the government thinks the right to family life means.

It will not include, for example, a child’s preference for British chicken nuggets – although the conclusion of that case, which has achieved the status of urban legend, was that the deportation was allowed when the Home Office appealed.

But the significance of Starmer’s BBC interview was that he went much further than simply trying to narrow the courts’ interpretation of European Convention rights.

“It’s more than that,” he said, referring specifically to the UN Refugee Convention, Torture Convention and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This suggests that some serious work is now being done on the real legal obstacles to secure borders.

As every wannabe Starmer – every ambitious lawyer specialising in human rights law – has pointed out, the ECHR is not what is frustrating the government’s attempts to stop the boats. The number of appeals against deportation on article 3 and article 8 grounds is small. The bigger problem is the definition of a refugee in the Refugee Convention, with two-thirds of people arriving by small boat qualifying for it.

Again, Starmer is not proposing to withdraw from that treaty, but he knows that nations have a lot of scope for interpreting it. Whoever is doing the research for his rewriting of the law has noticed that other countries have a much higher refusal rate for asylum applications than Britain and none of them has been hauled before the International Court of Justice as a result.

So it may be that a dramatic change can be achieved by changing British law alone – and who better to oversee this legal revolution than the author of the definitive book about incorporating international human rights law in domestic legislation?

October 1, 2025 11:00 am

NEW YORK — The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Virginia, and ACLU of North Carolina today filed a lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to obtain records regarding the agency’s potential plans to expand immigration detention across Virginia.

The lawsuit stems from ICE’s Requests for Information issued on May 28, 2025, seeking “available detention facilities"" in areas covered by ICE’s Washington, D.C. Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Field Office. The ACLU submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in August 2025 which went unanswered, prompting the ACLU to take legal action. The lawsuit comes weeks after the Trump administration opened new ICE detention centers at a maximum-security prison in Louisiana, as well as at the Fort Bliss military base in Texas.

“The Trump administration is hastily opening new ICE detention facilities in an effort to deport as many people as possible, no matter the costs to our communities,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU’s National Prison Project. “The public has a right to know how its taxpayer dollars are being used to expand the abusive ICE detention machine.”

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, demands that ICE comply with the Freedom of Information Act and immediately turn over the requested records to the ACLU. The litigation follows a series of lawsuits filed by the ACLU and its affiliates seeking details about ICE’s plans to expand detention capacity nationwide to support the Trump administration’s goal of deporting 11 million immigrants from the U.S. Already, the ACLU’s FOIA litigation has revealed critical details about ICE’s plans, including details on which current and new facilities are being considered across the Midwest, South, and West Coast.

“This lawsuit is about transparency and accountability,” said Michele Delgado, staff attorney, ACLU of North Carolina. “The public has a right to know how ICE is planning to expand its network of detention centers, especially when tens of thousands of people are already held in these facilities every day under conditions that raise serious human rights concerns.”

The lawsuit also comes as media reports have found inhumane conditions at the Washington D.C. ERO Field Office in Chantilly, Virginia, where dozens of immigrants have been detained in the weeks following President Trump’s federal takeover of Washington, D.C. According to reports, people detained at the facility were only given one meal a day and denied access to their lawyers.

“The Trump administration’s determination to rip families apart has created a humanitarian crisis in ICE facilities,” said Sophia Gregg, senior immigrants’ rights attorney at the ACLU of Virginia. “ICE's solution to the dangerous, rapidly degenerating conditions in its existing facilities can’t be to replicate those conditions in new facilities that it builds in secret. ICE must be transparent and follow the law – not violate people’s civil rights and civil liberties to advance an inhumane political agenda.”

“Roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,” Vought wrote on X.

“Specifically, the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Ave Subway,” he added in a second post.

The announcement, coming on the first day of the federal government shutdown, would dramatically affect major projects for the home state and city of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

Fact Check

Do Democrats want to fund health care for illegal immigrants?

+5

, , , , and

Statement

After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive. They are threatening to shut down the Government of the United States unless they can have over $1 Trillion Dollars in new spending to continue free healthcare for Illegal Aliens (A monumental cost!)

Verdict

Undocumented immigrants cannot sign up for Affordable Care Act coverage and are not eligible for Medicaid coverage. That is not legal now, and Democrats are not looking to change that.

Analysis

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996(PRWORA) made undocumented immigrants mostly ineligible for federal public benefits.

What Democrats are trying to do is restore access to federal health care funding for 1.4 million people from whom Republicans stripped it from in March. That group of 1.4 million people exists in a gray area called “lawfully present.” These are such people as those granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, refugees and asylum-seekers. They are not considered “undocumented immigrants” — the government knows who they are, and they’re playing by the rules — but they don’t have legal permanent status.

Undocumented immigrants do have access to emergency room visits under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a separate law from the Affordable Care Act. Immigration advocates have said that federal spending for emergency care represents a fraction of a percentage point of Medicaid spending.

Undocumented immigrants do have access to emergency room visits under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a separate law from the Affordable Care Act. Immigration advocates have said that federal spending for emergency care represents a fraction of a percentage point of Medicaid spending.

Speaker Johnson calls Democrats' push on Obamacare subsidies 'a red herring'

and

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the Democratic push to address Obamacare subsidies in a government funding bill a ""red herring"" during a news conference on the government shutdown with other Republican leaders in Congress.

""This is an extraneous matter right now, what the Democrats are doing is trying to grab a red herring,"" Johnson said, flanked by other top GOP lawmakers, outside the Capitol. ""They're trying to bring in a December policy decision, which, by the way, is expiring because they themselves, the Democrats, put that in the law.""

""That's not a decision that has to be made until the end of the year,"" he added.

Johnson added that ""there isn’t anything we can do to make this bill any better” for Democrats, touting that the legislation Republicans put forward doesn't include any policy riders.

Republicans said they want to keep the government open now and negotiate the Affordable Care Act credits in the next two months.

Democrats, however, have said Congress has to address the expiring Obamacare subsidies now because insurers will begin to send notices about premiums soon, and the marketplace opens on Nov. 1.

They've expressed worry that people could drop out of health care coverage altogether if they think premiums are going to spike, and they've viewed the shutdown fight as a point of leverage to get Republicans to the table on the issue.

FEMA to continue disaster response during shutdown

and

The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will continue disaster preparation and response efforts during the shutdown.

The agency ""remains fully prepared and capable of responding to natural disasters, even amidst the current government shutdown,"" a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement, adding, ""FEMA will continue to conduct essential activities deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of property.

Critical agency functions that will continue include ""payments to disaster survivors, debris removal, emergency protective measures, and salaries for our disaster workforce,"" the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson also went on to blame ""left-wing politicians"" for ""exploiting this government shutdown for political gain"" — a continual refrain from administration officials, GOP leaders in Congress, and even government agencies as negotiations reached an impasse and government funding lapsed.

Senate set to vote on procedural motions to advance stopgap funding bill

and

The Senate will vote again at 11 a.m. on procedural motions related to the two stopgap funding bills that failed yesterday. The votes are aimed at starting consideration of the stopgap funding bills and both are expected to fail again.

To advance the House-passed, clean continuing resolution, Republicans need eight Democrats to vote alongside them if GOP votes remain the same. Last night, three members of the Democratic Caucus joined Republicans in voting to advance the bill, including Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez, Masto, D-Nev. and Angus King, I-Maine.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was the only Republican to vote against it.

The Senate is set to leave this afternoon and will be gone tomorrow to observe Yom Kippur.

White House budget office to brief House Republicans on shutdown plans

The director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, will provide a virtual briefing to House Republicans today about how the administration will proceed with the government shutdown, a GOP source familiar with the plans told NBC News.

The conference call, scheduled for 1 p.m. today, comes as Vought has threatened to conduct mass permanent layoffs in the federal workforce in the event of a shutdown.

Punchbowl was first to report the timing of the call.

Several federal government websites are not being maintained in the first hours of the shutdown

and

Some federal government websites are down or not being updated and maintained, with some explicitly pointing to the shutdown as the reason.

When users try to load the website data.census.gov, for example, they see a message that reads, ""Due to the lapse of federal funding, portions of this website will not be updated. Any inquiries submitted will not be answered until appropriations are enacted.""

Similarly, the website for the National Archives opens with a pop-up message to inform users that, apart from a few exceptions, ""Due to the shutdown of the federal government, National Archives facilities are closed, websites and social media are not being updated or monitored, and activities are canceled.""

Schumer: Speaker Johnson 'has been the real bad guy in this'

In an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., rebuffed claims that Senate Democrats are to blame for this shutdown, instead pointing to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for adjourning the House last month without a deal on government funding.

""There are Republicans on the Senate side who are saying, 'Let’s sit down and negotiate.' We should, and it has to, by the way, it’s not just [Senate Majority Leader John] Thune. It has to include Johnson,"" Schumer said.

""Johnson has been the real bad guy in this,"" he continued. ""If you want to know who wanted a shutdown, there’s one sentence that proves it. Johnson had the Congress, the House, not even be in session when the shutdown occurs. How do you negotiate like that?""

Schumer says 'no,' Democrats won't buckle as shutdown goes on

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., stood firm this morning on his party's insistence that a government funding bill must address extending Affordable Care Act subsidies before they expire at the end of the year.

Asked if Democrats will go crawling back to Republicans if the government shutdown lasts for several weeks, Schumer said, ""No.""

Democrats plan to launch a messaging effort to convince Americans that their move to reject a so-called clean funding bill, which would keep spending at current levels and not extend the subsidies, is legitimate.

""They've tried twice to get us to vote for their bill, which does nothing to protect Americans' health care,"" Schumer said. ""We are going to be fighting everywhere, on TV stations like yours, in the social media, in picketing, in protesting, in emails, in every way.""

He said his party is ""going to be pointing out it's the Republicans who did it. And we're also going to be pointing out that we asked them three times to vote on extending the ACA credit, which would make this all better, and they voted no three times.""

Schumer slammed Republicans for spreading the false claim that Democrats are trying to give undocumented immigrants access to federal health care benefits, which is against the law, calling it ""a total, absolute effing lie.""

Democrats are ready to sit down with Republican leaders ""and negotiate a good deal that protects Americans from the health care crisis, and we're ready to do that right away,"" he said.

Shutdown means delay for key jobs report

As a result of the government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will delay the release of its monthly jobs report, which had been scheduled for Friday.

The report would have included the number of new payrolls added in the U.S. economy, as well as the latest unemployment rate. Deterioration for both figures in recent months have suggested a weakening jobs market that has made it increasingly difficult for those out of work to find new employment.

The report’s delay comes at a particularly sensitive moment for the U.S. economy, which faces a bevy of challenges, including tariffs, changing immigration patterns and a widening split between wealthier households and the rest. The Federal Reserve has signaled it intends to lower interest rates in response to the worsening picture — but a prolonged period without the official jobs data could affect its future decision-making.

An independent report released Wednesday by the payrolls processor ADP showed jobs declined by 32,000 in September, though ADP noted there were some issues with the ""granularity"" of its analysis due to changes in a dataset it relies upon. Nevertheless, it said, the overall weakening trend was ""unchanged.""

Experts say it would take a few days for the BLS to release the September data once the government shutdown ends.

The delay also comes after the White House pulled its nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Vance says Trump administration doesn't 'want to lay anybody off' during the shutdown

and

Vice President JD Vance said in an interview on ""CBS Mornings"" that the Trump administration doesn't want to lay federal workers off during the government shutdown.

""We don’t want to lay anybody off, but what we do want to do is make sure that as much of the essential services of government remain functional as possible,"" he said.

""We were sort of dealt this hand by that faction of Senate Democrats who shut down the government,"" Vance said. ""We’re going to have to deal with it. We’re going to have to make sure that as much of the people’s government remains government remains open or functional as possible.""

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that about 750,000 federal employees will be furloughed during the shutdown. Last week, the White House Office of Management and Budget asked federal agencies to prepare for potential workforce firings, going beyond the typical employee furloughs in the event of a shutdown.

Democrats in the House and Senate have sought to include an extensions of expiring Obamacare subsidies in any government spending bill, while Republicans are pushing for a status quo extension of current funding.

National parks to remain partially open during government

and

National parks will remain partially open during the government shutdown, according to an Interior Department contingency plan posted last evening.

Open-air sites will remain open to the public but buildings that require staffing, such as visitor centers or sites like the Washington Monument, will be closed. Health and safety will continue to be addressed for sites that remain operational, meaning restrooms will be open and trash will be collected, the Interior Department said.

The contingency plans specify that park roads, lookouts, trails and open-air memorials will stay open but emergency services will be limited. The department added that if public access begins to pose a safety, health or resource protection issue, an area must close.

The contingency plan says that about 64% of the National Park Service workforce is set to be furloughed and that those kept on would perform “excepted” activities, such as law enforcement or emergency response, border and coastal protection and surveillance, and fire suppression and monitoring.

Speaker Johnson: Democrats have 'decided to close the government'

House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats of voting to shut down the government and said the decision was driven by ""selfish reasons.""

He said on X at midnight: """"Results: Moms and kids now lose WIC nutrition. Veterans lose health care and suicide prevention programs. FEMA has shortfalls during hurricane season. Soldiers and TSA agents go UNPAID.""

He added: ""The only question now: How long will Chuck Schumer let this pain go on — for his own selfish reasons?""

Senior Democrats have said that health care remains a barrier to backing the government spending package and said Republicans were not a ""credible partner.""

Government shutdown threatens to upend Virginia’s race for governor

and

This is not the first time Virginia voters have braced for a government shutdown in a partisan standoff over Obamacare just a few weeks before they elect their next governor.

In October 2013, the federal government shut down for 16 days after lawmakers failed to reach a deal to fund it. President Barack Obama and other Democratic leaders loudly blamed Republicans in Congress, dubbing it the “tea party shutdown” — and polls showed that the public overwhelmingly agreed.

Fast-forward to the present. Republicans control the White House, the federal government barreled into a shutdown at midnight, and a race for governor in Virginia is weeks away. Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger has so far led Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in both polling and fundraising.

Senior Democrats blame 'erratic and unhinged' Trump for shutdown

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement early this morning that Trump and Republicans had ""shut down the federal government because they do not want to protect the healthcare of the American people.""

They said Democrats were willing to ""find a bipartisan path forward to reopen the government"" and end the shutdown, but reiterated their position that the GOP stance on health care remains a barrier, questioning whether the Republicans are a ""credible partner.""

""Over the last few days, President Trump’s behavior has become more erratic and unhinged. Instead of negotiating a bipartisan agreement in good faith, he is obsessively posting crazed deepfake videos,"" they said.

The government blames the Democrats for causing the shutdown by not backing down on their opposition to the bill.

Unions file suit over Trump’s ‘illegal’ plan to fire many federal workers in a shutdown

Two unions filed suit against the Trump administration over its plans to fire federal workers during the government shutdown, alleging that the “unlawful threats” were contrary to the law and should be declared unlawful by a federal court in San Francisco.

“These actions are contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious, and the cynical use of federal employees as a pawn in Congressional deliberations should be declared unlawful and enjoined by this Court,” the lawsuit filed hours ahead of the shutdown alleged.

Nurses' union calls on Congress to pass funding bill and end shutdown

The National Nurses United has urged lawmakers to pass a funding bill and end the government shutdown to ""save lives by restoring health care funding and assistance.""

The NNU, which says it is the country's largest nursing union, said it was also time to end ""the Trump administration’s unprecedented power over government spending.""

The union said in a statement that Republicans were blame for the shutdown, having ""manufactured this impasse by refusing to negotiate with Democrats as a means to further degrade and gut critical public services and to advance an agenda to privatize vital functions.""

The NNU has separately written to members of Congress urging them to find an agreement.

Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has accused Democrats of holding the government ""hostage"" by not agreeing the bill and suggested more would support it as the pain of the shutdown takes hold.

What are the next steps after government shutdown?

Reporting from WASHINGTON

As the U.S. government shutdown officially begins, millions of federal workers and services are being impacted. What are the next steps after the shutdown and the potential effects for Americans?

Members of Congress still get paid during a government shutdown

and

Millions of federal workers won’t get paid during a government shutdown. But the people who could prevent or end a shutdown — members of Congress — will still receive a paycheck.

That’s because their pay is protected under Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution, which states: “The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.”

Federal employees were told to brace for a shutdown — and blame Democrats

Federal employees who would be impacted by a government shutdown received a memo yesterday informing them of possible furloughs, along with a partisan accusation that Democrats in Congress were to blame.

The memo — sent to the Department of Health and Human Services, Education Department, the Justice Department and the Labor Department, among others — begins by saying that Trump “opposes a government shutdown” and supports a House-passed Republican bill that would keep the government funded into November.

As Illinois leaders warned Monday of a National Guard deployment, residents in the nation’s third-largest city met a brazen weekend escalation of immigration enforcement tactics with anger, fear and fresh claims of discrimination.

“It looks un-American,” said Chicago Alderman Brendan Reilly, who represents downtown on the City Council. He deemed the Sunday display a “photo op” for President Donald Trump, echoing other leaders.

Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon, also braced for a federal law enforcement surge. Meanwhile, Louisiana’s governor asked for a National Guard deployment to New Orleans and other cities.

Trump has called the expansion of federal immigration agents and National Guard troops into American cities necessary, blasting Democrats for crime and lax immigration policies. Following a crime crackdown in the District of Columbia and immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, he’s referred to Portland as “war-ravaged” and threatened apocalyptic force in Chicago.

“Whether it takes place here in the city or the suburbs, it’s all the same to us,” Border Patrol agent Gregory Bovino said in Chicago.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has issued a memo that also directs component agencies within the Justice Department, including the FBI, to help protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, including in Chicago and Portland.

Here’s a snapshot of where things stand with federal law enforcement activity in Chicago, Portland, Memphis and New Orleans.

Chicago raises alarm about racial profiling

Many Chicagoans were already uneasy after an immigration crackdown began earlier this month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

Trump has waffled on sending the military, but Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday it appeared the federal government would deploy 100 troops. Pritzker said the Illinois National Guard received word that the Department of Homeland Security sent a memo to the Defense Department requesting troops to protect ICE personnel and facilities.

An immigration processing center outside Chicago has been the site of frequent protests and aggressive tactics by federal agents.

The enforcement recently escalated, with agents using boats on the Chicago River and marching Sunday on Michigan Avenue and in upscale neighborhoods.

Activists and elected leaders are concerned about discriminatory stops, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted restrictions on roving patrols in LA. The court cleared the way for immigration agents to stop people based on race, language, job or location.

“ICE is running around the Loop, harassing people for not being white,” Pritzker said, describing the city’s core business district.

Activists said a Latino family of four was led away by federal agents Sunday near the popular “Cloud Gate” sculpture, commonly called “The Bean.” Construction workers and bicyclists were also targeted.

“The downtown operation of being racially profiled and kidnapped by immigration in broad daylight represents a major escalation by the Trump administration,” said Veronica Castro with Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Bovino told The Associated Press that agents will go after “anyone who is here illegally,” an approach that fell under immigration authority, known as Title 8. He told the Chicago Sun-Times that a person’s appearance goes into the calculation.

“It would be agent experience, intelligence that indicates there’s illegal aliens in a particular place or location,” he told the newspaper. “Then, obviously, the particular characteristics of an individual, how they look.”

DHS did not return messages Monday.

Chicagoans trail Border Patrol

As Border Patrol agents marched near downtown, a few onlookers nodded in approval and shouted praise while a trail of activists and others urged agents to leave.

Shirley Zuniga was celebrating her 24th birthday when she saw agents. Still wearing a pink birthday sash, she left brunch to follow them.

Zuniga, among the first in her family of Honduran immigrants to be born in the United States, said she forgot all about her birthday plans as she yelled at the agents to go home.

“This is much more important to me,” she said as she grew emotional. “I’m celebrating my people.”

Portland goes to court

In Oregon, Democratic Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion in federal court Monday seeking to temporarily block the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard.

The motion is part of a lawsuit Rayfield filed Sunday, after state leaders received a Defense Department memo that said 200 members of the state’s National Guard will be placed under federal control for 60 days to “protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur.”

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek are among local leaders who object to the deployment.

“Putting our own military on our streets is an abuse of power and a disservice to our communities and our service members,” Rayfield said in a statement Monday.

The ICE building outside of Portland’s downtown has been the site of nightly protests that peaked in June, with smaller clashes occurring since then.

A larger crowd demonstrated at the building Sunday. Two people were arrested for assault, according to authorities. That followed a peaceful march earlier in the day that drew thousands to the city’s downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

Some residents are already frustrated.

The building manager of the affordable housing complex adjacent to the ICE building said “the impacts of violent tactics, including tear gas and late-night altercations, are traumatizing for residents,” including the veterans who live there.

“Sending federal troops will only escalate the situation. The last thing we need is an escalation,” Reach Community Development said in statement.

Meanwhile, federal agents on Monday searched a home associated with someone who allegedly aimed a laser at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter as it flew over Portland on Saturday evening, the FBI said. Four people, who were found to be in the country illegally, were detained and placed under the custody of ICE, according to the FBI, which did not specify the charges they face.

Memphis residents worry

Memphis was in wait-and-see mode Monday, the first day of a planned federal law enforcement surge ordered by Trump to fight crime. There were no immediate reports of large-scale federal law enforcement operations.

Still some residents, including Latinos, expressed concerns that immigration agents will detain people regardless of immigration status.

“We know the presence of the National Guard will lead to our neighbors being afraid to seek help when they need medical care, need to report crimes, or require social services, because of this military presence,” said Sandra Pita, a community organizer.

The city has experienced high numbers of violent crimes such as carjackings and homicides in recent years, but both Democratic and Republican officials have noted that the majority-Black city is seeing decreases this year in some categories.

Louisiana’s governor asks for National Guard

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on Monday asked for a National Guard deployment to New Orleans and other cities to help his state fight crime.

In a letter sent to to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Landry also praised the president’s decision to send troops to Washington and Memphis.

Landry said there has been “elevated violent crime rates” in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans as well as shortages in local law enforcement.

But crime in some of the state’s biggest cities has actually decreased recently, with New Orleans seeing a particularly steep drop in 2025 that has put it on pace to have its lowest number of killings in more than five decades.

The History of DACA Litigation Since its creation, DACA has been the subject of ongoing legal and political battles: 2012–2016: DACA was implemented through executive action under President Obama.

The Current Status of DACA Renewals: Individuals who already have DACA can continue to file for renewals.
That means: In the other 49 states and Washington, D.C., the injunction no longer prevents USCIS from granting full DACA benefits.","What is DACA?

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a program first created in 2012 by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It provides certain undocumented individuals who were brought to the United States as children — often called “Dreamers” — with protection from deportation and eligibility for work authorization.

To qualify, applicants must meet specific criteria, including age at entry, continuous residence, education or military service, and good moral character. Importantly, DACA is not a pathway to permanent status or citizenship, but it has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to live and work lawfully in the U.S. on a renewable two-year basis.

The History of DACA Litigation

Since its creation, DACA has been the subject of ongoing legal and political battles:

2012–2016: DACA was implemented through executive action under President Obama. Efforts to expand it through DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans) were blocked by the courts.

2017: The Trump Administration attempted to rescind DACA entirely. That rescission was challenged in court.

2020: The Supreme Court ruled in DHS v. Regents of the University of California that the rescission was improper under administrative law, keeping DACA alive but vulnerable.

2021: In Texas v. United States, Judge Andrew Hanen (S.D. Tex.) found that DACA was unlawful and blocked new, initial applications from being approved. Renewals for existing recipients were allowed to continue.

January 2025: The Fifth Circuit narrowed the injunction so that it applied only within Texas. This ruling meant the district court’s bar on new approvals could no longer automatically block the program nationwide.

The Current Status of DACA

Renewals: Individuals who already have DACA can continue to file for renewals.

Initial Applications: Since 2021, USCIS has been unable to approve first-time DACA requests. Applicants could file, but their cases remained frozen.

Legal Limbo: Courts have repeatedly ruled that DACA exceeds executive authority, but they have also recognized the serious reliance interests of recipients, which is why renewals have been preserved during litigation.

The Latest Filing: A Possible Reopening for First-Time Applicants

In late September 2025, the federal government (DOJ and DHS) submitted a filing in Texas v. United States proposing a path forward. The proposal reflects the Fifth Circuit’s January 2025 decision narrowing the injunction to Texas only.

Outside Texas: The government has asked the court to allow USCIS to resume processing initial DACA applications filed both before and after the 2021 injunction. This would reopen DACA to first-time applicants nationwide, except in Texas.

Inside Texas: Because the injunction still applies there, the government proposes that applicants residing in Texas would only be eligible for deferred action (protection from deportation) — but not for work permits or “lawful presence” status.

Why Not Texas?

The reason Texas is treated differently lies in the Fifth Circuit’s ruling. In January 2025, the court limited Judge Hanen’s injunction so that it would only apply in Texas. That means:

In the other 49 states and Washington, D.C., the injunction no longer prevents USCIS from granting full DACA benefits.

In Texas, however, the district court’s injunction remains in effect.

As a result, USCIS cannot lawfully issue work authorization or lawful presence through DACA to Texas residents — though the agency may still provide deferred action alone.

This creates the unusual outcome of geographic inequality: DACA could be fully available in most of the U.S. but restricted in Texas. It also raises complications for current or future recipients — moving to Texas could jeopardize continued employment authorization.

What’s Next?

The government’s plan is still subject to court approval. USCIS has not announced a timeline for when (or if) it will begin adjudicating new DACA applications outside Texas. Until the court rules, initial applicants remain in limbo.

For now:

Current DACA recipients should continue to file timely renewals.

First-time applicants outside Texas may soon see their cases move forward, if the court approves the plan.

Applicants in Texas remain limited to deferred action without work permits.

Conclusion

DACA’s future remains uncertain, but this latest filing marks the first real possibility in years that new, first-time applicants could benefit — at least outside of Texas. The legal battles will continue, and Congress remains the only body with authority to provide a permanent solution.

At another time border patrol agents cleared the driveway for a vehicle. Agents stood face to face with protesters. Then one officer pulled a protester to the ground. Seconds later, two people were carried away by ICE agents.

Earlier in the evening a man stood in the driveway of the facility. Protesters yelled at him to back off. The man refused and moments later agents chased him before backing back off.

Protesters told KATU News the man was not part of their group, and that they had no idea who he was.

""We kept our eye on him because safety of everybody out here, not just us, is one of the top priorities,"" said a protester who identified himself as Ritto. ""And I just don't want anybody who saw that clip to go ahead and look at that and be like, this is what they're doing, because that's not.""

It was the fourth night of protests after Trump's post on Truth Social on Saturday, Small groups of protesters have been outside the ICE facility since June. There have been several isolated clashes.

Many of the protesters were angry over Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to the city.

""I would love to say that it would make things better, but based off of the actions of the people inside without supervision, I have a feeling that this camp will be targeted very heavily,"" Ritto said. ""And all we can do is prepare and protect each other.""

Lawyers for President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court last week to review the legality of his executive order ending birthright citizenship — a high-profile and controversial order that, if enacted, would have profound impacts on the lives of millions of Americans and lawful U.S. residents.

It would also mark the second time in less than a year that the Supreme Court would review the order, at least technically.

Trump administration officials view the order as a key component of his hard-line immigration agenda, which has become a defining feature of Trump's second White House term. Opponents have argued that the effort is unconstitutional and ""unprecedented,"" and would impact some 150,000 children in the U.S. who are born annually to parents of non-citizens.

As the court prepares to kick off its fall term, here's what to know about the order — and possible next steps — in the high-profile case.

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP BAN FOR ALL INFANTS, TESTING LOWER COURT POWERS

What's new?

U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the Supreme Court last week to review the merits of Trump's birthright citizenship executive order. His request focused largely on two court orders handed down in July by a federal judge in New Hampshire, and by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

In his petition to the high court, Sauer argued that the lower court's decisions were overly broad, and ""invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security.""

The New Hampshire case, Barbara v. Trump, centers on a preliminary injunction handed down by U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante in July.

Laplante ruled that Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship likely contradicts the 14th Amendment and the ""century-old untouched precedent that interprets it.""

He also certified as a class all infants born in the U.S. after Feb. 20, 2025, who would have been denied citizenship under Trump's executive order.

Sauer also honed in on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled 2-1 to invalidate Trump's order.

TRUMP TO BEGIN ENFORCING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDER AS EARLY AS THIS MONTH, DOJ SAYS

The 2-1 majority for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the order is ""invalid"" because it ""contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment"" and its citizenship clause.

Sauer argued last week that the Supreme Court has a ""compelling interest in ensuring that American citizenship — the privilege that allows us to choose our political leaders—is granted only to those who are lawfully entitled to it.""

Sauer also reiterated the administration's argument that the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment was intended ""to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children.""

The rulings in question, he said, rely on the ""mistaken view"" that ""birth on U.S. territory confers citizenship on anyone subject to the regulatory reach of U.S. law became pervasive, with destructive consequences.""

Notably, he opted not to ask the justices to fast-track the case, meaning that oral arguments would not likely be scheduled before the end of the year. More details from the high court could come as early as this month, after challengers file their responses to the high court.

What's changed?

In short, not much. Though the Supreme Court technically reviewed the case in May, both the Trump administration's appeal to the court, and the justices themselves, steered clear of addressing the merits of the order in their first review.

Instead, the appeal, and the May oral arguments, focused narrowly on the ability of lower courts to issue so-called ""universal,"" or nationwide injunctions that block a president's executive order from taking force across the country.

In June, justices ruled 6-3 that plaintiffs seeking nationwide relief must bring the cases as class action lawsuits, narrowing the instances in which lower district courts can issue universal injunctions.

And while justices for the Supreme Court majority appeared to view the birthright citizenship case as a valid pretext for the administration to challenge lower court authorities, it did not impact the fate of the order itself, which was blocked by multiple federal courts in the weeks after the Supreme Court's decision.

LAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS

Trump's order

The executive order at issue was signed by Trump on Jan. 20, the first day of his second White House term. It directs all U.S. government agencies to refuse to issue citizenship documents to children born to illegal immigrants, or children who do not have at least one parent who is an American or a lawful permanent resident.

The order seeks to clarify the 14th Amendment, which states, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""

Instead, the language proposed by Trump officials — and subsequently blocked in court — would be changed to note that individuals born to illegal immigrant parents, or those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright.

Public perception

Trump's order on birthright citizenship has provoked intense criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, who note that the U.S. is one of some 30 countries around the world where birthright citizenship has long been afforded.

It was almost immediately challenged in court by more than 22 U.S. states and immigrant advocacy groups, which warned that possible fallout from the order could prove ""catastrophic.""

Its legal bona fides remain unclear, and to date, no court has sided with the Trump administration in enforcing the order.

Still, critics have noted the deep uncertainty the order, and the lack of clear court consensus, has caused for many Americans, and residents living here without permanent citizenship.

Ian Roberts had been under the impression from a prior attorney that his immigration case was “resolved successfully,” said attorney Alfredo Parrish. His law firm filed a request to stay Roberts’ deportation with an immigration court in Omaha, Nebraska, and was working on another motion to reopen the educator’s immigration proceedings.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Roberts last week, saying the Guyana native and former Olympic runner was living and working in the country illegally. A state board stripped Roberts’ license to be superintendent.

The Des Moines school board voted Monday to put Roberts on unpaid leave from his job leading the district, which has more than 30,000 students.

Roberts submitted a letter through his attorney announcing his immediate resignation Tuesday, saying he didn’t want to distract district leaders and teachers from focusing on education.

Hours later, the board unanimously voted to accept his resignation, finding he no longer was authorized to work for the district.

“It is a sad and troubling end for an individual who gave many people, especially our students, hope,” board chair Jackie Norris said.

The backlash from the arrest was far from over.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division announced Tuesday it would investigate whether the district has engaged in racial discrimination by favoring non-white applicants as part of a plan to “increase the number of teachers of color.” A district spokesperson said the matter was under review.

Meanwhile, hundreds of high school students marched out of their classrooms Tuesday to protest Roberts’ arrest and ICE’s broader crackdown on illegal immigration.

Roberts, 54, is being held at the Woodbury County Jail in Sioux City, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Des Moines.

Parrish described Roberts as a “tremendous advocate to this community” and an inspiration to students, and he thanked the public for an outpouring of support. Parrish said he and other lawyers spoke with Roberts for hours Tuesday and “his spirits are high.”

Parrish cautioned that it was a “very complex case” that will take time to investigate. He acknowledged Roberts could face deportation at any moment, and it was uncertain whether his new appeals would be considered by the court.

Federal authorities are also investigating how Roberts obtained a handgun that was allegedly found in his district vehicle during last week’s arrest, which could lead to criminal charges.

The office of U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, a Republican who represents the Des Moines area, released a redacted excerpt of Roberts’ May 2024 removal order Tuesday after obtaining the document through the Freedom of Information Act.

The document alleges Roberts was provided notice to appear at a removal hearing but failed to show or otherwise apply for relief.

An immigration judge found the Department of Homeland Security submitted adequate evidence to support its allegations that Roberts was subject to removal. The judge ordered Roberts to make arrangements to voluntarily leave or face deportation.

Parrish affirmed his client was born in Guyana. But Parrish did not say whether he had ever applied for U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, when his work authorization may have expired, and what happened during the removal proceedings last year.

He released a March 2025 letter that he said was from Roberts’ prior attorney in Texas informing her client that the case had been closed in his favor.

“It has been my pleasure to represent you throughout this process, and I am pleased to report that your case has reached a successful resolution,” Texas attorney Jackeline Gonzalez wrote.

An aide to Gonzalez confirmed the law firm had represented Roberts but gave no immediate comment.

Norris said the district had not been notified of the removal order until it received a copy Monday.

She said Roberts signed a form attesting that he was a U.S. citizen when he was hired in 2023, and he submitted a Social Security card and a driver’s license as verification.

When Roberts was cited for traffic violations in Iowa in 2023 and 2024, he presented a Maryland driver’s license in each case that had different addresses, the tickets show.

Roberts has been registered to vote at one of the addresses since at least 2017, according to a Maryland voter registration database. The Maryland Board of Elections said Roberts’ registration may have been unintentional, and a review “did not show any voting history.”

A Maryland Department of Transportation spokesperson said Roberts held a state license from 2001 to 2024, when it was exchanged to New York.

Internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement records obtained by the Washington Post in August named the vacant Prairie Correctional Facility in Appleton as a piece of the plan to expand immigrant detention capacity to more than 100,000 beds by the end of the year — about a 66% increase from April.

Faith leaders from across the state joined Appleton residents in a prayer vigil in protest of the prison’s potential reopening Tuesday. One resident, with supporters in tow, delivered a letter to local leaders, signed by a number of faith leaders and immigrant rights organizations, opposing the detention center plans and requesting transparency.

“Appleton, frankly, is going to be a real hotbed of resistance,” said Rev. Daniel Romero of Disciples Public Presence, a social justice advocacy arm of the Disciples of Christ church.

The documents obtained by the Post were preliminary plans and were still in flux at the time of reporting, but the prison’s owners, CoreCivic, and ICE have not denied the reports.

Appleton City Administrator John Olinger told MPR News in August that CoreCivic was “aggressively pursuing” a contract with ICE.

ICE and its enforcement and detention tactics have become a flashpoint as the Trump administration attempts a mass deportation campaign, while human rights activists and civil libertarians demand more scrutiny and accountability.

On Tuesday, for instance, U.S. District Court Judge William Young, a Reagan-appointee, slammed the Trump administration for using deportations as a way to stamp out the free speech rights of immigrant pro-Palestinian demonstrators. He called the conduct of the administration unconstitutional and “a thing virtually unknown to our constitutional tradition.”

In a statement to the Reformer, an ICE spokesperson said the agency “is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity.” The Republican megalaw passed in July boosted funding for immigrant detention and deportation by $176 billion, with $45 billion set aside for expanding detention capacity.

CoreCivic spokesman Brian Todd said the company “continue(s) to explore opportunities with our government partners for which our Prairie Correctional Facility could be a viable solution.”

Prairie Correctional Facility was Minnesota’s only private prison until it shut down in 2010. A state law passed by the DFL-Legislature in 2023 bans private prison contracts at the state level — but won’t impact the federal government’s efforts to establish a private detention facility in Minnesota.

The resistance is certainly present — if not widespread — in Appleton, which Trump won in 2024 by 27 points. As dozens of people gathered to sing and pray together in the green space next to Appleton City Hall, a truck circled the block with an American flag flying and a “WELCOME ICE” sign.

Shrouded in secrecy After the CRAC meeting, officials acknowledged the reality of ICE deportation flights at RIC.
The federal government, whoever's doing the ICE flights isn't disclosing to [media].
It is unclear if the ICE deportation flights are counted among them.","The volume and frequency of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights from Richmond International Airport this year, detailed in a Henrico Citizen investigation last week, has caught some airport officials and board members by surprise.

At the regularly scheduled monthly Capital Region Airport Commission meeting Sept. 30 that largely was devoted to the airport’s growth, Vice Chair Tyrone Nelson, who represents the Varina District (the home of the airport) veered briefly from the planned agenda to express concern about information reported in a recent Citizen article that detailed ICE flights from the airport.

“I've got my personal feelings about deportation efforts that are being done for political clout,"" Nelson said to the CRAC. ""Not everyone that’s being whipped up into planes and [being put in] chains are criminals that are doing harm to the United States of America. I think it’s wrong and inhumane. That’s my feeling about it, but as a commissioner, I do think that something of this magnitude, we really should know what’s going on.”

At least 80 “shuffle flights” this year have originated from RIC, traveling to a federal detention hub in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to Human Rights First, which is monitoring the flights that have spiked since the Trump administration has pursued an unprecedented mass deportation agenda.

There were 32 deportation flights from RIC during the same time span in 2024, according to HRF records.

CRAC owns and operates Richmond International Airport. The commission directs the growth, operation and business activities of RIC and “works tirelessly to ensure it continues to be an affordable option for local, regional and out-of-state travelers,” according to its website.

At Tuesday's meeting, Nelson said the airport had an obligation to keep its 14-member commission informed of deportation flights because of the human rights concerns.

“I had not heard anything about ICE [deportation] flights out of the Richmond Jet Center, and I had gotten a lot of questions, comments and concerns. I have my own concerns about being on the airport commission and not [knowing],” said Nelson, who requested that officials from fixed-base operator Richmond Jet Center, which is facilitating the ICE flights at RIC, attend the next commission meeting to provide details about those flights.

“When we had discussions with the FBOs, I heard nothing about this, and this was going on last year. So, I think we need to know what’s going on,” Nelson said.

“To be honest. I don’t know what activities are going on along those lines,” CRAC chairman Charles S. Macfarlane (founder of strategic advisory and investment firm Macfarlane Partners) replied to Nelson. “I would assume if the jets are here, it’s the FBI or other federal services that are getting fueled.”

CRAC President and CEO Perry Miller said he would report to the CRAC about ICE deportation activities at the body’s meeting next month.

The rest of Tuesday's meeting proceeded according to its agenda, as the commission passed proposals previously approved by the CRAC finance and audit committee (including signing on Frontier Airlines, which kicks off routes to Atlanta and Denver this month; expanding space for UPS; renewing a contract for the Martin Air FBO; and including the QubicaAMF bowling company in the airport’s Foreign-Trade Zone).

Fairfield District Supervisor Roscoe Cooper, one of Henrico's other three representatives on the CRAC, told the Citizen last week that he was not aware of the ICE flights at the airport either and that he intended to learn more.

The other two county representatives on the commission (Three Chopt District Supervisor Misty Roundtree and Bobby Ukrop), as well as local and state congressional representatives, have not yet responded to requests for comment.

ICE also has not responded to email and Freedom of Information Act requests for more information about the numbers of flights as well as the people, carriers and contractors involved in them.

Shrouded in secrecy

After the CRAC meeting, officials acknowledged the reality of ICE deportation flights at RIC.

“It’s not new,” said Miller. “It’s a change in volume.”

Miller said the Richmond airport is neither informed nor able to offer input on the use of the facility by ICE or a contractor.

“We are federally obligated to follow the laws. The federal government, whoever's doing the ICE flights isn't disclosing to [media]. They're not disclosing to us either,” Miller said.

RIC cannot pick or choose who uses the airport, according to RIC spokesperson Troy Bell.

“But I can understand a perspective like Rev. Nelson mentioned because, personally, he has some concerns. It's possible to do both. And that's what some of the members have to do right now,” Bell said.

The details of the ICE flights are difficult to track even from the airport side; staffers said they don’t track flights utilizing the FBO’s private terminals. However, according to airport statistics, the number of enplaned “charter and other” flight passengers (2,864) is up 50% this year. Charter flights are just 1% of RIC’s market share. It is unclear if the ICE deportation flights are counted among them.

The Richmond Air Traffic Control tower tracks all flights that arrive at and depart from RIC, but the person who answered the call button Tuesday morning to the gated building from a reporter inquiring for clarity about the ICE flights pointed back to the CRAC or the Federal Aviation Administration and disconnected the phone.

Bell said that ICE flights tend to be airplanes with the same tail number showing up “all the time, even if it won't report to you or me who owns the plane.”

Even when airport staffers input the ICE-contracted airplane identification numbers – if they are provided – Bell said, information systems that track flights show the carriers as “unknown.”

Ownership information for the “Tyson"" ICE flights (an identifier frequently used for the flights and one that is most commonly associated with President Trump's personal plane, perhaps as a nod to former boxer and Trump supporter Mike Tyson) are not available on sites such as FlightAware, adding another layer of secrecy to the government-funded flights.

'Unprecedented' quick movement of people

The secrecy also is a concern to Sophia Leticia Gregg, an immigrant rights attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, who was struck by the extent of the ICE deportation flights emanating from RIC as reported by the Citizen. ACLU VA is focusing on “the rampant and indiscriminate arrests of non-citizens in Virginia specifically, and the conditions that they face when they're in detention, and their lack of due process” Gregg said.

Gregg views the spike in deportation flights a result of the increase and what she termed disproportionate enforcement in the Washington, D.C. and Virginia area.

“We're seeing large numbers of arrests happening here. This is another downstream result of that and the entire dehumanization and inhumane conditions in which ICE puts people into,” Gregg said.

The frequent flights facilitate the ramped-up enforcement and rapid transfer of people out of the jurisdiction in which they are living, in Gregg's opinion as a way to thwart any litigation and challenges to the legality of their arrest, and to get them down south as quickly as possible to the Fifth Circuit.

“The movement of individuals quickly is unprecedented from our view,” said Gregg, who has communicated with clients who had been transported to the Alexandria, Louisiana airport detention centers. “The concerns about the treatment of individuals is accurate, as has been described by our clients and the experiences that they've had, the shackling, the chaining of them, the overcrowding, the lack of food or water while they're being moved around on these flights or generally transferred from facility to facility.

“It’s our view that the conditions in which people are suffering as a result of these flights and transfers is because of ICE. It's because of the federal government. It's Department of Homeland Security's custody and control. Their conditions and their abuses suffered are a result of the Department of Homeland Security's neglect or intentional treatment.”

Gregg has heard of people in ICE detention who are shackled for days at a time.

“We're hearing of people who might be taken from one facility in Virginia shackled in four-point restraints, where they might be just waiting on the bus to get on the plane in those shackles for hours at a time,” Gregg said.

“Then they board the flight, then they might be taken to Alexandria, [Louisiana], not even to deboard. The plane may then be flown to another location for another hours-long flight, all while being shackled, being provided minimal food and water during that entire process. And, depending on the flight plans, for wherever DHS is taking them to, it could be 24 hours from one facility to the next, and during that entire period, they are shackled completely.”

Detained people that Gregg hears from have told her that they are not given access to counsel during any transitory period, she said.

“They're oftentimes not given access to use the restroom as they need or given sufficient food during that period,” Gregg said.

ICE officials have not yet responded to the Citizen's requests for comment.

Reid: 'We ALL must obey the law'

Richmond Jet Center president and CEO Michael Clarke sent a statement to the Citizen this week to clarify the company's role in the ICE deportation flights, indicating that it doesn’t decide what air carriers the company serves.

“Richmond Jet Center provides critical services such as fueling, deicing and repairs for commercial airlines and general aviation customers, including corporate and charter aircraft, flying to and from Richmond,"" Clarke wrote. “Our team also provides services for military aircraft and other federal and state agencies that utilize the Richmond International Airport. As a small, family-owned business that has proudly served RIC for nearly 80 years, we remain focused on safely providing the highest-quality service to the airport and all of its customers.”

Some reactions by readers and followers of the Citizen to its initial report last week focused on moral issues, while other comments took a political tenor.

Facebook comments varied in opinion.

“Oh no. . . here right under our noses. . . who knew,” wrote one respondent, adding vomit emojis.

“Let’s go ICE!” wrote another.

Wrote a third: “Alternate story title: 'Law enforcement uses airport.'

“This is what we voted for. Law and Order,” wrote another.

Even John Reid, the Republican candidate for the statewide lieutenant governor role left a comment on the Citizen's Facebook page.

“We ALL must obey the law,” Reid said. ""If the people who are so upset about the flights really cared they’d be raising money for legal help for their illegal friends. It is very important that everyone be put on notice: the old days of living here without documents if you are not a citizen are over. We do not have to apologize for that.”

One person who agreed with Reid emphasized the need to fix the immigration laws “so we can attract the best of the world to the U.S. We have always been made greater by immigrants bringing in skills and education we need.”",https://www.henricocitizen.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/09/IMG_6246.JPG,N,,2025-10-01 15:56:58.395503

Many airport employees, including air traffic controllers, are required to report to work during the government shutdown — but they will do so without pay, and staffing issues are likely to arise.

Here’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.

1️⃣ Government shutdown

The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure before the midnight deadline. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed, while many others deemed essential will continue working but will not receive pay until the impasse ends. As tensions escalate on Capitol Hill, Republicans insist that Democrats must agree to extend current funding for an additional seven weeks. Democrats refuse to do so without major concessions over enhanced Obamacare subsidies. The Senate will vote again today on the GOP funding plan, which Republicans vow to put on the floor daily until Democrats agree to reopen the government.

2️⃣ US military

President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are laying out a new vision for the US military. They addressed a gathering of top admirals and generals in Virginia on Tuesday, with Hegseth detailing new directives slamming diversity and bashing what he called “stupid rules of engagement.” Rules of engagement are directives governing how and when force can be used by the military. The defense chief also said combat troops will have to meet the “highest male standard,” and if that means there are no women in combat roles, “it is what it is,” Hegseth said. President Trump followed Hegseth with his own remarks, telling America’s military brass that “we’re under an invasion from within” as he defended his domestic crackdown.

3️⃣ ICE agents

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were seen on video grabbing and shoving journalists at a New York court on Tuesday, sparking swift condemnation from immigrant rights groups and Democratic lawmakers. The incident comes as tensions are escalating nationally over ICE tactics and press freedom. Critics argue that officers are being overly aggressive, while the agency says that the safety of agents is at risk. The journalists were documenting an arrest when they were shoved, according to the New York Immigration Coalition. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security offered a different account, saying the ICE agents were “swarmed by agitators and members of the press” while arresting an immigrant from Peru.

4️⃣ Hurricanes

Twin hurricanes Imelda and Humberto are churning up powerful waves along the US East Coast as the storms head toward Bermuda. The island is facing a rare one-two punch from the hurricanes, with Humberto passing nearby Tuesday and Imelda potentially making a direct hit today. In North Carolina’s Outer Banks, at least five homes collapsed into the ocean, the National Park Service said. Dramatic video shows the homes breaking apart and being swept away by waves as the surf battered the shoreline. Notably, the US has avoided a hurricane landfall so far this year. If this streak holds, it would be the first season without a storm coming ashore at hurricane strength in a decade.

5️⃣ Philippines earthquake

A 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines on Tuesday, killing at least 60 people and injuring more than 150 others. Several buildings collapsed, littering streets with debris after the shallow quake struck around 10 p.m. local time, just west of Palompon. Emergency services are scrambling to find survivors today, with military troops, police and civilian volunteers carrying out door-by-door searches. More than half a million people felt strong shaking across the Visayan Islands, which include Cebu, Biliran and Leyte, according to estimates from the US Geological Survey.

Mayor Katrina Thompson, Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills and Acting Fire Chief Matt Martin all spoke harshly about the actions at the Broadview ICE facility, especially the use of chemical agent and tear gas on protesters outside.
""The relentless deployment of tear gas, pepper spray and mace at the ICE facility is endangering nearby village residents, harming police officers, harming firefighters and American citizens exercising their First Amendment rights,"" Mayor Thompson said.
He said the fire department reached out to DHS immediately upon the fence's appearance on Sept. 23 to demand its removal, but DHS officials have not responded.

Mayor Katrina Thompson, Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills and Acting Fire Chief Matt Martin all spoke harshly about the actions at the Broadview ICE facility, especially the use of chemical agent and tear gas on protesters outside.

""The relentless deployment of tear gas, pepper spray and mace at the ICE facility is endangering nearby village residents, harming police officers, harming firefighters and American citizens exercising their First Amendment rights,"" Mayor Thompson said.

She said the gas has a 200 to 700 foot radius of effect when it's deployed, but wind can and does carry the chemical agents further. It has exposed people who live nearby as well as nearby businesses that are vital to the community.

Mills recounted that on several occasions his officers have been ""verbally abused"" by ICE agents at the Broadview facility, including one agent telling an officer that ""he was a fascist and wasn't doing his job"" on Sept. 12.

""I was offended because I, in my 37 years working with the Chicago Police Department, I've worked with a lot of federal agencies on criminal investigations, that has never happened,"" Mills said. ""We may not have always seen eye to eye, but we've always been able to work it out for the good of the community.""

Thompson and Mills said the use of tear gas and chemical agents is directly impacting the health and safety of public employees, with each deployment forcing officers, firefighters and EMTs to be taken out of action to recover.

""This unacceptable risk to those sworn to protect the community is a profound failure of the federal government to be a good neighbor,"" Thompson said. ""It also is a moral failure.""

Acting Chief Martin also said the fence that was constructed on a public street outside the facility was put up illegally and poses an ongoing safety threat because it is blocking fire department access to businesses in that area in case of an emergency.

""The risk of tragedy increases every day the fence remains,"" Martin said.

Martin also said the department is exploring ""all options"" regarding removing the fence on their own. He said the fire department reached out to DHS immediately upon the fence's appearance on Sept. 23 to demand its removal, but DHS officials have not responded.

Village officials said they have opened investigations into two hit-and-run incidents involving a vehicle striking a pedestrian, as well as a criminal damage to property for a pepper ball fired at CBS News Chicago reporter Asal Rezaei on Sunday.

Speaking one-on-one with CBS News Chicago after the news conference, Mills said ICE's actions involving Rezaei shocked hiim.

""I just couldn't believe it,"" he said. ""When it happened, there was just no reason. I don't understand it.""

DHS denied in a statement that any agent ""attacked"" a member of the press.

Village officials sent a letter to DHS asking for their cooperation in the criminal investigations. Mills said he received a response confirming the department would cooperate, but they have not yet given police any information pertinent to the investigation.

The officials also slammed statement made by DHS that officers had failed to respond to DHS and ICE agent concerns, repeating they have only received one call for help from the facility about debris being thrown on the train tracks behind the building.

Thompson said the village is demanding ICE ""stop issuing falsehoods"" in their official communications, stop putting their public servants and residents in harm's way, and stop attacking peaceful protesters and journalists, in what Mills said is a public safety crisis.

""We are experiencing an immediate public safety crisis,"" Mills said. ""The deployment of tear gas, pepper spray mace and rubber bullets by ICE near the processing center in the village of Broadview is creating a dangerous situation for the community.""

""This is not Putin's Russia,"" Thompson said. ""This is America.""

She encouraged the protesters to continue to exercise their right to free speech peaceful, invoking Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his instruction to ""forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline.""

""I want you to raise your voices, not your fists,"" she said.

The officials said they are committed to the safety and wellbeing of their residents and will continue to press DHS and ICE for accountability and to comply with local laws until ""an end to the current community siege.""

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons released a statement in response, denouncing the mayor's letter and saying in part, ""Mayor Thompson is distorting reality, pointing her finger in the wrong direction, while our officers are protecting her community – and others – from real threats, while also facing skyrocketing violence against them, including at the Broadview facility.""

WASHINGTON, DC— UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguía issued the following statement regarding Congress’ inability to keep the federal government open:

“As the federal government shuts down, our nation faces a looming health care crisis driven by the reckless cuts in the federal budget law passed this year by the Republican majorities in Congress at the direction of the Trump administration.

We applaud the lawmakers who are fighting to address this crisis and the consequences working families will face.

“This shutdown comes as communities across the country are voicing their concerns not just about the affordability of health care but also the devastating impact of unlawful immigration enforcement operations and the militarization of communities, like we have already seen in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Memphis and Portland. These tactics are decimating local businesses and economies and indiscriminately harming U.S. citizens and legal residents.

“Congress must urgently address the Trump administration’s abuse of power and must make sure that any funding package protects access to affordable health care. Now more than ever, families need stability, not a government shutdown and disruptions of critical services.”

Four days later, a mentally troubled neo-Nazi went to the offices of immigration law firm Duncan Lewis with the intention of killing its solicitors because they helped immigrants.
Muhunthan Paramesvaran, a partner at Wilsons, is chair of the Law Society’s immigration law committee.
Immigration lawyers were warned to take extra security measures, or stay away from work, amid far-right threats to their firms.
The biggest problem, says McKenzie, is the lack of highly skilled people making asylum decisions.","Some lawyers approached by the Gazette for this article did not want to comment on the record, for fear of putting themselves and colleagues at risk. That is perfectly understandable. Lawyers acting for refugees and asylum seekers have increasingly become the target of vitriolic abuse and even death threats, as successive governments fail to ‘stop the boats’ or ‘smash the gangs’.

The ‘hostile environment’, they note, is fuelling the perception that migrants are to blame for all manner of societal woes, from housing shortages to NHS waiting lists.

In 2020, home secretary Priti Patel deployed social media to accuse ‘activist lawyers’ of frustrating efforts to remove ‘migrants’. Four days later, a mentally troubled neo-Nazi went to the offices of immigration law firm Duncan Lewis with the intention of killing its solicitors because they helped immigrants. Cavan Medlock was deemed too mentally unwell to stand trial and sentenced to a hospital order.

Jacqueline McKenzie, head of immigration and asylum at Leigh Day, has direct experience of being personally targeted. In 2023, the Conservative party compiled a dossier briefing against her which was sent to select national media. It labelled McKenzie an ‘open borders activist’.

Threats, many sent to her work email, included rape and drowning. She was called a ‘n*****-lover’. Her home address was publicly circulated.

The Law Society and Bar Council responded with a joint statement expressing grave concern at the attacks.

Clients, McKenzie tells the Gazette, are ‘demonised’ by sections of the media, political organisations and commentators. In addition to general flag-waving, this has led to more serious consequences such as demonstrations outside asylum accommodation, riots, threats of violence and most recently the London demonstration led by far-right agitator Tommy Robinson (Stephen Yaxley-Lennon).

Muhunthan Paramesvaran, a partner at Wilsons, is chair of the Law Society’s immigration law committee. ‘The threat has got progressively worse and more vitriolic over the last few years,’ he says, ‘as successive home secretaries have attacked lawyers.’

Cross-party shame

The change of government to Labour, led by a prime minister who was a human rights barrister, has made little difference. Last month, Jo White, Labour MP for Bassetlaw and chair of the parliamentary party’s ‘Red Wall Caucus’, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that asylum solicitors are ‘ambulance-chasers’ and blamed them for the ‘broken’ appeal system.

‘I think for many solicitors it’s a licence to print money,’ White said. Her solution was for the government to make it as ‘unpleasant’ and ‘difficult’ as possible for people to claim asylum here.

Responding, Paramesvaran says: ‘Apart from contributing to a febrile atmosphere, they are completely wrong. Lawyers in this field largely work on legal aid rates that haven’t increased for 25 years and are barely enough to cover the cost of employing someone to do the work.

‘Lawyers have been subjected to death threats, vitriolic comments on social media and threatening letters for doing their job, representing some of the most vulnerable people in our community, complying with their professional obligations and acting in the best interests of their client within the confines of the law’.

The temperature rose markedly in July 2024 with the Southport stabbings. Three schoolgirls were murdered – a crime initially and wrongly blamed on an asylum seeker. Immigration lawyers were warned to take extra security measures, or stay away from work, amid far-right threats to their firms.

Lawyers’ groups warned that members were at risk after a list of 60 immigration advice centres was circulated via messaging app Telegram, with the suggestion that they should be the target of protests.

Judges are also in the line of fire, including from senior politicians. In February, Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch heavily criticised a judgment in a case concerning a Palestinian family who had applied for asylum using the wrong form.

Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick MP, meanwhile, a former City solicitor, has singled out immigration judges for criticism on social media, declaring that judges are ‘too political’ and their decisions could ‘undermine public confidence’.

Following the Court of Appeal’s ruling on asylum seekers being housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Lord Justice Bean became the latest target.

And while not directly criticising the lawyers or judges involved, Shabana Mahmood MP – barrister, former justice secretary and now home secretary, laid into ‘vexatious, last-minute claims’ when a High Court decision delayed the deportation of an Eritrean man under the ‘one in, one out’ deal agreed with France. Such claims ‘make a mockery of our laws and this country’s generosity’, she claimed.

A Law Society spokesperson stresses: ‘Immigration solicitors are currently facing very real and tangible threats to their lives and safety – they are targeted because of the work they do.’ Politicians ‘want to pin the blame’ on lawyers and judges, he added, which ‘needs to stop’.

Zoe Bantleman, legal director of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, says: ‘Immigration and asylum law has become sensationalised and distorted, exposing individuals, those who represent them, and those who decide on their appeals to unnecessary and unacceptable threats and danger’.

Bantleman wants the government to ‘educate and inform society as a whole of the importance and value of upholding the rule of law’. That also means telling the public the truth that ‘people have a legal right to seek asylum from persecution’.

Channel crossing

More than 30,000 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats since the start of the year – the highest numbers coming from Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran. Deterring small boat arrivals by removing the ability to claim asylum in the UK was a key focus of the Conservative government – both through its failed scheme to send individuals to Rwanda and the Illegal Migration Act 2023, which removed the right of those arriving ‘illegally’ to stay or claim asylum.

Labour began in government by stating it would repeal the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024 and much of the Illegal Migration Act 2023. That will be achieved in the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill (see below), which also hands more powers to law enforcement agencies to ‘smash the gangs’ facilitating Channel crossings.

Nevertheless, some lawyers accuse the party of ‘lurching to the right’ on immigration as Nigel Farage’s Reform UK rises in the polls. Appointed home secretary in the recent Cabinet reshuffle, Mahmood has pledged to go ‘further and faster’ on tackling small boat arrivals. She is expected to take a tougher line on immigration than predecessor Yvette Cooper.

Many lawyers doubt that the ‘one in, one out’ scheme brokered by Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron will deter arrivals. More than 100 small boat migrants have been detained pending removal to France, but some predict that larger numbers are likely to arrive in the UK despite the treaty agreed in August.

Decisions and backlogs

More widely, most agree with a briefing from lawyer-run website Free Movement that the asylum system is ‘broken’ and that it was ‘the Conservative government that broke it’. The system has been ‘overwhelmed’ – not by new arrivals, but by ‘mismanagement’.

Latest Home Office figures show that the number of cases in the asylum system increased more than fourfold in the decade to June 2024, to 224,742. By the end of last year, some 91,000 cases were awaiting an initial decision. This was 31% lower than the peak reached in 2022, but there was an additional appeals backlog of 42,000.

By June 2025, more than 19,000 people had been waiting longer than a year for an initial decision. These delays, says Diana Baxter, a partner at Wesley Gryk, leave clients and their families in limbo, which can have a detrimental effect on their mental and physical wellbeing.

At their annual conference in Bournemouth last weekend, the Liberal Democrats branded the asylum backlogs a ‘national emergency’. The party has called for ‘Nightingale processing centres’ to clear the lists in six months and reduce the use of hotels.

Liz Barratt , head of immigration and asylum law at Bindmans, argues that ministers’ focus on detention and removal addresses the problem ‘from the wrong end’. The government should instead target resources at reducing the backlog of cases by increasing the quality and speed of initial decisions by Home Office staff – thereby reducing the number of appeals, she says.

Since Labour came to power, initial decisions have been made more quickly. But some lawyers say the emphasis on speed has come at the cost of accuracy and quality, shifting the problem to the tribunal system.

In 2024, 47% of applicants were granted asylum at the initial decision stage. Three-quarters of those rejected lodged an appeal, of which 33% were successful. This suggests many appeals would not have been necessary if the initial decision had been properly reached.

The biggest problem, says McKenzie, is the lack of highly skilled people making asylum decisions. ‘Very often, the decisions are a cut-and-paste job with an inadequate application of the evidence. Sometimes they even get the countries wrong and very often the facts are wrong,’ she says.

Home Office data shows the poor quality of its decision-making. In 2023/24, only 52% of decisions reviewed passed the department’s own quality test.

Jawaid Luqmani, a founding partner of north London immigration and asylum-focused law firm Luqmani Thompson, suggests that sensible concessions rather than spurious appeals, and allowing applications from countries with a 90% or above success rate (subject to criminal checks), would speed cases up by months and save money on hotels.

The delays, notes Barratt, are also exacerbated by a shortage of legal aid lawyers arising from low rates of pay, which leaves applicants unrepresented.

The government plans to overhaul the asylum appeals system, replacing tribunal judges with ‘independent adjudicators’. Details are scant, but Luqmani describes the change as ‘semantic’. There will still need to be a system to appeal adjudicators’ decisions, he suggests – otherwise the High Court will be ‘bombarded’ with judicial reviews.

Ministers have also argued that refugees can come via safe and legal routes, but these presently exist only for those coming from Ukraine or Hong Kong. In 2023, 102,283 people were offered a safe and legal (humanitarian) route to come to, or remain in, the UK. Almost half were on Ukraine schemes.

By suspending the family reunion scheme that allowed relatives to join refugees, Paramesvaran notes that ministers have also closed a legal route, adding to the number of people prepared to attempt a small-boat crossing.

Ministers have also mooted the idea of suspending commitments entered into under the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998. Yet lawyers argue this will do nothing to prevent people from attempting to come here, or help deal with those already on our shores. Applicants would still have common law rights to sanctuary, too.

Attorney general Lord Hermer suggests it is a ‘political trick’ to pretend that any meaningful changes to the ECHR could be achieved in time to ‘make a difference’. Even so, Mahmood is expected to publish an asylum white paper setting out how the government intends to tighten the way judges interpret the convention in British courts.

First and foremost, lawyers stress that the government must be honest about the facts. ‘We get hardly anyone coming to the UK [seeking asylum] compared to the rest of the world, and the majority of people coming here arrive with student or work visas,’ stresses McKenzie.

‘There are 120 million people displaced around the world,’ she adds, with most going to poorer countries. ‘We are supposed to be the fifth-richest country in the world, but we can’t accommodate a small number of asylum seekers a year? Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, has taken in over one million Rohingya.’

Most asylum seekers coming to the UK will be permitted to stay, but while their claims are assessed, they are not allowed to work and they receive just £9.95 a week (if meals are provided at their allotted accommodation). Allowing them to work or study would save taxpayer money and benefit those seeking refuge here, says Baxter.

S Chelvan, a barrister at 33 Bedford Row, advocates repealing section 40 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, which makes it a criminal offence to arrive in the UK without a valid entry clearance. ‘We need to burst the balloon of hate and fear that has been created by labelling asylum applicants as illegal and criminal’, and ‘go back to our understanding and acceptance that it is not illegal to claim asylum.’

Ultimately, says Barratt: ‘This is a global issue that requires a global solution. There are people in crisis and on the move all over the world, and with global warming, it will only get worse.’",https://www.ein.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/immigration_word.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 11:58:44.325668

Under the new legislation, individuals whose asylum applications are rejected must leave Greece within 14 days. Failure to comply can result in prison sentences of two to five years, fines of up to €10,000, and mandatory electronic ankle monitoring. The law also extends detention periods for undocumented migrants from 18 to 24 months and removes the possibility for long-term undocumented residents to regularize their status—a process that previously allowed residents to apply for a permit after seven years of continuous stay.

The Greek government argues that these measures are necessary to deter irregular migration and enhance border security, while also using electronic monitoring to expedite deportations.

However, the law has sparked strong opposition. Legal experts, administrative judges, the Greek Ombudsman and international human rights organizations warn that it violates fundamental rights, undermines the right to asylum and contradicts the principle of non-refoulement, which protects individuals from being returned to countries where they face serious threats.

Civil society groups have also expressed alarm over proposed changes that would give the government increased authority to control migration-related NGOs. Organizations that oppose government policies or challenge state decisions risk being removed from the official registry. Losing registry status would block access to state-run migrant facilities, making it harder for NGOs to assist and monitor the conditions of detained migrants.

In September, four civil society organizations formally requested the European Commission to investigate Greece’s three-month suspension of the right to asylum for people arriving from North Africa by sea. They argue that the measure breaches EU and international human rights standards and have called for urgent intervention to protect the rights of affected migrants.

The law is expected to have a profound impact on migrants, particularly those from African countries. Extended detention periods, fines and electronic monitoring could increase the challenges faced by individuals already in precarious situations.

As Illinois leaders warned Monday of a National Guard deployment, residents in the nation's third-largest city met a brazen weekend escalation of immigration enforcement tactics with anger, fear and fresh claims of discrimination.

""It looks un-American,"" said Chicago Alderman Brendan Reilly, who represents downtown on the City Council. He deemed the Sunday display a ""photo op"" for President Donald Trump, echoing other leaders.

Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon, also braced for a federal law enforcement surge. Meanwhile, Louisiana's governor asked for a National Guard deployment to New Orleans and other cities.

Trump has called the expansion of federal immigration agents and National Guard troops into American cities necessary, blasting Democrats for crime and lax immigration policies. Following a crime crackdown in the District of Columbia and immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, he's referred to Portland as ""war-ravaged"" and threatened apocalyptic force in Chicago.

""Whether it takes place here in the city or the suburbs, it's all the same to us,"" Border Patrol agent Gregory Bovino said in Chicago.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has issued a memo that also directs component agencies within the Justice Department, including the FBI, to help protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, including in Chicago and Portland.

Here's a snapshot of where things stand with federal law enforcement activity in Chicago, Portland, Memphis and New Orleans.

Chicago raises alarm about racial profiling

Many Chicagoans were already uneasy after an immigration crackdown began earlier this month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

Trump has waffled on sending the military, but Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday it appeared the federal government would deploy 100 troops. Pritzker said the Illinois National Guard received word that the Department of Homeland Security sent a memo to the Defense Department requesting troops to protect ICE personnel and facilities.

An immigration processing center outside Chicago has been the site of frequent protests and aggressive tactics by federal agents.

The enforcement recently escalated, with agents using boats on the Chicago River and marching Sunday on Michigan Avenue and in upscale neighborhoods.

Activists and elected leaders are concerned about discriminatory stops, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted restrictions on roving patrols in LA. The court cleared the way for immigration agents to stop people based on race, language, job or location.

""ICE is running around the Loop, harassing people for not being white,"" Pritzker said, describing the city's core business district.

Activists said a Latino family of four was led away by federal agents Sunday near the popular ""Cloud Gate"" sculpture, commonly called ""The Bean."" Construction workers and bicyclists were also targeted.

""The downtown operation of being racially profiled and kidnapped by immigration in broad daylight represents a major escalation by the Trump administration,"" said Veronica Castro with Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Bovino told The Associated Press that agents will go after ""anyone who is here illegally,"" an approach that fell under immigration authority, known as Title 8. He told the Chicago Sun-Times that a person's appearance goes into the calculation.

""It would be agent experience, intelligence that indicates there's illegal aliens in a particular place or location,"" he told the newspaper. ""Then, obviously, the particular characteristics of an individual, how they look.""

DHS did not return messages Monday.

Chicagoans trail Border Patrol

As Border Patrol agents marched near downtown, a few onlookers nodded in approval and shouted praise while a trail of activists and others urged agents to leave.

Shirley Zuniga was celebrating her 24th birthday when she saw agents. Still wearing a pink birthday sash, she left brunch to follow them.

Zuniga, among the first in her family of Honduran immigrants to be born in the United States, said she forgot all about her birthday plans as she yelled at the agents to go home.

""This is much more important to me,"" she said as she grew emotional. ""I'm celebrating my people.""

Portland goes to court

In Oregon, Democratic Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion in federal court Monday seeking to temporarily block the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard.

The motion is part of a lawsuit Rayfield filed Sunday, after state leaders received a Defense Department memo that said 200 members of the state's National Guard will be placed under federal control for 60 days to ""protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur.""

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek are among local leaders who object to the deployment.

""Putting our own military on our streets is an abuse of power and a disservice to our communities and our service members,"" Rayfield said in a statement Monday.

The ICE building outside of Portland's downtown has been the site of nightly protests that peaked in June, with smaller clashes occurring since then.

A larger crowd demonstrated at the building Sunday. Two people were arrested for assault, according to authorities. That followed a peaceful march earlier in the day that drew thousands to the city's downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

Some residents are already frustrated.

The building manager of the affordable housing complex adjacent to the ICE building said ""the impacts of violent tactics, including tear gas and late-night altercations, are traumatizing for residents,"" including the veterans who live there.

""Sending federal troops will only escalate the situation. The last thing we need is an escalation,"" Reach Community Development said in statement.

Meanwhile, federal agents on Monday searched a home associated with someone who allegedly aimed a laser at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter as it flew over Portland on Saturday evening, the FBI said. Four people, who were found to be in the country illegally, were detained and placed under the custody of ICE, according to the FBI, which did not specify the charges they face.

Memphis residents worry

Memphis was in wait-and-see mode Monday, the first day of a planned federal law enforcement surge ordered by Trump to fight crime. There were no immediate reports of large-scale federal law enforcement operations.

Still some residents, including Latinos, expressed concerns that immigration agents will detain people regardless of immigration status.

""We know the presence of the National Guard will lead to our neighbors being afraid to seek help when they need medical care, need to report crimes, or require social services, because of this military presence,"" said Sandra Pita, a community organizer.

The city has experienced high numbers of violent crimes such as carjackings and homicides in recent years, but both Democratic and Republican officials have noted that the majority-Black city is seeing decreases this year in some categories.

Louisiana's governor asks for National Guard

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on Monday asked for a National Guard deployment to New Orleans and other cities to help his state fight crime.

In a letter sent to to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Landry also praised the president's decision to send troops to Washington and Memphis.

Landry said there has been ""elevated violent crime rates"" in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans as well as shortages in local law enforcement.

But crime in some of the state's biggest cities has actually decreased recently, with New Orleans seeing a particularly steep drop in 2025 that has put it on pace to have its lowest number of killings in more than five decades.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17916473_chicago-agents-downtown-AP-TN-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-01 11:59:01.374335

Why has the US government shut down?

The US government shutdown began on 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT) on Wednesday, which marked the beginning of the new fiscal year, at which point, the past year’s funding for government operations expired.

Republicans control both chambers of Congress, but failed to gather consensus to pass their bill laying out funding for government operations until November 21. Without this bill, the government cannot function.

Democrats refused to support the bill unless Republicans reverse recent cuts to Medicaid enacted under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill in July. Democrats proposed alternative solutions to the bill, but these were rejected by the Republicans. Congress was left deadlocked.

What happens to government employees now?

When the government shuts down, agencies must “furlough” – suspend or discharge – their “non-excepted” – or non-essential – employees.

These furloughed employees receive no pay for the duration of the shutdown. Once the government resumes operations, most will receive back pay, thanks to a 2019 bill passed by Congress enshrining this into law.

That law makes no mention of contract staff, however, meaning cleaning staff and other contractors working in affected government departments and agencies will only be paid if their contracting firm has budgeted for this.

“Excepted” employees are defined as those “who protect life and property”. These essential workers continue in their jobs during the shutdown but won’t be paid until the shutdown ends.

Each agency has already been required to submit its own staffing plan in the event of a government shutdown.

The funding lapse could lead to approximately 750,000 federal employees being furloughed each day of the shutdown, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). This would result in a daily loss of about $400m in wages, it said.

Many of these people may not return to their jobs, however. While the US government has faced dozens of shutdowns before the current one – and federal employees have been furloughed – the White House instructed government agencies to prepare for large-scale layoffs of federal workers in this case, via a memo from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on September 24.

What does ‘furlough’ mean, and how do people pay bills in the meantime?

To be furloughed means to be suspended or discharged for a period of time without pay.

“When you’re furloughed, you’re on leave without pay, just as you might remember that many people were furloughed during the pandemic,” Scott Lucas, a professor of US and international politics at the Ireland-based University College Dublin’s Clinton Institute, told Al Jazeera.

“In this case, however, if you’re without pay, there’s also no federal support payments to cover this.”

Two years into Trump’s first term, in December 2018, a 35-day partial government shutdown occurred – the longest in modern US history – after Congress again failed to agree on government funding. Nine federal departments were fully or partially closed: agriculture, commerce, homeland security, housing and urban development, interior, justice, state, transportation and treasury.

Lucas explained that during that shutdown, many people were forced to take out loans or rely on family and friends to get by. Lucas added that some people went to food banks, which are nonprofit charitable organisations that store surplus amounts of food to distribute to those struggling financially.

“There’s no real safety net for what takes place. So that’s an immediate human cost of what’s going on here,” Lucas said.

What will stay open and what will shut down?

Here is what will happen to different government agencies and other services in the US during the shutdown.

The Social Security Administration will continue to issue disability and retirement benefits since it is funded by mandatory spending. However, it will furlough 12 percent of its staff and put all marketing campaigns on pause, according to its shutdown plan.

Medicare and Medicaid will also continue functioning during the shutdown, since they are also funded by mandatory spending.

The FBI, CIA, Drug Enforcement Administration, Coast Guard and other federal law enforcement agencies will continue to operate during the shutdown, and employees will stay on the job but will be unpaid until the shutdown comes to an end.

The US Postal Service, which earns its revenue from its services and is not funded by tax money, will continue operations during the shutdown. Post offices will remain open.

The International Revenue Service (IRS) will remain fully staffed for the first five days of the shutdown. The agency’s strategy does not detail what will happen to its staff if the shutdown lasts longer than five days. This year, the IRS lost about a quarter of its staff, many as a result of layoffs ordered by the Trump administration, and now employs approximately 75,000 people.

More than 13,000 air traffic controllers will continue to work during the shutdown. However, they will not get paid until the shutdown ends, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). There are more than 14,000 air traffic controllers in the US, according to the FAA website. Most Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees will also continue working.

Courts could run out of funds to remain fully operational as early as Friday, the federal judiciary warned last week. This marks a shift from the last shutdown during Trump’s first term, when courts stayed open for five weeks.

During the shutdown, the two million US military personnel will remain on duty without pay until it ends, and National Guard forces deployed to cities by Trump will also continue working. Trump has ordered the Department of Defense to rename itself the Department of War, but this requires congressional approval.

Most Justice Department staff overseeing the running of immigration courts will continue working, as Trump has declared illegal migration a “national emergency”, according to a statement released by the department.

Employees who coordinate with state and local officials to order immigrant arrests will also remain on the job. Border patrol, immigration enforcement agents and most customs officers will stay at their posts, according to Department of Homeland Security’s shutdown strategy.

The Small Business Administration will furlough 24 percent of its staff, according to its statement.

About 4,000 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees will be furloughed, according to the agency. However, FEMA has about $2.3bn in its Disaster Relief Fund as of September 15, to respond to a disaster such as a major hurricane.

US Customs and Border Protection tariff collections will continue, the Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday. It also said operations funded by US Citizenship and Immigration Services fees would continue, along with services and operations essential for the running of the agency’s exempt activities.

Will Democrats compromise over Medicare cuts in order to resolve this?

It does not seem likely that the Democrats will compromise on their demands for Medicare cuts to be reversed – or for Medicaid subsidies to be extended beyond the end of this year – in order to get government operations up and running again.

When the White House released its memo informing agencies that staff will be laid off, not just furloughed, it earned condemnation from Democratic leaders in Congress.

“This is an attempt at intimidation,” Schumer wrote in response to the memo on X on September 25. Jeffries responded as well, posting on X on the same day: “We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings.”

Lucas said that one reason the Democrats are unlikely to fold now is that “a lot of Democrats wanted to hold the Trump administration to account back in March because the Trump administration was already running roughshod through the government”.

Back then, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was laying off hundreds of thousands of government employees in its bid to cut government spending. Agencies such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID) were shut down completely, a move ruled unconstitutional by US District Court Judge Theodore Chuang. The Trump administration also cut back on research funding in areas such as medical care and the environment.

What else could Trump do during the shutdown?

Trump has taken aim at the Democrats, whom he blames for this shutdown.

“So we’d be laying off a lot of people that are going to be very affected. And they’re Democrats, they’re going to be Democrats,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday.

He added that a “lot of good can come down from shutdowns” and suggested that he could make use of the shutdown to “get rid of a lot of things we didn’t want, and they’d be Democrat things”.

Lucas speculated that Trump is likely referring to US government programmes and departments here. Earlier this year, he signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. However, congressional approval would normally be required for this.

Trump could use the shutdown as an opportunity to find ways to push ahead with such plans. “He’ll label them as ‘Democrat’, whether it means closing agencies, trying to shut down the Department of Education, whether it is completely gutting the ability of other agencies to operate,” Lucas said.

Lucas added that this could also mean undermining the operations of agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, which has now largely become a “tool for the fossil fuel industry”, or the Justice Department’s Office of Civil Rights, which has been “neutered” because its focus has been redirected to “going after Trump’s enemies”.

“It’s anything that doesn’t suit his particular vision of his power. He goes after it. He kills it or he makes it loyal to him. That’s his vision.”

Trump could well use a shutdown to dismantle government functions, Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit focused on improving the federal government, was quoted as saying by PolitiFact.

If lawmakers can’t reach a deal, Stier said, Trump “will have enormous latitude to determine which services, programmes and employees can be sidelined – decisions that could go far beyond what has occurred during past shutdowns”.

How have markets responded to the US government shutdown?

Markets were braced for the shock and have, therefore, remained stable, experts say. The US’s three major stock indices – the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq – closed with slight increases on Tuesday.

“I think that’s in part because they priced in the fact that they thought a shutdown was going to be likely and it’s also because of other factors that they’re watching that are affecting global portfolios, as well as their investments in the US,” Lucas said.

The memo, emailed to all area, local and district office directors of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Sept. 15, says that the agency will discharge by Tuesday any complaints based on “disparate impact liability,” a legal concept that argues that even if a policy looks fair on the surface, it can still be discriminatory if it creates unnecessary barriers that make it harder for certain groups of people to succeed.

The EEOC’s decision to drop such cases aligns with President Donald Trump’s April executive order directing federal agencies to deprioritize the use of disparate impact in civil rights enforcement because it encourages the assumption that any racial imbalance in the workforce is a result of discrimination, which creates undue burden on businesses.

The move marks a significant shift in EEOC enforcement, and critics say it weakens an effective legal tool used to root out workplace discrimination. That’s especially true when it comes to addressing algorithmic bias as more employers rely on AI in the hiring process.

Since AI draws on large amounts of data to generate results, it can replicate the patterns of inequality even if it’s not programmed to do so. In one infamous example, Amazon developed a resume-scanning tool to recruit top talent, but abandoned it after finding it favored men for technical roles — in part because it was comparing job candidates against the company’s own male-dominated tech workforce.

“As AI is becoming more and more popular, it’s particularly important that we have the disparate impact tools available to be able to police it and make sure it’s not being used to resegregate the workforce,” said civil rights and plaintiff-side employment attorney Christine Webber.

Historically, discrimination claims invoking disparate impact have been less common than those alleging intentional discrimination, known as disparate treatment. But in AI systems, discrimination is more likely to occur in the disparate impact context, said Littler attorney Bradford Kelley, who was chief counsel to former Republican EEOC Commissioner Keith Sonderling.

Kelley said companies should still be concerned that their algorithms could invite disparate impact complaints, noting that many states and local authorities have their own laws and regulations.

“The risk is still there,” he said.

Despite its modern-day applications, the idea of disparate impact is not new: It has been an established part of U.S. civil rights law for decades, and has helped stop unfair practices that keep minorities, women, people with disabilities, older adults, and others from getting jobs, loans, or equal pay.

The EEOC memo cites Trump’s executive order arguing that disparate impact has become a “key tool” of a “pernicious movement” that threatens meritocracy in favor of “racial balancing” in the workforce, and instructs districts to compile a list of pending disparate impact cases, then close them by Tuesday. Workers who submitted complaints solely on these grounds will receive a notice from the agency saying they can pursue the case in court on their own if they wish.

The EEOC declined to comment on the memo, citing that its contents are privileged. But a spokesperson said that as an executive branch agency, the EEOC “will fully and robustly comply with all Executive Orders” and that it “continues to fulfill its statutory obligation of accepting all charges of discrimination from all charging parties and serving all charges of discrimination on the relevant employer, regardless of the theory of discrimination alleged.”

Webber said the EEOC’s decision not to pursue these investigations “definitely erects an unnecessary hurdle” for workers who filed complaints, and now no longer get the benefit of a publicly-funded investigation, which can be difficult and costly. Unlike private lawyers, the EEOC has the ability to compel employers to provide information early in the process.

Former EEOC general counsel Karla Gilbride, who was fired in January alongside two Democratic commissioners, said she was “disturbed” by the agency’s decision to close charges based on their category, not the facts and evidence.

And because disparate impact often involves company-wide or industry-wide policies, the number of people affected is usually larger than an individual discrimination complaint.

“You’re talking about thousands of people who could be affected by this,” added former EEOC commissioner Chai Feldblum.

Despite the EEOC’s new stance, some businesses are proactively addressing potential bias. Job search website Indeed, for example, recently developed a virtual hiring assistant using generative AI aimed at helping employers find and connect with talent, according to senior product director Heidi Laki.

She said a core tenet of building out that product is ensuring AI is used responsibly — and conducting both disparate impact and disparate treatment analyses to “make sure that we don’t have outcomes that disproportionately affect populations.”

And following the EEOC’s shift in enforcement, “we are maintaining all of our responsible AI analysis that we had before,” Laki said. ________",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/c2a60f7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2846x1601+0+422/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fc1%2F5d%2F1922374f57ae36ffc0f970792186%2Fdc59e6f1ffa44eaf9fad432e66238715,N,,2025-10-01 09:57:36.592394

Will furloughed federal workers get paid?
In 2019, Congress passed a bill enshrining into law the requirement that furloughed employees get retroactive pay once operations resume.","The U.S. government officially shut down at midnight after Congress and the White House failed to reach an agreement to keep government programs and services running by Wednesday’s deadline.

Roughly 750,000 federal workers are expected to be furloughed, some potentially fired by the Trump administration. Many offices will be shuttered, perhaps permanently, as President Donald Trump vows to “do things that are irreversible, that are bad” as retribution.

Other functions — like NASA’s space missions, President Trump’s immigration crackdown and certain public health work at FDA and the USDA — would continue.

It’s the first government shutdown since 2018, in Trump’s first term, which was the longest ever at 34 days, lasting into early 2019. As of Wednesday morning, there was no clear path to a resolution, with the two sides fundamentally at odds over how to resolve the impasse.

The Republican Party controls both chambers of Congress, but it needs Democratic support to pass a bill in the Senate, where 60 votes are required. The two parties failed to craft a bipartisan bill, with the Senate rejecting both a GOP proposal and a Democratic proposal just hours before the shutdown deadline.

Here's a breakdown of what happened, what is expected, and how the shutdown could impact you.

Politics

Why is the U.S. government shutdown?

Republicans supported a short-term measure to fund the government generally at current levels through Nov. 21, but Democrats blocked it, insisting the measure address their concerns on health care. They want to reverse the Medicaid cuts in President Trump’s 'mega-bill ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" passed this summer and extend tax credits that make health insurance premiums more affordable for millions of people who purchase through the marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans called the Democratic proposal a nonstarter that would cost taxpayers more than $1 trillion.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said Republicans are happy to discuss the health care issue with Democrats — but not as part of talks to keep the government open. More votes are expected Wednesday.

“What the government spends money on is a demonstration of our country’s priorities,” said Rachel Snyderman, a former White House budget official who is the managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington.

What happens in a shut down?

Now that a lapse in funding has occurred, the law requires agencies to furlough their “non-excepted” employees. Excepted employees, which include those who work to protect life and property, stay on the job but don’t get paid until after the shutdown ends.

The White House Office of Management and Budget begins the process with instructions to agencies that a lapse in appropriations has occurred and they should initiate orderly shutdown activities. That memo went out Tuesday evening.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that roughly 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed each day of the shutdown, with the total daily cost of their compensation at roughly $400 million.

What’s staying open and shutting down

Overall, each federal agency develops its own shutdown plan. The plans outline which workers would stay on the job during a shutdown, and which would be furloughed.

Health and healthcare

The Medicare and Medicaid health care programs are expected to continue, though staffing shortages could mean delays for some services. Social Security payments still go out, and seniors relying on Medicare coverage can still see their doctors and health care providers can be reimbursed.

But Trump has warned that the administration could focus on programs that are important to Democrats, “cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.”

Health and Human Services will furlough about 41% of its staff out of nearly 80,000 employees, according to a contingency plan posted on its website.

As part of that plan, the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue to monitor disease outbreaks, while activities that will stop include research into health risks and ways to prevent illness.

Meanwhile, research and patient care at the National Institutes of Health would be upended. Patients currently enrolled in studies at the research-only hospital nicknamed the “house of hope” will continue to receive care. Additional sick patients hoping for access to experimental therapies can’t enroll except in special circumstances, and no new studies will begin.

Most of the Food and Drug Administration’s core responsibilities would continue, including responding to public health threats and managing product recalls and drug shortages.

Some routine activities, including previously scheduled inspections of company manufacturing plants, will be halted. But the agency will continue to conduct inspections when it has reason to suspect a problem that could endanger consumers.

Government activities that ensure the immediate safety of the food supply will continue, including food recalls, investigations and inspections of imports. But longer-term food safety efforts, including initiatives aimed at reducing foodborne illnesses, would be paused.

About 86% of the agency’s staff would remain on the job because their work is deemed essential or they are funded by non-federal sources, according to the administration’s shutdown plan. FDA scientists who review drugs, medical devices and tobacco products are mostly or entirely funded by company fees, not the federal government.

Parks and museums

As agencies sort out which workers are essential, or not, Smithsonian museums are expected to stay open at least until Monday. A group of former national park superintendents urged the Trump administration to close the parks to visitors, arguing that poorly staffed parks in a shutdown are a danger to the public and put park resources at risk.

FEMA

While FEMA’s core disaster relief functions would not be affected, at least in the short term, other aspects of the agency’s work would be impacted. Some grant approvals would be paused, and no new policies could be written under the National Flood Insurance Program, halting new mortgages that require flood insurance.

Air Traffic Control and Airports

Air traffic controllers already certified and on the job would be among the essential workers who would continue during any shutdown but their pay could be affected.

National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels has said that having to work without a paycheck adds stress to controllers who already do a difficult job. He said that in past shutdowns some controllers have even had to get side jobs to help pay bills while the shutdown drug on.

Capt. Jason Ambrosi, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, urged Congress to reach an agreement. “A shutdown threatens the stability of the safest aviation system in the world,” Ambrosi said.

At Airports, TSA agents would likely be required to work without pay until the shutdown ends.

Homeland Security and Immigration

Most Department of Homeland Security employees would continue to work, because much of the department’s workforce is connected to law enforcement or works in areas funded by user fees as opposed to Congressional appropriations.

In a message posted to X early Wednesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said there was no change to immigration laws or enforcement during a shutdown.

USPS

You'll still get mail delivered, and post offices will remain open. The U.S. Postal Service is unaffected by a government shutdown. It’s an independent entity funded through the sale of its products and services, not by tax dollars.

Impact on the economy

Impact on the economy

Phillip Swagel, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said a short shutdown doesn’t have a huge impact on the economy, especially since federal workers, by law, are paid retroactively. But “if a shutdown continues, then that can give rise to uncertainties about what is the role of government in our society, and what’s the financial impact on all the programs that the government funds.”

“The impact is not immediate, but over time, there is a negative impact of a shutdown on the economy,” he added.

Markets haven’t reacted strongly to past shutdowns, according to Goldman Sachs Research. At the close of the three prolonged shutdowns since the early 1990s, equity markets finished flat or up even after dipping initially.

A governmentwide shutdown would directly reduce growth by around 0.15 percentage points for each week it lasted, or about 0.2 percentage points per week once private-sector effects were included, and growth would rise by the same cumulative amount in the quarter following reopening, writes Alec Phillips, chief U.S. political economist at Goldman Sachs.

Will furloughed federal workers get paid?

Yes. In 2019, Congress passed a bill enshrining into law the requirement that furloughed employees get retroactive pay once operations resume.

While they’ll eventually get paid, the furloughed workers and those who remain on the job may have to go without one or more of their regular paychecks, depending upon how long the shutdown lasts, creating financial stress for many families.

Service members would also receive back pay for any missed paychecks once federal funding resumes.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/250930-capitol-getty.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-01 10:57:00.122821

Federal agents have used chemical agents, including pepper spray and tear gas, in plain sight to disperse Chicago protesters blocking immigration enforcement vehicles.","BROADVIEW, IL – Katrina Thompson, mayor of the small village outside Chicago home to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, is slamming federal agents for heavy-handed tactics, saying their presence in the area amounts to a ""siege.""

""You are making war on my community. And it has to stop,"" Thompson said, in a letter addressed to Department of Homeland Security Field Office Director Russell Hott. ""Beleaguered Broadview residents are begging for relief from your center's siege of our neighborhood.""

Thompson held a news conference at the Village Hall to call for relief. President Donald Trump’s Chicago-area immigration enforcement crackdown known as Operation Midway Blitz has transformed Broadview. The small village of some 8,000 people is home to the region’s main immigration enforcement facility and it has become a hotbed of clashes between federal agents and anti-immigration enforcement protesters.

Tense moments between the two sides have frequently ended with federal agents deploying chemical agents and other crowd control tactics on protesters as well as journalists. Broadview officials say federal agents are initiating some confrontations without provocation and village police are investigating immigration enforcement agents for three separate criminal cases.

""A lot of rhetoric comes from the White House about being tough on crime, but from where I sit, ICE has generated criminal activity in Broadview,"" Thompson told reporters.

Police Chief Thomas Mills also told reporters that federal agents ""verbally assaulted"" him when he confronted them about the aggressive tactics. He said agents, using profanity, told him they would bring chaos to the village in response.

In a statement to USA TODAY, Homeland Security officials said Broadview leaders were attempting to ""smear"" the agency and vehemently denied making the profanity-laced comment to Broadview police.

Thompson responded, saying she trusted the word of the village’s top cop.

""The Department of Homeland Security is running a disinformation campaign that would make even the Russians blush,"" the mayor said.

Spiraling tensions in Broadview come about three weeks into Trump’s blitz operation. The president says the crackdown is aimed at catching ""the worst of the worst"" immigrant criminals. Illinois leaders say the White House is preparing a power grab in the region.

Tear gas, pepper spray fallout hits neighborhoods

The immigration enforcement facility in Broadview lies on an industrial strip surrounded by residential streets, where trim lawns and towering Halloween skeletons make the neighborhoods look like any other in suburban America.

But the smell of tear gas lingering in the air signals the place isn’t as peaceful as it seems.

""Absolutely nobody in Broadview or the neighborhood around wants this here,"" Silas Lopez, a local resident, said of the immigration enforcement facility. The 20-year-old told USA TODAY gases have left him out of breath at points. He worries what impact the fumes will have on his younger siblings: ""The wind blows it right into the neighborhood.""

Thompson said village residents have been emailing, calling and showing up in person to complain about the impact the facility is having on the area.

Many residents also complain that protesters are taking up parking.

""I’m glad to see protests as long as it doesn’t get violent,"" Lonzia Casteel, a nearby resident, told USA TODAY. ""But, man, there’s cars parked everywhere.""

Rioters or protests?

Department of Homeland Security officials say immigration agents are appropriately under tough conditions.

""These rioters are laying siege and interfering with legitimate law enforcement operations,"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons said in a letter addressed to Thompson. ""Failure to provide relief makes you a party to the obstruction of justice. There will be no change in our operational posture until these unlawful activities cease. The only siege in Broadview is the one being waged against the United States government.""

Homeland Security officials say they have arrested 34 people in connection with the protests, including three who had loaded guns. Agency officials did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the people arrested.

Agency officials also distanced themselves from criminal allegations made by Broadview police who are investigating federal agents in connection with two hit-and-run incidents and in connection with damage done to the property of a news reporter’s vehicle.

""Less than a week after a terrorist attack at an ICE facility in Dallas, Mayor Katrina Thompson, Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills, and Acting Fire Chief Matt Martin chose to smear ICE and launch a bogus criminal investigation into our brave ICE law enforcement,"" said agency spokesperson Emily Covington. ""It’s disheartening that even after the terrorist attack and arrests of rioters with guns outside the Broadview ICE facility, these sanctuary politicians chose to engage in political theatre to inflame hatred of ICE.""

Federal agents have used chemical agents, including pepper spray and tear gas, in plain sight to disperse Chicago protesters blocking immigration enforcement vehicles.

Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador was also fatally shot in the attack, ICE said in a statement.

Gauffeny said her husband was shackled and restrained in his hospital bed after being shot, his face was swollen and he had staples in his forehead with dried blood on his face, neck and bedsheets. He had been shot about eight times in the shoulder, stomach, tailbone and neck, causing a stroke.

It would be the latest in a bevy of lawsuits that the state has filed against the Trump administration in relation to immigration.

That includes two lawsuits — one of which Raoul filed Monday — against the administration’s plan to withhold funding from states that don’t cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“None of this chaos, and none of these acts make us safer,” Raoul said Monday, referring to the administration’s efforts to federalize National Guard troops and withhold funding for states that limit law enforcement collaboration with ICE.

House Republicans, meanwhile, called a news conference Tuesday saying they want to “bring down the tension” and once again called for repealing the state’s TRUST Act that prohibits local law enforcement agencies from assisting ICE with civil immigration enforcement.

Legality of troop deployment

Thus far, Illinois officials know little about the federal government’s plan — or if one will even be executed — to send troops to Chicago. Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday the Illinois National Guard learned of a memo from the Department of Homeland Security that requested the Department of War send 100 troops to the city.

Pritzker said DHS sought the activation of troops to protect “ICE personnel and facilities.” He also said he didn’t know whether the troops requested would be Illinois National Guard or from another state.

Over the weekend, armed Customs and Border Patrol officers paraded through the streets of Chicago arresting people, while ICE shot chemical projectiles and rubber bullets at protesters in Broadview, including allegedly at a TV news reporter’s car. As of Monday, the Chicago Tribune reported that federal prosecutors had charged five people in relation to recent protests, including two who were apparently armed.

Raoul noted it is illegal to prevent federal agents from doing their jobs, including trying to block vehicles. But he also said the 10th Amendment “preserves state sovereignty to enforce state laws as they see fit,” previewing his legal arguments should troops arrive.

“The militia clauses of the United States Constitution give Congress sole authority to decide what factual circumstances allow the presidents to federalize the National Guard. They don’t exist here,” Raoul said.

In August, a federal judge ruled the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles to engage in law enforcement was illegal. The Trump administration has since appealed. The attorney general of Oregon is also challenging a recent troop deployment.

But it’s unclear whether a judge would deem the apparent purpose of this deployment — to protect ICE and federal buildings, according to Pritzker — as permissible.

“Clearly, this deployment of the Federal officers into our well-policed central business district is meant to provoke Chicagoans,” Raoul said. “What the President is hoping to do is foment chaos by inciting out-of-control protests. So I urge Illinoisans: Don’t take the bait. There is no emergency in Chicago. Don’t help him create one.”

GOP blames Pritzker

None of the three House Republican leaders who called a news conference Tuesday expressed concerns about the potential deployment of federal troops to Chicago or the actions of ICE and Border Patrol agents in the city.

The Biden administration’s lax border policies made Illinois “unable to keep up with the flood of illegal immigrants coming into the country,” Rep. CD Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said. That affected crime rates and the state budget, he said.

Rep. Jeff Keicher, R-Sycamore, said he believed ICE agents were on Michigan Ave. because of Pritzker’s actions. He criticized Pritzker’s comment, made in Los Angeles last March, that Democrats need to become “street fighters” in the political arena.

“I haven’t seen reporting of our governor saying what is occurring with ICE is illegal,” Keicher said. “He just feels it’s wrong, and that’s the premise of the issue. He should be addressing this through legal challenges. He’s choosing not to, because the actions of ICE are legal.”

Pritzker agreed with the premise that everyone should tone down their rhetoric, but he again criticized Trump at an unrelated Tuesday news conference.

“The president of the United States is trying to label the Democratic Party as if it’s some terrorist organization,” Pritzker said. “Who is inciting people? It’s usually the Republicans and Donald Trump, who are accusing other people of the very thing they are guilty of.”

Keicher said he filed House Bill 4142 to make protestors subject to a Class A misdemeanor if an officer tells them to get at least 14 feet away and the protestor does not comply.

In relation to protests in Broadview, House Minority Leader Tony McCombie criticized Pritzker for calling on Illinoisans to record interactions with ICE and Border Patrol and to seek badge numbers from the masked agents.

“It again goes back to Gov. Pritzker calling people to go there, show up and record, be present,” she said. “If there is something going on there, why is the governor sending citizens to this site? Why is he not sending law enforcement?”

Asked about the CBS-Chicago journalist who said her car was hit by a pepper ball, McCombie responded: “I would highly doubt that ICE was targeting anybody from the media. They’re doing their job, trying to protect themselves, the facility and the detainees.”

The reporter said there were no protests happening when her car was hit; the Broadview Police Department said it was investigating.

U.S. citizens allegedly detained

In a new court filing, advocates for immigrant rights allege ICE detained at least three U.S. citizens earlier this month in raids on several suburban communities as part of “Operation Midway Blitz” in the Chicago area.

Lawyers for the National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois allege the citizens were among more than two dozen people arrested since May without warrants or probable cause, which violates a federal consent decree.

Since 2022, ICE has been under a consent decree that stipulates immigration agents cannot arrest people without warrants in the Chicago area unless there’s reason to believe someone is in the U.S. illegally and would flee before a judge could issue an arrest warrant.

The settlement was in response to a 2018 class-action lawsuit during the first Trump administration, which challenged the use of traffic stops to make arrests without warrants. It required ICE to adopt a nationwide policy on warrantless arrests.

The consent decree was set to expire in May, but NIJC and the ACLU petitioned the court earlier this spring to extend it another three years. While a federal judge in Chicago weighs the matter, he ordered that ICE continue refraining from arresting people without warrants. But attorneys argue the Trump administration has gone back on that policy since the president came back into power in January.

Court documents detailed

The court documents, filed Friday and first reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, detail the arrests of 27 people in Chicago and eight suburbs. Among the accounts were arrests of a father driving to church, a grandmother with no criminal history who takes care of her grandchildren, and many people on their way to work.

On Sept. 21, ICE allegedly arrested a man outside his family member’s home in Mount Prospect while he was packing his popsicle cart into his minivan. ICE agents, wearing jackets that allegedly said “POLICE,” asked the man about someone they were looking for. When the man, who has been in the U.S. for more than 20 years, said he didn’t know the person, agents asked for his ID and then arrested him, according to the filing.

In one instance in June, ICE agents showed a warrant to a man outside his home in Chicago. But the name and photo on the warrant did not match the man’s identity. The officers allegedly suggested the man’s driver’s license and state ID were fake and then arrested him. He’s remained in custody for more than three months.

According to the filing, the 27 arrestees in question were not told why they were being detained, and in some cases, ICE officers were masked, did not identify themselves or even display a badge. The filing alleges NIJC has received reports of more than 70 additional arrests that may constitute violations of the consent decree.

On Monday, the Chicago Tribune reported on a family of undocumented immigrants arrested over the weekend at Chicago’s Millennium Park while ICE ramped up its presence downtown. According to the report, federal agents took the family into custody without warrants despite the mother demanding to see one. She and her children, ages 3 and 8, are being held at O’Hare Airport awaiting transfer to Texas before deportation to Guatemala. Her husband is at the ICE processing center in Broadview.

Lawsuits for funding

Illinois and other states have also fought the Trump administration’s immigration actions in court in relation to federal funding.

Last week, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that the federal government cannot withhold emergency funding from Illinois and other states based on those states’ refusal to participate in immigration enforcement.

The judge ruled that the order violates the Constitution because Congress controls spending.

Since then, Illinois learned of another attempt to divert funding, Raoul said.

He’s leading a coalition of 12 attorneys general challenging the reallocation of $100 million in public safety and disaster relief funds “away from Illinois and other states around the country.” Illinois’ cut is worth $30 million, Raoul estimated.

Raoul said DHS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency made the cuts with four days remaining in the fiscal year “without any notice or explanation.” The attorneys general also filed that lawsuit in Rhode Island.

“These funds under the Homeland Security grant program help states protect against acts of terrorism and are a critical source of money for networks of police departments, fire departments, emergency services and public works departments across the country,” Raoul said.",https://capitolcitynow.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/284/files/2025/09/250929-RAOUL-AA-CNI.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 13:58:42.092824

Kehoe activates National Guard to assist ICE agents - STLPR,"Jason Rosenbaum, www.stlpr.org, jason-rosenbaum",,,,,https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2025-09-30/missouri-gov-kehoe-activates-national-guard-to-assist-ice-agents,"Mike Kehoe is dispatching the Missouri National Guard to support President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts.
“The Missouri National Guard is uniquely equipped to provide this essential administrative support, and we are confident their contributions will be invaluable to immigration enforcement efforts.
That involved Trump nationalizing the California National Guard and having the troops protect ICE facilities from protesters.
“This is not a force protection mission,” said Hardwick, who is a member of the Missouri National Guard but was speaking in his capacity as a state lawmaker.
“Missouri's National Guard exists to protect Missourians in times of crisis, like floods, tornadoes, natural disasters,"" Reed said.","Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe is dispatching the Missouri National Guard to support President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts.

The Republican governor announced on Tuesday that, starting on Wednesday, members of the Missouri National Guard will “assist with administrative, clerical, and logistical duties at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facilities within the State of Missouri.”

“Public safety, keeping Missourians safe, and upholding the rule of law is our administration's top priority,” Kehoe said in a statement. “The Missouri National Guard is uniquely equipped to provide this essential administrative support, and we are confident their contributions will be invaluable to immigration enforcement efforts. Missouri is proud to join in the Trump administration's efforts to keep our state and nation secure.”

Kehoe’s move comes as the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics are garnering a broader public outcry, most notably this week in Chicago. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has called on Chicago residents to film ICE personnel spotted downtown.

When asked if the Missouri National Guard will protect ICE facilities or ICE personnel detaining people who are suspected in being in the country unlawfully, Kehoe spokeswoman Gabby Picard said members of the Guard will assist “with tasks such as data entry, case management, and logistical support, enabling ICE personnel to focus on core enforcement and security functions.”

Picard said 15 members of the Missouri National Guard will participate in the mission.

State Rep. Bill Hardwick, R-Pulaski County, said Kehoe’s mission is not a deployment and is markedly different from what occurred earlier this year in Los Angeles. That involved Trump nationalizing the California National Guard and having the troops protect ICE facilities from protesters.

“This is not a force protection mission,” said Hardwick, who is a member of the Missouri National Guard but was speaking in his capacity as a state lawmaker.

He also said that the members of the Guard who volunteer to undertake this mission will be under Kehoe’s command – not Trump’s.

“I think what the governor is doing is a good thing,” Hardwick said. “I think it's a good opportunity for soldiers to get experience and to do a good job.”

Kehoe’s decision drew criticism from Democratic state Rep. Ray Reed, D-St. Louis County, who contended that the GOP governor should not be helping Trump with his immigration policies.

“Missouri's National Guard exists to protect Missourians in times of crisis, like floods, tornadoes, natural disasters,"" Reed said. “It’s really like just political theater designed to score some points with Donald Trump, not really actions that make communities across Missouri any safer.”

Although members of the Guard are voluntarily signing up for this mission and will focus on administrative work, Reed still said their energies would be best expended elsewhere.

“They're heroes who generally answer the call to help the state and our darkest hours,” Reed said. “They sign up to protect their neighbors, not do clerical work for Trump's broken immigration system.”

Kehoe’s office said that Missouri National Guard personnel assigned for the mission were selected on a volunteer basis and that their efforts to assist ICE will last until Sept. 30, 2026.

This story has been updated with more details from Kehoe's office and comments from state lawmakers.

The judgment, published in August, concerns the principle of ‘safe countries of origin’ and affects Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s agreement with Albania, a non-EU country.
It’s the second and third elements of the CJEU’s judgment that appear set to provide legal protection for migrants, and in part explain why 16 EU Member States intervened in the case.
However, the CJEU judgment ensures these parameters will probably be subject to considerable challenge in the courts.
This is exactly what the 16 Member States that intervened in the CJEU case were afraid of, he believes.","A recent judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on Italy’s plan to process asylum applications offshore has provided migrants with crucial legal protection.

The judgment, published in August, concerns the principle of ‘safe countries of origin’ and affects Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s agreement with Albania, a non-EU country. Italy’s scheme is designed to repatriate migrants who have been picked up in the Mediterranean. ‘The CJEU judgment is the natural consequence of this latest attempt by a national government to outsource asylum processing and decide for itself – without the right to challenge – what is a “safe” country,’ says Alex Stojicevic, an officer of the IBA Immigration and Nationality Law Committee.

It’s the second and third elements of the CJEU’s judgment that appear set to provide legal protection for migrants, and in part explain why 16 EU Member States intervened in the case. The CJEU found that schemes such as that put in place by Italy will only be lawful to the extent that the process, and the designation by a Member State as to what is and isn’t a ‘safe’ country, can be properly and effectively challenged in the courts. Further, the sources of information, the data and evidence relied upon to reach any decision around the safety of a country must be accessible.

The immediate consequence for Italy is that the Albanian detention centre will be, for now, under-used. Ultimately, the new EU Pact will substantially increase the parameters of what might be considered a safe country for repatriating irregular migrants and thus provides Member States with greater room for manoeuvre to do so.

However, the CJEU judgment ensures these parameters will probably be subject to considerable challenge in the courts. ‘The buried treasure in the [CJEU judgment] is the effectiveness of a challenge, and access to documents,’ says Steve Peers, a professor of EU and human rights law at Royal Holloway, University of London. ‘With the new EU Pact, it might be easier to say a country is safe but it will be easier to challenge this in individual cases.’

Peers believes those challenges will probably turn into a debate about, for instance, the client’s religion or sexuality and a country’s treatment of this category. This is exactly what the 16 Member States that intervened in the CJEU case were afraid of, he believes. ‘As they see it, their internal procedures will be clogged up with legal challenges,’ says Peers.

According to Meloni, the CJEU is ‘claiming jurisdiction that does not belong to it […] The European Court of Justice has decided to delegate to any national judge the decision […] on the part of migration policy relating to the repatriation and expulsion of illegal immigrants.’

In the UK in August, a local council was successful in its application to the High Court to have a hotel in Epping, near to London, banned from housing irregular immigrants. The ruling was however overturned at the Court of Appeal. What followed was criticism, including by a senior lawmaker, of the judges involved in this and other immigration cases. The suggestion was that their backgrounds and personal views were influencing their rulings.

A major concern is that this rhetoric against the judiciary undermines the rule of law. ‘Over time, this position erodes the view that the courts are legitimate,’ says Stojicevic, who’s also Managing Partner at MKS Immigration Lawyers in Vancouver.

Despite the CJEU judgment, the combination of the new EU Pact coming into effect and a European Parliament that’s more hardline in its attitude to immigration means the EU appears set to take an increasingly restrictive approach on the issue. ‘We could see the Pact develop such that whole countries are declared safe and the rules being re-written to make it difficult to challenge that,’ says Stojicevic. The EU might even consider deportations, which ‘are a feature of the Canadian and Australian systems and, as we well know, are looked on favourably in the US right now,’ he adds.

The plaintiffs say the Trump administration has violated multiple federal laws by combining various government sources to form a national “Data Lake” under U.S.
The advocacy groups say the Trump administration has ignored prohibitions against disclosing, combining and comparing data from different federal agencies beyond allowed exceptions.
Subsequent executive orders from Trump prompted states to begin sharing their voter data with federal agencies, the plaintiffs argue.","The Trump administration is breaking the law with its intra-agency efforts to cull protected personal information from millions of Americans to support its immigration and political motives, according to a lawsuit that privacy and voter advocates filed Tuesday in federal court.

The plaintiffs are seeking a class action designation to add more parties to their case.

Filed in the District of Columbia, the complaint alleges the Department of Homeland Security has created an illegal national citizenship database through its Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system. At least four states are using SAVE data to review voter rolls, even though it relies on Social Security data the agency considers unreliable, the lawsuit alleges.

The first state to plug into the SAVE system was Louisiana, where Secretary of State Nancy Landry announced Sept. 4 that she used the new database to scour state voting records going back to the 1980s. Her review found 390 noncitizen registered voters, including 79 who she said voted in at least one election over the past several decades.

The 390 voters in question represent 0.01% of all registered voters in Louisiana, though Landry acknowledged the possibility that some of her findings could be in error or attributed to outdated information.

“The consolidation and unlawful use of Louisianans’ sensitive data without our knowledge is alarming and terrifying,” M. Christian Green, president of the League of Women Voters of Louisiana, said in a statement.

Green’s chapter, its counterpart in Virginia and the national League of Women Voters are plaintiffs in the lawsuit with the Electronic Privacy Information Center and five individuals identified as J. Doe.

J. Doe 4 is a Louisiana voter who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014, according to the lawsuit. The court filing also claims that Social Security records incorrectly state that J. Doe 4 is not a U.S. citizen.

Defendants in the case are the Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, the Social Security Administration and its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, the U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Trump administration officials have yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit.

The plaintiffs say the Trump administration has violated multiple federal laws by combining various government sources to form a national “Data Lake” under U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a subagency of Homeland Security. In addition, the lawsuit claims the separation of powers provision in the Constitution was violated when the executive branch chose to usurp Congress’ authority over elections.

The alleged violations include the Privacy Act, approved in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal and amended in 1988 through the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act. The advocacy groups say the Trump administration has ignored prohibitions against disclosing, combining and comparing data from different federal agencies beyond allowed exceptions.

“Unfortunately, the Defendants in this case are ignoring these laws to create comprehensive databases of American citizens’ data …” the lawsuit reads. “The Plaintiffs in this case include a proposed class of millions of American citizens and permanent residents whose records have been unlawfully pooled into new or revised centralized records systems.”

Louisiana election investigation finds 79 noncitizens have voted since 1980s

The alleged violations began with the formation of the Department of Governmental Efficiency through an executive order from President Donald Trump, according to the lawsuit. DOGE initiated a “government-wide consolidation of sensitive personal data” that culminated with the approval of the SAVE system. Subsequent executive orders from Trump prompted states to begin sharing their voter data with federal agencies, the plaintiffs argue.

Without evidence to support his claims, Trump has repeatedly alleged widespread fraud took place in the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. The states that have willingly joined the president’s SAVE campaign are Republican led, while Democratic state leaders are fighting the Justice Department’s attempts to compel them to share voter data.

The lawsuit filed Tuesday calls for the federal court to stop the Trump administration from compiling information illegally and for the new database to be dissolved.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Voting-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 10:57:05.435530

After a four-year hiatus, immigration officials could resume processing new applications for the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA, which protects qualifying immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.

The lift on reviewing new applications was outlined in a court filing late Monday by the Trump administration as part of a years-long legal battle over the legality of DACA in a federal court in Brownsville.

The proposal will still need to be approved by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, a George W. Bush appointee who initially ruled that DACA was illegal in 2021.

Even if Hanen accepts this proposal, the lawsuit would continue and the program could still end altogether when the lawsuit is finally settled.

Still, to comply with the appeals court ruling, the Trump administration’s proposal to process new DACA applications will apply to all 49 states, while Texas residents will get a watered-down version of the program.

As part of the proposal, potential DACA enrollees will get deportation protection and a two-year work permit. But those in Texas will only get protection from deportation, without a work permit, according to the court filings. And any current DACA recipient who moves to Texas could be stripped of their work permit.

In 2018, Texas sued the Biden administration to scrap the program officially called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, arguing that the program is illegal.

After years of back-and-forth in federal courts, Hanen ruled that the program was illegal. However, his order allowed DACA recipients to continue renewing, while halting enrollment for new applicants.

However, in January, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a mixed decision, ruling that the federal government can legally protect immigrants from deportation, but that the two-year work permit is most likely illegal. The order, however, was narrowed to Texas, the leading state suing to scrap the program.

There are currently more than half a million immigrants enrolled in DACA and more than 89,000 reside in Texas, the state with the second-largest share of DACA recipients after California.

The Obama administration created the program in 2012, following Congress' repeated failure to pass a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s immigration laws that would allow people to apply to legalize their status and eventually qualify for U.S. citizenship. The program was also created in response to intense pressure from immigrant advocates who had pleaded with President Obama to grant legal status to immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2f61565/2147483647/strip/true/crop/842x442+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2Fd0%2F1f248c4447f6b6f8be0b3a3c22c6%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-30-163258.png,N,,2025-10-01 11:58:35.747906

The prime minister blamed the impact of Brexit for the surge in the number of illegal Channel crossings.
He was wrong about that,” Starmer told GB News.
Reform UK has pledged to scrap indefinite leave to remain, which would put hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants with that status at risk of deportation.
Starmer told Sky News that the announcement had made minorities in the UK feel a “shiver down their throat”.","Keir Starmer has said he will look at how international law is being interpreted by British courts in an effort to tackle small boats, which he labelled “Farage boats” because of their increase in number since Brexit.

Speaking after the Labour party conference, the prime minister signalled his unhappiness with how the European convention on human rights was being interpreted by judges making decisions about deportations. But he defended the UK’s membership of the ECHR, saying that ministers “need to look again at the interpretation of some of these provisions, not tear them down”.

Starmer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that while “those genuinely fleeing persecution should be afforded asylum … mass migration in a way that we have not seen in previous years”.

The prime minister blamed the impact of Brexit for the surge in the number of illegal Channel crossings. “These are Farage boats, in many senses, that are coming across the Channel,” he said.

Before leaving the EU, the UK was a signatory to the Dublin convention, which states that asylum seekers can be returned to the first member state they arrived in before their claims are considered.

The number of small boat crossings have risen dramatically since Brexit was implemented in 2020, according to Home Office figures. More than 33,000 people have arrived in the UK so far this year, a record since data was first reported in 2018.

“I would gently point out to Nigel Farage and others that before we left the EU, we had a returns agreement with every country in the EU and he told the country it would make no difference if we left. He was wrong about that,” Starmer told GB News.

He added that the government needed to “ramp up” its new returns agreement to send migrants who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for people with genuine asylum cases who have not attempted to cross.

Pressed for details about what was blocking deportations of foreign criminals, Starmer cited articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR, which ban torture and protect the right to private and family life respectively.

Ministers have expressed concerns previously that both articles are being interpreted too broadly by judges when deciding whether someone convicted of a crime can be deported to their country of origin.

Starmer was speaking following the conclusion of Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool, where he made a speech criticising Farage as someone who had never “liked or believed in Britain”.

He said the country was facing an “era-defining choice” between Labour and the populist right and questioned whether Reform UK loved “our beautiful, tolerant, diverse country” or simply wanted to “stir the pot of division because that’s worked in their interests”.

Speaking to broadcasters afterwards, Starmer said he did not think Farage was himself racist but reiterated that his latest immigration policy was.

Reform UK has pledged to scrap indefinite leave to remain, which would put hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants with that status at risk of deportation. Starmer told Sky News that the announcement had made minorities in the UK feel a “shiver down their throat”.

Farage attacked Starmer following his conference speech and said he was putting Reform UK activists at risk by accusing the party of championing a racist policy.

David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, rowed back on his claim on Tuesday that Farage had “flirted with Hitler Youth”, a statement apparently referring to allegations from 2013 that the Reform leader had sung Nazi songs as a schoolboy. Farage denied the allegations at the time.

Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, said on Wednesday morning that Starmer had “shown real fightback” and “drawn a line” under the questions over his leadership that had overshadowed the lead-up to the conference.

Those laws employed seemingly neutral language, applying to individuals “ineligible for citizenship,” to target Asian immigrants and bar them from purchasing land.
Chin and others say Ohio’s “foreign adversaries” provision is another broad framing calibrated to achieve targeted ends.
In February last year, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals put Florida’s law barring foreign land ownership on hold.
She’s specifically concerned that the Ohio Secretary of State would regularly update the list of foreign adversaries.","This past weekend more than a hundred Ohioans demonstrated outside the Statehouse against a pair of bills that could effectively outlaw some immigrants from owning land in the state.

Ohio House Bill 1 and Ohio Senate Bill 88, prohibit citizens of countries designated “foreign adversaries” from owning land within 25 miles of “critical infrastructure.”

Although people from a variety of backgrounds spoke at the event, the effort is being led by people of Chinese descent. They note that the measure is meant to restrict their ability to own a home or a business.

Ying Wu described herself as a mother from Dublin, and “an Ohioan by choice.”

She explained that after her husband finished his medical training, they had several options on where they could live. They chose Ohio because they saw it as a good place to raise a family.

“This is not just where we live, it’s who we are,” she said. “But lately, this promise feels fragile.”

“Bills like HB 1 and SB 88 don’t see the life we built,” she went on. “They look at our family and see a label. They listen to our story, and they hear an accent. They send a message to us: You will always be other. You do not belong.”

The bills’ sponsors pitch their plan as a national security consideration, but critics like Wu say the proposals attempt to codify racism.

For instance, state law defines critical infrastructure so broadly — extending to power lines, telephone poles, and sewage pipes — that effectively the entire state would be off-limits.

Opponents see Ohio’s proposal, and similar efforts in states like Florida, as a return to the so-called alien land laws that sprung up in 1900s.

Those laws employed seemingly neutral language, applying to individuals “ineligible for citizenship,” to target Asian immigrants and bar them from purchasing land.

“While these laws did not explicitly target Asians, the purpose behind them was very clear,” explained Abby Chin, past president of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Central Ohio.

Chin and others say Ohio’s “foreign adversaries” provision is another broad framing calibrated to achieve targeted ends.

Although the restrictions would likely apply to citizens of Iran, North Korea, and Russia, the sponsors make no secret that their primary concern is immigrants from China.

“The People’s Republic of China, Communist China, has not hidden the fact that their goal is not just to compete and outperform the United States, it is to take over the world — they actually meant this,” the bill’s sponsor state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, claimed in a February committee hearing.

The Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment restricts the government from discriminating based on several protected classes, including national origin and alienage.

In February last year, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals put Florida’s law barring foreign land ownership on hold.

In a concurrence, Judge Nancy Abudu specifically cited the Equal Protection Clause.

Rev. Dan Clark from the United Church of Granville called Ohio’s proposals “legalized xenophobia.”

“It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is unfaithful and it is immoral,” he said. “Our Constitution promises more than this. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process. The 14th guarantees equal protection. The Fair Housing Act outlaws discrimination based on national origin. HB 1 and SB 88 tramples all of these protections.”

In addition to their dubious legality, Chin said the measures are misguided.

Taking a broadbrush approach ignores nuance. Immigrants in Ohio could be refugees or dissidents from a designated country, for instance, he noted.

“These bills equate innocent individuals with the governments of countries that they come from,” she said. “In other words, it sets restrictions without any evidence that the individual has done anything wrong.”

Because Bowling Green State University Professor Louisa Ha is a citizen, the proposals won’t affect her ability to own land. But she’s still worried about how the bills target immigrant communities.

She’s specifically concerned that the Ohio Secretary of State would regularly update the list of foreign adversaries.

“Depending on politics, any other country can be added to that list,” she said, “so all immigrants are vulnerable.”

Far from making the state more safe, Ha said, laws that single out specific communities breed mistrust and hostility.

“As an immigrant, I don’t want to live in a community that sees immigrants as enemies,” Ha said. “I don’t want my children, who grew up and (were) born here and speak English as their first language, (to) be seen as perpetual foreigners in their own country.”

At a press conference on Monday, Gov. J.B.

ICE’s Chicago field office did not immediately return an email from The Record.

Learning of the unconfirmed reports coming out of Winnetka, some local organizations on Tuesday took the moment to remind residents of their rights when approached by immigration officers.

New Trier Township posted to social media the phone number (847-737-4042) for the North Shore Legal Aid Clinic, a local nonprofit that provides free legal services in specific areas, including immigration.

The legal aid clinic also on Tuesday posted to Facebook images promoting the clinic’s “Know Your Rights” flyers, which include information on the right to remain silent, right to an attorney, and protections against illegal search and seizure.

Patrick Hanley, a candidate for the Illinois’ 9th senate district, saw the potential activity as an opportunity to organize. Hanley said he wants to build a New Trier Rapid Response team that can collect and vet information on federal agents’ local activity.

Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian green-card holder and Columbia University student, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, have been fighting deportation proceedings since earlier this year.

Öztürk was arrested by masked federal agents on the streets of Somerville in March, and Mahdawi was detained in April in Vermont at a naturalization interview. Both were released on bail earlier this spring by a pair of federal district court judges in Vermont, who said it was likely their constitutional rights had been violated. Their deportation cases are ongoing in immigration courts.

At issue before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York is the federal government’s appeal of their release on bail by the lower court. In both cases, heard back-to-back Tuesday, the Justice Department argued that the district court did not have the right to weigh in on the detentions of Mahdawi and Öztürk, because Congress has tasked immigration courts with adjudicating immigration cases.

But the two students have argued that they were targeted for political speech in flagrant violation of their First Amendment rights. The government has cited an op-ed Öztürk signed criticizing Israel’s conduct in Gaza in arguing for her removal, and Mahdawi was a high profile pro-Palestinian activist at Columbia University. An attorney for Öztürk argued that it would have been futile to ask immigration authorities for relief, and that the student had no choice but to go to the district court instead.

“Asking the very executive branch that you allege is seeking to weaponize immigration detention to silence you, to release you, is not an adequate substitute for habeas,” ACLU attorney Esha Bhandari, who is representing Öztürk, told the appeals court.

All three Second Circuit judges who heard Tuesday’s appeals were Republican appointees, and two were nominated by President Donald Trump. But one, Steven Menashi, a former Trump White House official whose Senate confirmation stoked controversy, appeared particularly sympathetic to the government’s view.

His colleagues on the court, however — Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston, a George W. Bush appointee, and Judge William Nardini, who was also a Trump nominee — appeared much more skeptical.

Nardini repeatedly grilled Justice Department attorney Tyler Becker, at one point pressing him on whether it was reasonable to tell Öztürk not to ask the district court to intervene immediately and instead wait on the immigration courts, even if those courts did ultimately rule in her favor.

“If she hadn't been released here, or if she were to be returned to custody — well, you know that that could come after a year of detention,” he said. “To say to her, ‘Oh, guess what? You were right. You never should have been detained all along. Sorry about that, but I hope you had a good time for that year.’”

Trump officials have also repeatedly argued that Mahdawi is a threat to the public, citing a 10-year-old Windsor police report in which a local gun shop owner and nearby museum volunteer alleged Mahdawi made violent comments about Jewish people. Mahdawi has denied the allegations, and his lawyers have called them “cartoonishly racist hearsay.”

The incident was investigated by the F.B.I. at the time, but Mahdawi was never charged. His attorney, Michael Tan, also with ACLU, told the appeals court that the fact that the F.B.I. had dropped the matter vindicated his client.

“If the allegations are serious, they would have certainly continued an investigation,” he said.

But Nardini took issue with that, and argued that the F.B.I. dropped cases all the time it could not prove, but considered legitimate. He called it “the one dramatic overstatement, I think, on your side.”

The Mahdawi and Öztürk hearings took place on the same day as another district federal judge, in a separate but related civil case, ruled that the Trump administration was unconstitutionally chilling First Amendment rights on U.S. campuses by initiating deportation proceedings against pro-Palestinian student activists. The case was brought by a group of faculty associations and civil rights groups.

The judge in this case, William Young, began his 161-page ruling with the scan of an anonymous, handwritten note his office had received that asked: “Trump has pardons and tanks… what do you have?”

In remarks after Tuesday’s hearing, Mahdawi recited Young’s reply.

“Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, We the People of the United States — you and me — have our magnificent Constitution.”

Mahdawi said he urged “every American to sit with this quote.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04e2293/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3880x2037+0+391/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2Fb2%2Fc302c2114606bc85dbe75e96c840%2Fny-mahdawi.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 04:58:08.289918

Protesters filled part of a westbound lane on Wacker Drive near Michigan Avenue. Organizers include the Chicago Teachers Union, the Coalition Against the Trump Agenda, and United Working Families, who say the gathering was a direct response to the Trump administration’s deployment of federal agents to Chicago in recent weeks.

“I’m aghast about what is happening with immigrants and the way they’re being treated, being arrested without warrants. People not knowing what is happening to their loved ones, guns drawn. I’m horrified. That’s not America,” protester Teresa Exner said.

The protest comes as President Donald Trump announced federal troops would soon be sent to Chicago. ICE has also requested 100 National Guard troops to help manage demonstrations that have turned physical in recent weeks.

Federal officials say the ongoing enforcement effort, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, is targeting what they call “the worst of the worst” undocumented immigrants in the name of public safety.

“Wake up! This is really serious,” protester Rosemarie Pinkos said. “I’ve lived to this age, and I can’t believe it. I never knew it would come in our country.”

In a social media post, Greg Bovino, Commander at Large of the U.S. Border Patrol, said:

“All international instruments have to be applied in circumstances as they are now,” the prime minister said.
""These are Farage boats, in many senses, that are coming across the Channel.""
But the prime minister hasn’t taken anything off the table yet, which is good.
The prime minister is under pressure to go further in his efforts to bring down the number of migrants arriving in Britain via small boats.","Sir Keir Starmer has announced a dramatic U-turn over international human rights laws which have been criticised for making it harder to deport asylum seekers.

The prime minister said the government will review the way British courts apply the controversial European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which could mean asylum seekers are no longer able to avoid being sent back to their home country by claiming they could face torture as a result.

And they may be barred from demanding the right to stay in the UK on the grounds that it would separate them from their families.

The announcement marks another major policy reversal by Sir Keir, a former human rights lawyer, who has defended the ECHR in the past and comes as the prime minister steps up his attacks on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, dubbing the small boats he is trying to stop crossing the English Channel ""Farage boats"".

In an interview with the BBC, Sir Keir denied he is “tearing up” the ECHR but stated: “We need to look again at the interpretation of some of these provisions and we have already begun to do that work in some of our domestic legislation.”

He said the review concerns articles three and eight of the ECHR concerning “cruel and inhumane treatment” in an asylum seeker’s home country and the “right to a family life”.

The government is also reviewing other conventions relating to “refugees, torture and children’s rights”, he said.

“All international instruments have to be applied in circumstances as they are now,” the prime minister said. “We are seeing mass migration in a way we have not seen in previous years. Those genuinely fleeing persecution should be afforded asylum - that is a compassionate act, but we need to look again at the interpretation of some of those provisions - not tear them down but look at the interpretation.”

It comes after Sir Keir laid into Mr Farage’s claims yesterday, saying the Brexiteer had been ""wrong"" to claim that leaving the European Union would make no difference to migration policy, pointing to the Dublin Convention that allowed pre-Brexit Britain to return some asylum seekers to the continent.

Sir Keir told GB News: ""I would gently point out to Nigel Farage and others that before we left the EU, we had a returns agreement with every country in the EU and he told the country it would make no difference if we left. He was wrong about that.

""These are Farage boats, in many senses, that are coming across the Channel.""

The decision to review legislation is a major victory for new home secretary Shabana Mahmood, the Independent understands, who has been lobbying for such action since her appointment.

But it is understood that Ms Mahmood had been concerned by the influence of attorney general Lord Hermer who is very close to the prime minister and is strongly opposed to watering down these rights or changing the law.

A source close to her told The Independent: “She will know if she is successful or screwed on this by Christmas. But the prime minister hasn’t taken anything off the table yet, which is good. It is absolutely necessary to change the law on these four items.”

It came after the prime minister’s speech at Labour’s conference in Liverpool, in which he took the fight to Reform UK and said Nigel Farage, who advocates leaving the ECHR altogether, does not believe in Britain.

Kemi Badenoch is also expected to use the Conservative Party’s annual conference in Manchester to call for Britain to leave the ECHR.

Ministers have previously promised to review how human rights law is applied to immigration after a series of cases, including one in which an Albanian man was able to remain in Britain partly because of his young son’s aversion to foreign chicken nuggets.

The government’s review is focused on how the right to family life is applied.

The prime minister is under pressure to go further in his efforts to bring down the number of migrants arriving in Britain via small boats. Channel crossings are at record levels, with a single dinghy carrying 125 migrants into the UK on Saturday.

The number of migrant arrivals on small boats has topped 33,000 in 2025 so far, marking a record for this point in the year since data on Channel crossings was first reported in 2018. Saturday saw 895 people arrive in 12 boats.

Sir Keir followed his conference speech in Liverpool by insisting Reform leader Mr Farage and his supporters are not racist, despite branding the party’s immigration policy racist and immoral.

The PM told Sky News: “They’re concerned about things like our borders, they’re frustrated about the pace of change. I’m not for a moment suggesting that they are racist.”

And he insisted he was talking about a “particular policy”, claiming Reform’s plans would see migrants who live in the UK lawfully deported, saying “that to me would tear our country apart”.

Responding to the PM and Labour’s conference attacks on him, Mr Farage claimed Sir Keir had incited violence against Reform’s MPs and activists and is “unfit to be the prime minister of our country”.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/01/06/53f5367b40c1027e9169cc8c4cea2f13Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU5MzU2OTM2-2.81820152.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-10-01 04:58:13.009102

Minnesota would lose more than $6.5M if illegal cuts allowed to stand

September 30, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — Minnesota Attorney General Ellison and a coalition of 12 attorneys general today won a temporary restraining order that blocks the Trump Administration from unlawfully reallocating federal homeland security funding away from Minnesota or any state that refuses to comply with Trump's extreme political agenda. The order came in the context of an emergency lawsuit that Attorney General Ellison and the coalition filed yesterday against sudden, politically motivated cuts to homeland security funding to states. If these illegal cuts were allowed to stand, Minnesota would lose more than $6.5 million, or 44% of the dollars the state was slated to receive.

The Trump Administration's first attempt to deny previously nonpartisan homeland security funding to states that refuse to enact his extreme political agenda ended in failure last week. On September 24, Attorney General Ellison and a group of attorneys general secured a permanent injunction along with a court opinion holding that the administration violated the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by conditioning all federal funds from FEMA and DHS on states’ agreement to assist the federal government in enforcing federal immigration priorities.

Despite that permanent injunction, on Saturday, September 27 — without any notice or explanation, and just four days before the end of the federal fiscal year — the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency significantly cut funding to certain states, including Minnesota, that are unwilling to divert local and state law enforcement resources away from core public safety services that protect Minnesotans to enforce federal immigration law, which is a federal responsibility. DHS and FEMA reallocated those funds to other states.

In the lawsuit that Attorney General Ellison and the coalition filed yesterday, they argue that the reallocation of funds is unlawful and violates the federal Administrative Procedure Act.

""It’s outrageous and no longer surprising that the Trump Administration is once again playing politics with the safety of Minnesotans, and I’m grateful the court has once against blocked it,” said Attorney General Ellison. “The court has already permanently blocked Trump and his cronies from compelling Minnesota or any state to divert local law enforcement away from investigations, patrols, and community engagement to keep crime down in order to enforce federal immigration priorities instead. Now Trump is flouting that court decision and breaking the law again by cutting significant emergency preparedness funding from our state. I filed another lawsuit to halt this lawless act and protect the safety of Minnesotans. I will keep fighting to make sure Minnesotans get every federal dollar we need and deserve to respond to emergencies and keep our communities safe, regardless of politics.”

Many of the grant programs administered by DHS and FEMA were authorized by Congress in the wake of national emergencies, such as the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina, to strengthen the nation’s preparedness for and response to emergencies and major disasters. These grants fund first responders’ salaries, pay for the training they receive, and support the mutual aid networks that allow them to mobilize when tragedy strikes. They also support crucial efforts to prepare for and prevent disasters, such as computer network testing to identify cyberattack vulnerabilities.

For decades, administrations of both parties have operated these programs evenhandedly, supporting all 50 states in their efforts to prepare for and respond to emergencies and threats.

On Saturday, FEMA issued the award notifications for its single largest grant program, the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), which allocates approximately $1 billion in funds annually for state and municipal efforts to prevent, prepare for and respond to acts of terrorism. FEMA granted only $226 million to the states filing today’s lawsuit. This was a $233 million, or 51%, reduction from the total amount that FEMA had previously stated it would provide to these states. DHS then redistributed to other states the funds that it cut to Minnesota and states that refuse to endanger their residents’ safety by diverting state and local law-enforcement resources for Trump administration priorities.

Joining Attorney General Ellison in filing the lawsuit are the attorneys general of Illinois, New Jersey, California, and Rhode Island, who led the coalition, and the attorneys general of Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, and Washington.",https://www.ag.state.mn.us/_Img/Logo_SM.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 07:57:32.323059
